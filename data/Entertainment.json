    "content": "Fandom made 'Super': CBS premieres new competition series honoring music fans\n\n August 3, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dana Simpson | Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 436\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After decades of competitive reality shows committed to finding the most talented singers, dancers, performers and the like, CBS launches an unscripted series dedicated to the fans - well, to the \"superfans,\" to be exact. Honoring the most loyal of six celebrities' fan bases, the network's new competition series tests a group of contestants' knowledge in exchange for a chance to meet their idols up close and personal. Originally scheduled to arrive in June, \"Superfan\" premieres Wednesday, Aug. 9, on CBS, the CBS app and Paramount+.Created by executive producers Keltie Knight (\"Footloose,\" 2011) and Jodi Roth (\"Inappropriate Jeff,\" 2014), \"Superfan\" makes use of a classic game show model - think BBC's \"Mastermind,\" if you've seen it - testing players on a smattering of facts about the musician they all share a love for. Each week, beginning with LL Cool J (\"NCIS: Los Angeles\"), one music star is welcomed to perform and look on as their biggest fans settle the No.1-fan question once and for all.The series has a six-episode freshman season, and it is hosted by Canadian TV personality Knight and Canadian-American former NFLwide receiver Nate Burleson (\"The NFLToday\"). It features one new musical celebrity per episode, and following LL Cool J's inaugural episode, the weekly guests of honor include: Canadian country music legend Shania Twain (\"That Don't Impress Me Much,\" 1997); Cuban-American pop sensation Gloria Estefan (\"Rhythm Is Gonna Get You,\" 1987); Alabama-born country foursome Little Big Town (\"Pontoon,\" 2012); rapper and Miami native Pitbull (\"I Know You Want Me,\" 2009); and Tennesseean singer/songwriter Kelsea Ballerini (\"Miss Me More,\" 2017).As the artist's fans compete across several rounds to figure out who will come out as the one and only \"superfan,\" they each get the opportunity to interact with their favorite artist, thus making their music fandom dreams come true just by taking part. By the end of each episode, the artist in the spotlight will crown their No. 1 fan and present to them a unique set of prizes.While discussing his excitement about co-hosting the new show, Burleson stated that \"Superfan\" \"perfectly captures the energy of concert vibes and competition,\" adding that \"as a host, I get to meet music icons and watch everyday fans compete for a dream prize.\" As far as the at-home audience's interaction with the fun goes, Burleson notes, \"You will dance, laugh and even cry by the end of each episode, but more importantly, you'll walk away a superfan yourself.\" And Burleson isn't the only person delighted to be taking the game show genre to new heights; creators Knight and Roth also expressed their own love for the series in the CBS news release. \n \n Caption: Pitbull as seen in \"Superfan\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As Burrell and Mauro teach the contestants the skills required to master the kitchen once and for all, they hope to turn them, as Food Network says, from \"cooking duds into kitchen studs.\" In its description for the series, Food Network explains: \"The recruits not only learn how to make date-friendly dishes like sushi, spicy wontons and classic French pastries, they also go head-tohead in romantic dating-inspired challenges like the Cupid Games, the Bagel-orette and the Inferno Zone. In the end, only the most improved recruit left standing is awarded a $25,000 grand prize, bragging rights for their mentor and the ability to add \"great cook\" to their dating profile.The network continued with a deep dive into the season's first episode, dishing out some juicy details: \"Before picking teams, Anne and Jeff kick off the competition by having the recruits make their signature 'seal the deal' meal to show off their skills, or lack thereof, in the kitchen. Then in the main dish challenge, the teams learn to make duck paired with a fruit sauce. After assessing everyone's skills, Anne and Jeff reveal a unique twist when choosing their teams.\" During following episodes, these culinary (and relationship) hopefuls are introduced to some of the classic dishes of Italy, take a lesson on hand-pulling made-fromscratch noodles with chef Victor Huang and compete in a dazzling, Las Vegas-inspired challenge, recreating an over-the-top dish without a recipe.In the grand finale - a double date of its own, with the two final episodes airing back-to-back on Sunday, Sept. 10 - the two \"most improved\" chefs put their newfangled know-how to the test as they are asked to serve a three-course, restaurant-quality meal to a panel of expert judges, including chef Hawa Hassan, Christian Petroni (\"Food Network Star\") and Chris Scott (\"Top Chef \"). Whoever can serve the most date-worthy meal will go on to win it all.With twists, turns and romance in abundance, \"Worst Cooks in America: Love at First Bite\" premieres Sunday, Aug. 6, on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Anne Burrell, Jeff Mauro (middle) and the contestants from \"Worst Cooks in America: Love at First Bite\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Far more often, though, the exact sequence will be crucial to success. Against today's six-heart contract, West leads a low diamond. South wins in hand and plays a trump, West producing the singleton king. In which order should declarer cash his black-suit winners?North's two no-trump was the Jacoby Forcing Raise.South's three-spade rebid showed a singleton (or void) in that suit. Two control-bids and Roman Key Card Blackwood followed. (Yes, South was nervous about his bad trumps.)At trick three, South cashes dummy's heart queen, confirming that he has a trump loser. Now South has to discard his three diamond losers on dummy's black-suit winners before East can ruff in and cash the diamond king.This requires East's holding at least three clubs. Therefore, the correct play is to unblock the spade ace and to cash clubs immediately.When East shows up with four, declarer plays that suit off, one diamond being pitched. Now turning to spades, East ruffs the last one, but it is too late - declarer's fourth diamond disappears on that trick. (If clubs are 3-3, South switches to spades, hoping East has at least three of them.)At the table, though, South played off his spade winners first. East contentedly ruffed the third spade and cashed the diamond king.\"We had only four spades and seven clubs, partner,\" bemoaned South. \"How could I expect East to hold only two spades?\" Dummy was slightly sympathetic - but only slightly.© 2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

On your right, South opens one heart, you pass (I assume!), North responds one notrump (forcing or nonforcing, it doesnâ€™t matter), partner doubles (a takeout double of hearts), and righty rebids two hearts.What would you do?This problem faced four players at Bridge Base Online. You might pass, but that seems a tad cautious.Once you decide to do something, which suit would you prefer to be trumps: hearts or clubs?It seems clear to me that the answer is hearts. You cannot even guarantee an eight-card club fit, and you would have to win nine tricks. If so, surely you can take six or seven tricks in a heart contract for plus 200 or 500. Note the vulnerability.All four BBO players advanced with three clubs.Nine other Wests saw South open two hearts and East double in fourth position.Everyone ran to three clubs (using Lebensohl to warn of a weak hand).Now look at the full deal.How do two hearts and three clubs fareftIf the defenders are careful against two hearts doubled, they can take one spade, two hearts, two diamonds, one club and a diamond ruff for down two, plus 500.However, it isnâ€™t so straightforward. The play might well begin diamond, diamond, diamond ruff, a club to the king and another diamond. Then, though, South discards his spade loser and escapes for down one. East must shift swiftly to a spade, which is not obvious.Still, plus 200 would have been a cold top! \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, if I had to hazard a guess, I would suggest that if one hand is 4-3-3-3 and no suit is wide open, three no-trump is probably the way to go.Look at today's deal. If North is in three no-trump and East leads the spade queen, declarer will lose the first four tricks but will take the last nine when the heart finesse wins.If North is the dealer and plays in four hearts after a transfer sequence, the spade queen lead will be lethal.Finally, let's put South in four hearts. After West leads the diamond queen, how should declarer proceed?.The primary risk (apart from a 5-0 trump split) is finding West with the spade ace, and East getting on lead in trumps.The original South found a cute line. At trick two, he called for the heart two, and when East played the three, he covered with the four.(Here, if East had played the eight or 10, South could have won with the ace, crossed to dummy and led the heart seven, picking up the whole suit without loss.) After winning with the heart nine, West returned the diamond 10. Declarer won in the dummy and led a heart to the ace, discovering the bad break, but he just crossed back to the board with a club, finessed the heart jack, drew the last trump and ran the clubs, discarding a spade.He lost only two spades and one heart. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In addition, it occurs 25% more often than a 15-17 no-trump, and it is difficult to compete against.(You must bid constructively, not obstructively, because you could have the values for game.) My wife and I love the weak no-trump and are well ahead from using it.West decided not to lead away from his black-suit holdings. Instead, he selected the heart seven: five, jack, ace.Declarer returned the heart nine, which East ducked, then the heart four. East would have done best to switch to a black suit, but he had been reading a learned article about surrounding plays, so he led the diamond jack.Declarer finessed the queen and then immediately paused for thought when West played the six. Clearly, East had switched from the K-J-9 of diamonds.Accurately, South unblocked the diamond eight from the dummy. Next, he led the diamond three: six, 10, king.Later, when declarer got into dummy with the spade king, he cashed the 13th heart.Finally, he led the diamond four and, when East played the two, finessed his five.Cute - it isn't often you have the A-5 sitting over the 9-2 that late in the play of a suit. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "celebrityq & a - Armando Iannucci\n\n August 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Adam Thomlison | Page: 12A | Section: News \n \n 266\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Q: What has Armando Iannucci been doing since \"Veep\" ended?A: Actually quite a lot. He had a whole HBO sitcom, \"Avenue 5,\" come and go since 2019, when his beloved, award-winning political comedy \"Veep\" ended.If you didn't know that, it's likely because \"Avenue 5,\" a sci-ficomedy about a space cruise ship that gets stuck far from Earth, never really found an audience.Its first-season ratings, in early 2020, were poor, and then the pandemic happened, which meant the second season didn't air for another two and a half years. By then, any momentum it had was lost, as reflected in the even lower Season 2 numbers.Sadly, it seems like maybe that experience has soured Iannucci on TV for a while. He's currently focused on the stage, namely a live-theatre adaptation of the classic film \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\" (1964).Even worse for TV fans: It's being staged across an ocean in Iannucci's native Britain.\"Dr. Strangelove\" offered a cutting satire of government war-making when it was released in the midst of the Cold War, but Iannucci told the BBC that its message is just as relevant today.As for why he chose the stage instead of the screen, the ever-topical Iannucci said it was also about timing and current affairs. \"In the last three years, we've been so enclosed in our homes because of the lockdown, and have got addicted to our screens, so actually going out and seeing something live and in the flesh is all the more exciting. That's what excites me about actually doing it as a live stage show.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

If he had just wanted to stop in four hearts, he would have responded four diamonds, a Texas transfer.South, with four trumps and good controls, jumped to six hearts.The play in a slam is usually less complicated than in a lower contract because you cannot afford to lose the lead more than once.Here, the first order of business is to discard dummy's club loser. Declarer wins trick one with the club ace, plays a spade to dummy's ace (the honor from the shorter side first), returns a spade to his king and cashes the spade queen, discarding dummy's club nine.Now the only remaining problem is in the trump suit. South can afford one loser, but not two. A careless declarer would cash the ace first and go down one here.A more thoughtful player works out how to overcome a 3-0 break. He leads a low heart from hand or, better, plays a diamond to dummy's king and returns a low heart, covering East's card (which might be the king). Or, if East discards, declarer puts up the ace and leads back toward dummy's queen. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The tale gives Adam West a big chunk of time as Batman's alias Bruce Wayne.\"The Jetsons\" (MeTV, Sunday, Aug. 13): A series about the future - even an animated one - would have to consider the computer age to be even mildly accurate, and the first-season episode \"Uniblab\" sees George Jetson's (voice of George O'Hanlon) career placed in jeopardy by a machine that seems capable of performing all of the same functions, without the requirement of a paycheck.\"Face/Off\" (AMC, Tuesday, Aug. 15): Director John Woo's 1997 melodrama has a great conceit, with an FBI agent (John Travolta) very reluctantly - and very literally - surgically switching faces with a master criminal (Nicolas Cage) in a scheme to thwart a major attack being planned by the felon. As far-out as the plot might seem, there's enormous entertainment value in watching each star approximate the other, as both characters and performers.\"The Lost World\" (FXM, Saturday, Aug. 19): Before he became the movies' \"master of disaster\" with the likes of \"The Poseidon Adventure\" and \"The Towering Inferno,\" Irwin Allen made his mark as a producer-director of science fiction, one example being this 1960 adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's story about an expedition's discovery of prehistoric territory, The special effects are rather primitive (pun intended) by today's standards, but there's still fun to be had; stars include Michael Rennie, Jill St. John, David Hedison and Claude Rains. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We want to go back every year and let our kids have these ideal summers, running around barefoot in the grass and swimming in the lake. It has a really wholesome feel that really resonates with us, and it's great to spend real time there.Q: How have you enjoyed working with your husband. actor Jonathan Silverman (\"Weekend at Bernie's\"), on A: He's one of the kindest, most generous people on the planet and if he's going to do something with me (professionally), I want our characters to be completely at odds with each other. Frankly, there's nothing more fun than when you've been in a long-term relationship with someone and you know them inside and out - and you don't fight with them much - to go at it with them on camera. I can't even tell you how cathartic it is.We see each other all the time, and part of a happy relationship is a healthy boundary. Many people have said to us over the years, \"Why don't you guys do a show together?\" Well, it's because I want us to stay married! One of the reasons The CW wanted this show is that Jonny is such a recognizable American actor, and I think that's a nice advantage.Q: How does that work for you yourself, in terms of being well-known in both the U.S. and your native CanadaftA: I think a lot of Canada doesn't even know I'm Canadian. I think I've done nine series at this point, and I've been on everyone's television for 24 years.Part of my excitement in doing this show initially was to boost my profile in Canada, because I have always been patriotic and proud to be a Canadian, though doing a strictly Canadian show is something I've very rarely done. In the way my character Lidia goes back home (in \"Moonshine\"), this was going back home for me as well. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The list is a blend of pop artists, veteran rock groups and indie singer/songwriters, from Elton John to Olivia Rodrigo.Music Industry How To's survey results do not focus on albums released during 2023, but reflect the downloading habits of subscribers across all genres and generations.The oldest album is from 1981, while the latest is from 2022. The total revenue figures are estimates based on Spotify's current payment rate of $0.004 per stream.Top Streaming Albums On Spotify in 2023THE WEEKND: THE HIGHLIGHTS (2021)Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, better known as rap artist The Weeknd, tops the list with a 2021 Greatest Hits collection, The Highlights.So far in 2023, the album has garnered 23 billion Spotify streams, earning over $9.2 million in revenue.His 2019 single \"Blinding Lights\" earned $1,468,012 from 3.6 billion streams on Spotify.ED SHEERAN: ÷ (DIVIDE) (2017)British singer/songwriter Ed Sheeran's Divide earns the second spot with an estimated 13 billion Spotify streams and potential earnings of $ 5,389,556.

Bolstered by a popular Freddy Mercury biopic, Greatest Hits has earned nearly $4.1 million from an estimated 10 billion Spotify streams.The anthemic 1975 single \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is the most popular track, with 2.1 billion Spotify streams and $871,854 in revenue.OLIVIA RODRIGO: SOUR (2021)Pop sensation Olivia Rodrigo holds the sixth position with her debut album Sour. The album has earned roughly $4 million in revenue from 10 billion Spotify streams.

Fresh musical faces can still compete with veteran artists for subscribers' ears on the same platform. Subscribers can still discover new material, access the vaults, and find their favorite classics. The results of this survey prove there is still room for both camps.This article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n \n Caption: AP PHOTO/STEVE LUCIANO\n \nEminem performs during the halftime show during the NFLSuper Bowl 56 football game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams Sunday, Feb. 13, 2022, in Inglewood, Calif.\n \nAP PHOTO/INVISION/CHARLES SYKES\n \nEd Sheeran performs on NBC's \"Today\" show at Rockefeller Plaza on Tuesday, June 6, 2023, in New York.\n \nAP PHOTO/INVISION/RICHARD SHOTWELL\n \nOlivia Rodrigo arrives at the Universal Music Group Grammy After Party on Sunday, Feb. 5, 2023, at Milk Studios in Los Angeles. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Rocking reflections: Paramount+ revisits Elvis Presley's 1968 comeback special\n\n August 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: 9A | Section: News \n \n 489\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Elvis Presley's legendary 1968 television special was a turning point not only for him, but for many of the other people involved in it.One was producer-director Steve Binder, who candidly told the \"King\" of music that the latter's career was \"in the toilet,\" so he needed to do the NBC-televised hour. The result quickly became a legendary piece of television, and Paramount+ looks back at it in the new offering \"Reinventing Elvis: The '68 Comeback,\" which starts streaming Tuesday, Aug, 15 - the night before the 46th anniversary of Presley's death, and following the project's limited showings in movie theaters globally.While incorporating many segments from the original show, \"Reinventing Elvis\" examines Presley's relationship not only with Binder (who narrates the bulk of the film), but also with Col. Tom Parker, the famously strict manager who kept tight control over Presley.Singers Darius Rucker and Drake Milligan are among those who offer comments, along with journalist Alanna Nash and Anita Mann, who was a dancer on the 1968 special.Also an executive producer of \"Reinventing Elvis,\" Binder maintains that he's \"real pleased with what they did\" creatively with the documentary, though he admits he was skeptical at first. \"When I was approached to get involved, I said, 'There are so many third-party stories about Elvis, why do we need another one?' Then they pitched me their idea, and it really covered 1968 as a whole. I was rooting for them from the sidelines, and I certainly was responsive to any of their requests for more material.\" Music-documentary veteran John Scheinfeld - who also has done projects on John Lennon, John Coltrane, Herb Alpert and Harry Nilsson - directed \"Reinventing Elvis,\" which also has music-industry legend Spencer Proffer, a longtime Binder associate, as the executive producer who conceived it.\"There are so few of us alive today who were there when it all happened,\" Binder reflects of the 1968 Elvis show. \"There have been specials and books about it, but I never felt that anybody who was there told the real story.\"I was there from the beginning to the end, and it's so gratifying today to realize what the public response to it was. A number of years ago, somebody approached me and said, 'Steve, you realize that no matter what you did in the past or do from here on in, you'll be remembered mostly for the Elvis comeback special' and I think they told the truth.\" The entirety of \"Reinventing Elvis\" serves as a reminder of how major a star Presley was in his time. \"We're so lucky that we partnered with Paramount+,\" Binder notes, \"because many of Elvis' movies were done at Paramount, so we were given access to their library and were able to include clips from his films.That was just a stroke of luck, and it sure adds to this. None of the other projects that have been done about the 1968 special were able to clear those rights, I guess.\" \n \n Caption: Elvis Presley in his 1968 comeback special \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Turner Classic Movies shows the mystery Sunday, Aug. 13, as part of a \"Summer Under the Stars\" day devoted to Newman - who displays a cynical detachment as Lew Harper that makes him great fun to watch as the sleuth interacts with various suspects in a man's disappearance.Lauren Bacall, Robert Wagner, Shelley Winters, Julie Harris and Pamela Tiffin are among those questioned, with Janet Leigh and Arthur Hill also on hand. Interestingly, in the Ross Macdonald novel that inspired the film (\"The Moving Target\"), the main character was named Lew Archer but Newman's success with movie titles that started with \"H\" (\"The Hustler,\" \"Hud\") prompted the switch to \"Harper.\" Perhaps that was overly superstitious, but the result here was another \"H\": a hit. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They tend to forget that the value of a game is much greater than an overtrick or two.With that hint, how should South play in three notrump after West leads his fourth-highest club five: four, 10, jack?This deal has a lot of potential finesses. Which should declarer attempt first?Before even thinking about that, South should count up his top tricks, his immediate winners. Here, he has eight: four spades, one diamond and three clubs, thanks to West's lead. (Yes, given that South denied a major in reply to his partner's Stayman inquiry, maybe West should have led the spade seven, second-highest from a weak suit when the top two cards are not touching. Here, that works fine if declarer takes a diamond finesse and East shifts to a heart, preferably the seven.)If South immediately takes a diamond finesse, it loses, and back comes a club (not a heart - defense can be so difficult). Now, say declarer cashes the diamond ace.When West discards, South tries a heart, but with both honors offside, West establishes and cashes two club winners: down one.However, only one more trick is needed, and it is guaranteed if hearts are attacked.South should immediately play a low heart from hand (or cross to the spade king and lead a heart up).Even if West wins with the queen and plays another club, South leads a second heart, establishing his ninth trick while he still has all of the suits under control. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We can get a glass of wine, call in dinner, whatever.However, the deals seem to be adjusted. For example, finesses feel as if they win less than 50% of the time. Probably, though, I remember the bad deals and forget the friendly ones.On July 11, I decided that we would play East-West so that finesses would work!This week, I will show you the first six deals we played, each rotated to make South the declarer.South had a good weak two-bid. I (West) had a clear-cut takeout double.(Two humans unwisely overcalled two no-trump.)North correctly raised to three hearts, bidding to the nine-trick level with nine combined trumps. East understandably passed. Then I cautiously passed - though in theory I was right because three hearts and four of either minor could be defeated.Against three hearts, I led the club ace, and my partner signaled an odd number of clubs. I should have shifted to a low spade, but I selected a low diamond. Partner took two winners there and returned a club. Declarer ruffed, drew trumps and led the spade 10. I put up the ace and played another spade.South, believing I would defend like that only with the ace-queen, played low from the board and went down one. A close call, but only 33.3% for us because several Norths had passed over West's double and sold out to three clubs, which made. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It featured a textbook example for maintaining trump control.How should South play in four hearts after West leads the club king?Yes, I was the only North to rebid two hearts rather than one spade. However, I still like my call despite the poor trumps. It backfires when partner is 4-4 or 4-5 in the majors and not strong enough to bid again.Otherwise, she will rebid two spades, and I will raise. I win when she has five hearts and a weak hand. This way, we find our eight-card fit.Also, if she were to rebid two clubs over one spade, I would have to pass. Two hearts would promise some 16 high-card points. Note also that my wife's jump to four hearts promised at least five trumps. With only four, she would have rebid three notrump or fudged somehow!Finally, yes, she might have rebid three diamonds or four clubs (a splinter bid). I would have signed off with such useless trumps.The danger to four hearts is a bad trump break, which is almost a certainty at BBO!The correct technique is to win the first trick and to duck a round of trumps. You ruff West's club continuation and now cash the heart ace to see the expected 4-1 division. However, you play on diamonds to set up your side suit and cruise home, losing only three trump tricks.Starting with the heart ace and another heart is fatal here. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

From painful past experience, we expect finesses to lose and suits to split badly.However, sometimes poor splits can help, especially if you are in no-trump.In this deal, what do you think of the auction, and how will the play go in three no-trump after West leads the spade three and East puts up the 10? Is four hearts preferableftAfter South overcalled two clubs (not one no-trump), most Norths advanced with three diamonds (because two would have been nonforcing) and, when partner rebid three no-trump, continued with four hearts, which ended the auction.In the given auction, my two-diamond advance was forcing for one round.The declarers in four hearts ran aground on the BBO rocks. Diamond lead ruffed, club return ruffed, spade ace, diamond ruff and club overruff produced down two.At one table, North could pitch his spade on the second club to escape for down one and get 90%. At five tables, East led the spade ace and, instead of shifting to a diamond, continued with the spade queen, hoping partner had the singleton. Now, though, North won with dummy's king, cashed the heart ace and played a club to the ace. It wasn't lethal when East ruffed. Plus 620 was worth 73.3% to North-South. Six Easts went down in four spades doubled.My partner won with the spade king, played a club to my ace and led a heart to her 10, based on the point-count.Now she took 10 tricks, and plus 630 was worth 93.3%. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Each pan yielded four squares volunteers popped in the bottom of paper bowls.Also volunteering were students from Visionquest Morningstar Youth Academy in Woolford. Director of Education Susan McCandless said her team made 36 pans of cobbler.About two dozen vendors sold a variety of goods, including pottery, Christmas decorations, jewelry, clothing, hats and candles.Lewis said the highlight for him \"as a pastor is people hung around. We had three long tables set up, and people would just sit there and talk and eat all afternoon.\" \"So it was a very much a fellowship time - time for the community to get together,\" Lewis said. \"People had a chance to really get to see folks they haven't seen in a while, and it was nice.\" \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nChris Farnell bags a quart of peaches from Heritage Orchard for a customer at the 21st annual Peach Festival Saturday, Aug. 12, in Preston.\n \nCONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nSelf-taught crochet crafter Ian Whaples creates fruit - including peaches - and sells them at the Peach Festival.\n \nCONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nStudents and administrators of Visionquest Morningstar Academy in Woolford baked each cobblers and volunteered at the 21st annual Peach Festival in Preston.

Yes, it comes a cropper occasionally - we went down 1400 back in June - but the good boards outweigh the bad.The pleasing result on this board was unusual and dependent on the vulnerability.At six of the 16 tables, North opened two diamonds, and East overcalled two notrump.Then, when South nudged to three diamonds, he bought the contract, going down one or two. When South passed over two notrump, West transferred with three hearts. In three spades, East lost only two hearts and one club.At nine tables, East opened one no-trump, and West transferred into spades. Now East should have jumped to three spades to show fourcard support, a maximum and a doubleton somewhere, but no one did.At our table, I opened one diamond, of course! South overcalled two clubs without the usual six-card suit. He succeeded in stopping us from finding our spade fit, but it was a Pyrrhic victory.I won with the spade ace and returned the spade jack.South ruffed and played the club queen. When I led another spade, South ruffed again, took the heart king and ace, and played a third heart. I erred by not ruffing, so declarer won with his queen and led the club jack to my ace. We took two spade tricks, South peeling diamonds. My partner cashed the heart jack and had a trump trick to come for down two.Plus 200 was worth 83.3%, but if they had been nonvulnerable, plus 100 would have given us only 6.7%! \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Only accessible by password - and to us lucky viewers - chef Bobby Flay invites the most talented in the industry to visit his underground kitchen and compete in another round of culinary's most exclusive competition: Season 2 of \"Bobby's Triple Threat\" begins Tuesday, Aug. 22, on Food Network.The series, hosted and orchestrated by Flay, follows as a trio of culinary titans (talented chefs handpicked by Bobby) head to the host's speakeasy-style kitchen, where they will face off in a secret showdown against some of the most skilled chefs in the game in order to see who really is the best of the best.This season, Flay welcomes titans including Brooke Williamson, who earned worldwide acclaim as the youngest female chef to ever cook at the James Beard House; Michael Voltaggio, a Michelin star-rated chef and \"Top Chef\" winner; and Tiffany Derry, a two time James Beard Award finalist, former \"Top Chef\" contestant, and current owner of Roots Southern Table.\"[The titans] have competed in and won countless tournaments, proving their culinary excellence and securing their names and reputations among the very best in the biz,\" Food Network explains. \"This time, though, they won't be competing to earn glory but to keep it.Over the course of three head-to head rounds, elite chef-contestants will battle the titans and have their food judged in blind taste tests.\" Making matters more complicated, Flay will choose an ingredient that must be featured in each dish.Whoever finishes the competition on top earns not only bragging rights, but a whopping $25,000 prize.\"Season 1 of 'Triple Threat' was just a warm-up,\" Flay recently claimed. \"In Season 2, I welcome 10 of the best chefs in the country to take on the titans. The challengers walk through the speakeasy door with the utmost confidence - but will they walk out with the same swagger and $25,000? Not if my chefs have anything to say about it.\" The competition will put Bobby's best to the test, however, as this season's guest competitors include \"Iron Chef\" stars Michael Symon and Jose Garces; \"Chopped\" judge Scott Conant; Kelsey Bernard Clark; Esther Choi; Kelvin Fernandez; Byron Gomez; Rashida Holmes; Mei Lin and Shota Nakajima.Season 2 of \"Bobby's Triple Threat\" begins Tuesday, Aug. 22, on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Bobby Flay and contestant Jonathon Sawyer in \"Bobby's Triple Threat\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was the press secretary to the vice president, then special assistant to the president, and then deputy assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs and press secretary to the United States Department of Defense.After that, Griffin went into the business of being an analyst on television, working online for The Hill's program and also appearing regularly on CNN - which she still does, while fulfilling her regular weekday job on ABC's \"The View.\" She had been a guest on the latter show's panel during 2021 and 2022, then was made a permanent co-host with the start of the series' 26th season in the fall of 2022 (along with Ana Navarro, who'd had a similar arrangement).Griffin came by her interest in public affairs naturally, being the daughter of Joseph Farah, who was an editor at both the Los Angeles Herald Examiner and the Sacramento Union. She wrote (as did her mother) for the website World Net Daily, which her father founded.Elsewhere, Griffin was the captain of her high school girls' soccer team, and she has a black belt in karate. She married Justin Griffin in 2021, and some members of her family boycotted her wedding - including her father and stepmother - because of their political differences with her. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Starring Rosario Dawson (\"Dopesick\") in the title role, the eight-episode series follows Ahsoka Tano as she takes on the not-so-small task of protecting the galaxy from imminent threats.Former Jedi Padawan-turned-Rebel Alliance member Ahsoka is one of the most beloved characters in the Star Wars universe among fans of the franchise's animated films and TV series. Before Dawson's live-action portrayal of Ahsoka in the Disney+ series \"The Mandalorian\" and \"The Book of Boba Fett,\" the character first appeared in the 2008 animated feature and subsequent TV series \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars\" as a teenage apprentice of Anakin Skywalker.The new series is set just after the events of the animated series \"Rebels\" and in the same timeline as \"The Mandalorian.\" Hayden Christensen (\"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,\" 2002) reprises his role as Anakin yet again in \"Ahsoka,\" after appearing in 2019's \"Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,\" and bringing the character back to life in the spinoff series \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" - presumably as a Force ghost, as he is long dead in this timeline.So, who will the baddies in \"Ahsoka\" be without Darth Vader to represent the dark sideft Returning to portray Grand Admiral Thrawn is \"The Witcher\" star Lars Mikkelsen, who lent his voice to the chilling Imperial officer in \"Rebels.\" Icy in demeanor and appearance - Thrawn is Chiss and his skin glows blue - he is only the tip of the villain iceberg in \"Ahsoka.\" Portraying even more adversaries challenging the Jedi and the universe at large are Ivanna Sakhno (\"High Fidelity\") as Shin Hati, Diana Lee Inosanto (\"The Last Tour,\" 2016) as Magistrate Morgan Elsbeth and the late Ray Stevenson (\"Das Boot\") as Baylan Skoll.\"Ahsoka\" also stars Natasha Liu Bordizzo (\"Day Shift,\" 2022) as Sabine Wren, Mary Elizabeth Winstead (\"Kate,\" 2021) as Hera Syndulla, Eman Esfandi (\"The Inspection,\" 2022) as Ezra Bridger and David Tennant (\"Doctor Who\") as the voice of droid Huyang, reprising his role from the Clone Wars series.Portraying a character that is as cherished as Ahsoka, and held in such high regard by one of film and TV's most active and vocal fan bases, is a daunting task. Dawson was up for the challenge, however, crediting stunt co-ordinator Ming Qiu (\"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\") with getting her into shape when it came to wielding a lightsaber like a Jedi, as she shared on the Dagobah Dispatch podcast in May: \"When Qiu said, 'This one did not make my eyes hurt,' that was the first compliment that I got, and I think I cried.\" \n \n Caption: Mary Elizabeth Winstead in \"Star Wars: Ahsoka\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Beverly D'Angelo, Annie Golden and Melba Moore also are in the cast of the picture, which boasts songs that became iconic - including the title tune, \"Aquarius,\" \"Let the Sunshine In\" and \"Good Morning Starshine.\" A particular showstopper is Williams' rendering of \"I Got Life.\" \n \n Caption: Treat Williams in \"Hair\" \n \n Memo: more retro rewinds\n \n\"The Idolmaker\" (Paramount+ With Showtime, streaming): Director Taylor Hackford's fabulous 1980 drama-with-music is informed by great original tunes and the excellent acting of Ray Sharkey as a would-be songwriter who becomes a self-styled late-1950s talent manager, transforming a naive restaurant worker (Peter Gallagher, also superb, in his movie debut) into a teen idol named Caesare. With success comes strife, though, as the new star becomes overwhelmed by sudden fame. Tovah Feldshuh, Joe Pantoliano and Maureen McCormick (yes, TV's Marcia Brady) also appear.\n \n\"The Monkees\" (Catchy Comedy, Sunday, Aug. 20): Though the musical quartet was formed for purposes of this comedy series, the foursome also had some genuine hit records (\"Daydream Believer,\" the Neil Diamond-composed \"I'm a Believer,\" etc.) - virtually all of which are heard here as a weekend marathon of the show continues.\n \n\"Ironside\" (GetTV, Wednesday, Aug. 23): After his long run as \"Perry Mason,\" Raymond Burr began another sizable weekly-TV stay in the two-hour pilot film for the series that cast him as San Francisco's chief of detectives, who becomes a special operative after being paralyzed below the waist by a sniper he is determined to track down. Don Galloway, Barbara Anderson and Don Mitchell also are series regulars. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

One of the latest examples on screen can be found in \"Puppy Love,\" a Freevee movie that makes its debut Friday, Aug. 18. The tale teams two performers who have had a strong television presence in recent years: Lucy Hale, who went on from \"Pretty Little Liars\" to star in \"Life Sentence,\" \"Katy Keene\" and \"Ragdoll\" and Grant Gustin, who wrapped up his nine-season run as \"The Flash\" earlier this year.Their \"Puppy Love\" characters, Nicole and Max, may have less success in matters of the heart than their dogs do - at least initially. The two humans' very different natures result in a date that does not go well, to put it mildly, making a second one seem highly unlikely. That's until they discover that their dogs made a much happier connection than they did, with evidence in the litter of puppies that the animals produce, causing Max and Nicole to reunite for the benefit of their suddenly larger family.And they just might find love with each other, too, the second time around.\"Puppy Love\" was inspired by a same-themed digital series from several years ago, \"Puppyhood,\" shown by BuzzFeed (which also had a hand in producing the new movie) and centering on a man whose closest friend and confidant turned out to be his dog. The film also stars someone else who is no stranger to viewers, Jane Seymour, who had a long and successful run in \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\" and has returned to television lately as the title amateur sleuth in \"Harry Wild.\" Hale plays it free and unpredictable in \"Puppy Love,\" and though she has displayed variety in other roles - particularly in going from the sunny spirit of \"Katy Keene\" to the pronounced darkness of \"Ragdoll\" - her defining image to date arguably is that of the level-headed Aria in the hugely popular \"Pretty Little Liars.\" Around those shows, she also has done such movies as \"Truth or Dare\" and \"Fantasy Island.\" \n \n Caption: Grant Gustin and Lucy Hale in \"Puppy Love\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Playing for money, North would have doubled five hearts and collected 300 points.However, worried that most pairs would buy it in four spades, North pushed on to five spades.Clearly, South had to avoid a club loser, and he knew to leave the key suit as late as possible. He ruffed the second heart, drew one round of trumps and played a diamond to the king. East took that trick and played another trump. Declarer won on the board, cashed the diamond jack, crossed to the spade queen and played off the diamond queen and 10, pitching clubs from the dummy.It was time to work out the club position. What had South learned?East was known to have started with three spades and five diamonds. The bidding also strongly suggested that East had four hearts. If so, his hand distribution was 3=4=5=1.Singularity rules. Declarer cashed his club king and ran the club jack, chosen to encourage an unwise cover.Well counted. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I mean, it was just amazing.\" For over 34 years, Caroline Summerfest has been an outdoor celebration of arts and entertainment on the grounds and surrounding streets of the Caroline County Courthouse.The two-day event took place 5 to 9 p.m. Friday, Aug. 18, and Saturday, Aug. 19.This year's theme was \"Caroline Summerfest goes Back to Bedrock.\" Fred and Wilma cutouts from The Flintstones decorated vendors' booths, while the traditional sand sculpture on display featured the cast of characters.At the Aug. 22 Commission meeting, Commission President Travis Breeding thanked the Summerfest staff for \"running a flawless\" event.On Saturday evening Breeding experienced the satisfaction of hitting a red metal target, plunging Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker into the dunk tank.\"Can we start budget negotiations now?\" Breeding taunted Baker as the crowd laughed before Baker fell in.Musical entertainment took place simultaneously on two stages, one on the courthouse steps and the other on the west lawn. Artists ranged from a steel drum band Spark in da Pan to local rap artist Devon Beck and 11-year-old rock guitarist Ben Connolly of Centreville.Popular with the young and young-at-heart were rides atop a firetruck, complete with flashing lights and sirens.On Saturday, Lt. Bruce Cathcart of Denton Volunteer Fire Company sold $3 tickets to riders' families who lined up for half a block, four and five abreast. He said 320 tickets were sold on Friday.Food vendors did a brisk business and organizations like the Caroline County Republican Central Committee were \"really busy,\" said chairman Julie Quick.Vendors sold fried catfish, pork parfaits and funnel cakes.The Sno Angel crew created art in sugar and ice. Lining the streets were classic cars, dueling marching bands and nonprofit tents that promoted diverse causes, such as Caroline Pride, His Hope Ministries and Gideon Bibles.Jim Elben said Gideons International rely on support from various churches in the area \"and we are thankful for that. They make it possible.\" Angel Perez, CEO of Caroline Pride and the new president of Denton Rotary, said, \"I love to see the people come together during the weekend.Seeing how many people come to town and enjoy the music, enjoy the vendors and especially the food.\" Perez ranked his favorite Summerfest foods. \"Number one Is the roast beef sandwiches from the Knights of Columbus; number two, the funnel cakes from the Rotary Club; number 3 is the pork parfait from the Denton Lions Club; (and) number four is the Italian sandwich from the Ridgely Lions Club.Two for today, two for tomorrow,\" he said.Denton Mayor Abby McNinch chimed in on the great food, as well. \"Each year there is a catfish sandwich on white bread. I make sure to get it. One of the Methodist churches prepares it,\" she said.Stunt street dancer Uncle Grandpa showed up with a boombox on wheels. He had the little kids getting in motion and dancing to the beats.Ashley Dwire, with 5-month-old daughter Clara Eichelberger in a sling, said \"This is our second year coming to Summerfest. The bounce houses were a huge hit last year. We are visiting grandparents, and we had to come and check it out.\" Down the hill from the court house there were rows and rows of classic cars and muscle cars. Proud owners prowled up and down the hill to examine other cars that have been lovingly cared for.The top car was a 1979 Chevy Camaro Z28, owned by Dave Hubbard.\"Hands down, the best part is the community,\" said Dr.Derek Simmons, superintendent of Caroline County Public Schools.\"We get kids. We get adults.We get everybody and it is nice to kick off the school year with Summerfest,\" he said.\"Summer flew by way too fast.\" Capping the festivities on Saturday night was a fireworks display promptly at 9 p.m. over the Choptank River. Hundreds of people perched on the courthouse lawn and filled the bottom of Market Street, applauding the show.\"Summerfest is tradition.It is how people come together,\" said McNinch, who has attended 21 Summerfests \"In our society right now where everything is disjointed, we come together here. We see old friends and make new friends.

Wright Park checking out the vendors and munching on food truck fare, a frenzy of energetic kids - who probably shun the bathtub - made trip after trip to careen down a foamy slip and slide one more time.While the day was hot and humid, the sunny weather drew hundreds to the third annual Summerdaze free event from noon to 4 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 12, in Preston.\"It was good. It was nice and warm, but it was cool in the dunk tank so I can't complain,\" Town Manager Amber Korell said.Korell said she was \"dunked enough,\" but her activity was only one of several offered during the day.The foam party, water slide bounce house, hose down by Preston Volunteer Fire Company's fire truck, free craft table and Nana Poppins' face painting attracted groups of children, from toddlers to teens.Throughout the park under tents and shady trees, about 50 vendors and nonprofits offered games and drawings, provided information, took orders and sold their goods.The Cayer Band performed in the open air pavilion while folks bought food and set up lunch on the picnic tables.The event was sponsored by the town of Preston and earned, from vendors' fees, about half as much as last year's event, according to Korell.Other events in nearby Jonestown and Bethesda Methodist Church's Peach Festival may have siphoned off some from Summerdaze.\"That foam cannon and waterslide is the big attraction,\" Korell said. \"The kids come ready. and play all day, and the parents are geared up and ready for it, too. They shop around while the kids play.\" One mishap on the foam slide sent a man to the hospital with a dislocated shoulder.\"He decided to stand up as he was going down the hill, and it didn't work out too well on that slippery slide,\" Korell said.Emergency management personnel were already at the event selling raffle tickets, so they responded quickly.Although the event is free and fun for the kids, Korell said she heard concerns from vendors about them not making as much money as during last year's event.\"I want the vendors to be successful and to come back every year so they do make a little bit - at least make their vendor fee, if not triple, double, quadruple that,\" she said.\"So it was a little sad that some of them didn't make as much as they did last year, but I think I understand why, and I'm going to revamp my events to fix that,\" Korell said. \n \n Caption: CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nJan Mason of Cambridge sells her colorful, hand-painted marble coasters and other items at Summerdaze Aug. 12.\n \nIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nThe third annual Summerdaze featured free activities to keep the kids busy outdoors all afternoon Saturday, Aug. 12, in Preston.

That way, if it doesn't work out, you haven't wasted a whole day.\" At the bridge table, though, if you take an early finesse that does not work out, you might have wasted your contract.In today's deal, for example, how should South plan the play in three no-trump after West leads the spade queen?South starts by counting his top tricks and sees five: two spades, one heart, one diamond and one club. So, if the club finesse is winning, that will be an easy nine tricks for declarer. However, after taking the first trick with dummy's spade ace, South should realize that if West wins an early trick, he cannot continue spades without conceding a third trick in the suit. In contrast, if the club finesse loses, putting East on lead, a spade return through the K-10 establishes West's suit.So, declarer should endeavor to keep East off the lead until nine tricks have been set up.How does South do that?Right - at trick two, he takes a heart finesse. Yes, it loses, but as just noted, West cannot safely play another spade. He will probably shift to a diamond, but declarer wins in his hand and now takes the club finesse. If it succeeds, fine; declarer gains overtricks. Here, it loses and a spade is returned, but South takes that trick, crosses to dummy with a club and takes a second heart finesse, which is heavily favored to succeed.When it does, declarer can claim nine tricks: two spades, two hearts, one diamond and four clubs.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Whether you looked forward to a quinceañera, a sweet 16, your senior prom or another teenage milestone event, it seems more than likely that the day came and went with a certain level of anticipation and expectation. Unfortunately, those two feelings often team up to create unattainable standards, as is the case in Netflix's newest family comedy.In \"You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah,\" premiering Friday, Aug. 25, on Netflix, Stacey Friedman (Sunny Sandler, \"Grown Ups,\" 2010) is dead set on having the perfect bat mitzvah party. The film is based on the young adult (YA) novel of the same name by Fiona Rosenbloom, in which Stacey's desires are made very clear: all she wants is \"the perfect BCBG dress to wear, her friends by her side, and her biggest crush ever, Andy Goldfarb [Dylan Hoffman, \"Next\"], to dance with her (and maybe even make out with her on the dance floor).\" So naturally, when the day doesn't exactly go off without a hitch, Stacey is massively disappointed.Adding insult to injury, Stacey always seems to be in competition with her so-called best friend, Lydia (Samantha Lorraine, \"The Walking Dead: World Beyond\"), who is also hosting her bat mitzvah around the same time.When popularity, romantic crushes and other middle school dramas creep into the picture for Stacey, her flubbed ceremonial rite of passage threatens to ruin her reputation.While the last name Sandler is most closely associated with \"Billy Madison\" (1995) and \"Happy Gilmore\" (1996) comedian Adam Sandler, the entire Sandler family is on board for this new production. The plot may revolve around the character played by his youngest daughter, Sunny, but Sandler's wife, Jackie Sandler (\"The Wrong Missy,\" 2020), stars as a member of the Rodriguez-Katz family, while their eldest daughter, Sadie Sandler (\"Pixels,\" 2015), plays Stacey's sister, Ronnie. \n \n Caption: Sunny Sandler and Millie Thorpe in \"You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MGM+ presents the Mike Nichols-directed 1988 comedy Thursday, Aug. 31, with Griffith as a New York secretary who aspires to be more. Her candor frequently gets in the way of her aims, which she gets a fresh chance to attain when she goes to work for a self-involved boss (a wonderfully hilarious Sigourney Weaver).A skiing accident puts Boss Lady out of commission, giving Griffith's character the opportunity to mount a deal involving a sale of radio stations - and also involving a down-on-his-luck broker (Harrison Ford) who provides Griffith with a new chance at romance beyond her philandering boyfriend (Alec Baldwin). Smart, tremendous fun throughout, the picture also boasts a Carly Simon music score that features the Oscar-winning \"Let the River Run.\" \n \n Caption: Melanie Griffith, Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver in \"Working Girl\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A fresh look: Northern Ireland's troubled history is traced in PBS documentary\n\n August 24, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 518\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Typically and logically, some of the most telling documents of history are those related by people who actually lived through the given times.The timeline of the strains of life in Northern Ireland is well-known, and it gets first-person treatment in a PBS documentary that spans five parts and three nights. After first being presented as a streaming offering via the network's digital avenues last May, \"Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland\" makes its broadcast premiere nightly from Monday, Aug. 28, through Wednesday, Aug. 30 (check local listings).Co-produced with PBS with England's BBC and BBC Northern Ireland, the program by filmmaker James Bluemel showcases the memories of individuals who experienced daily challenges over the course of more than three decades, from the late 1960s - and the start of what were known as The Troubles, which ultimately cost an estimated 3500-plus lives - to the signing of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement in 1998.The Troubles technically began in 1966 with the Ulster Volunteer Army's opposition to the Irish Republican Army punctuated by several attacks on Catholics.As detailed in the program's opening hour, \"It Wasn't Like a Movie Anymore,\" the situation festered over several years and ultimately erupted into Bloody Sunday, the 1972 event that saw British soldiers shoot 26 unarmed civilians during a protest in Derry, Northern Ireland. Thirteen of the wounded died on the exact day, and one more succumbed to his injuries after several months.Part 2, \"Do Paramilitaries Lie Awake at Night?,\" picks up in the immediate aftermath of the massacre as other instances of violence occurred. While Catholics and Protestants were very divided in the face of bombings and rigid paramilitary patrols, young people on each side of the conflict found punk music to be a respite, particularly in giving voice to their emotions.The third part, \"So Many Broken Hearts,\" recalls how alarmingly common the discord in Northern Ireland became - encompassing assassinations and car bombings. Also, a hunger strike was waged by IRA prisoners to protest the policies of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.In Part 4, \"The Dirty War,\" the documentary moves along to the late 1980s. The ongoing violence was supplemented by an increase in the information war while the physical one raged on, with efforts to infiltrate paramilitary groups used as attempts to stop the conflict from within. Considerable paranoia resulted, as very few people were sure who to trust.The concluding portion, \"Who Wants to Live Like That?,\" involves a major diplomatic controversy: namely, U.S. President Bill Clinton's 1994 White House invitation to Gerry Adams, the then-leader of the Sinn Fein party, which was associated at the time with the Irish Republican Army. That move drew sharply differing reactions, but the same year, the IRA announced a ceasefire (which would last until 1996). Later in 1994, loyalist paramilitaries also issued a ceasefire, contingent on \"the continued cessation of all nationalist/republican violence.\" History bears out that the legacy of The Troubles continued for years, but \"Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland\" covers much of the essential information comprehensively. And a great deal of it remains troubling today. \n \n Caption: James as featured in \"Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Lately, he's launched his own, unlikely film franchise: the \"Fisherman's Friends\" movies.It started as an independently made British comedy, \"Fisherman's Friends.\" It was a runaway hit, based on a true story of a group of fishermen from the British region of Cornwall who sang sea shanties to pass the time but suddenly launched to fame after getting a global record deal.The success of the first led soon to a sequel, \"Fisherman's Friends: One and All,\" released last year. Purefoy stars in the films as one of the singers, and signed on as a producer of the sequel.The series' success must have been welcome for Purefoy, whose big-screen career was a bit tarnished by a pair of all-time flops. In the same year he did \"The Philanthropist\" (2009), he had the title role in the big-budget adventure film \"Solomon Kane,\" which didn't even earn back half of its $45-million budget. He followed that up with a leading role in 2012's \"John Carter,\" one of the most notorious bombs of all time. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Yes, if you make the wrong decision.One aspect of playing in an online duplicate is that you are always on the lookout for overtricks. If you fail to win one that you could have collected, it can be expensive.In today's deal, how do you think the play went in four hearts?All 16 tables played in hearts, 14 in game by South, one in game by North (after South opened two diamonds, Flannery, showing a minimum opening with 4=5 or 4=6 in the majors), and one in three hearts (when North only invited game and South declined). Note that three no-trump, even by South, would have failed after a club lead.It looked wrong to start with trumps. Usually, it would be better first to attack dummy's side suit that I wished to establish. So I played a diamond to the queen, which held. Robots rarely duck, so I placed the diamond ace with West. Now, though, I erred. I was too tempted by the club finesse, and when it lost, I was in danger of conceding a trick in each suit.Still, the robot gave me a second chance. Instead of immediately playing another spade, West cashed the diamond ace first. I could have played a trump to the board, ruffed a diamond, returned with another heart and discarded two spades on the diamond king and eight.However, I cashed both high hearts immediately and could not recover. My line could have done well, but it was little compensation that only one pair bid and made four hearts. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Use the extra darkness to discuss the bidding and play of this deal with your partner. What do you think of the auction, and how should South play in four hearts after the first trick goes club jack, four, three, queen?The auction was almost \"After you,\" \"No, after you.\" West should have bid two or three spades on the second round, despite an apparently worthless diamond king.North ought not to have bid three hearts without a fourth trump. Finally, South bid four hearts because it is fun making a game when the opponents could have passed you out in a partscore.West was really regretting his three-spade bid.At one table, South, after winning the first trick with the club queen, drew trumps. However, now he was stuck in the dummy.The only way home was to lead a low diamond and play East for royal-doubleton.When declarer crossed to the club ace and took a diamond finesse, East won and cashed two spades and the club king.South should take a diamond finesse at trick two. It loses, and East, say, returns a club. Declarer wins with his ace and takes a second diamond finesse - whew, it wins. Then South can draw trumps and claim an overtrick.If East plays his two top spades when in with the diamond queen, declarer ruffs, cashes the two remaining top trumps, crosses to the club ace, removes East's third heart and takes a second diamond finesse. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, occasionally one produces an interesting declarer-play or defense problem.In today's deal, South is in three no-trump. How should he plan the play after West leads the spade 10? What would have happened if West had instead led the heart seven or heart jack or club six? How would four spades have fared?West's two-no-trump intervention showed at least 5-5 in hearts and clubs, the unbid suits. After that, North-South struggled into three no-trump.A careless declarer won with the spade jack and played four rounds of diamonds. An accurate heart shift by East left South unable to cash his third spade winner.When West discards at trick two, South should unblock the spade ace and duck a diamond, giving East his winner early (usually the right play). Now declarer can win the heart shift with his ace, cash the spade king and run the rest of the diamonds.He retains communication between his two hands.Note that the heart seven opening lead results in down two. The heart jack blocks the suit and allows South to escape for down one. The club six leads to down one if declarer guesses the clubs correctly at trick one.Finally, the toughest question: Four spades can be made unless West leads a trump! ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As the balloon inflated, it provided welcome shade to a large swath of the festival-goers enjoying the music of county singer Jimmy Charles, an Eastern Shore native, who is now based in Nashville.Chad Boushell hustled on the ground as the interior of the balloon warmed up, adjusting the tether rope system that allowed pilot William Randell to take passengers up and down on about a 50-foot flight when Big Blue was ready to fly.While conducting one of those flights, Randell was asked what he liked about being a hot air balloon pilot.\"No restraint, the fact that I can cut loose and say goodbye to everybody,\" said Randell, who lives in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and has being flying balloons for about 10 years.\"We went up in the air, and it was very high,\" said Bastion Baatine, one youngster who flew in Big Blue. When asked whether it was scary or cool, Bastion said, \"Both, but more cool than scary.\" Chesapeake Balloon Festival social media manager Mary Bryan said the event was going \"really well\" in light of the \"jumps, hurdles and speed bumps\" the organizers encountered. \"I think it's turned out really well,\" Bryan said.Joel Berka of Mystical Breeze Balloons was down from Binghamton, New York, with his 90,000 cubic foot balloon \"Colorscape.\" Colorscape's burners put out about 40 million BTUs in optimal conditions, and the basket typically holds four or five passengers for a flight.Berka said he flies balloons all over the world. \"I've been to New Zealand, Mexico, up and down the East Coast, Europe, all sorts of great places, and (I) meet all sorts of beautiful, nice people,\" he said of his experience.Berka said he has been ballooning since he was a year old, taking his first flight with his father, who was manning the adjacent balloon, \"Earthbound,\" at the festival.\"Ever since, I've been hooked,\" he said.Earthbound is 105,000 cubic foot, equivalent to roughly the same number of soccer balls, Berka said.Earthbound originally came from Dubai as a plain green balloon, but Berka had a face stitched on, one Berka said is open to some interpretation.The balloon certainly bears a strong resemblance to an alien. \"Everybody wants to know: 'What is it?What is it? I say it's whatever you want it to be,\" Berka said, \"Alien, cricket, grasshopper, frog, so long as it makes you smile.\" \n \n Caption: MIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nTOP: Big Blue, the first balloon of the evening, inflates at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nBria Hart of Stevensville gives the \"thumbs up\" as she poses with the pilot and passengers of a balloon about to take flight at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nBalloons rise over the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nA flames fill up a balloon and lights up the vicinity at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nYoungsters help to inflate a balloon at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nA pilot flies a balloon at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nA flame fill a balloon with hot air the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nEastern Shore-born Jimmy Charles performs at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nA girl reacts to the roar of the propane flame filling a balloon with over the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nThe glow of a balloon is viewed from another balloon at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nBalloon \"Colorscape\" stands between two other balloons at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nCrewmen keep tension on a line as a balloon is fixed with air at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nThe Chesapeake Balloon Festival is seen from a balloon flight on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Brooks and Allan Burns.The saga of Mary Richards, a local-TV-news producer negotiating her social life as well as her career, also had a major benefit in what Moore - whose company produced the series - understandably called \"the best ensemble cast\" when she addressed the studio audience after filming the final episode. Edward Asner, Valerie Harper and Cloris Leachman all got their own spinoffs, with Gavin MacLeod, Ted Knight and Georgia Engel also contributing mightily to the sophisticated fun. \n \n Caption: Mary Tyler Moore and Ted Knight in \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A series 'Reborn': 'The Wheel of Time' returns for Season 2\n\n August 31, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dana Simpson | Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 548\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Within the realm of the fantastic, several novels, movies, video games and series exist to tickle the adventure bone. However, despite the plethora of content, few franchises have the hold that Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and The Lord of the Rings do. One series that has recently re-entered the chat, however, is \"The Wheel of Time,\" which is about to begin its second season on Prime Video.First written by Robert Jordan beginning in 1990, the 15-book series was expected to comprise just six novels. In 2009, the book series was taken over by fellow fantasy writing powerhouse Brandon Sanderson, following Jordan's death two years earlier. As time progressed and more books emerged, fans of high fantasy craved a TV or film adaptation that would do the then-stillgrowing book series justice. Finally, in 2018, following nearly two decades of rights disputes, low-budget pilots and controversy, it was announced that Amazon Studios would partner with Sony Pictures Television to make everyone's otherworldly dreams come true.Now, following further setbacks brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and more, \"The Wheel of Time\" Season 2 premieres Friday, Sept. 1, on Prime Video.Already renewed for a third season ahead of the Season 2 premiere, WOT fans can rest easy knowing that the series' writers did not need to rush to fit several books' worth of content into one (potentially) final set of episodes. Instead, audiences get another eight episodes in the second season, while looking forward to even more come Season 3 (likely to be released 2024-25).When Season 1 began, viewers met Moiraine (Rosamund Pike, \"Gone Girl,\" 2014) as she began her quest to find the Dragon Reborn in the Two Rivers.As a member of the powerful Aes Sedai, an order of women with the ability to channel a form of elemental magic called the One Power, Moiraine has been called upon to find a kind of \"chosen one,\" the reincarnation of a channeller called the Dragon, who once destroyed the world. After gathering a small group - any of whom could possibly be the Dragon Reborn - Moiraine, her Warder, Lan Mandragoran (Daniel Henney, \"Big Hero 6,\" 2014), and the four new candidates - Perrin Aybara (Marcus Rutherford, \"Bulletproof \"), Mat Cauthon (played by \"Clique's\" Barney Harris in Season 1 and replaced by \"The Witcher's\" Dónal Finn in Season 2), Rand al'thor (Josha Stradowski, \"High Flyers\") and Egwene al'Vere (Madeleine Madden, \"Dora and the Lost City of Gold,\" 2019) - begin their quest to defeat a primordial evil known as the Dark One.For the sake of brevity and avoiding as many spoilers as possible, suffice it to say that the first season did not end on a high note for Moiraine and her tribe of villagers. Despite the unveiling of the Dragon Reborn, a battle between the reincarnation and a villain presumed to be the Dark One only appeared to awaken a more sinister energy. Needless to say, a war is on the horizon headed into this new instalment.\"In Season 2, threats new and very old seek out the young friends from the Two Rivers, now scattered over the world,\" the Prime Video description reads.\"The woman who found and guided them is now powerless to help, and so they must find other sources of strength. In each other, or themselves. In the Light or the Dark.\" \n \n Caption: Ayoola Smart in \"The Wheel of Time\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Milo Ventimiglia OF FORMERLY \"THE COMPANY YOU KEEP\" ON ABC\n\n August 31, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: 10 | Section: News \n \n 268\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Q: Now that \"The Company You Keep\" is over, what's next for Milo Ventimiglia?A: That remains to be seen. The actor put a lot into that ABC series, since his production company was heavily involved in it, in addition to his being the show's star. It also came pretty much on the heels of the end of his run on NBC's \"This Is Us,\" so he had been busy for quite some time.The much-acclaimed family drama, on which Ventimiglia played Jack Pearson, followed a string of other regular roles for him on series (\"Mob City,\" \"Chosen,\" \"The Whispers\") so if he should take a break from weekly television work for a while, it's understandable. It's also mandated, at least for the time being, given the work stoppage that has been prompted by the actors' and writers' strikes.Other shows on which Ventimiglia has appeared have included \"Gilmore Girls,\" \"American Dreams,\" \"The Bedford Diaries\" and \"Heroes.\" He's also not opposed to guest shots, as he proved on \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" as it was nearing its finale.Even if TV isn't the route Ventimiglia takes when show business gets back to business, he's done a sufficient amount of movie work that might inspire him to go down that path again instead. \"The Art of Racing in the Rain\" and \"Second Act\" are among his more recent films, as is \"Creed II,\" in which he reprised the role of Rocky Balboa Jr. that he first played in (aptly enough) \"Rocky Balboa.\" The relationship he developed with Sylvester Stallone on the latter picture led to Stallone's guest stint on \"This Is Us.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Did you think of a giraffe, though? I didn't.At the bridge table, paying careful attention to valuable spot cards can make the difference between success and failure.In today's deal, how should South play in four spades after West leads the club queen?West might have considered sacrificing in five diamonds, but the vulnerability was unfavorable.South saw four potential losers: one heart, two diamonds and one club. He had only nine top tricks: seven spades and two clubs.He had to eliminate that club loser, and the only way to do that was to establish a heart trick and discard a club from hand.However, that required being careful with communications.The defenders were already halfway to collecting a club winner.Declarer played spotlessly!He won the first trick in his hand and led the heart 10. West correctly ducked, letting his partner take the trick. East shifted to a diamond, West collecting two tricks there before returning the club 10.South won on the board, ruffed a heart with a spade honor, overtook the spade five with dummy's nine, trumped another heart with a high trump, led the spade eight to dummy's 10 and ruffed a third heart high, bringing down West's ace. Finally, declarer played his spade deuce to dummy's three and pitched his remaining club on the heart queen.It was a purrfect line of play.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He took the offer, partially because of his belief that Griffith's series was about to end, though it actually lasted three more years beyond that (with Knotts returning for guest appearances).Turner Classic Movies salutes Knotts' big-screen work with a double feature Saturday, Sept. 2. The first attraction is the first picture he made under the arrangement with Universal, the 1966 horror satire \"The Ghost and Mr. Chicken.\" Then comes his turn as the unlikely publisher of a spicy men's magazine in \"The Love God?\" (1969). And yes, since it was Knotts, the question mark was part of that official title.On \"The Ghost and Mr. Chicken,\" Knotts had some familiar names and faces with him, since a number of other \"Andy Griffith Show\" personnel went to that project with him including such supporting players as Hal Smith (alias \"Griffith's\" often besotted and jailed Otis Campbell) and Hope Summers, plus director Alan Rafkin and writers Jim Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum. Knotts transferred a lot of his Fife-isms into the role of an aspiring reporter who spends the 20th anniversary of a murder-suicide in the allegedly cursed mansion where the crime occurred.\"The Love God?\" was the fourth of the five movies in Knotts' Universal deal, and the only one to carry what then was an \"M\" rating (now a \"PG-13,\" in that picture's case) for adult material, a somewhat surprising development for a Knotts vehicle. The subject matter justified it, however, as the star played a birdwatching-magazine publisher whose new business partner (Edmond O'Brien) transforms the periodical into something else altogether. An interesting byproduct was that some theaters evidently wouldn't book the film, since the traditional Knotts movie was designed for family audiences. And \"The Love God?\" surely was not. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This will begin tonight with Sammy Miller and the Congregation, Saturday is trumpeter Dominick Farinacci and the festival closes on Sunday with \"Tony Bennett's favorite singer,\" Allan Harris.\"I think this is the best lineup that has ever been presented,\" said Richard Marks, founder of the Dock Street Foundation. \"It is beyond belief to have these three acts on the same weekend in Easton.Just remarkable.\" There will be some humor in addition to great musicianship.\"Sammy is a hoot,\" Marks said. \"Dominick is a world-class musician, and his stage presence has a warmth that is unparalleled. He goes far beyond just the ballads.\" He calls Allan Harris an institution.\"It is icing on the cake to have him finish up on Sunday,\" he said.\"I have seen Sammy Miller and the Congregation before,\" said jazz fan Hugh Panero, who is known for founding XM Radio. \"Their music is a lot of fun. It is very much audience participation.Dominick is spectacular and has been to Easton before.These are the kind of acts you would see in a major city whether it be D.C. or N.Y.\" Panero said the festival is a great way to spend the weekend \"with all the great things going on in Easton - you know great food, great lodging and great music.\" Tonight at 8 p.m., Sammy Miller and the Congregation will take the stage. Their show focuses on the music of 1973. Does that include \"Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree\" or the fusion ensemble Weather Report?Hard to say, but this band is upbeat and as accessible as jazz can get. Get ready to stomp and sweat with their youthful verve. Miller was trained at Juilliard as a drummer. He brings rarefied chops to the service of good fun.Within his ensemble is Molly Miller. This guitarist has toured with Jason Mraz and has a doctorate of musical arts in guitar performance.The good doctor shreds while keeping a firm eye on the underlying song's structure.\"This is feel good party jazz, harking back to the '20s and '30s. It's brassy, stomp your feet and dance music, and it's got the raw, uplifting vibe of a New Orleans street parade,\" according to the San Francisco Weekly.After shaking it out with Sammy Miller and the Congregation, you may want to delight in Farinacci's belllike tone on his trumpet and quintet's sensitive and percussive support. He can bop and he can ballad. Farinacci will be playing at 8 on Saturday, Sept. 2.\"Mr. Farinacci is a clear, declarative, forceful player.When Mr. Farinacci soloed, Mr. Diehl (pianist) accompanied, leaving fabulous acres of silence between chords,\" wrote New York Times jazz critic Ben Ratliff.\"It's rare to hear an artist who can balance finesse and fire, but Dominick Farinacci is the real deal, mixing class, charm, taste and skill in equal measure,\" according to All About Jazz.The final curtain will rise on Sunday at 3 p.m. for vocalist and educator Allan Harris.Harris' quintet is tight, rhythmic and toe tapping.He can scat and hit soaring low notes and has a smooth baritone delivery. He uses his music to educate on subjects like the African American experience in the western expansion of the 19th century.The Miami Herald said: \"Blessed with the warmth of Tony Bennett, the bite and rhythmic sense of Sinatra and the sly elegance of Nat King Cole.\" Choose your jazz this weekend at the festival. From raucous to refined, erudite to transporting, this Jazz Experience is worth a listen.Tickets run roughly from $40-60 for each show and are available online at the Avalon website, tickets.avalontheatre.com. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nSammy Miller and the Congregation take the music and the fun dead serious in equal measure. Miller is a Juilliard trained drummer. The guitarist in the band is Molly Miller. She tours with melodic pop sensation Jason Mraz.\n \nCONTRIBUTED PHOTO\n \nDominick Farinacci has toured all over the world with his trumpet. He comes to the Avalon on Saturday at 8.

Then, though, is the time to be frugal, to limit yourself to your contract and not risk going minus.In today's deal, how should South play in six no-trump after West leads the spade jack?South's two-no-trump response was an artificial inquiry. Three diamonds announced a maximum weak two with a diamond feature (ace or king). Then South, having no way to find out if the heart suit was solid, settled for six no-trump.West did well to find a safe lead.As soon as the dummy appeared, South wished he were in seven no-trump.Playing without thinking, he unblocked his heart ace, crossed to the diamond king and cashed the heart kingqueen, getting the bad news when East discarded a spade.Undaunted, declarer led dummy's remaining diamond. Disaster! East again failed to follow suit.Now South had to concede a diamond to West, who also cashed the heart jack for down one.Unlucky, yes, but South needed only five diamond tricks. When he led a diamond at trick three, he should have played low from the board. East might have won with the five and shifted to a club, but declarer could have won with his ace, crossed to the diamond king, gotten the bad news about the hearts, returned to hand with a spade and run the diamonds, taking three spades, three hearts, five diamonds and one club. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Schuller, who was a televangelist, said, \"High achievers spot rich opportunities swiftly, make big decisions quickly and move into action immediately. Follow these principles and you can make your dreams come true.\" That also applies to bridge experts. How should South play to try to make four spades? West leads the diamond jack, and East overtakes with his queen.North was tempted to rebid two spades, but with 4-3-3-3 he settled for one no-trump.South bid what he hoped he could make.South has nine top tricks: seven spades and two minorsuit aces. Maybe East will have the heart ace - but as you are seeing this deal in a column, you know it cannot be that easy. Similarly, West is not going to have the club king. Can declarer get home if both of those honors are offsideftYes, if he notes the invaluable clubs. South wins trick one because if he ducks, East will shift to the heart queen, and the defenders will take the first four tricks.Declarer overtakes his club 10 with dummy's ace and continues with the club queen (or nine). Here, East will cover with the king.So South ruffs high, draws trumps ending on the board and plays the club nine.When East covers, declarer ruffs, plays a spade to the eight and cashes the club eight.Note that if East does not cover one of the clubs from the board, South discards his remaining diamond.Finally, if West has both the club king and jack, declarer is still all right. He will lose only two clubs and one heart. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

In this deal, for example, which card allows South to guarantee his sixspade contract after West leads the heart 10?Following South's fourspade opening, North used Roman Key Card Blackwood to learn that his partner had the top three spades. Thinking they had 12 winners (South's eight spades and his own four tops), North put his partner into six spades. However, South had only seven spades and needed to find a 12th trick somewhere.His first thought was to try each minor-suit finesse, but then he wondered if he could get home even if East had both of those kings.Suddenly declarer noticed the power of dummy's diamond nine. He took the first trick on the board and drew trumps. Then he played a low diamond and covered West's card with dummy's nine. East won with his jack, but what could he do now?Whether he returned a heart, a diamond or a club, it was into a tenace on the board and furnished South with his 12th trick.Notice that it does not help West to put up the diamond 10. Declarer can cover with the queen. Yes, East takes the trick with his king, but a diamond away from the jack runs around to the dummy's ace-nine.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And while viewers have already gathered their fair share of Daryl details since his first appearance in TWD's Season 1 episode \"Tell It to the Frogs,\" audiences have never seen the troubled \"walker\"-fighting hero quite like this.\"Daryl Dixon\" follows the titular character as he \"washes ashore in France and struggles to piece together how he got there and why\" (per AMC). According to the official synopsis, \"The series tracks his journey across a broken but resilient France as he hopes to find a way back home,\" noting that as \"he makes the journey the connections he forms along the way complicate his ultimate plan.\" The title of this latest TWD spinoff was announced in October 2022, which is also when filming began in Paris. Despite AMC's initial desire to produce a series that followed another TWD character, Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride, \"The Mist,\" 2007), the network eventually landed on \"Daryl Dixon\" as a result of scheduling conflicts with McBride. That said, McBride is expected to reprise her role as Carol in at least one of the premiere season's six episodes.In fact, as mentioned by Vanity Fair writer Derek Lawrence in his November 2022 article titled \"Norman Reedus Unpacks the Walking Dead Finale and His 'F-ing Great' Spin-Off,\" Daryl himself made a nod toward his own future series in the final episodes of the flagship series' finale.\"It's not like we're never gonna see each other again,\" Daryl tells Carol in an intimate scene toward the end of 'Rest in Peace,'\" Lawrence writes, noting Carol's response: \"I'm allowed to be a little sad. You're my best friend.\" And while we have no idea what may be in store for Carol, fans can certainly expect more \"Daryl Dixon\" beyond the first six episodes. Just last month, AMC announced that the series had already been renewed for a second season.Also joining the cast for Season 1 is French actress Clémence Poésy, known for her roles in films such as the Harry Potter franchise (beginning in 2005), \"In Bruges\" (2008) and \"Tenet\" (2020), among others.Poésy plays Isabelle, a French woman with a dark Parisian past and a connection to a \"progressive religious group.\" She joins forces with Daryl on his journey. \n \n Caption: Louis Puech Scigliuzzi and Norman Reedus in \"The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jimmy Olsen (Jack Larson) and Perry White's sister (veteran character actress Mabel Albertson) vanish while investigating a voodoo cult in Haiti, sending Perry (John Hamilton) and Clark Kent (George Reeves) on a quest to find them.\"Freaky Friday\" (Freeform, Monday, Sept. 11): Filmed a couple of times previously and again since, this fanciful body-switch comedy has served the Disney studio well, including in this 2003 version. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are quite enjoyable as the mother and daughter who magically make the exchange, a therapist and a would-be musician who each get a new and quite deep understanding of the other by walking in their shoes, quite literally. Mark Harmon and Chad Michael Murray also appear.\"Magnum, p.i.\" (getTV, Monday, Sept. 11): \"Limbo\" is an appropriate title for the episode that concluded Season 7 of the series, since it originally was intended to end the entire show but CBS ended up renewing it for one more round. A seriously wounded Magnum (Tom Selleck) is in a coma, and his ghostly self pays visits to his friends to consider the times he's had with each. Elements of the story continued to play out over the first couple of episodes of Season 8. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After making another Lifetime film titled \"How She Caught a Killer,\" she plays the title role in the Hallmark Movies & Mysteries feature \"Guiding Emily\" Friday, Sept. 8. The telecast helps to mark National Dog Service Month, for a reason that's quite clear in the story.Based on the same-named book by Barbara Hinske, the film's Emily is a successful career woman who experiences a major crisis when an accident robs her of her eyesight. Struggling to adjust to the situation, she gets a helper in a canine named Garth (whose thoughts are voiced by \"Will & Grace\" alum Eric McCormack), who is undergoing his own transition as he trains to become a guide dog and the two of them grow and benefit from each other as their symbiotic relationship develops. Antonio Cupo (\"Blood & Treasure\") and Sharon Taylor (\"Nancy Drew\") also are in the cast.In a statement she released before the SAG-AFTRA actors' strike, Drew said, \"Shooting 'Guiding Emily' was a deeply moving experience that allowed me to enter into the blind and partially sighted community in a very powerful way. We were honored to have two actresses from the community play roles in the film, and sitting with them both and hearing their stories was transformative for me and for our crew.\" \"I was also honored to visit the Guide Dogs of America open house the weekend before we started shooting,\" Drew noted, \"and was able to tour the facility and learn all about the process for raising service dogs and the sacrifice puppy raisers make to train them for two years, and then send them off to a member of the blind and partially sighted community to partner with them.\" \n \n Caption: Sarah Drew in \"One Summer,\" another Hallmark movie \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

What was the last one she did?A: As a series regular, that would have been \"Switched at Birth,\" on which she played one of the mothers whose daughters were well, check the title of the show again.She also had recurring roles on \"Scorpion\" (as the Katharine McPhee character's mom) and \"The Goldbergs,\" and she had a guest part last year on \"Star Trek: Picard.\" It's worth noting that Thompson also was a director on the latter two programs, and she's been spending a lot of time in that job - which she shares with her husband, Howard Deutch (\"Pretty in Pink\") - in recent times. She also has guided episodes of \"Will Trent\" (on which Deutch is an executive producer and occasional director), \"Resident Alien\" and \"Young Sheldon\" among other shows. Earlier, Thompson directed four \"Switched at Birth\" stories as well as two of the \"Jane Doe\" mystery movies in which she starred.Thompson's other major series credit as a star is the 1990s sitcom \"Caroline in the City,\" which ran almost as long as \"Switched at Birth,\" ending just short of 100 episodes.She'll have another shot at longevity on weekly TV when she returns in \"The Spencer Sisters,\" a Canadian import premiering Oct. 4 on The CW. She and Stacey Farber play a mystery-writer mother and police-officer daughter (despite the \"Sisters\" in the title) who decide to open a private-detective agency. Thompson isn't credited with directing any of that show yet, but that's likely to change if it continues for additional seasons. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Turner Classic Movies shows the picture Thursday, Sept. 14, to lead a memorial salute to Friedkin, who died in August.He won an Oscar for the fact-inspired 1971 police thriller (named its year's best picture at the awards), as did Gene Hackman as \"Popeye\" Doyle, a tough New York detective determined to get the goods on a seemingly untouchable international drug smuggler (Fernando Rey). Roy Scheider also attained stardom as Doyle's partner, and while there's much else to recommend about the movie, the chase that puts a wild-driving Doyle on the trail of an overload train is a highlight that's hard to beat.

Pumpkin-flavored everything, apple pies galore, cinnamon practically hanging in the air - no one does Autumn like Food Network, delighting with more tricks and treats in a new season of \"Halloween Baking Championship,\" premiering Monday, Sept. 11.Season 9 of the competition sees the return of John Henson (\"Wipeout\") as host, alongside the all-star panel of celebrity judges who reigned supreme in Season 8: chef Carla Hall (\"The Chew\") and patissiers Stephanie Boswell (\"Bake Or Break\") and Zac Young (\"Top Chef: Just Desserts\").Food Network has released descriptions for the series' first two episodes. According to the network, the season begins as \"host John Henson welcomes a dozen bakers to the Henson & Sons Carnival, where they're ready for the ride of their lives. First, they must layer a 'tarot-misu' depicting the carnival's untimely demise. Then, the bakers scare up a new carnival mascot by designing creepy clown cakes.\" Those lucky enough to make it to the second episode will face a frightfully gory night, with the Food Network promising a particularly \"bloody\" competition. \"Do-nut try to steal John Henson's dream job,\" they say, \"or things might get bloody. The remaining bakers make bloody filled doughnuts to commemorate an unfortunate accident.Then it's a joyful bake for some and doomed one for others as the competitors take judges [Hall, Boswell and Young] round and round on the creepiest carousel ever.\" Each episode will see two rounds of spine-chilling competition. The bakers begin with the \"Preliminary Heat,\" where they receive a bitesized, Halloween-themed challenge that must be completed within a tight time frame. The patissier who presents the spookiest (and most delicious) treat will gain a mystery advantage - a trick to play against their fellow bakers, perhaps - heading into the \"Main Heat.\" This second round sees some intense frights and delights, as competitors are given a new theme and a longer time period to create whatever creepy-crawly confection they'd like. The bakers must present something larger than life, as the winner of the \"Main Heat\" immediately advances to the next round while one baker is eliminated from the game. The final three (or four) then compete in a winner-take-all finale, with one monstrous baker winning $25,000.Sharpen your teeth and prepare to dine. Season 9 of \"Halloween Baking Championship\" begins Monday, Sept. 11, on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Carla Hall from \"Halloween Baking Championship\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The declarers who are good at that are used to saying to partner, \"Don't tell me - the suit is splitting badly yet again.\" How should South have planned the play in three notrump on today's deal? West, after overcalling in spades, led the diamond king: two, 10The bidding was pushy.North's two-spade cue bid showed at least gameinvitational values with club support. South was not happy rebidding two no-trump, but he knew his partner did not have four hearts (no negative double over one spade), and five clubs was a long way away. North raised because he had a fifth club and a vulnerable game bonus was very tempting.South saw six top tricks: three hearts, one diamond and two clubs. If clubs were 2-1, there were nine easy winners. So, declarer assumed they were 3-0. Who had the tripleton? Surely it was East because West already seemed to be marked with at least nine pointedsuit cards. However, before immediately playing a club to dummy's king, he silently said to himself, \"Wait, wait.\" He could acquire more data by first cashing his heart winners.Well, well - West had only one heart. If he had been void in clubs, he would have had something like 6=1=6=0 distribution and surely would have bid three or four diamonds over two no-trump.South cashed his club ace and claimed when East discarded.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Today's deal features one of them.How should South play in seven spades after West leads the diamond king to dummy's ace?After North described game-forcing values with three-card spade support, South used 14-30 Roman Key Card Blackwood to learn that his partner had three aces (key cards). He then jumped to seven spades.The unimaginative declarer who doesn't count his tricks or look for alternative lines of play quickly concludes that he needs the club finesse to work. If it does, he feels vindicated; if it loses, he complains that he never gets a break.A more perceptive declarer, who knows that a finesse is only a 50-50 proposition, will look for something better.Since dummy's trumps are so strong, he considers a dummy reversal. He sees that if the opposing spades divide 3-2, which will happen more than two-thirds of the time, he won't need a finesse.South cashes the spade 10 to check that the trumps aren't 5-0. Then he ruffs a diamond in hand and plays a spade to dummy's jack. If the trumps split 4-1, declarer must hope that West holds the club king. However, when both opponents follow suit, the play continues: diamond ruff in hand, heart to dummy's 10, third diamond ruff in hand, a club to the ace, draw the last trump (discarding the club seven from hand) and run the heart suit.South takes three spades, five hearts, one diamond, one club and those three diamond ruffs.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Sometimes, though, there still won't be an obvious candidate. Then it is often best to think big, shut your eyes and bid what you hope you can make.On today's deal, which was played in Australia and was reported by Tim Bourke, South didn't know what to do after East opened with a weak two spades. South made a takeout double, then mentally shrugged his shoulders and jumped to six diamonds. He knew he could be either too high or too low, but he saw no way to find out.West led the spade seven: nine, 10, queen. Declarer's immediate reaction was to cash the spade ace, discarding a heart from the dummy, and to ruff his heart three and one low spade on the board. However, he recalled the bidding. Since East had six spades, West had started with only two. Surely West would hold two diamonds higher than the five, which would allow him to ruff in front of the dummy.Then South spotted a better line. At trick two, he ruffed the spade four on the board.Declarer returned to hand with a heart to the ace and led the spade five. What could West do?If he ruffed with the diamond seven, declarer would throw a heart from the dummy.Eventually South would ruff his heart three in peace. If West discarded on the spade five, declarer would ruff in the dummy, draw trumps and claim, conceding a heart trick at the end.The key point, which applies in most contracts, is that winners can wait, but losers cannot. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I have just found out that every month has Ides. It is the 15th in March, May, July and October, and the 13th in the other months.Caesar, while taking his bath before that evening's party, was reading an edition of New Zealand Bridge. He came across this amusing story: North opened one heart. South immediately asked for aces and then bid seven no-trump. As he tabled his dummy, North said, \"I'm sorry, partner. I think I've underbid my hand.\" Thumbs up!This deal was also in the magazine. After East opened with a weak no-trump (showing 12-14 points) and South made a penalty double, West's redouble announced a weak one suited hand. Doubling two hearts would have worked well, probably netting 500, but North-South didn't have the methods to accomplish this.Against three no-trump, West led the heart queen.When declarer ducked, West might have found the lethal club nine switch, but he continued with his low heart to dummy's king. Declarer took a diamond finesse and led the spade jack, trying to create a dummy entry, but East ducked. Now a spade went to the queen and ace.Endplayed, East cashed the club ace, but South missed his chance. If South had jettisoned his king, East would have had to concede an entry to the dummy in either black suit. Declarer could have picked up the diamond suit and collected nine tricks. When South played the \"automatic\" club five, though, East exited with a low club. South could do no better than play the ace and another diamond, finishing one shy.

Some people registered multiple entries.Greensboro Volunteer Fire Company firefighter Rick Faust answered questions about the company's 1927 truck on display.Sitting atop the truck was a large stuffed Dalmatian.Four generations of the Robbins family of Greensboro registered six vehicles for the car show. They had just come from a family reunion and gathered under a tent.

They're ecstatic with the car turnout.\" No admission was charged, and Weaver said food truck operators and vendors set up for free as well and were not charged a percentage of their sales.\"Everybody had great respect for each other's space,\" Weaver said. \"Even the weather - you know car show people don't like rain, but nobody left. They all stuck it out.\" \"The car show was far more successful than we had anticipated for our first year,\" Kelledes wrote in a Sept. 12 email. \"We will obviously need a much larger area for all of the vehicles next year, which we will gladly accommodate.We will hold the event at the same location but the layout will be much different.\" The festivities concluded with an 8 p.m. fireworks display at the carnival grounds. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nGreensboro Volunteer Fire Company firefighter Rick Faust drives the company's 1927 truck at Greensboro's Musicfest and Car Show Sept. 9.\n \nCONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTrophies are lined up at the first car show accompanying Musicfest Sept. 9 in Greensboro.\n \nCONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nJoe Nadolny of Greensboro shows off his rare and luxurious 1997 Japanese-made Toyota Century.\n \nCONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nCathy Spencer, left, and Greensboro Town Commissioner David Spencer, right, and their grandson Zachary Braband volunteer at the third annual Musicfest and Car Show.\n \nCONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nVintage and newer vehicles attracted enthusiasts at Greensboro's Musicfest and Car Show Sept. 9\n \nCOURTESY TOWN OF GREENSBORO\n \nThis 1971 Chevy C-10 pickup owned by Gary Ingram of Lincoln, Delaware, wins the best in show trophy at the town of Greensboro's first car show.\n \nCOURTESY TOWN OF GREENSBORO\n \nGary Ingram, left, of Lincoln, Delaware, wins best in show for his 1971 Chevy C-10 pickup at the town of Greensboro's first car show.

Sunday, Sept. 24 is set aside for spectators and offers a day of grand classic motoring, lively music, and Eastern Shore cuisine and libations in a casually elegant waterfront setting.\"The Delahaye's aerodynamic curves and lines embrace elegance like no other,\" says St. Michaels Concours d'Elegance Chairman Luke L. Phipps. \"The world-renowned Audrain Auto Museum of Newport is entering a 1951 Delahaye, just one week before their own prestigious Concours & Motor Week. We feel extremely honored by their participation.\" Phipps says the 1951 Delahaye 135M remains in remarkable overall condition, including its very attractive two-tone gray finish, supple red leather interior with exquisite, burled wood trim, and whitewall tires.The Delahaye's 135, introduced in Paris in 1935, was a rare model that straddled both the pre-war and postwar eras. It boasted a brandnew chassis with the same 3.6-liter, six-cylinder engine first seen in the earlier Type 138, and it proved to be a remarkable automobile upon its release. The 135 proved to more than hold its own in competition, as it swept the top six places at Marseilles in 1936. In the following years, leading up to the beginning of the Second World War, the 135 further cemented its reputation, taking second place overall at Le Mans in 1937 and placing first, second, and fourth the following year.\"Even today, six decades after the final Delahaye was produced, the famous 135 series cars remain very highly regarded as some of the most compelling French automobiles ever produced,\" Phipps says.The invitational class of Corvettes includes six automobiles known on the racetracks at Le Mans, Sebring, and Daytona. The 1960 Corvette Briggs Cunningham Le Mans Racer #1 is a motorsports icon and will be on display at the event.The Corvette was personally driven by Briggs Cunningham and has been fully restored to its original 1960 Le Mans delivery. The 1960 Corvette Briggs Cunningham Le Mans Racer #3-the first Corvette to win 1st Class at the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1960, a title held for more than 40 years-will also be on display, along with a 1956 Corvette SR-2 Racer, the first General Motors purpose-built and sponsored Corvette Racer.Spectators can also take in the only 1962 Corvette and one of five straight axle Corvettes to compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The September/Turner Corvette was placed in the number one position, set by its 5.4-liter engine size. A 1966 Roger Penske Corvette Development L88 #9 will also be on display and is the only midyear Corvette with back-to-back wins in 1966 at Daytona, 24 Hours of Le Mans, and 12 Hours of Sebring. Wrapping up the invitational class is the 1968 Corvette L88 Rebel #4 Le Mans Racer, built by Toye English's Red team as the successor to the legendary \"Rebel.\" This Le Mans Racer completed the 1972 24 Hours of Le Mans and finished first in class and third overall at the 1973 24 Hours of Daytona.Phipps says and has been kept in pristine condition by the family since purchased new as a gift for the owner's Italian grandmother.An award ceremony takes place Sunday afternoon and includes a Chairman's Award recognizing one automobile in the Corvette Collector Car Park, with Corvette owners encouraged to attend the event and line the entrance of the Yacht Club.Vendor tents and live music wrap up the event.\"In addition to an array of exceptional award-winning motorcars, we'll showcase a number of luxury yachts dockside for the event,\" says Phipps. \"It's a grand day of celebrating motorsports, restoration excellence, all combined with Eastern Shore hospitality.\" Public day-trippers are encouraged to come by boat, with dockages for weekend transients also available at the Kent Island Yacht Club and Hyatt Place Marina. Slips are limited, with advanced reservations needed, with more by contacting info@smcde.org.Locally sourced cuisine and craft libations will be available for purchase from the Kent Island Yacht Club, find early-bird discounted tickets for Sept. 24 and more information about the event at www.smcde.org. \n \n Caption: ED BAUMGARTEN\n \nThis year Corvette's 70th anniversary is being celebrated with an invitational class of racing Corvettes sponsored by Cunningham Automotive at the St. Michaels Concours d'Elegance on Chesapeake Bay, including this 1968 Corvette L88 Rebel #4 Le Mans Racer, built by Toye English's Red team as the successor to the legendary \"Rebel.\" This Le Mans Racer completed the 1972 24 Hours of Le Mans and finished first in class and third overall at the 1973 24 Hours of Daytona.\n \nCOURTESY OF ST.

    "content": "Hidden talent: 'I Can See Your Voice' reveals more secret voices\n\n September 14, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Sarah Passingham | Page: 9A | Section: News \n \n 449\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n They say you can fake it 'til you make it, and there is nowhere that idiom is more true than on \"I Can See Your Voice.\" The musical mystery game show returns for its third season Tuesday, Sept. 19, on Fox, as host - and series creator - Ken Jeong (\"The Afterparty\") leads contestants through a series of guessing rounds centered around six talented lip-synchers.Among the \"secret voices\" are true vocalists and imposter songbirds who all perform on stage to stellar pre-recorded vocals, but only the real singers perform to their own backup track. If the contestant correctly identifies a genuine performer in the final round without hearing a single note, they're singing all the way home with the $100,000 grand prize. Whether the secret voices are retired vocalists, up-and-coming artists, hobbyist singers or just convincing fakes is only revealed once the contestant locks them in for elimination or their final selection.This season, Fox promises \"all-new theme nights,\" featuring duets between celebrity musicians and contestants' \"secret voices\" picks - for better or worse. The contestants don't know just how many of the six secret voices are good or bad singers, meaning that while each elimination round reveals the true voice of one of the lip-synchers, the contestants have no clue whether they're producing sweet music or a train wreck in the final duet performance.The duets ratchet up the nail-biting tension for the contestants, panelists, studio audience and musicians alike. Singer-songwriter and \"The Masked Singer\" winner, Jewel (You Were Meant For Me,\" 1995), made an appearance in the second season of \"I Can Hear Your Voice,\" and after having aided the night's contestant from the panel, she herself was nervous to hear if the secret voice really had pipes when they took the stage together.Luckily the secret voice was hiding a true talent for crooning.Contestants on \"I Can See Your Voice\" have limited information on the secret voices - they are defined solely by their occupation - leaving the lip-synchs as the most credible evidence of performance prowess.Throughout the elimination rounds, contestants get help from a panel of celebs anchored by Adrienne Bailon-Houghton (\"The Real\") and Cheryl Hines (\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\") with a rotating chair of guest judges and featured musical artists.In addition to the panel, contestants have the opportunity to use the \"golden mic\" (an impression from a celebrity offscreen about the lip-synch performances), a look into a day in the life of one of the secret voices, a testimonial from a secret voice's biggest fan and a peek into the secret voice's home.Not every clue is a helping hand, however, as the tools at the contestants' disposal are filled with both genuine hints as well as red herrings. \n \n Caption: Ken Jeong from \"I Can See Your Voice\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Oscar winner (for \"Les Miserables\") got her big break in \"Get Real,\" a Fox series that aired during the 1999-2000 season. The seriocomic show about a dysfunctional family also was the first major credit for Jesse Eisenberg (\"The Social Network\"), who played Hathaway's younger brother; Eric Christian Olsen, later of \"NCIS: Los Angeles,\" also portrayed one of the show's three siblings.Though the series lasted only that one season, it didn't take long for Hathaway's movie career to get going. \"The Princess Diaries\" was a big hit in 2001, and though its filming meant Hathaway had to miss her first semester of college, she said later that she didn't mind. Director Garry Marshall had thought of Liv Tyler for the part, but his granddaughters weighed in and convinced him to opt for Hathaway instead, and the picture earned her an MTV Movie Award.Returns were mixed on her movies that followed immediately, including \"Nicholas Nickleby\" and \"Ella Enchanted,\" but she sampled another medium by putting her singing talents to work in a 2002 New York staging of \"Carnival.\" She eventually got back on the box-office track with the 2004 sequel \"The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement\" and moved from that into a variety of screen projects encompassing \"Brokeback Mountain\" and \"The Devil Wears Prada.\" Hathaway has returned to TV on occasion, as a host of \"Saturday Night Live\" and the Oscars, and she also appeared in the streaming projects \"Modern Love\" and \"WeCrashed\" (serving as an executive producer of the latter as well). Additionally, her voice has been heard in episodes of \"The Simpsons\" and \"Family Guy.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It showed slam interest, spade support and a singleton (or void) in clubs. It was a debatable choice, a splinter with a singleton ace rarely being right, and North had such bad trumps. With nothing wasted in clubs, South wasn't willing to stop short of six.Actually, it isn't the world's worst slam, because of the secondary diamond fit, but South's declarer-play wasn't up to the task.After winning the first trick with dummy's club ace, declarer played a trump.When East's king appeared, South smiled. He won with his ace and cashed the queen, but East discarded a club.Still alive, South ruffed a club in the dummy, played a diamond to his queen and ruffed his last club. Now if he could have just found West with four diamonds, South could have discarded the heart jack and queen before West ruffed in. However, when East followed to the second diamond, South took his best chance, attempting the heart finesse. It lost, and West scored two major-suit tricks.There was a simple way to get home - if South had thought of it. When East played the spade king, South should have ducked. Suppose East switched to a heart. South could have won with the ace, ruffed his two low clubs in the dummy, drawn trumps and run the diamonds. His 12 tricks would have been three spades, one heart, five diamonds, one club and those two club ruffs.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's happy music, in spite of (like most American folk music) having lyrics of gloom and doom, jail and jealousy and unrequited love.The bands that are paid to play at these events are mostly local. They usually consist of banjo, violin, mandolin, guitar(s), bass and sometimes Dobro and other specialty instruments.There is excellent voice harmony, and the words can actually be heard and understood. The unpaid groups, the \"kitchen pickers\" who play a set in between the pro groups' sets just for fun, are really good too and vary from month to month. The sound system is good and well controlled.These concerts are held in Denton at the American Legion, 9238 Legion Road from 1-4 p.m. on second Sundays. The cost of admission is $15, and a season pass can be purchased.You can even use your credit card. Food and beverages of all kinds are available for purchase.During these difficult and challenging times it's good to know that, at least one Sunday afternoon each month, we can get together with families and friends for some real joy.There are several ways to see the schedule for the Denton concerts: Eastern Shore Bluegrass Association on Facebook and by website: easternshorebluegrass.org. Other events are scheduled at other venues by ESBA. Staying well and happy is easy when music is available.VICKI SPARKSFishing Creek \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "A night of noir: TCM salutes the genre\n\n September 14, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: 12A | Section: News \n \n 318\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Turner Classic Movies certainly knows noir, and as extra proof, it's offering a whole night of the genre.Eddie Muller has proven himself a king of noir by presenting moody-melodrama classics on his \"Noir Alley\" series twice each weekend, and the channel is expanding on that approach with a special evening of film noir from the 1950s starting the evening Tuesday, Sept. 19 (with Alicia Malone hosting) and running until early the following morning. Typically, noir pictures rely on stories of tough men (and, in many instances, tough women as well) informed by gritty storytelling and distinctively shadowy cinematography, and the five titles chosen for the festival are quite representative.First up is director Otto Preminger's \"Angel Face\" (1953), with the made-for-noir Robert Mitchum as an ambulance driver who has big doubts about an overly attentive heiress (Jean Simmons) who ropes him into marriage after possibly having been responsible for the car accident that killed her father and stepmother - a tragedy in which both of the new spouses are implicated. Known largely for comedy in later years, Jim Backus (\"Gilligan's Island\") plays the prosecuting attorney.Mitchum returns in the next attraction, the well-reputed \"The Night of the Hunter\" (1955), casting him as a murderer who impersonates a clergyman to find out from a widow (Shelley Winters) and her children (Billy Chapin, Sally Jane Bruce) where her husband - the killer's former prison cellmate - hid the take from a bank robbery. The only movie directed by actor Charles Laughton, the picture has a James Agee screenplay adapted from Davis Grubb's novel.Next comes \"Elevator to the Gallows\" (1958), French filmmaker Louis Malle's drama that literally takes place largely in an elevator, where two lovers (played by Jeanne Moreau and Maurice Ronet) become trapped after conspiring in the murder of the woman's husband who also was the man's boss. The very notable music score is by Miles Davis \n \n Caption: Gloria Grahame and Humphrey Bogart in \"In a Lonely Place \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That is even more exciting because it plays right into the spookiness of all of it.\" Returning alongside Bennett are some of the series' fan-favorite, classic components, including pumpkin carving, cake decorating and sugar blowing - but be prepared for shocks galore, as this unlucky season promises some new and exciting surprises along the way.The series' first three episodes act as the \"Halloween Wars\" qualifying rounds, with Bennett asking the teams to complete a series of increasingly difficult tasks, including the \"Monster Mashup,\" where each group must choose two of the scariest monsters imaginable and meld both into one ghastly creation; a round based on the 1973 classic film, \"The Exorcist;\" and a fairy talebased challenge that just may lead to one team's \"happily ever after,\" as this season's judges - Aarti Sequeira (Season 6 winner of \"Food Network Star\") and Shinmin Li (\"Holiday Wars\") - eliminate one bunch of bakers, carvers and confectioners each round.Following episodes will be split into two challenges: the \"Small Scare,\" where teams have 45 minutes to complete an edible interpretation of a spooky theme, and the \"Spine Chiller,\" where the time limit is extended to five hours, allowing for ultimate creativity.Keeping to theme for this 13th season, this year's teams feature some of the show's spookiest puns yet, with names like Team Sweet Screams, Pumpkins Up the Volume, Snax Sabbath, Spice Ghouls, Pumpkin Posse, Trick or Sweet and more, with each team hopeful to prove their deliciously deadly talent in the kitchen and win the final, $50,000 grand prize.Season 13 of \"Halloween Wars\" begins Sunday, Sept. 17, on Food Network. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Matthew Broderick voices Simba, a lion who wants to succeed his father Mustafa (who has the unmistakable sound of James Earl Jones) as their pride's ruler but Mustafa's scheming brother Scar (voice of Jeremy Irons) has other ideas. The Oscar-winning score includes \"Circle of Life,\" \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" and \"Hakuna Matata.\" \"The Big Bang Theory\" (TBS, Wednesday, Sept. 20): It was no small accomplishment for this sitcom to land Stephen Hawking as a guest, which it did in Season 5 with \"The Hawking Excitation.\" The scientific genius figures into a story that sees complications arise among Howard (Simon Helberg) and his pals as a lecture by Hawking at Caltech nears.\"The Birds\" (Turner Classic Movies, Thursday, Sept. 21): A rare instance of Alfred Hitchcock relying on villains who aren't human, this hugely effective 1963 thriller - presented here as part of a night of movies set in the San Francisco area - turns our feathered friends into attacking enemies, with electronic sounds enhancing the terror as they descend upon an otherwise quiet village's population.Tippi Hedren, in her first film (and her first with director Hitchcock), plays a visitor whose stay becomes memorable for the wrong reasons; Rod Taylor, Suzanne Pleshette and Jessica Tandy also star. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Being shown on MGM+ Hits on Friday, Sept. 22, writer-director James L. Brooks' 1987 comedy-drama comes from a world he already knew, having co-created the TV newsroom of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\" However, he fortified his effort by landing an adviser in CBS News veteran Susan Zirinsky, a veteran CBS News producer who's now the chief of that entire division.She's also the inspiration for one of the story's chief characters Jane Craig, a driven producer in a network bureau in Washington, D.C. The role made Holly Hunter a star, and perfect opposite her is William Hurt is cast as charismatic Tom Grunick, a newly hired reporter whose admission of not fully understanding the job repulses Jane, though she also can't deny her attraction to him. Albert Brooks completes the tale's romantic triangle as Aaron Altman, a correspondent who's more than capable at his job, though he lacks star quality. This is a film that remains enjoyable to watch time and again. \n \n Caption: William Hunt in \"Broadcast News\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

South played the spade two: nine, king, three.Declarer called for dummy's spade four. When East discarded a low diamond, South put in the seven. West won with the jack, cashed the spade ace and led his last spade. Now South had 10 tricks: two spades, one heart, five diamonds and two clubs.How many times did the pendulum swing?First, any minor-suit opening lead from West would have put his side in control.Second, looking at those strong diamonds in the dummy, East should win trick one with the heart ace and return the heart 10. Now South must play the trump suit to avoid losing three tricks there.After taking the second trick with dummy's spade king, South should abandon trumps. By playing three rounds of diamonds and discarding the heart nine, declarer keeps the contract under control. He will lose only three trump tricks.After winning with the spade jack at trick three, West missed a difficult chance to defeat the contract. If he had guessed what had happened at trick one, he would have led the heart queen, pinning South's nine.

South rebid three no-trump because he saw nine tricks. Maybe North should have passed, but because he had a ruffing value in diamonds, he went with the known major-suit fit.South won with his heart ace, cashed the spade ace and played a low spade to dummy's nine. Now he led a diamond to his jack.However, West won with the queen and returned his last trump. In dummy with the jack, South played a diamond to his king, but West won with the ace and cashed a diamond and a heart to defeat the contract.\"Did you see how unlucky I was, partner?

He also refrained from pointing out that if South leads a diamond from his hand at trick two, he guarantees a diamond ruff in the dummy - the shorter trump hand - for his 10th trick. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We know when solar eclipses will occur for centuries into the future. I even have a chart for learning on which day any date from 1700 to 2499 has fallen or will fall. Of course, the internet has made everything so much easier.Imagine how much better prepared today's senior citizens would have been if they could have enjoyed such easy access to data when they were teenagers.Today's deal is a rarity. It was declared by two robots and one human. All three went down. Against six spades, West leads the heart king.Declarer ruffs and cashes the spade ace, but East discards a heart. How should South continue?Looking at the North-South hands, you would like to be in seven spades, needing only trumps 2-1. However, how do you find out that North has three trumps and that perfect club holding?In the given auction, three clubs was a double negative, showing some 0-3 points.Both robots drew trumps before playing three rounds of diamonds. East happily took two diamond tricks: down one.The human, after East discarded at trick two, played three rounds of diamonds.East, though, won and led his last diamond, which West ruffed with the spade jack: down one.South should cash the club ace and king at tricks three and four. Then he leads a low spade from hand, voluntarily sacrificing a trick. South can draw trumps ending on the board and discard his diamond losers on the club queen and jack.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Copycats began selling tees without contravening the patent, which had been written too imprecisely.In bridge, if you stroke the cards as recommended by the textbooks, normally you will hit down the middle, but sometimes you will slice or hook badly. East made a good shot on today's deal, but South got his ball into the cup first.Against three no-trump, West led the spade six: three, queen, four. With two spades left, it would be normal for East to return his higher card. But East realized that if he led the 10 and South had the singleton jack left, South would get two spade tricks.So East returned the spade five.The declarer, Jose Le Dentu, who was one of France's top player-writers, could have blocked the spade suit by winning trick two with dummy's ace over West's king. However, not knowing who held the 10, he ducked.After winning the third trick with dummy's spade ace, Le Dentu led a club, winning with his ace when East played low. Back to dummy with a heart, Le Dentu led another club through East. If East had played the queen, declarer would have ducked. When East played low, South won with the king and led a third club. Le Dentu had established nine tricks without letting West gain the lead to cash his two spade winners.South's play avoided the bunkers. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

First is director Frank Capra's \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939), starring James Stewart as a newly appointed U.S. senator who finds many of his peers opposed to his idealism. Then comes \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955), which helped build James Dean's iconic screen image through his portrayal of a deeply troubled teen.Dreyfuss is sure to relate themes from those pictures to his own work choices, and the Academy Award recipient (for 1977's \"The Goodbye Girl\") has enjoyed quite a varied career that has spanned genres from love stories to science fiction. It's interesting to consider what might have happened for him (or not) had filmmaker George Lucas not chosen him for the part of cynically observational teen Curt in \"American Graffiti\" (1973). Though he made \"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz\" (1974) next, his subsequent role was shark expert Matt Hooper in \"Jaws\" and virtually anyone who even has heard the word \"movie\" knows what happened with that. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "The 'Continental' Experience: John Wick Franchise Gets Three-Night Tv Stay\n\n September 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 428\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For many of us, when we book a stay in a hotel (particularly a luxury one), comfort ranks above all else. Though the meaning of the word \"comfort\" varies from one person to the next and could encompass anything from the thread count of the bedsheets to one's proximity to the bar, \"comfort\" in the world of John Wick is most closely associated with personal safety.Those familiar with the John Wick franchise will already be aware of The Continental's most important rule: the assassins seeking refuge within the hotel shall not conduct any \"business\" on the grounds.Put simply, no hits will be tolerated on the premises.That said, NBC/Peacock is certainly hoping for a hit of its own (granted, a \"hit\" of a different kind) when the new miniseries \"The Continental: From the World of John Wick\" begins streaming Friday, Sept.22, on Peacock.John Wick (Keanu Reeves, \"The Matrix,\" 1999), the trained assassin who lends his name to the franchise supported by The Continental Hotel, first made audiences fall in love with him in the 2014 film, simply titled \"John Wick.\" Despite his former career as a hitman, Wick exhibits a soft side while taking care of a new beagle puppy in the wake of his wife's death. However, when a group of gangsters breaks into Wick's home and the puppy is targeted, Wick loses all sensitivity and comes out of retirement to avenge his furry friend. And while Wick's situation may change from film to film, one thing that remains a constant throughout the franchise is The Continental; and this is where Peacock's newest series comes in.Created by Greg Coolidge (\"Ride Along,\" 2014), Shawn Simmons (\"Wayne\") and Kirk Ward (\"The Turkey Bowl,\" 2019), \"The Continental: From the World of John Wick\" is a three-part noir-action miniseries that focuses on the history of the mysterious hotel chain that operates as \"neutral territory for members of the criminal underworld\" (per IMDb).Colin Woodell (\"The Flight Attendant\") stars as a young Winston Scott, the manager of The Continental's New York division and a character already known to franchise fans thanks to the work of \"Deadwood\" actor Ian McShane. The role of Winston is a meaty one for Woodell, filled with lots of backstory for both character and setting as the series' events dive deep into real-life New York crime history.While the specifics of the miniseries are being kept a secret for obvious reasons, there has been word that the events take place over three nights at The Continental in the 1970s and that there is a correlation to both the Winter of Discontent and the rise of the American Mafia. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

New episodes premiere Monday, Sept.25, on Fox.The network is no stranger to Ramsay's distinct - now practically trademarked - in-your-face, abrupt and (sometimes) devastatingly honest critiques, as Fox is currently home to four other shows hosted by the celebrity chef: \"Next Level Chef,\" \"MasterChef,\" \"MasterChef Jr.\" and \"Hell's Kitchen,\" which is slated to return with its 22nd season - dubbed \"Hell's Kitchen: American Dream\" - on Thursday, Sept. 28 (also on Fox).His most popular (and perhaps most quoted) series - \"Kitchen Nightmares\" - first aired in the U.K. as \"Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares\" before making its debut on Fox in 2007.The series ran for nearly 100 episodes before concluding in 2014, much to viewers' dismay.Later, in 2017, Ramsay told the Daily News: \"Yes, it was wrong to pull my own show off air. The biggest demand over the last four years is for 'Kitchen Nightmares' (to come back).\"Hungry fans have been waiting since then for word of the show's potential return.Now, with Season 8 around the corner, Fox has shared an updated synopsis for the series: \"Chef Gordon Ramsay hits the road to help struggling restaurants all over the United States turn their luck around. Ramsay examines the problems each establishment faces, from unsanitary refrigerators to lazy or inexperienced staff, and searches for resolutions. With help from his team, Ramsay redecorates each eatery to give it a fresh new look and updates the menu as needed.Ramsay's ultimate goal is to make the restaurants he visits popular and profitable, but it's up to the restaurateurs to take his advice and turn their business nightmare into the American dream.\"In each episode, Ramsay gives himself, restaurant owners and the rest of their team one week to turn their failing restaurant into spick-and-span, neatly operating (and with any luck, delicious) businesses.Originally produced by ITV Studios (now known as ITV America), the series will now be produced by Gordon's very own Studio Ramsay Global - and the more Gordon Ramsay, the better. With more insults, code violations and stomach-churning dishes, \"Kitchen Nightmares\" returns to Fox, Monday, Sept. 25. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I thought I read that she is related to someone famous. Is that true?A: It is, and on two counts, given who her parents were. Her mother, Phyllis George - a former Miss America - is widely remembered as a trailblazer among national television sportscasters, and she gave birth to Pamela in 1983 while serving as one of the regulars on the CBS pregame show \"The NFLToday.\"Brown's father, John Y. Brown Jr., was the governor of Kentucky from 1979 to 1983 and he also was a pro-basketball-team owner and an owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken who bought the latter company from Colonel Harland Sanders.Brown now has a weekday-afternoon program on CNN, \"The Bulletin With Pamela Brown,\" the latest step in her career with the cable news network where she began working in 2013. Before that, she had been an anchor-reporter at WJLA-TV in Washington, D.C.During her CNN tenure, Brown also has been a senior Washington correspondent and senior White House correspondent, plus a \"CNN Newsroom\" weekend anchor and a fill-in anchor on \"The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer\" and \"Erin Burnett OutFront\"; she has been Emmy-nominated on a number of occasions.Brown recently earned a Master of Studies in Law degree from George Washington University, and she and her husband have a son and a daughter. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

TNT runs the eighth-and-last-season premiere episode of the sibling-witch saga (titled \"Still Charmed & Kicking\") Friday, Sept. 29, with Phoebe, Piper and Paige (played by Alyssa Milano, Holly Marie Combs and Rose McGowan) presumed to be deceased which is not the case.They hope that being free of any expectations from others will allow them to reboot their lives, but that wish crumbles fairly quickly, as Paige has to help another sorceress (Cuoco) who has gotten herself into trouble while on a quest to locate her own missing sister.

He hooks many helium balloons onto his house, making it an airborne vehicle - with an extra passenger aboard, a youngster (voice of Jordan Nagai) trying to earn a scout badge for helping elderly people. Christopher Plummer also is heard.\"Serpico\" (MGM+, Friday, Sept. 29): Al Pacino is superb in director Sidney Lumet's 1973 drama, the true story of New York police detective Frank Serpico, who made himself a marked man with many in his department through his exposure of some other cops' corrupt practices. As is traditional with Lumet films set in the Big Apple, the atmosphere of the city itself is a star of the film, but nothing else here overshadows Pacino's Oscar-nominated performance. The cast also includes Tony Roberts, John Randolph and Cornelia Sharpe.\"A Christmas Story\" (Turner Classic Movies, Friday, Sept. 29): It's unusual to see this 1983 favorite of many viewers this far ahead of the yuletide, but it's part of a \"Remembering Childhood\" theme evening here. Of course, the principal child in question is Ralphie (Peter Billingsley), writer Jean Shepherd's surrogate who wants nothing more than to receive a Red Ryder air rifle as a holiday gift - which earns him the warning from almost everyone around him, \"You'll shoot your eye out!\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In contrast, if you are trying to establish your suit, you might duck an early trick to keep communication with your partner - but not always.Defending against three notrump, West led the spade ace. With the queen in the dummy, attitude was known.So East dropped the two, showing an odd number of spades. Since from the bidding this had to be three, West continued with a low spade, giving declarer the trick he was bound to win and keeping communication with his partner. However, South made West pay.Declarer cashed dummy's diamond ace and played a diamond to his king. West's heart discard was a blow, but not lethal. South played off his three club winners before leading a diamond to dummy's queen. West discarded a second heart.Deciding West hadn't started with 5=3=1=4 shape and the heart king, which would now be bare, declarer exited with dummy's spade queen.West won with the king and cashed two more spade tricks, but then he had to lead away from the heart king, giving South his eighth and ninth tricks.If only West had played three rounds of spades at the beginning, the contract would have been defeated.Holding the heart king as an entry, this defense was leakproof.The vessel that leaks from the top, as pointed out by late journalist James Reston, is the government. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

To many people, it is working on a stock-exchange floor. A lot of North American bridge experts have made their living trading options.The Oxford American Dictionary gives four definitions. The illustrative phrases are \"None of the options is satisfactory,\" \"Had no option but to go,\" \"We have ten days' option on the house\" and \"Keep one's options open.\"At the bridge table, three of these may apply. You hope never to face only unsatisfactory options; sometimes you have no option but to adopt one line of play or defense; and ideally you can keep your options open while you learn more about the deal.How many options did East give himself in today's deal? Defending against four hearts, West led the spade 10: two, jack, five. East cashed the spade king: eight, seven, queen. East continued with the spade nine, but South claimed an overtrick. He ruffed in the dummy, drew trumps, cashed the diamond ace, overtook his diamond jack with dummy's queen and discarded his club losers on dummy's two diamond winners.Did East misguess or misdefend?East was a little unlucky that West couldn't overruff dummy's heart nine. Even so, East should have used his eggs to make two omelets, not one. At trick three, he should have cashed the club ace. If West had discouraged, East would have returned a spade. Here, though, West would have encouraged with the club seven, so East would have known to play a second club to defeat the contract.Keep as many defensive options open as possible.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Sorry for the inconvenience.\" In bridge, too, there may be signposts. The hard part is first realizing the signpost is there and then reading it correctly to find the right play.After South opened with an artificial and forcing two clubs, North gave the negative response. The rest of the auction was natural.Declarer won West's spade queen lead with his king and led the heart king: nine, three, four. South continued with the heart queen: two, five, seven. Annoying! If only an opponent had won with the ace, the contract would have been easy.Next, South cashed three diamond tricks, overtaking his queen with dummy's king on the second round.West discarded the club five on the third round.To an innocent bystander, it appeared that South would now try the club finesse for his ninth trick. However, South paused to work out the distribution. From his echo in hearts, it seemed that West had started with a doubleton. (He was very unlikely to echo when holding three low hearts.) If so, West would have length in clubs - and be ripe for an endplay. South played a spade to his ace and exited with the spade nine.West took three spade tricks but then had to lead away from the club king into South's ace-queen tenace.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Any ideas?If you watch bridge players, most properly place their cards onto the table without noticeable mannerisms. However, when something unwelcome has happened, a few play their cards with excessive emphasis. Also, there are those who like to spin the cards onto the table. In today's deal, a spinner was sitting West.Although his point-count was low, South jumped straight to game because he had only five losers (two hearts and three diamonds--you never count more than three losers in a single suit).West spun out the spade queen: three, two (discouraging), ace. Now South led the diamond three.It was clear to West that declarer was trying to engineer a diamond ruff or two in the dummy. If so, it would probably be beneficial for the defenders to lead trumps. Still, perhaps East didn't have a heart holding that could be safely led away from. So, in an excellent effort to guarantee winning trick two, West spun the diamond jack onto the table. (If West plays a lower diamond, the contract makes.) After winning the trick, West switched to his singleton trump.Whichever way South turned now, he was doomed to defeat. Actually, he finessed in hearts, so East won with the king and returned another trump.Then, when East regained the lead with the diamond queen, he led a third trump.South finished with only his nine top tricks.The Earth will stop spinning in millions of years, after the sun has exploded. However, one wag suggested it would stop spinning \"usually about five hours after one has stopped drinking.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Her first big credit was the 2002-05 NBC series \"American Dreams,\" inspired by the legendary music show \"American Bandstand\" and featuring Boston as Beth, who became the sister-in-law of \"Bandstand\" dancer Beth (Brittany Snow).Boston went on to do guest shots on many series including \"NCIS,\" \"Crossing Jordan,\" \"Las Vegas,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" \"ER\" and \"Castle.\" She landed continuing roles on \"In Plain Sight\" and \"Witches of East End,\" and in 2014, she began what has become her long association with the Hallmark brand, which started with the movie \"A Ring by Spring\" (still repeated fairly often).The Christmas season has yielded a particular amount of work for Boston, who has worked again for Hallmark in \"Ice Sculpture Christmas,\" \"Christmas in Angel Falls,\" \"Check Inn to Christmas,\" \"The Christmas Carousel\" and \"A Christmas Cookie Catastrophe.\" \"Stop the Wedding,\" \"The Last Bridesmaid\" and \"Dating the Delaneys\" have been among Boston's other Hallmark projects; she also has made films for Lifetime occasionally.Additionally, Boston has had a recurring role on \"SEAL Team\" that enabled her to keep working while she was in later stages of her pregnancy, since her character on the series - Hannah Oliver - also was expecting, with high-school friend and Bravo Team member Sonny Quinn (A.J.Buckley) the father of her child. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

For example, I have seen many road signs claiming \"Slow Children Playing.\" Presumably the quick children are at home studying. Also open to misinterpretation was this sign in Northern Ireland: \"If you find the service in this cafe unsatisfactory, you should see Mr. Wilson the manager.\" The correct play in today's deal should be crystal clear to an expert.After a straightforward auction to four hearts, West leads the club king. How should South plan the play?Declarer has nine top tricks: six hearts, two diamonds and one club. If East has the spade ace, everything will be smooth sailing, but is that likely? West made a two-level vulnerable overcall.Surely he has the spade ace.The next thought is to play three rounds of diamonds, hoping both that they break 3-3 and that West has to win the third round. That is a faint hope against defenders with any acumen.The only way to benefit from a 3-3 diamond break is not to lose a diamond trick. South achieved this by calmly playing low from the dummy at trick one.South won the second trick with dummy's club ace, discarding a low diamond from his hand. He then cashed two top trumps in hand. Declarer continued with the diamond ace, a diamond to the king and a diamond ruff. When they split 3-3, South played a heart to dummy's jack and discarded a spade loser on the 13th diamond.After congratulating South on his play, West commented, \"Sorry, partner. Next time I'll lead fourth-highest from my longest and strongest.\" ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That's actually putting it mildly, but things eventually warm up between them after a long series of fits and starts.Dreyfuss won an Academy Award for his performance, capitalizing on the screen persona he had made known through his successes in \"American Graffiti\" and \"Jaws,\" and he has considerable fun spoofing the acting profession as his character appears in a show-within-the-show. Also a vital cast member is Quinn Cummings as Mason's wiser-thanher-years young daughter. The hit theme song is performed by David Gates, who was a member of the pop group Bread. \n \n Caption: Marsha Mason and Richard Dreyfuss in \"The Goodbye Girl\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Though the festival usually will be only at night - stretching into early Thursday mornings - the opening day takes a page from TCM's annual \"Summer Under the Stars\" playbook by presenting a full 24 hours (technically, 25-1/2) of his features, moving back and forth between sections of his career.The first attraction is a later Heston project, a television version of \"Treasure Island\" (1990), adapted and directed by his son Fraser and casting the elder Heston as pirate Long John Silver. That's followed by two more classic stories, \"The Three Musketeers\" (1973) and \"The Four Musketeers\" (1975), with Heston as Cardinal Richelieu. After those comes \"Counterpoint\" (1967), with Heston as a World War II-era orchestra conductor who stages concerts for his Nazi captors.Then, several epics carry most of the rest of the Heston tribute's first day.\"The Big Country\" (1958) is a William Wyler-directed Western also starring Gregory Peck and (in an Oscar-winning performance) Burl Ives; Sam Peckinpah's \"Major Dundee\" (1965) casts Heston as a renegade Civil War officer; Wyler's legendary \"Ben-Hur\" (1959), which earned Heston one of its 11 Academy Awards, presents him in a famous chariot race; and \"Khartoum\" (1966) offers him as a military general sent to free soldiers and civilians in Sudan.\"The War Lord\" (1965) and \"55 Days at Peking\" (1963) wrap up the historical-drama theme of the Heston showcase's Day One, but there's much more of him to come in the subsequent weeks, some of it relatively contemporary.Examples include director and co-star Orson Welles' well-reputed 1958 melodrama \"Touch of Evil\" (Oct. 11); \"Soylent Green,\" (Oct. 25), the 1973 sci-fi drama with Heston as a policeman of the overpopulated then-future - 2022! - who learns a terrible secret; and the 1971 thriller \"The Omega Man\" (Oct. 25), with Heston as one of the last human survivors in a society ruled by virus-afflicted zombies. \n \n Caption: Charlton Heston in \"Ben Hur\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Missing no more: Procedural drama takes sinister turn in 'Found'\n\n September 28, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dana Simpson | Page: A9 | Section: News \n \n 462\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n According to NamUS's October 2022 report, in the United States, approximately 600,000 people are reported as missing annually - no doubt a much higher number than many of us might expect.As true crime aficionados and law enforcement can likely attest, only a fraction of these missing people are ever found, and with each passing hour, their cases become more and more dire. Thankfully, there are a handful of people in the world who are equipped with the skills and knowledge to help, and one such person - on screen, at least - is Gabi Mosely, the leading character in NBC's newest procedural drama \"Found,\" premiering Tuesday, Oct. 3, and streaming the following day on Peacock.Played by \"Shameless\" star Shanola Hampton, Gabi is a hard-working, determined public relations expert who specializes in finding Americans who have been reported as missing. As she leads a team of professionals in their shared noble work, Gabi does her best to parse her own past as a missing person. That said, Gabi's methods for dealing with her demons could arguably use a bit of work.As viewers quickly learn, Gabi has turned the proverbial tables on her former captor and has taken him hostage for a change - not exactly legal, but certainly satisfying. Now, despite her outwardly calm and put-together exterior, Gabi must hide the fact that she has a man, known only as \"Sir\" (played by \"Saved by the Bell's\" Mark-Paul Gosselaar), tied up in her very own basement while she seeks justice for the remainder of the missing Americans on the register.To make matters even more intriguing, Gabi has a plan for Sir.Convinced that, as a former abductor himself, Sir knows the ins and outs of the criminal psyche and its various resulting behaviors, Gabi enlists his help as a consultant. With each new case she brings home, Sir is forced to help her find the victims of these heinous abductions and turn the kidnappers over to the authorities for investigation, (hopefully) a guilty verdict and sentencing.While \"Found\" was originally scheduled for a Feb. 19 premiere this year, NBC announced the show's postponement in mid-January, believing it to be better suited to an autumn release.\"After watching the first few episodes of 'Found,' it quickly became clear that our love for this show has continued to grow and grow with each step of the process,\" Susan Rovner, chairman of entertainment content for NBC Universal television and streaming, said in a January news release.\"Our goal is always to find the absolute best home for all our series, and it's particularly the case with one as important as this,\" Rovner continued. \"By moving it to fall, we're able to better leverage our resources, including lead-in and marketing muscle, enabling us to launch 'Found' to the largest possible audience across all our platforms.\" \n \n Caption: Shanola Hampton in \"Found\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Truman said, \"I have found the best way to give advice to your children is to find out what they want and then advise them to do it.\"This deal isn't child's play. South and West must pay close attention to the spot cards. If everyone plays perfectly, what is the result in six spades doubled after West leads a top heart?South ruffed the opening lead low and cashed the spade ace. He wasn't surprised when East discarded the club ace. Now South led the spade seven and finessed dummy's nine. Next came a successful diamond finesse. South cashed the spade king, led his last spade to dummy's queen and finessed again in diamonds. He cashed the diamond ace, then announced he would run the rest of the diamonds before conceding a club at trick 13. Six spades doubled and made, but how many errors were committed?The answer is two. West's error was easier to avoid. When declarer led the spade seven at trick three, West should have put in the jack. He knew declarer was left with the K-10-7 of spades. So, by inserting the jack, he could reduce the dummy's entries to one. South would be unable to bring in the diamond suit without loss and would go down.However, declarer could avoid this fate. Just in case West had all four spades, South should have ruffed the opening lead with the spade 10. Then, after cashing the spade ace, he would retain the K-7-3 of spades. West would be unable to stop two dummy entries.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I'm in three no-trump, and you're in the recycling bin if you don't win at least nine tricks.\"However, if they can only see their companions in your hand, it won't help much. True, maybe they will watch more closely than your partner and be able to remind him when a card is high.If talking to the cards appeals to you, get a copy of the entertaining book \"Right Through the Pack\" by Robert Darvas and Norman de Villiers Hart. It contains 52 tales, each told by a different card. The play in today's deal is narrated by East's spade jack.Against South's contract of three no-trump, West leads the heart five: eight, queen, king. Do you see how the spade jack might play a pivotal role?South did well not to bid three spades over two notrump, as the spade game would surely fail.With the heart suit wide open, South couldn't afford to lose the lead. He also knew it was better to risk one diamond finesse than two spade finesses. As you can see, East does have the diamond king. So South played a spade to dummy's ace and took the winning diamond finesse for nine easy tricks, right? Not quite! East, guessing this was the position, smoothly dropped the spade king under dummy's ace! Suddenly the situation had changed. Taking the spade king at face value, South played a club to his ace and ran the spade nine. However, East produced the jack and returned his last heart: down two.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You should retain some flexibility in your thinking, though. Maybe you saw someone having an off day. Perhaps he had had a tough time in the office or at home. In today's deal, North's two diamonds was a cue-bid raise, showing a maximum pass with three-card support. (He would have advanced with two no-trump holding four or more spades.)With a rounded-suit lead, the defenders could have taken the first four tricks, but, following his partner's thin opening bid in diamonds, West understandably led that suit.South won East's diamond queen with his king and immediately drew two rounds of trumps. He could no longer make the contract. The simplest line is to cash the spade ace at trick two, play a diamond to dummy's ace, return to hand with a trump (\"Whew -- they're 2-2\") and discard one of dummy's club losers on the diamond jack. The later club ruff in the dummy will be South's 10 th trick.Was South a beginner? Far from it. He was playing in the final of the 1992 World Team Olympiad.Colette recommended: \"You will do foolish things, but do them with enthusiasm.\" However, this declarer wasn't too enthusiastic about his mistake. His only consolation was that his error cost less than it might have. His teammates, sitting East-West at the other table, had climbed to the Everestine heights of five diamonds. South had been happy to double, and the contract went down five, costing 1,100.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

South cashed his spade king before leading a low club, scooping up West's singleton king with dummy's ace. Now declarer exited from the dummy with the diamond ace and another diamond. After winning with his king, East continued with a diamond to his partner's queen. Endplayed, West exited with a spade. Declarer ruffed in the dummy, discarded his club loser and conceded three tricks: one heart and two diamonds.The errors? First, East should have played the diamond jack, not the king, at trick seven. Second, West should have dropped the diamond queen under his partner's king. East wouldn't have risen with the king unless holding the jack as well. In both cases, West could have received two club ruffs to defeat the contract.Last, South should have exited from the dummy with a low diamond, not with the ace and another. If East wins and gives his partner a club ruff, South wins West's diamond exit with dummy's ace, draws the last trump and concedes a second diamond trick. If instead the defenders persist with diamonds, declarer wins with dummy's ace and plays a third round, endplaying whoever wins the trick. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "celebrity update - Wayne Brady OF LET'S MAKE A DEAL ON CBS\n\n October 5, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: 10A | Section: News \n \n 288\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Q: How long has Wayne Brady been hosting \"Let's Make a Deal\"?A: Ever since CBS' current daytime version began in 2009. Its premiere there made it a rare series to run on three different broadcast networks, since the original show - hosted by Monty Hall, also (along with business partner Stefan Hatos) a creator and producer of it - ran on NBC from 1963 to 1966, then moved to ABC, where it continued until 1976.There also were other editions before the Brady-hosted revival premiered, with NBC attempting it again twice, in daytime with Bob Hilton and (very briefly) in prime time with Bush.Brady has earned two of his five Emmy Awards for his work on \"Let's Make a Deal,\" and by the time he started that job, the idea of comedians becoming gameshow hosts had been accepted. Among examples, Drew Carey assumed the hosting spot on \"The Price Is Right\" in 2007, and Louie Anderson had guided \"Family Feud\" from 1999 to 2002 (Steve Harvey started in the latter show in 2010).In interviews, Brady has maintained that he never wanted to be just one thing in the entertainment world not exclusively an actor nor a comic (a skill he has displayed plentifully on the improvisation-oriented \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\") nor a singer (he was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award for his cover of Sam Cooke's \"A Change Is Gonna Come\"). He also has appeared on Broadway in \"Chicago,\" \"Freestyle Love Supreme\" and \"Kinky Boots.\" Along with \"The Price Is Right,\" extra episodes of \"Let's Make a Deal\" have been made expressly for CBS' prime time lineup. That will continue for both shows during the upcoming television season, when they are slated to be seen on Friday nights starting in November. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

An MGM+ Drive-In attraction on Monday, Oct. 9, and Tuesday, Oct. 10, director and co-writer Billy Wilder's tale casts Jack Lemmon as an office drone who's quite popular with much of the management at his workplace thanks to his relatively tiny apartment, which he loans out to the bosses so that they can have romantic trysts there.The company's main chief (Fred MacMurray) discovers what's going on and cuts himself in, but his affair is with the office building's elevator operator (Shirley MacLaine) - who is greatly liked by Lemmon's character, forcing him to develop more of a conscience about what he's been facilitating. This simply is a great film that not only has held up on its own over 60-plus years, it also inspired the hit stage musical \"Promises, Promises.\" The excellent cast also includes Ray Walston, Jack Kruschen and Edie Adams. \n \n Caption: Jack Lemmon and Shirley Maclaine in \"The Apartment\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Beyond time and space: 'Loki' returns with uncontrollable powers\n\n October 5, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Sarah Passingham | Page: 9A | Section: News \n \n 436\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n We've all done the time warp and explored the multiverse, but it's high time to sort out the timeline. A brand-new season of \"Loki\" premieres Friday, Oct. 6, on Disney+. Tom Hiddleston (\"The Essex Serpent\") returns as the God of Mischief, everyone's favorite troublemaker, Loki, who has developed a mysterious problem this season.Owen Wilson (\"Haunted Mansion,\" 2023) is back as Mobius M. Mobius, the Time Variance Authority agent tasked with helping Loki right his wrongs across the multiverse. The first season of \"Loki\" saw the Norse God meet his match in an alternate version of himself. Sophia Di Martino (\"The Electrical Life of Louis Wain,\" 2021) is Sylvie, a variant of Loki who interrupts the Sacred Timeline. After coming together to set things right across space and time, Loki returned to what he thought would be the TVA headquarters he left before his mission, but something still wasn't right.In the official trailer for the upcoming season, Mobius brings Loki to a repair shop of sorts, manned by TVA repair guy OB, portrayed by Ke Huy Quan (\"American Born Chinese\"). Before the pair have time to explain what's brought them there, Loki suddenly, uncontrollably disappears in a timeslip, leaving Mobius looking to OB for an answer. \"It's impossible to timeslip in the TVA,\" is all he can say, though they just watched it happen.\"Loki\" executive producer Kevin Wright told Entertainment Weekly in September that \"[OB's] job is basically every piece of tech, every computer, every thing that is running at the TVA. [[---]] He either designed it or he fixes it and keeps it running.\" Having recently picked up an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2022's \"Everything Everywhere All At Once,\" Quan is well suited to help repair another multiverse.While Quan's character is the latest to join Loki's crew as he chases chaos across the multiverse, several cast members return for the new season, including Gugu Mbatha-Raw (\"Surface\") as Ravonna Renslayer, an ambitious judge in the TVA who oversees Loki's case. Literally backing up Loki at one point in the season's trailer alongside Mobius, Sylvie and OB is Wunmi Mosaku (\"We Own This City\") as Hunter B-15. Eugene Cordero (\"Star Trek: Lower Decks\") returns as Hunter K-5E, former TVA receptionist.The upcoming seasons also star Neil Ellice (\"Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn\") as Hunter D-90, Jonathan Majors (\"Creed III,\" 2023) as He Who Remains and Tara Strong (\"Teen Titans Go!\") as the voice of Miss Minutes. Rafael Casal (\"Blindspotting\"), Kate Dickie (\"Annika\") and Liz Carr (\"Silent Witness\") all join the cast this season in as-yet-unnamed roles. \n \n Caption: Owen Wilson and Tom Hiddleston in \"Loki\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Michael Caine is spy Harry Palmer in a TCM double feature\n\n October 5, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: 12A | Section: News \n \n 333\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Many secret agents came to the screen during the spy craze of the 1960s, but Harry Palmer made his mind his main weapon.Played by Michael Caine, novelist Len Deighton's brainy character sparked three theatrical features, released over three consecutive years and two of them form a double bill Sunday, Oct. 8, on Turner Classic Movies. Logically scheduled first is the character's initial film, \"The Ipcress File\" (1965), then the lineup skips the second picture in the series (1966's \"Funeral in Berlin\") to proceed directly to the third, \"Billion Dollar Brain\" (1967).Harry Saltzman, who was one of the original producers of the James Bond movies along with Albert R. Broccoli), bought the film rights to the Palmer books from Deighton during the latter's brief involvement with the Bond franchise. Interestingly, each of the '60s Palmer capers was released by a different studio: \"The Ipcress File\" by Universal, \"Funeral in Berlin\" by Paramount, and \"Billion Dollar Brain\" by United Artists.Such key players in the 007 series as composer John Barry, editor Peter R. Hunt and composer John Barry were brought over by Saltzman for \"The Ipcress File.\" The movie that made later two-time Oscar winner Caine a star, it finds ex-military man Palmer enlisted to find a kidnapped scientist.complications involving British Intelligence and the CIA arise as the case proceeds, with Palmer eventually captured and subjected to brainwashing in a classic sequence designed for maximum tension by Hunt and director Sidney J. Furie.While \"The Ipcress File\" is deliberately low in gadgetry, \"Billion Dollar Brain\" leans more into the technology that became such a part of the spy genre during that era. An early work by director Ken Russell, later of \"Women in Love\" and \"Tommy\" fame, it pits Palmer against a computer-obsessed tycoon (Ed Begley) who schemes to incite World War III by dispatching his own private army. Karl Malden, who would reunite with Caine in 1979's \"Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,\" plays a presumed friend of Palmer. \n \n Caption: Michael Caine and Nigel Green in \"The Ipcress File\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As an added treat, Smithsonian National Zoo members can enjoy early admission from 5 to 6 p.m. all three nights.Boo at the Zoo offers families a safe atmosphere to trick-or-treat while enjoying festive Halloween decorations in the wild and not-so-spooky setting of the zoo.Tickets include afterhours access to popular zoo exhibits, including the Small Mammal House, Elephant Community Center and Reptile Discovery Center.Guests can feast their eyes on spellbinding habitats decorated with jack-o'-lanterns, spooky enrichment and tasty treats for the animals.Each trick-or-treater will receive one recyclable bag to fill up with sweets, snacks and other fun surprises at around 30 booths stationed throughout the park. Fiendishly fun vignettes featuring frolicking skeletons and fantastical creatures will liven up the zoo's main pathway, Olmsted Walk.Tickets are on sale for $35 or for $25 for zoo members.Each attendee, including any children over the age of 2, will need a ticket.In addition to early access to the event, zoo member benefits include discounted parking, which is available for pre-purchase online at $20 per vehicle for zoo members and $30 per vehicle for non-members.Only guests with a parking pass will be permitted to enter the zoo's Connecticut Avenue entrance with their vehicle.Guests using ride share vehicles will be dropped off and picked up at the designated ride share zones near the Connecticut Avenue and Harvard Street entrances.

These bakers need to think big and bold, blowing up their designs to gigantic proportions and thinking outside the (bakery) box.\" As \"Big Bake\" competitions take place throughout the year, this iteration celebrates the spookiest and scariest season of them all, tasking bakers with eye-popping and downright dreary challenges that feature spooky Halloween treats, creepy clown cakes, fa-boolous shrieks, scares and costumes galore.So far this season, the teams have been asked to create cakes of the best \"boo-ticians\" in town, decorated with their creepy clientele, and then made their way to the carnival, where funhouse screams were on the menu as Smith asked the baking teams to create some spine-chilling desserts.But fear not. The scariest snacks are still to come.During this upcoming episode, Food Network promises that witches will be the \"talk of the town,\" as a description for the challenge shares that \"Brad Smith asks the baking teams to wave their magic whisks to create cakes featuring the queens of Halloween.\" In the following weeks, the competition continues, as bakers serve some \"big bog bakes\" with swamp-themed cakes and later tackle their fears by making creations that feature thrill-seeking monsters.As tension rises and suspense builds, bakers must do their best to impress this season's judges - pastry chef Ron Ben-Israel (\"Cake Wars\"), cornerback-turned-chef Eddie Jackson (\"Outchef 'd\") and internet personality/cookbook author Danni Rose (\"Danni's Juke Joint Comfort Food Cookbook: Modern-Day Recipes, Ole Skool Flavas,\" releasing in November 2023) - and avoid elimination, making it to the end of the competition, where the most ambitious (and terrifying) baker will go home with a $10,000 prize.Jam-packed with creepy confections, taunting treats and bizarre baked goods, new episodes of \"The Big Bake: Halloween\" air Mondays through October on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Ron Ben Israel, Danni Rose, Brad Smith and Eddie Jackson from \"The Big Bake\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

To a pugilist, it is a means to an end: the end of his opponent's resistance. (Why does anyone inflict physical pain on another, human or animal?) An Englishman might think of the humorous Punch magazine, long deceased. One of its former editors, Malcolm Muggeridge, defended his tenure by writing: \"Good taste and humor are a contradiction in terms.\" However, to a bridge player, \"punch\" is forcing declarer to ruff and lose trump control -- as in today's deal.After a straightforward auction, West has to choose a lead. Some would misguidedly select the singleton heart. They would argue that partner might have the ace (unlikely on this auction) or that partner might have the club jack as an entry and either the dummy or declarer might hold only a singleton club. However, if the latter is the position, there are only three defensive tricks: the spade ace, the club jack and one heart ruff.Much more sensible is to lead a top club and to continue leading club winners. After ruffing the third round, South plays a spade. Suppose West ducks this trick, to check South's spade length, and wins the next round with his ace. He forces declarer a second time with another club. This leaves the dummy and South with one spade each while West retains two. Whatever South does now, West must score a second trump trick -- and his fourth in all -- to defeat the contract.I suppose, if I weren't above that level of humor, I'd add that West had clubbed South to death.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Margaret Knudsen, executive director of Cambridge Main Street, which hosts the event, said that in previous years, the taste category was often crab and one \"fun bonus\" taste. However, this year the categories are crab, seasonal soup and stew, mac and cheese, apple and pumpkin.\"So everyone who has a tasting ticket will be able to get a little bit of savory as well as sweet,\" Knudsen said.A cooking contest, which will go until 4 p.m., will determine the winners of each of these different food categories.Entry to the festival is free and those who want to eat and drink can purchase tickets.This year, there will are a variety of ticket types to choose from, including food only tickets, general admission tickets and VIP tickets. The VIP ticket will give ticket holders the opportunity to taste and sip during a VIP hour from noon to 1 p.m.\"So if you would like to taste and sip early, you can buy a VIP ticket,\" Knudsen said. \"And that allows you the opportunity to get the food while it's fresh out of the oven and ditch the lines.\"Compostable silverware will be handed out to ticket holders at check in.\"We have been told that there was a lot of plastic waste, in previous years, from the event,\" Knudsen said. \"So we were trying to come up with creative solutions to reduce our waste.\"Although tasting and sipping are the festival's main draws, there are plenty of other things for attendees to do. People can peruse a vendors market full of independent businesses or listen to live performances at one of the festival's two stages.On the main stage in the Blue Ruin Plaza off Gay Street, there will be performances from tranzfusion, the Eastern Shore Dance Academy, Anna Burgess music and SoulCrackers.On the secondary stage at the corner Race and Muir streets, there will be performances from The Folk Villains, Island Fusion with Nancy and Jody and The Terry Koger Duo.Mike Elzey's Guitar Studio will be playing in the Main Street Gallery from 1 to 3 p.m.There will also be a kids' zone complete with costumed princesses, a bubble studio and bounces houses, pending the weather.\"We will have Belle, Elsa and Mirabel making appearances,\" Knudsen said.With rain in the forecast, Knudsen said the rain could have a large effect on the event.\"But thankfully we've been able to be flexible with how we're situating our musicians,\" she said. \"And the restaurants have all been more than accommodating and willing to come out in the rain and support Cambridge Main Street.\"Knudsen said people should come to the event if they are looking for family fun with different entertainment options.\"So if you want to come shopping, you can,\" she said. \"If you want to eat, you can. And if you just want to get a picture with Elsa, she'll be there in the kids' zone.\" \n \n Caption: FlLE PHOTO/\n \nRAR Brewing's crab cake won the judges' choice and people's choice awards at the 2018 Taste of Cambridge. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

How did the declarer play after West had led the club queen?North's sequence, a transfer bid of two hearts followed by a jump to four diamonds, showed a slam-try with at least six spades and at most one diamond (a splinter bid).South bid what he thought he could make.Declarer won the opening lead with dummy's club ace, cashed the spade ace, played a club to his king and ruffed a club high in the dummy.After a spade to South's king had removed the opponents' trumps, declarer ruffed his last club.I know you've seen the key play coming for some time, but just in case, now declarer called for dummy's diamond and finessed his jack.West won with the queen but was endplayed. He had to concede three side-suit tricks: either two hearts and one diamond on a heart return into declarer's A-Q tenace; or one heart and two diamonds on a diamond return into declarer's A-10 tenace.The transfer bid did its job. If North declares in six spades, East will surely lead the heart jack, which kills the contract.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One of the most reliable is that if one side is playing on a suit, it is wrong for the other side to play on it too.Today's deal is a straightforward example.West leads his fourthhighest heart against three no-trump. This gives declarer seven top tricks: two spades, one heart, three diamonds and one club. Assuming no 4-0 diamond split, two more tricks are readily available in diamonds. Or are they? Look at the spots. If the diamonds break 3-1, declarer will have to win the fourth round in his hand. With no dummy entry, the fifth diamond trick shrivels and dies like an earthworm on a hot pavement.However, South spotted a possibility. After winning the first trick with dummy's heart nine, he cashed the diamond queen and ace.West's club discard was a blow, but now declarer led the heart king.You see the idea behind this play. South knew West had started with at most five hearts, because West had led the five and declarer could see the three and four. South hoped that West would cash at least one more heart trick, on which the declarer would discard the blocking diamond seven or nine.However, West knew that if South thought it was right for North-South to play on hearts, it had to be wrong for East-West to do so too. West won with the heart ace and immediately switched to a spade.This condemned the contract. When declarer lost a trick in another suit, the defenders cashed their hearts. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

West took declarer's jack with his queen and exited with a spade, won by South's king.Declarer cashed the diamond king-queen and spade queen before playing a spade to dummy's ace.After taking the 13th spade and the diamond ace, South exited with dummy's last diamond. West won with the nine and cashed the heart ace, but he had to concede the last trick - declarer's ninth - to the heart king.Bridge is a tough game!Receive daily instructive and entertaining quizzes from Phillip by subscribing for only $10 per month at www.bridgeforeveryone.com. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

(He also has been an executive producer of the show from the beginning.)Piers Morgan, Brandy Norwood and David Hasselhoff made up the judging panel for the first season in 2006, with Regis Philbin as the host.At the time, Cowell was intending to make a similar contest for British television, but some complications ultimately held that up and he turned his attention to making a U.S. version. The result was a summer hit for NBC, and it also jump-started the originally planned British edition, which premiered in 2007 and also continues. From there, the concept expanded even more, with versions still being done in Canada, Cambodia, France, India and Spain (among other locations).A judge on the British version from the start, Cowell became an on-air \"America's Got Talent\" presence beginning with the 11th season - this year has marked its 18th round - but he wasn't present for the live episodes during Season 15, due to a back injury. Substitute judges were enlisted initially, but the number of judges then was reduced from four to three in Cowell's absence, with Howie Mandel (who has been with the show since Season 5), Heidi Klum and Sofia Vergara holding forth with those duties.Actually, Klum also missed some of Season 15 due to illness, with Vergara's fellow \"Modern Family\" alum Eric Stonestreet filling in for her. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So many episodes of the series are classics in their own right, if you asked five people which one was their favorite, you'd likely get five different answers.

    "content": "Welcome to Miami: A young artist dreams of making it big in 'Neon'\n\n October 12, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Sarah Passingham | Page: 12A | Section: News \n \n 294\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n There may be a chill in the air, but a new comedy series brings the heat from Miami beaches and dance floors to your screen. \"Neon\" premieres on the streamer Thursday, Oct. 19, dropping all eight episodes and immersing audiences in the world of up-and-coming reggaeton artist Santi (Tyler Dean Flores \"Miguel Wants to Fight,\" 2023) as he tries to make it to the big time in Magic City.Packing their lives up into a 2009 Toyota Corolla, Santi and his friends Ness (Emma Ferreira \"Unstable\") and Felix (Jordan Mendoza \"Kaleidoscope\") leave small-town Florida behind and hit the road that leads to Miami. The three best friends have a lot of inroads to make once they arrive in the big city, but their hopes of stardom for Santi keep them afloat.In a teaser trailer for \"Neon\" released by Netflix, the trio's temporary Miami lodgings are parked within view of the more comfortably cramped suites of a Sheraton hotel. Humble beginnings for sure, but the trailer also sees the dreamers working hard, making connections and taking to the stage, enjoying the nightlife they hope to become fixtures of soon.Though they're starting from the bottom and sleeping in their car to start, the \"Neon\" trailer teases some pretty glamorous upgrades afforded to the crew. Santi shoots a music video, lays down a track in the studio, embraces his friends backstage of a very important performance, gets invites to swanky house parties and tosses cash in the air. \"You are a star,\" Ness proclaims in the trailer before further declaring, \"We have to show them we're not loser wannabes.\" Whether Santi is on the rise or a wannabe, the music fanatics of Miami decide his fate - he'll either get set off to stardom or back to his hometown. \n \n Caption: Tyler Dean Flores in \"Neon\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

From producers including \"Gunsmoke\" veteran Charles Marquis Warren, it casts the actor as Rowdy Yates, a trail hand assisting with cattle drives. The legendary theme song is performed by Frankie Laine, and cast regulars also include Eric Fleming, Sheb Wooley and Paul Brinegar.\"Saboteur\" (Peacock, streaming; Turner Classic Movies, Monday, Oct. 16): Alfred Hitchcock was establishing his Hollywood cred when the director made this terrific 1942 melodrama, hugely memorable for its use of the Statue of Liberty in its finale. That iconic New York site is where an alleged traitor's (Robert Cummings) pursuit of the actual culprit (Norman Lloyd) reaches its superbly tense climax.\"From Russia With Love\" (MGM+, Saturday, Oct. 21): Though its gadgetry is relatively limited, many James Bond aficionados consider this 1963 adventure one of the best adventures in the series. Sean Connery's second turn as Agent 007 finds the spy sent to retrieve a decoding device also wanted by Russian rivals, who dispatch an alluring associate (Daniela Bianchi) to seduce and discredit him. The great villains include vicious Red Grant (played by an incredibly fit Robert Shaw) and sneering Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya), who wields a very lethal shoe. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bakers have been asked to: make two-sided trick-or-treat bags - with one side being light and fun while the other is dark and spooky - out of lemon candies, black licorice and peach rings; decorate cookies with scary self-portraits; craft life-size oozing zombie parts out of cookies, overflowing with gooey marmalades and jams; and create creepy, 3D haunted mirrors - each old and cracked with crunchy treats like kettle chips, pretzels and corn chips.This week, \"Edible stained glass is one of the most colorful and bewitching trends in the cookie world, and four cookie experts make glowing Halloween stainedglass cookies,\" the network promises.\"After one cookier is eliminated, the remaining three masters build giant, elaborate Halloween fun houses that would thrill any Halloween carnival-goer. The judges will really feel like they are at a carnival as the bakers must incorporate fun fair flavors like caramel apples, grilled corn, popcorn balls and deep-fried sandwich cookies.\" In the season's final episode, the final four competing cookie makers hope to scare the pants off hosts Goldman and Pansino by making edible, three-story haunted houses. Then, in the last round, Food Network has shared that, \"The three remaining cookiers host a séance by making playable spirit boards. To make sure there is maximum 'spirit' in their boards, they will include spirits like apple brandy, cinnamon whiskey, coffee rum and black currant liqueur.\" A rambunctious carnival filled with delicious treats, Season 2 of Food Network's \"Halloween Cookie Challenge\" airs new episodes Mondays through October. \n \n Caption: Rosanna Pansino co-hosts \"Halloween Cookie Challenge\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We're just poor musicians,\" Thompson said, with a laugh.\" The band is a hard-rocking ensemble, reflecting Thompson's guitar-driven passions that are heavily influenced by Stevie Ray Vaughn, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Alvin Lee, and Billy Gibbons.When the family is together, however, the selections also drift all over the musical map.\"The littlest girl (vocalist daughter Rachel) will do some Dolly Parton and Linda Rondstadt, and we'll throw in some Monkees, like \"Daydream Believer,\" Beatles, and kind of go from Dire Straits to Johnny Cash to 60's rock. In an event like that, you really want to mix it up a lot,\" Thompson said.Thompson's wife Kate plays keyboards and electric violin; his son, Blake Jr., plays keyboards and drums; daughter, Sarah, is a rhythm guitarist and vocalist, along with Rachel; daughter, Josie, is a bass guitar player; and Russ Reinacher will be sitting in on the drums.During his long career, the 57-year-old Thompson, who is also an accomplished recording engineer and mixer, has played regularly with his own band and with Bit O Jane and the Elliots. He's also toured in conjunction with the Steve Miller Band, Dave Matthews Band, The Gin Blossoms, David Crosby, Little Feat, and others.It is a career that got its start when he bought his first guitar at Dixon's Auction in Crumpton when he was a 15-year-old freshman at Kent County High School.\"I played ninth-grade football and I met a guy on the team who I talked music with all the time, and he played guitar, and I said, 'I'll get a guitar, too,'\" Thompson said. \"I bought a cheap guitar at Crumpton and it only had four strings and I played it like that for about three months. It just went from there. I worked and practiced and got some books, and I watched other local bands, and wrote down what they were doing, and ran home and practiced.\" By the end of high school, he had his own band with other musicians from the Massey area, where his family had relocated. And, as he said, his career went from there.\"It was wild. The whole band was from about a one-mile radius,\" Thompson said.\"In that band, and others after that, we played all over the area before I started traveling the country.I think I'm related to half of Kent County. I've got relatives in Chestertown, Rock Hall, Worton.This show at FallFest is like coming home, big-time. The whole event has a great vibe to it.\" While the Thompson Family show is can't-miss, it has some company on Main Street during FallFest. Also keeping things lively is Wicked Sycamore, an all-female acoustic Americana trio that recently won a Wammie Award, presented by the Washington Area Music Association; The High and Wides, a traditional bluegrass group that has long been a local favorite; Pat Wictor and Bob Beach, who play dobro, slide guitar, and harmonica to turn out haunting bluesbased rock; and The Good Stuff, a new country-tinged band led by Phil Dutton, who also fronts the Cajun-flavored group, The Alligators.And, of course, no FallFest is complete without an appearance by the Catonsville High School Steel Band, which plays the traditional tuned pans from Trinidad and Tobago.The group has been an annual FallFest highlight since 1999, and the band comes back bigger and better than ever this year.That's a great day of music, but FallFest is about more than music.In celebrating the opening of the commercial oyster season, approximately 6,000 oysters will be shucked onsite, and there is all manner of other street fair food, including fried oyster platters, burgers, dogs, tacos, fries, ice cream and, all the rest.Main Street becomes a pedestrian thoroughfare for visitors to stroll and explore our shops and take a look at the offerings of dozens of artisan vendors. There is also Kids Kourt at The Village at the foot of Main Street with games, prizes, animals, painting, clowns and much more for the younger set and all of it free.Admission and nearby parking is also free. So, come join us for a great day of music, food, and fun that benefits our local community projects. Some proceeds from our non-profit event support the Kent County Waterman's Association scholarship fund, and we also help fund improvements for The Mainstay, the iconic music venue at the heart of Main Street.See you on Oct. 14 at 10 a.m. for all the festivities. Bring your appetite and bring your dancing shoes.It's a family affair, especially for Blake Thompson. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF FALLFEST\n \nBlake Thomspon \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

An interesting clash of northern European cultures, the two worlds meet seamlessly due to the titular character's Norwegian roots and the often-folkloric nature of the crimes she encounters at work.The series' main character, DI Annika Strandhed, has been a hit with audiences across the pond since the original radio series premiered in early January 2017 on the U.K.'s BBC Radio 4. The radio series, titled \"Annika Stranded,\" wrapped Sept. 4, 2020, but for lovers of the series, the story continues on television, complete with Nicola Walker (\"MI-5\") in the role of Annika - no doubt a familiar voice for fans who jumped over from the radio play.Both series follow Strandhed, a former Oslo-based \"murder squad\" police officer, as she relocates to a remote region of Scotland to head up the country's first-ever Marine Homicide Unit. Given her dedication to the job and a lifelong love of fast-moving boats, Strandhed seems poised as the perfect fit to lead the new team. That said, her cohort DS Michael McAndrews (Jamie Sives, \"Guilt\") has other opinions.McAndrews attended police college with Strandhed, but the two detectives selected career paths that took them in opposite directions, causing them to drift apart. While McAndrews is clearly supportive of Strandhed and finds her to be a very intelligent leader, he still believes himself to have been a better candidate for her position as leader of the MHU. Nevertheless, the pair must find a way to work together - thankfully McAndrews' duties as head diver keep him busy and away from Strandhed much of the time.Working alongside the two team leads are DC Blair Ferguson (Katie Leung, \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\" 2005), who provides data analysis and tech support for the team; DS Tyrone Clarke (Ukweli Roach, \"Blindspot\"), a former drug unit investigator who prefers to work alone; and DCI Diane Oban (Kate Dickie, \"The Green Knight,\" 2021), who oversees all police proceedings within the precinct and often has the final say on how the MHU operates.Joining the MHU this season is DC Harper Weston (played by Varada Sethu, \"Jurassic World Dominion,\" 2022), a motorcycle-riding trainee who, given her youth, may act as a second person to provide Strandhed a bit of insight regarding her daughter, Morgan (Sylvie Furneaux, \"Red Rose\"). This guiding role has previously only been played by Ferguson, who is of a similar age to Weston and only a few years older than Morgan herself. \n \n Caption: Nicola Walker in \"Annika\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Outside Shop Abbey in Cumbria, northern England, was a sign reading, \"Admission free. Special terms for parties.\" In bridge, one deal can provide variety. The opening lead may be pivotal. For example, in today's deal, how would you plan the play in six spades if West has led either a club or a trump?Two no-trump was the Jacoby Forcing Raise. South's three-no-trump rebid showed 15-17 points but denied a singleton or void.North control-bid the club ace. South used Blackwood twice, learning that two kings were missing.After a club lead, declarer is in trouble. He must draw trumps, cash the heart king and take a heart finesse. If it loses, the contract dies.However, if the finesse wins, South cashes dummy's heart ace. If the suit breaks 3-3, declarer's club loser disappears on the 13th heart, and he tries the diamond finesse for an overtrick. If the hearts are 4-2, the diamond finesse must win.On a trump lead, though, South has some flexibility.After drawing trumps, it is right to take an immediate diamond finesse. If it loses, declarer must bring in four heart tricks, playing West for queen-third. But if, as in the given layout, the diamond finesse wins, South needs only three heart tricks for his contract. It is time for a safety play. Declarer cashes dummy's heart ace, plays a heart to his king and leads a heart back toward dummy's jack. This maximizes the chance of three heart tricks.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There was even rocking funk music from G Method to make spirits high.\"The Jellyfish Apocalypse is amazing. It is so flavorful. It still tastes like a beer, but with a yummy kick. We saw the name and said, 'Let's give it a go.' You have to be truly adventurous,'\" said Jackie Sadler, who is part of Three Roads Brewing Company in Virginia.\"To be a good beer taster you have to be open minded about trying different types of beer. So being open to trying the IPA or the blonde or the pilsner or the lager - I think that is what makes the best beer taster,\" said Emily Sadler, who is Jackie's daughter in law.Chris Hash, the treasurer of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, has been organizing the October beer festival for eight years.\"It's a huge fundraiser. We have over 1,000 in attendance. Its a big financial impact. General admission tickets are $45. VIPs are $75,\" he said.While the money is great, Hash said another part of the event is enlisting new firefighters.\"We have a recruitment and retention table over here. We guys talking about what we do and hopefully recruit some new younger members. Volunteering has become a bit of dying breed in the last few years,\" said Hash.\"Firefighting has a lot of excitement.There is a lot of training, but it is rewarding. You get to do something a normal person doesn't get to do. You are running into burning building when others are running out.\" He said all the food, like crab dip on top of fries, was cooked by firemen.You could also find brats, pulled pork and hot dogs.The festival featured 46 brewers, a couple of wineries and distilleries, and 120 different drink options.Tim Miller of Easton started making National Premium beer in 2012.\"We have some old fans and we hope to make some new ones, but this is kind of the rewards of the beer business. It is just a fun day for everybody. It is in our backyard and it is the best run beer festival I've done. And I have done a lot. I don't have to lug ice or equipment. I can just come and pour,\" said Miller.There was even some art to be found at the beer fest. One lady is the \"Queen of Bottlecaps.\" She color coordinates beer caps and puts them into designs on a wooden board.\"It takes several hours to make one. It is therapeutic. I have been here at least four times. More men are willing to make this purchase.The crab design is the most popular,\" said Hillary Wright of Salisbury. the event, which is sponsored by Easton Liquors and Discover Easton, helped lead to the pouring of ciders, seltzers, craft beers, wines and spirits all day long. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTim Miller, left, bought the National Premium beer franchise in 2012.

Wodehouse wrote, \"Judges, as a class, display, in the matter of arranging alimony, that reckless generosity which is found only in men who are giving away someone else's cash.\" Well, on today's deal, you be the judge. South was the husband, North his wife - and, yes, they are still married.After an auction in which neither side knew who could make what, South ended in four spades doubled. West led a heart to his partner's king. East switched to the club six. Declarer won with his ace, unblocked the diamond king, ruffed a heart in the dummy and discarded a club on dummy's diamond ace. He then cashed the club king and ruffed the club four in hand. However, disaster struck when West overruffed.A moment later, when East got in with the spade ace, another club lead promoted West's spade queen as the setting trick.\"How unlucky can I be?\" asked South. \"Why should East have five clubs and only one spadeft\" \"You misplayed,\" replied North. \"There is no hurry to discard your club loser. After winning trick two with the club ace, ruff a heart in the dummy, play a diamond to your king and ruff your last heart. Then lead dummy's third trump.\" South judged his wife was right. With her line, everything is as much under control as it can be. If East plays low on the trump, South puts up the king, East being marked with the ace from the auction. Here, though, East wins with the ace and returns a club to dummy's king. South discards his remaining club on the diamond ace and loses only one more trump trick. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Attached to a high-tension electricity pylon in Massachusetts was a board stating: \"To climb this structure means instant death. Anyone found doing so will be prosecuted.\" In bridge you can commit suicide but remain alive and unprosecuted - except perhaps by your partner. It is your contract that dies.South is in three no-trump.West leads the heart five: two, queen, king. How should South continue?When in no-trump, declarer must count his top tricks first. Here he has seven: two spades, three diamonds, one club and one heart (given the lead). He needs two more tricks, which can obviously come from the clubs. However, taking the club finesse at trick two electrocutes South. East wins with the king and returns his remaining heart - down one.Better is to lead the club queen to tempt a cover, but then to win with dummy's ace. Maybe East has the singleton club king. Also, if the club finesse is working, you don't need to take it because West cannot hurt you.However, here, whichever line you choose, the contract dies. Let's go back to trick one. Assuming West's heart five is his fourth highest, when East plays the queen, you can place the ace with West. So, the only risk to your contract is the given layout. As you are never getting more than one heart trick, just play low from your hand at trick one. Give East the trick with his queen. The defenders' communications are cut, and your contract is safe. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bridge players are hooked on a 13-trick deal. However, both are aware that they might not last that long. Rodeo riders often fall off in under eight seconds. The bridge player might have lost too many tricks before the last one has been played. Still, both always set out with the best of intentions.In today's deal, South was on the three-no-trump bronco. Upon opening the gate, he saw that the lead was the diamond king. How should he have tried to ride to success?During the first buck, South noticed that he had seven top tricks: one spade, one heart, one diamond and four clubs.Looking at those lovely diamonds in the dummy, South won the first trick with his diamond ace and fired back the diamond three.However, West went in with the queen (East discarded the club three) and switched immediately to the heart two. South sailed off the bull and landed face first in the dirt. He couldn't avoid losing five tricks.However tempting those diamonds looked, there was a better source of tricks available: spades. South should win the first trick, play a club to dummy's queen and take a spade finesse by, say, running the queen. West wins with the king and switches to hearts, but South, after ducking one round, wins with his heart ace, plays a club to dummy's ace and runs the spade nine.When that finesse wins, he repeats it and cashes the spade ace and club king-jack for nine tricks: three spades, one heart, one diamond and four clubs.Did you tame the bucking broncoft ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Comediennes make quips about husbands. We can relate to them because they are so close to the truth.Zsa Zsa Gabor lent her own style when she said, \"I'm a marvelous housekeeper.Every time I leave a man, I keep his house.\" In bridge, you have to be careful to keep your tricks.If you have a winner in one hand, you must have an entry to that hand - or be able to force an opponent to lead the suit for you.Today's auction was tricky.What should North do over West's three-spade opening? Pass is cowardly.Three no-trump is brilliant or foolhardy, depending on the result. Four clubs is one-dimensional. Double is the most flexible action, but dangerous.Over the double, South might pass for penalties, but that is risky with such poor spades. (He can get 800 for down three.) He could try three no-trump, but that suffers from the same drawback. Four hearts is the normal bid.West starts with three rounds of spades, declarer ruffing the last high in the dummy. East discards three diamonds. South draws trumps, reducing the deal to no-trump. Now it looks superficially attractive to continue with the club ace and another club. However, against the bad break, the contract dies. East wins two club tricks to go with the two spade tricks already in the defenders' bag.The correct play is a low club to dummy's jack. (If West has the singleton king, tough!) The ace must be kept as the entry to the spade jack. Declarer's 10 tricks are one spade, four hearts, two diamonds, two clubs and one spade ruff in the dummy. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's time to sharpen your knives and prepare your mise-en-scène, as \"Mary Makes it Easy\" airs an all-new episode, Sunday, Oct. 22, on Food Network.Hosted by Canadian television host, cookbook author and chef Mary Berg (winner of \"MasterChef Canada\" Season 3), this how-to series follows as Berg gives step-by-step instructions to follow recipes that are guaranteed to impress even the pickiest of eaters, as the chef hopes to teach culinary novices and cooks alike how to expand their recipe book without any of the stress.With multiple seasons now under her belt, Berg has focused episodes on a myriad of topics, including: how to make multiple recipes all utilizing the same base ingredients - like coleslaw used both in golden brown Japanese Okonomi-yaki-inspired pancakes and store-bought rotisserie chicken, turned into a nearly unrecognizable, quick and easy Coq au Vin; upgrading store-bought cookie doughs and pie crusts to make impressive desserts; using your kitchen tools - cast iron included - to their fullest potential; and even making the correct wine and alcohol pairings, in an episode in which Berg \"shakes things up with Wine Can Chicken that's cooked with a cocktail of dry white wine, lemon and herbs\" (Food Network).In episodes to come, Food Network shares that Berg shares her love for cooking outside, detailing recipes that \"take grill night to the next level.\"\"Brie and Pancetta Burgers are topped with chunky grilled red onion and gooey Brie cheese,\" they describe. \"For a vegetarian grill-friendly main, Mary's Grilled Soy Maple Mushrooms caramelize beautifully, and on the lighter side, Grilled Scallops with Minty Pea Salad are flavored with garlic, lemon and herbs on a peppery arugula base. Finally, Mary does some barbecue baking with decadent Cheese Stuffed Grilled Garlic Flatbreads.\"And - taking her creative approach, as always - Berg even shares her own, unique \"mash-up\" recipes throughout the series, melding common dishes like Caesar Salad and Roast Chicken, even crafting a Taco Meatball skillet.Delving into the best tips, tricks and tools necessary for any cook, Mary Berg impresses in every episode of \"Mary Makes it Easy,\" airing Sundays on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Mary Berg from \"Mary Makes it Easy\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He guest-starred on \"Friends\" for three episodes in 2000 as Paul, the disapproving father of Ross's (David Schwimmer) considerably younger girlfriend Elizabeth (Alexandra Holden), and the two men eventually came to a meeting of the minds thanks to certain information Ross had about Paul (which the latter man didn't want revealed).Willis earned a Primetime Emmy Award for the portrayal, marking the second one he won, his first having come for his work as wisecracking sleuth David Addison on \"Moonlighting.\" He also did guest shots on such shows as \"Ally McBeal\" and \"Mad About You,\" but movies had the bulk of his creative attention after he scored an enormous hit with the original \"Die Hard\" in 1988.That being said, the actor also hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" a couple of times, and he was the good-natured target of a \"Comedy Central Roast\" in 2018, with his ex-wife Demi Moore and \"Moonlighting\" leading lady Cybill Shepherd among those who took humorous shots at him. As is traditional for such events, though, Willis got to even the score with his own remarks at the end of that show. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who played Willis' younger self in the 2012 movie \"Looper,\" was the host of the \"Roast.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Kim Dickens (\"Friday Night Lights\") stars as Madison Clark, a high school guidance counsellor before the outbreak who now oversees the reconstruction of a survivors' island colony.\"Fear the Walking Dead\" closes out an impressive eight-season run with six episodes to go before the big, two-part series finale set to air Sunday, Nov. 19. The first of now six spinoffs of the original series, \"Fear the Walking Dead\" premiered in 2015 and followed an extended family as they tried to survive in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. The series detailed the survivors' journey as they travelled and settled in California, Mexico and now an island off the Georgia coast.The island, known as PADRE, was constructed after the walker outbreak as a military operation intended to distribute supplies to new communities of survivors. A tragic walker invasion decimated PADRE, and since then, desperate survivors have used the island's resources that once represented a more hopeful future.In the first half of the final season of \"Fear the Walking Dead,\" Madison landed on PADRE after a hard-fought journey to find the island with Morgan Jones (Lennie James, \"Save Me\"). The pair reunited Morgan with his daughter, Mo (Zoey Merchant, \"The Price of Fame\"), by force at PADRE before the show leaps seven years into the future. Madison is imprisoned on PADRE while Morgan spends most of the first six episodes of the season on his own mission, trying to save Grace Mukherjee (Karen David, \"Legacies\") from radiation sickness before sadly losing her and setting off to Alexandria.With the dangerous former co-leaders of PADRE no longer a problem, Madison attempts to reinvigorate the spirit of PADRE and the island with the remaining resources available to them. While the final episodes of \"Fear the Walking Dead\" could certainly detail the establishment of a post-apocalyptic paradise, this is the Walking Dead universe after all, so there will undoubtedly be danger lurking in the shadows of PADRE.This season also stars Rubén Blades (\"The Counselor,\" 2013) as resistance leader Daniel Salazar; Colman Domingo (\"Sing Sing,\" 2023) as antihero Victor Strand; Danay Garcia (\"Prison Break\") as survivor Luciana Galvez; Austin Amelio (\"Hit Man,\" 2023) as PADRE member Dwight; Christine Evangelista (\"Mrs. Fletcher\") as Dwight's wife, Sherry; Jenna Elfman (\"The Twilight Zone\") as nurse June Dorie, who is on the run from PADRE; and one former cast member whose appearance in a trailer for the upcoming return of the series may have come as a surprise to \"Fear the Walking Dead\" fans. \n \n Caption: Jenna Elfman in \"Fear the Walking Dead\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Played by Titus Welliver, Harry Bosch - a homicide detective turned private eye - has a deeply personal case to handle this time, since he searches for his kidnapped rookie-cop daughter Maddie (Madison Lintz). The drama is based largely on Connelly's book \"The Crossing,\" and Connelly and Welliver are both among its executive producers.Interestingly, \"The Crossing\" is the 18 th book in the Bosch franchise, while Season 1 of \"Bosch: Legacy\" was inspired by two of the novels that came later, \"The Wrong Side of Goodbye\" (the 19th book) and \"The Night Fire\" (the 22nd book). The first season ended with a cliffhanger that suggested the abduction of Maddie, who seemed likely to have to testify in a wrongful-death shooting case, for which her police body camera had captured evidence.Maddie works out of the same Los Angeles police station where her father was based during his days as a cop. His frequent employer, attorney Honey \"Money\" Chandler (Mimi Rogers), trades on her own contacts to try to help him find Maddie before time runs out. Bosch and Chandler have other problems as the saga unfolds, with federal agents taking an interest in them and definitely not for the purposes of professional camaraderie and cooperation.New cast members in the sophomore round of \"Bosch: Legacy\" include Anthony Michael Hall (\"The Breakfast Club\") as one of the FBI investigators, as well as Jessica Camacho (\"All Rise\"), Max Martini (\"The Unit\"), David Denman ('The Office\") and veteran actor Bruce Davison (\"Willard\"). Among other co-stars returning to the \"Bosch\" world are Jamie Hector, Gregory Scott Cummins, Troy Evans, Denise Sanchez, Stephen A. Chang, Jacqueline Obradors and David Marciano. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Since it's set in 2022, some viewers may get a rueful chuckle out of its portrait of a densely polluted, overpopulated New York but there's also something quite moving about its rumination of the world the way it used to be.Heston plays a policeman whose investigation of a tycoon's (Joseph Cotten) murder exposes him to the good life the slain man lived. That encompasses such then-novelties as fresh beef and strawberries, some of which the cop spirits away to share with his friend and assistant - or \"book,\" in the parlance of this tale. That role marks the final performance of Edward G. Robinson, who's thoroughly moving and simply wonderful here. Leigh Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors and Brock Peters are among other familiar faces on hand. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The sleuths eventually suspect a shy fellow (played by guest star Neil Patrick Harris), assessing that he might not want to be challenged by anyone he chooses to keep company with.\"Final Destination\" (AMC, Sunday, Oct. 22, and Thursday, Oct. 26): A successful horror franchise was launched by this cleverly plotted 2000 melodrama, casting Devon Sawa as a student who foresees the destruction of an airplane he's supposed to fly on. After he's thrown off the jet, his vision becomes reality, and he and those who left with him try to prevent the Grim Reaper from catching up to them. Co-stars include Ali Larter, Seann William Scott and the ever-fearsome Tony Todd (\"Candyman\"). \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As an integral part of life? Or like Jean Cocteau, who said, \"We must believe in luck.For how else can we explain the success of those we don't like?\" In today's deal, if you play well, you will win 10 tricks.If you don't, you won't!Against your contract of four hearts, West leads the club four: queen, eight, five.How would you continue?North's bid of three hearts was questionable. With such a good club suit, he should have raised to three no-trump. If he had, South probably would have gone down!In four hearts, declarer won the first trick and naively assumed that West had led from the 4-3 doubleton. At trick two, South finessed the heart queen. Then he cashed the ace, luckily dropping East's king. Declarer drew West's last trump and led his remaining club. When West discarded a spade, South let out an audible groan. There was no way to recover and win 10 tricks.At another table, South started the same way: club queen, heart to the queen, heart ace. However, now he led his remaining club. West wasn't fooled. South could have drawn the last trump, so it couldn't be right to ruff.West discarded a spade; once more, down one.As West had surely led a singleton, the right play at trick two was a low spade from the dummy, planning to insert the nine. Declarer must organize a spade ruff in the dummy as his 10th trick. (If East plays an honor, South wins with his ace and continues with the spade 10, hoping that West must win the trick.) Later, when the heart king tumbles in two rounds, declarer receives a coconut - not a cigar today! ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You lead from an ace-king holding. Instantly it is clear that you can take a second trick in the suit. However, if you do, you will establish dummy's queen as a winner for the declarer. Do you take the second trick before the rodents get at it, or do you wait, hoping the trick doesn't evaporate?Although one example proves little, usually the right play is the one that worked on this deal from a team match.Defending against four spades, both Wests led the heart ace. For the losing team, West cashed his second heart winner, hoping his partner had started with a singleton. At trick three, he switched to a low diamond, when a club would have been much more successful. The declarer won with dummy's ace and, in case East had all three trumps, led the heart queen. East ruffed, and South overruffed. Declarer drew two rounds of trumps ending on the board and discarded one club loser on the heart jack: plus 620.At the other table, West switched to a low diamond at trick two. (I wonder if he considered leading the king.) The declarer misguessed. He won with dummy's ace and played for West to have the club ace: minus 100.In general, don't establish tricks for the opponents. Try to establish your own. first.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATEDISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATIONFOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You must pass a fairly easy test of your driving, chipping and putting.Should we do the same in bridge, setting players leaving beginners' classes a few simple bidding, declarerplay and defense problems?If so, do you think today's deal would be slightly too difficult for the test, or just right? West leads the club queen against your four-heart contract. How would you plan the play?There are three passes and South opens one heart. Should West pass, double or bid two clubs?Most inexperienced players bid two clubs. However, I think that is the third-best choice. With such soft values opposite a partner who couldn't even open in third position, there is a good case for passing. Especially in a pair event, though, you should strive to contest the partscore. Note that a takeout double gives you three chances to find a fit, whereas two clubs will probably lock you into that suit.Playing in four hearts, South must not win trick one with dummy's club king and lead a trump. With this layout, the contract can then be defeated, South losing one spade, two hearts and one diamond. It is right to win in hand with the club ace and immediately lead the diamond jack. If West wins with the ace and continues clubs, you discard two spade losers on dummy's diamond royals, play a trump to the ace and another trump.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Operatic opposition: HBO period drama lifts curtain on Season 2\n\n October 26, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dana Simpson; David Furr and Louisa Jacobson in \"The Gilded Age\" | Page: 29 | Section: News \n \n 475\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Whether first heard as a quippy one-liner from famous New York humorist Fran Leb-owitz (\"Pretend It's a City\") or read in Esther Crain's book \"The Gilded Age in New York, 1870-1910,\" there is little doubt you've heard about New York City's penchant for change. Per Crain's aforementioned book, released in 2016 and available through most major booksellers, \"the most common observation about New York is that it never stops evolving.\"This is especially true in the HBO series \"The Gilded Age,\" premiering Season 2 on its home network and the Max streaming service Sunday, Oct. 29. Starring Carrie Coon (\"Gone Girl,\" 2014), Cynthia Nixon (\"Sex and the City\") and Christine Baranski (\"Mamma Mia!,\" 2008) as some of New York's finest wealthy gossips, the series follows a group of business moguls and socialites as they work hard to make a name for themselves and build an empire in New York City during the turn of the 20th century.Coon stars as Bertha Russell, a \"new money heiress\" who caused some major waves in Season 1 alongside her husband, railroad tycoon George Russell (Morgan Spector, \"The Plot Against America\"), and her fellow socialite Mrs. Caroline Astor (Donna Murphy, \"The Nanny Diaries,\" 2007), the leader of aristocratic social society called The Four Hundred. With her own societal standing foremost in her sights, Bertha often stirs up more trouble than is necessary to get what she wants.Also to blame for her fair bit of trouble is Marian Brook (new talent Louisa Jacobson), who fell on hard times when her father died in the series premiere and began Season 1 by moving into her estranged aunts' house for a bit of a lifestyle makeover in the Big Apple. Marian's aunts, Ada Brook (Nixon) and Agnes Van Rhijn (Baranski), both belong to the old-money world and thus have very particular views on how things should be done among New York's finest. While Marian does her best to please her aunts, she has also learned that not everyone subscribes to her family's conservative school of thought.Returning alongside Coon, Murphy, Jacobson, Nixon and Baranski for Season 2 is Denee Benton (\"UnREAL\"), who plays highly motivated writer Peggy Scott, who moved from Pennsylvania to New York City with Marian. Despite holding down a job as Agnes' secretary, Peggy is of respectable societal standing herself and has come to enjoy the company of her old friend in a new city. She also enjoys testing the boundaries set in place by those in high-up positions, often complicating matters for herself and those closest to her.Headed into the show's second season, the Primetime Emmy-winning series follows more of the petticoat-clad drama that comes along with Gilded-era expansion. This time, according to the official HBO trailer, it seems that the bulk of the hullabaloo centers on the world of the operatic arts. More specifically, it likely revolves around the 1886 closing of the Metropolitan Opera House. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Her yen for trying different sorts of projects is clear again as she stars in the fact-inspired Lifetime movie \"Would You Kill for Me? The Mary Bailey Story,\" debuting Saturday, Oct. 28.As she has done on many of her projects, Hart also serves as an executive producer on the film, in which she plays the matriarch of a family whose women suffer the alcohol-fueled abuse of an outsider. Hart's character Ella sees her daughter Veronica (played by Olivia Scriven) marry Willard (Connor McMahon), whose behavior gets steadily worse - one major indication being his affair with Veronica's best friend, who becomes pregnant by him. Ella's young granddaughter Mary (Presley Allard) also is subjected to the turmoil, until one night that ends fatally.\"Would You Kill for Me? The Mary Bailey Story\" takes a \"Ra-shomon\"-like approach, showing the events from the perspective of each of the female relatives. As the story unfolds, the audience is invited to guess who committed the killing, with that person's identity revealed at the end of the movie.Obviously, this is heavy territory for Hart, but she's been tackling challenging material since the time she was particularly popular with young viewers for her weekly television work. During that period, she portrayed a young woman who manipulated her boyfriend against her parents in \"Twisted Desire\" (1996), one of several people left at the mercy of the sea by a yacht mishap in \"Two Came Back\" (1997), and a college journalist probing her best friend's assault in \"Silencing Mary\" (1998). \n \n Caption: Melissa Joan Hart and Presley Allard in \"Would You Kill for Me?

How long was she on that show?A: The late actress joined the NBC sitcom, set in the Boston bar \"where everybody knows your name,\" in 1992 at the start of the sixth of its 11 seasons. Her character, Rebecca Howe, became the site's manager and effectively assumed the former spot of Diane Chambers (played by Shelley Long) as a romantic interest and verbal sparring partner for bartender Sam Maloine (Ted Danson).Alley already had done a considerable amount of television work by the time she began her \"Cheers\" tenure, including her stints as a non-celebrity contestant on \"Match Game\" and \"Password Plus.\" Her first major acting role was TV-based, as Lt. Saavik in \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" (1982), though that was a theatrical film. She had a brief mid-1980s run in the ABC espionage series \"Masquerade,\" then gained attention in the ABC miniseries \"North and South\" and played iconic feminist Gloria Steinem in the ABC movie \"A Bunny's Tale.\"\"Cheers\" came next for Alley, and most of her extracurricular work during her run on that series leaned toward feature films. She used her hiatus periods from the show to make such movies as \"Shoot to Kill\" (1988), \"Loverboy\" (1989), \"Sibling Rivalry\" (1990) and the three \"Look Who's Talking\" comedies (1989, 1990, 1993). Alley would make several other series, including \"Veronica's Closet\" and \"Kirstie\" (though her character in the latter was named Maddie), later. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

AMC gives the scare show a real workout by showing it Sunday, Oct. 29, Monday, Oct. 30, and Tuesday, Oct. 31 - along with several of the sequels, which were guaranteed when the first movie became one of the most profitable independent films of all time.Recent Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis secured her \"scream queen\" label as Laurie Strode, the babysitter who ends up in a battle for survival against Michael Myers (played mainly by Nick Castle), a sanitarium escapee who targets various people in an Illinois town. Donald Pleasence also stars as the masked and highly lethal Michael's psychiatrist, who does what he can to recapture the killer. Carpenter also composed the memorably minimalist music score. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Experience is recognizing that you have made the same mistake for a second time.Of course, ideally we compress education and experience into one, never making the same mistake twice. However, in the real world, it happens; and it is especially frustrating when it occurs at the bridge table.North's two-no-trump response showed at least a limit raise in spades with four or more trumps. (North would have cue-bid three hearts with only three-card spade support.) South, despite being worried about his heart holding, took a shot at the vulnerable game.West started with three rounds of hearts, East echoing to show his doubleton.South, who had seen the high-low also, was in a dilemma. Should he ruff with dummy's spade 10, hoping West had the jack? Or should he ruff with the queen, hoping the spade jack would drop in one or two rounds? Of course, if South had a trump loser, maybe East would have the club queen, so that South's diamond loser could be discarded on dummy's club ace. Which way should South have gone?As the experienced among you will know, declarer shouldn't ruff high or low. He should discard one of dummy's low diamonds. Then, as long as the trumps aren't 4-0, the contract is under control.Suppose West switches to a diamond. Declarer wins with dummy's ace and draws trumps. Then he ruffs his diamond loser in the dummy, when there is no risk of an overruff.As Mark Twain said, \"The principle of give and take is the principle of diplomacy - give one and take 10.\"©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And having tried everything - from acting to modeling to competitive swimming - before becoming a professional restaurateur, this Peruvian chef certainly has both to share. All-new episodes of \"Hot Dish With Franco\" air Saturdays on Food Network.During this series, \"Franco shares personal heartfelt stories of his Peruvian and Italian roots as he prepares delicious dishes with his signature flare for flavor,\" Food Network describes. \"From quick and easy weeknight meals to brunch and classic Latin dishes with a twist, all of Franco's food is easy, accessible and brings people together.\"Even before the show's premiere, Noriega's enthusiasm for the program was evident. \"Delicious food has always been central in my life as some of my favorite memories have been in the kitchen eating and cooking with my family and traveling across the world enjoying fantastic meals. Now, I'm thrilled to share my favorite recipes and lifelong passion for cooking with Food Network viewers,\" he recently shared.Throughout the series' six half-hour episodes, Food Network promises that \"Franco takes viewers on a culinary journey, sprinkling in tidbits of his Latin American and Italian background along with cooking tips and tricks,\" exploring everything from cheese-covered Arepas with Chorizo and Vegetable Ceviche to Crispy Parmesan Lemon Asparagus, Deconstructed Tiramisu and ooey-gooey Lava Chocolate Chip Cookies in previously aired episodes.During the season's fifth episode, chef Franco invites viewers to taste a Peruvian-inspired feast - what he dubs the perfect comfort food. \"Crispy and fluffy Baby Are-pas with melted cheese and chorizo are the perfect appetizer,\" the episode description promises, \"and there's nothing more comforting than juicy Pollo a la Brasa with crispy skin, smothered in a spicy green sauce. Papas Huancaina with a Spicy Cheese Sauce makes for the perfect side, especially when paired with a Pisco Sour.\"Finally, during the series' upcoming Season 1 finale, Franco tackles brunch, sharing his recipe for piled-high Avocado Toast before crafting an elevated take on Tex-Mex Huevos Rancheros, complete with fried tortilla strips then covered in homemade salsa, refried beans, crema and fried eggs.Bursting with flavor and Franco's signature flair, the Season 1 finale for \"Hot Dish With Franco\" airs Saturday, Nov. 4, on Food Network. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He also wants to honor Christmas, but others don't know how to separate the spirit of that occasion from the Halloween events they're used to, to the degree that a plot to kidnap Santa Claus is hatched. Catherine O'Hara and Paul Reubens - alias \"Pee-wee Herman\" - also are in the voice cast.\"To Catch a Thief\"(MGM+, Sunday, Oct. 29): One of director Alfred Hitchcock's most stylish and lushy filmed pictures, this 1955 treat teams Cary Grant and Grace Kelly - and, quite notably and noticeably, the French Riviera - in the tale of a former jewel thief (Grant) who has a hard time convincing others that he's gotten out of that line of work. Jessie Royce Landis, who played Grant's mother in Hitchcock's \"North by Northwest\" several years later, co-stars.\"The Beverly Hillbillies\"(MeTV, Tuesday, Oct. 31): The nostalgic channel marks Halloween with relatively eerie episodes of some classic series, but there's still room for laughs here in the appropriately titled story \"Trick or Treat.\" Jed (Buddy Ebsen), Granny (Irene Ryan) and the other Clampetts decide it's time to meet their neighbors in Beverly Hills but they choose Halloween to do that, resulting in encounters that are interesting, to say the least. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

My dad recently came to visit me, and I was excited because I hadn't seen him in six months.My excitement was dampened once he got here and had nothing positive to say, just complaints the entire time.He hated my apartment, thought it was too exhausting to walk up the hills in the city and didn't like how expensive the city was.I was really frustrated because I've been loving my life here. I found a small apartment that's in a great location and have been really good at budgeting.Despite his complaints, I decided to try and keep a positive attitude and continue to tour him around the city. I don't want our relationship to be strained, and I want him to see that I'm doing well here.How can I address my dad's negativity and help him see the positive side of my new life in San Franciscoft - Crack a Smile DEAR CRACK A SMILE: Choose the positive.Thank your Dad for coming to visit you and spending time together. Tell him how much you appreciate his effort. Then move on to recapping what you like about your life as you are establishing independence as a young adult.You can leave it at that, or, if you feel so inclined, you can remind him that you are budgeting well in an expensive city. You are enjoying the beauty that the city has to offer, meeting new people and building your life.Your father does not have to love your city, your home or anything else about your life. Just know that his complaints probably are based on his love for you and his knee-jerk reaction to protect you. He may only see that he would find it hard to live there.

Today's deal reminds me of this. It is one of my favorite teaching deals because inexperienced players have trouble believing that \"length before strength\" is valid. They would much prefer to bid an A-K-Q suit than a 6-5-4-3-2 suit.After a predictable first round to the auction, many Souths would pass, refusing to bid a suit as weak as 5-4-3-2. This South, though, knew that any four-card suit is biddable.West applied some pressure with a preemptive raise to three hearts, but he should have bid four hearts with a known 10-card fit. Vulnerability is for children! However, North had sufficient distribution to justify his three-spade bid. Now South showed true courage, raising himself to game. Note that four spades is the only game contract with any chance of success.South won the heart lead (luckily not the club 10!) with his ace and immediately played a trump. East won and led a top heart, forcing the dummy to ruff. However, declarer happily played another round of spades.When they broke 3-2, the contract was under control.Declarer played on diamonds until an opponent ruffed in, losing only three trump tricks.True, it is easier on the nerves to have longer and stronger trumps than these. Still, if you enjoy a three-card majority and the opponents' trumps are dividing 3-2, which they will more than two-thirds of the time, the contract will usually be playable. The many dwarfs will overpower the few giants. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Most players get it wrong. Without peeking at the East-West hands, how would you play the club suit for at most one loser in notrump?North's sequence showed four hearts, at least five clubs and game-going values or more. He announced the \"or more\" when leaping to six no-trump on round three.South starts with 10 top tricks: two spades, four hearts, two diamonds and two clubs. Clearly, he can afford one club loser but not two. All plays work if the missing clubs are divided 3-2. So you must maximize your chances against a 4-1 break.It looks normal to play the club king and another club, winning when East has the singleton nine, jack or queen.However, there is a better play. You should win the diamond lead with dummy's ace and immediately call for the club 10! If East plays the two or three, you play low. If East plays the nine or an honor, you win with the king and return a club, planning to cover West's card.This line works whenever East has the singleton nine, jack or queen, and when West has the singleton nine.The opening sentence was penned by Terence, a second-century B.C.Roman comic poet who wrote in remarkably pure Latin.

Tickets are $20 to $60.The Cirque Italia's Paranormal Cirque III has seductive, hypnotic, sultry acts not associated with the family circus that many onlookers might recall from their childhood. Children under 13 are not allowed and kids 13 to 17 must be accompanied by an adult.Roxana Midi, a native of Romania who will perform as an aerialist in the upcoming shows, is eager to display her talents in an event that the producers readily boast will feature a wide range of performances that circus goers would clearly not view as normal, including acts featuring exotic witches, gruesome ghouls, sexy witches and zombies.\"For me, they main reward comes from the applause that I receive from the audience after a performance,\" Midi said. \"It's hearing the crowd clap and cheer during the show and at the end that really makes all the hard work worthwhile. Paranormal Cirque is not like anything else that is associated with Cirque Italia. It's very dark, it's sensual and it takes people into a dream world.\" Developed by entrepreneur Manuel Rebecchi, the Paranormal Cirque III features the usual array of spectacles associated with the premier circuses in the world, including breathtaking visuals, first-class artists and the latest technological advances in theatrical productions.But it also focuses on the sultry and the terrifying and will not be suitable to younger audiences.\"We're excited to bring this unique and thrilling show to Waldorf,\" said Luisa Nelson, Cirque Italia's marketing and public relations manager in an interview with the Southern Maryland News. \"We've assembled an incredible cast of performers, and we can't wait to showcase their talent to our audiences. This show is perfect for anyone looking for a night of entertainment and scares.\" Midi, who has been performing with the Cirque Italia for eight years after previously honing her talents as a ballroom dancer, likened much of the show to dancing in the air, something that she will do while performing as an aerialist as \"The Dark Angel,\" a character seeking love and compassion.\"We have a lot of good dancers and some of them will be dressed as vampires and others as zombies,\" Midi said. \"Anyone who sees this show will be impressed with the dancing and displays of talent. It's like a burlesque show for acrobats. It's scary and creepy, but at the same time it is also very sexy.\" For more information or to purchase tickets, which cost $20-$60, go to paranormalcirque.com. \n \n Caption: For more information on the Paranormal Cirque check out https://www.paranormalcirque.com/\n \nPHOTOS COURTESY CIRQUE ITALIA/BOO MEDIA\n \nParanormal Cirque III has upcoming shows at Arundel Mills mall and St. Charles Towne Center \n \n Memo: 'It's very dark, it's sensual and it takes people into a dream world.' \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Today's is, of course, one of them. It is another of those deals on which many players would go down because they wouldn't carry out sufficient analysis.After a Stayman auction in which North upgraded his hand because of the singleton, West led the spade jack. Declarer, deciding, reasonably enough, that West wouldn't lead away from the king-jack into a no-trump opening, played low from the dummy. Up popped the king from East.Delightedly, South won with the ace and led a trump.However, West shot in with the ace and returned the spade 10. Declarer covered with dummy's queen, but East ruffed, of course. Back came a trump, and South couldn't avoid the loss of two more spade tricks for down one.When East plays the spade king at trick one, it must be a singleton. If South stops to consider his alternatives, he will realize that ducking his ace is a good play. Then, when West wins with the heart ace and leads another spade, declarer plays low from the dummy. If East ruffs, he is trumping a loser.The spade ace and queen remain to take tricks in a moment. If East doesn't ruff, South wins with the ace and ruffs his two diamond losers in the dummy. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As widower and dad Steve Douglas, the star filmed all of his scenes for a season over the course of two months giving him the rest of the year to do whatever he wanted. That's why he's often seen on the screen by himself here, since other cast members would film their portions later.\"Family Affair\" (Catchy Comedy, Monday, Nov. 5, through Friday, Nov. 9): Executive producer Don Fedderson also was behind \"My Three Sons,\" and he gave this show's Brian Keith the same work arrangement that Fred MacMurray had on the other series - with all of his scenes as orphan-guarding \"Uncle Bill\" Davis compacted into two 30-day blocks for a season. Kathy Garver, Anissa Jones and Johnny Whitaker play Davis' young wards, with Sebastian Cabot as manservant Mr. French.\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (Turner Classic Movies, Friday, Nov. 10): One of the most emotionally grueling house parties ever is the basis of then-debuting director Mike Nichols' 1966 film of the Edward Albee play. Legendary showbiz spouses Eiizabeth Taylor (who won an Oscar here) and Richard Burton get a chance to shatter their glamorous images as an argumentative married couple who put their guests (George Segal and Sandy Dennis, the latter also doing Academy Award-winning work) through quite a wringer during the night they spend together. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Martin back as a series star in \"The Irrational.\" I know he also was in \"Law & Order\" and \"The Flash,\" but has he done any other shows?A: Yes. After appearing on the ABC daytime serial \"One Life to Live\" early in his career, Martin landed a starring role in the short-lived \"413 Hope St.,\" a seriocomic Fox show about a crisis center. He stayed with Fox for a recurring part on \"Ally McBeal\" during its first two seasons, then NBC's \"Law & Order\" came his way, and he appeared in just under 200 episodes over eight years as Detective Ed Green.Martin had another recurring role in the NBC musical-drama series \"Smash\" during its second and final season, then his next long television run - lasting the better part of a decade - with his portrayal of Joe West on The CW's \"The Flash.\" Martin was cast in the \"Irrational\" before his \"Flash\" engagement ended, and he went from regular to recurring status on the superhero show so that he could begin work on \"The Irrational,\" on which he's also a producer.The fact that Martin started work early on \"The Irrational\" is a big reason the show was able to premiere as it normally would have at the start of the fall season, when so many other series were unable to start at the usual time because of the actors' and writers' strikes that prevented production from taking place. Enough \"Irrational\" episodes had been banked by the time the strikes began to enable the program to have the September start that it always was planned for. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trivial pursuit: New comedy film 'Quiz Lady' wins big\n\n November 2, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Sarah Passingham | Page: 9A | Section: News \n \n 555\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Fingers on buzzers! Which streamer premieres a brand-new comedy film starring Awkwafina (\"Renfield,\" 2023) and Sandra Oh (\"Grey's Anatomy\") on Friday, Nov. 3? The answer is Hulu, and the film in question is \"Quiz Lady,\" a buddy comedy about two sisters who come together to win a quiz show and save a dog.Awkwafina is Anna, the reliable, type-A sister who is called away from her work as an accountant when her mom's senior living facility reaches out to let Anna know that they had lost her mom - but not to the afterlife.The attendant corrects herself in the trailer, telling Anna, \"Sorry, that was terrible phrasing. I meant we don't know where she is.\" After making it to the facility, Anna is joined by her estranged and distraught sister Jenny, portrayed by Oh, whose purple highlights, oversized sunglasses and flamboyant personal style contrast with Anna's head-to-toe grey wardrobe. Anna is clued in to her mother's whereabouts when a bookie informs her that her beloved pet pug, Mr. Linguini, has been kidnapped and is being held hostage over her mother's massive gambling debts.With the debts creeping up her back and seniors home infractions stacking up, Anna and Jenny's mom flees to Macau, leaving them to sort out what she owes and be reunited with Mr. Linguini. Anna's salary isn't quite generous enough to settle their mother's $80,000 tab, and Jenny's constant search for her latest passion hasn't resulted in financial stability. Two weeks is all they're given to cough up the funds.The siblings are at a loss for ways to get rich quick until Jenny sees Anna participate in her favorite game show, \"Can't Stop the Quiz,\" from her sofa. The show is must-watch television for Anna, who tunes in daily, usually accompanied by her canine companion, and effortlessly answers every single question correctly. Seeing Anna in her element turns on a light bulb over Jenny's head.It's decided, then, that the pair will travel to Los Angeles, get Anna on \"Can't Stop the Quiz,\" and all their problems will be solved when she wins. Leaving the safety of her routine life in Philadelphia behind, Anna joins Jenny on a wild road trip across the United States and embraces her sister's chaotic, adventurous way of life. Neither of them is completely certain that Anna's trivia skills will transfer from the comfort of her couch to the pressure of the game show's set, but this is the best chance they've got to scrape together enough money to bring Mr. Linguini home unharmed.Having spent years apart, estranged over their differences, Anna and Jenny have a lot of ground to cover - geographically and emotionally - on their road trip. Anna's strictly balanced life greatly differs from her sister Jenny's listless pursuit of purpose. They have things to learn from each other, whether it's how to let loose and go on an adventure or focus enough to successfully achieve a goal.\"The element that really attracted me was the sister dynamic,\" director Jessica Yu told Deadline at the world premiere of \"Quiz Lady\" at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. She added, \"For one thing, I just haven't seen a lot of comedies about sisters, and the fact that at the center of this was two Asian-American sisters, made me think, 'Oh, this will be really fun to explore.'\" \n \n Caption: Sandra Oh and Awkwafina in \"Quiz Lady\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Netflix's 'Sly' charts Sylvester Stallone's life and career\n\n November 2, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: 12A | Section: News \n \n 315\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The saga of Sylvester Stallone continues to add new chapters, but he already has quite a story to tell.The actor-writer-director - famous for creating his own fame as the originator of the \"Rocky\" franchise - is the subject of \"Sly,\" a Netflix documentary that makes its streaming debut Friday, Nov. 3, after premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival in September.Directed by Thom Zimny, who also has done projects about Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash, the profile is built on a wealth of Stallone's remarks about the triumph and setbacks he has experienced in his personal and professional lives. Family members also contribute comments, as do Stallone colleagues and friends Arnold Schwarzenegger and Henry Winkler, and filmmaker Quentin Tarantino.Born in New York's Hell's Kitchen in 1946, Stallone made one of his first notable appearances as a subway-train hoodlum in Woody Allen's \"Bananas\" (1971), and he gained some attention in \"The Lords of Flatbush\" (1974) opposite Winkler and in \"Death Race 2000\" (1975). His breakthrough clearly was the original \"Rocky\" (1976), which he wrote and insisted on starring in himself, with the huge success of the saga of a struggling Philadelphia boxer winning its year's Oscar for best picture. It also yielded five direct sequels and inspired the \"Creed\" series, with \"First Blood\" (1982) giving Stallone another continuing character in famously rugged Vietnam veteran John Rambo.Stallone remained a box-office king for years afterward, with \"Cobra\" (1986), \"Tango & Cash\" (1989), \"Cliffhanger\" (1993), \"Demolition Man\" (1993), \"The Specialist\" (1994) and \"The Expendables\" (2010) among the bigger hits that sustained his career when such efforts as \"Oscar\" (1991) and \"Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot\" (1992) didn't register strongly by comparison.The star picked up critical acclaim for pictures including \"Cop Land\" (1997), and he became an Oscar nominee for reprising (and aging) the Rocky role in the first \"Creed\" movie (2015). \n \n Caption: Sylvester Stallone stars in \"Sly\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In 2018 they released their first full-length album, \"A Heart Never Knows.\" They now perform at many venues and festivals across the United States as well as in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Canada.Other band members include Trevor Holder on banjo, bassist Bobby Osborne Jr. and guitarist Conner Vlietstra.The next concert in the series will feature an all-Christmas program on Dec. 10 with the Becky Buller Band featuring Ned Luberecki. Other performances planned for early 2024 will be by Lonesome River Band on Jan. 14, The Grascals on Feb. 11, High Fidelity on March 3, Russell Moore & IIIrd Tyme Out will perform March 24 and Dave Peterson & 1946 will close out the series April 28.Tickets for The Price Sisters are $23 per person, free for ages 12 and younger with a paid adult.Doors open at noon and food and beverages will be available for purchase.For more information, call 301-737-3004 or go to www.somdbluegrass.com. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED PHOTO\n \nKentucky-based The Price Sisters will kick off the Southern Maryland Bluegrass Series with a concert on Nov. 5 at the Calvert Elks Lodge. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He knew of an eight-card fit and, more importantly, the potential blockage in the heart suit might prove to be lethal to three no-trump.

It is impossible to bid perfectly on every deal without seeing all of the cards.West, with an unappealing lead, selected a trump.Declarer won in hand, played a diamond to dummy's ace and finessed the club queen.West won with the king and played his second heart.Declarer continued with the diamond king and another diamond, but East won and led a third round of hearts.Now South had to go down one, losing one spade, two diamonds and one club.The club queen was a red herring.

One of the best known ways of keeping them intact is \"second hand low.\" Why rush up when your partner is last to play to the trick?This week, let's look at the times when your problem is deciding between second hand high and low.First, second hand low. A textbook example is in this deal. How should the play go in six spades after West leads the heart king?If North were a member of the Real Bridge Players Don't Need Blackwood Club, he would jump straight to six spades. Here, he uses Roman Key Card Blackwood to learn that his partner has either two aces or one ace and the spade king.Declarer wins the first trick with dummy's heart ace, cashes the three diamond winners, discarding his remaining heart, ruffs the heart four in his hand and leads a club toward dummy's king-jack.West must play second hand low -- and do it with no hesitation. He should know that his side needs two club tricks to defeat the contract. He must not give declarer the contract on a platter with caviar, lobster and toast points.Then, if declarer calls for dummy's king, West will say: \"Sorry, partner. Next time I will lead a low club, which will surely cause South to misguess.\"©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They must not make things easy for him.The heart suit in this deal is one example. How should South plan the play in six spades? West leads the diamond 10.After South opened one spade, North understandably launched into Blackwood, signing off in six spades when he learned that one ace was missing. He expected South to claim immediately, but the mirror distribution meant that play had to proceed.South, who can afford to lose only one heart trick, wins trick one in the dummy, draws trumps, cashes all of the minor-suit winners ending in his hand and leads a heart. If West wins with the ace, it is all over. So, let's assume West plays low. Now South calls for dummy's heart queen. (This is a better play than immediately finessing dummy's 10.) If East takes the trick, he is endplayed, forced either to return a heart into dummy's K-10 or to concede a ruffand-sluff. So, let's assume East also plays low.Declarer returns to his hand with a trump and leads another heart. Again, if West wins with the ace, South claims. When West plays low, though, declarer has a guess. He might or might not get it right, but at least the defender with the ace - whether it is East or West - did his best.Finally, note that both West and East must play low so smoothly that the kibitzers think the deck is missing the heart ace. Any hesitation gives the game away. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is a trump contract. Dummy has a sidesuit singleton, and in that suit you have the ace without the king or queen. You know what will happen. Declarer will get into the dummy and call for that singleton. Do you win with your ace, or do you play low smoothly?North, despite having six losers (one spade, two hearts, two diamonds and one club), blasted into Blackwood and then leapt to six spades. A four-club splinter bid would have been a wiser choice - if North-South were using that toy, of course. (Four clubs would have shown fourcard or longer spade support, at least game values and a singleton or void in the bid suit.)A diamond lead would have defeated the contract by two tricks, but West understandably selected the heart queen. Declarer won with dummy's king and called for the club seven.East was immediately on the spot. What should he have done?If the ace is the setting trick, he (almost always) should grab the trick. But far more often than not, second hand should play low, not win with the ace. This deal is a tough example. Although South has no guess in the suit, if East wins with his ace, the contract makes. Declarer gets two club winners, on which he discards dummy's two low diamonds. He takes five spades, two hearts, one diamond, two clubs and two diamond ruffs in the dummy.Luckily for the defense, East had been there before: He played low smoothly. That cost one club trick, but two diamond tricks come back in return. The declarer had no chance. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Out of this world TV: Season 4 of 'For All Mankind' enters new millennium\n\n November 9, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dana Simpson | Page: A9 | Section: News \n \n 425\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Whether it takes \"one small step\" or \"one giant leap\" to get to your couch, do it \"For All Mankind.\" The hit Apple TV+ television series \"For All Mankind\" is back for a fourth season Friday, Nov. 10, after taking a yearand-a-half-long hiatus. With one Primetime Emmy win under its belt already, the sci-fidrama's newest season is comprised of another 10 episodes, thus bringing the total episode count for the series to a whopping 40.The series first made (gravitational?) waves when it premiered on its home streamer in 2019. Marketed as an alternate version of 1969, in which \"the Soviet Union beats the United States to the moon\" (per IMDb), the series reimagines history and speculates how this one change in events could have sparked a whole new world order. Largely focused on the political and scientific ramifications of the then-U.S.S.R. making history on the moon, \"For All Mankind\" Season 1 leaned into the idea of a space race that \"continues on for decades with still grander challenges and goals.\" With the premiere of Season 2 in February 2021, the astronauts faced an all-new set of challenges that took place more than a decade after the moon landing. Having confronted everything from lunar ice and trespassers to gender debates in Season 1, the next two seasons promised higher stakes and bigger problems. And on this promise it surely delivered.From natural disasters such as solar storms and generally harsh living conditions to personal qualms ranging from reckless and selfish behavior to ego-based contests and grand political motivations, there has never been a dull moment on the screen - or in the lives of \"For All Mankind's\" fictionalized astronauts and their families.One of these astronauts is Edward Baldwin, played by \"The Killing's\" Joel Kinnaman. The head of the Baldwin family, which has seen some serious struggles throughout the show's three seasons to date, Ed is one of NASA's best astronauts and is rumored to have been based upon real-life Apollo 10 commander Thomas P. Stafford.While Ed has been supported by several family members over the years, including Karen (Shantel VanSanten, \"Shooter\"), Kelly (Cynthy Wu, \"Holidate,\" 2020) and Shane (played by brothers Teddy and Tait Blum, \"Big Little Lies\" and \"Shooter,\" respectively), the only confirmed Baldwin returning (other than Ed) is Kelly.Joining Ed in space and on Earth are returning characters Ellen Wilson (Jodi Balfour, \"Quarry\"), Margo Madison (Wrenn Schmidt, \"Nope,\" 2022), Danielle Poole (Krys Marshall, \"Supergirl\"), Helios Aerospace founder Dev Ayesa (Edi Gathegi, \"The Blacklist\") and Aleida Rosales (Coral Peña, \"The Post,\" 2017). \n \n Caption: Wrenn Schmidt in \"For All Mankind\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This year, the U.S. is entering 24-year-old Noelia Voigt of Park City, Utah.The program features events that will eventually select a winner, a process including personal statements, interviews, evening gowns and swimwear.The winner takes office immediately after coronation, becoming an ambassador for a year, spreading the organization's positive message and humanitarian works, including fighting for women's ethnic minority rights, racial issues, public health issues and environmental issues.Winners also receive a cash allowance and other perks, such as scholarships, modeling opportunities, beauty products, clothes, styling, fitness services and more.The organization claims: \"Miss Universe Organization exists to advocate for a future forged by women - women with the courage to push the limits of what's possible, who are curious enough to make world-shaking discoveries and audacious enough to do this over and over. We believe that the future of humanity rests on reaching gender equity around the world.\" The \"72nd Miss Universe\" pageant airs live, Saturday, Nov. 18, on the Roku Channel. \n \n Caption: R'Bonney Gabriel, Miss Universe 71 \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Notable among the guest stars are Tom Bosley (\"Happy Days\"), entrepreneur Mark Cuban and rock musician Joan Jett.\"A Few Good Men\" (AMC, Monday, Nov. 13): \"You can't handle the truth!\" Or maybe you can, especially if you're familiar with Aaron Sorkin's play or director Rob Reiner's 1992 movie version about two soldiers (Wolfgang Bodison, James Marshall) on trial for the alleged \"Code Red\" hazing of one of their peers - supposedly on the orders of their stern commander (a great Jack Nicholson).Tom Cruise, Demi Moore and Kevin Pollak play the defendants' military lawyers. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

What's his next project going to be?A: His next project is going to be taking it easy, and enjoying being a granddad.The legendary English actor told the BBC last month that, at 90 years old, he's now officially retired.He said so while doing press for what will now be his last movie, \"The Great Escaper,\" a biographical drama about a war veteran who escapes his retirement home to attend the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in France. It was released in early October.It's been well received so far, and Caine said he's unlikely to get another leading-man role again at his age. \"The only parts I'm likely to get now are old men, 90-year-old men, maybe 85. And I thought, 'Well, I might as well leave with all this - I've got wonderful reviews. What have I got to do to beat this?'\" It caps off an incredible career that launched with small parts in war movies in the mid-1950s. But he really got on the map in the mid-'60s with young, heartthrob roles in hits like \"The Ipcress File\" (1965) and \"Alfie\" (1966).He kept up an incredible work rate even into his 80s, appearing, for example, in three different films in 2020 alone (the fantasy drama \"Come Away,\" the kid-friendly comedy \"Four Kids and It\" and the smash-hit sci-fithriller \"Tenet\").But he told People magazine a little while ago that becoming a grandfather changed his view of life and ultimately overshadowed his career. \"I am completely besotted by my grandchildren. It's my best role, and I don't need any awards for it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

However, there are three critical positions when second hand must play high, like it or not!With that enormous hint, it shouldn't be hard to work out in this deal how the defense can defeat three no-trump after West leads the heart queen.When someone opens two no-trump, his hand will usually contain seven controls, an ace being two controls and a king one.Here, South had eight controls, with which he might have upgraded and opened two clubs. However, he had no five-card suit or good intermediates (nines and 10s). He sensibly started with two no-trump.South had seven top tricks: one spade, two hearts, three diamonds and one club. So, even if diamonds were 3-3, declarer needed to make something of dummy's club suit.South won the first trick with his heart king and immediately led a club.West's big moment had arrived: He had to play second hand high, putting his king onto the table.Note that if West had played his low club, declarer would have called for dummy's nine. Whether East won with his queen or ducked, South would have gotten four club tricks and 10 in all.However, when West played his club king, declarer was caught between a rock and a hard place. If he had ducked in the dummy, another heart would have established West's suit. Instead, when South won with dummy's ace and played another club, East ducked, holding declarer to a pair of club tricks. With the diamonds 4-2, not 3-3, the contract had to fail. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

FX shows the film Saturday, Nov. 17, and even with editing done for basic cable, it remains one of the most tense and troubling sci-fimovies made to date. Its realistic, understated approach in the early going has the effect of softening up the audience for what's to come.Ripley is one member of a deep-space crew that investigates a distress signal and picks up a highly unwelcome visitor the title creature, which grows into something larger and increasingly lethal as it runs amok within the vessel named Nostromo after making quite an explosive entrance. (Anyone familiar with one co-star's big exit scene will know what we're talking about.)Tom Skerritt, Yaphet Kotto, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton and Veronica Cartwright comprise the rest of the cast. \n \n Caption: Sigourney Weaver in \"Alien\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He famously appeared with his former fellow stars in the 2021 streaming special \"Friends: The Reunion,\" which still can be found on Max, and it's quite touching to watch the embraces and memories shared by him and the other five actors with whom he shared so much time - and success - over the decade-long run of that much-repeated show (which was seen originally on NBC).LeBlanc also was part of a 2021 \"Top Gear\" special that paid tribute to the late race driver Sabine Schmitz, who appeared often on that BBC series. LeBlanc's presence on that special acknowledged his own presence on \"Top Gear\" as a presenter on episodes that were spread over four seasons, after his participation as a guest. He was required to be in England to make the show, and he ultimately decided to leave that job and remain largely in the U.S.It's not new for LeBlanc to take extended breaks from television work.He also did that after the NBC run of the \"Friends\" spinoff \"Joey,\" and what was planned as one year off became five, with the actor eventually returning (and playing a variation of himself) in the Showtime comedy series \"Episodes.\" He won a Golden Globe Award for that show, then he spent four seasons on \"Man With a Plan.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

From Amazon Studios and ITV America's ITV Entertainment comes a new dating reality series - a social experiment unlike any other, delving into the dating world of identicals. The Amazon Freevee series \"Twin Love\" premieres Friday, Nov. 17, on Prime Video.The series, hosted by professional wrestling duo Brie and Nikki Garcia (\"WWE Smackdown!\"), formerly the Bella Twins, welcomes a cast full of doubles. Amazon Prime describes: \"Ten sets of twins will be split up and placed into two houses of 'identical' casts, where they'll begin a unique and compelling search for love. With double the fun and drama, the series will discover if their inherent similarities extend to their romantic desires.\" \"When separated from their twin brothers and sisters - some for the first time ever - will they pursue the same identical partners?\" Amazon asks. \"Or will their choices be dramatically different?\" There's only one way to find out.During this inaugural season, twins include: Whittnay and Brittnay James, who have both been single for over four years; Sabella and Hanna Radostitz, with matching tattoos for former boyfriends they now regret; Cameron and Ceara McKegney, a pair of opposites who still share in their quick-witted and entertaining personalities; Zoie and Baelee Bogart, twin sisters who have never been apart for more than a day; Morgan and Madison Ramsey, two self-proclaimed tomboys who mind their manners; Seth and Luke Banks, the chatterbox brothers, both golfers from a big family; Jair and Micquel Bernier, two confident and popular, party-going jocks; Matthew and Andrew Beatty, who have lived all over the world, making friends globally with their outgoing personalities; Samir and Samer Akel, twins born in Syria who moved to the United States 10 years ago, now successful restaurateurs; and David and Aaron Cabello, both high school dropouts who started their own business that quickly spread across America.From executive producers Simon Thomas (\"Love Island\"), Bernie Schaeffer (\"Edge of Alaska\"), Kenny Rosen (\"Hell's Kitchen\") and Jessica Nahmias (\"The Marriage Pact\"), \"Twin Love\" premieres Friday, Nov. 17, on Prime Video. \n \n Caption: Brie and Nikki Garcia (middle) with the cast of \"Twin Love\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Packed with holiday cheer and tasty treats, an all-new season of \"Christmas Cookie Challenge\" is now airing on the network.Hosted by former NFLplayer, current \"Food Network Star\" (Season 11), food truck owner and private chef Eddie Jackson, alongside writer, photographer, cookie-making mom and experienced cooking show host, Ree Drummond (\"The Pioneer Woman\"), this series follows as \"confident and daring bakers compete to prove their holiday cookie-making skills,\" Food Network describes, promising that as four new bakers are introduced each episode, \"tough-love judges are on hand to crown the holiday cookie master, [each of whom] will go home with a $10,000 prize!\" From gingerbread to snickerdoodles to swirly-twirly gumdrops, the series whips up cheer and inspires bakers back at home. The competing cookie makers are tasked with fun challenges, like crafting usable gingerbread puppet theaters, decorating snickerdoodles and even paying homage to classic Christmas films such as \"Elf\" (2003), starring Will Ferrell.\"Four of the finest cookie makers around get inspired by 'the seven levels of the candy cane forest' and 'the sea of swirly-twirly gumdrops,'\" Food Network explains, \"[creating] cookies that show the parts of Buddy's journey not featured in the movie. When it's over, one 'cotton-headed ninny muggin' will be sent home for the holidays, while the one who decorates the most fantastical journey will win an advantage for the next round.\" \"Their magical displays will have to incorporate ingredients from Buddy the Elf's favorite meal: maple syrup, chocolate syrup, candy-coated chocolates, chocolate breakfast pastries or cooked spaghetti,\" they say, encouraging some interesting flavors.This current season will also feature an all-star episode, set to air Thursday, Nov. 16, on the network.During this \"Champions\" episode, Jackson and Drummond welcome eight former \"Christmas Cookie Challenge\" champions back to the kitchen, asking them to prove who is the best of the best.\"This time, the cookie makers are facing challenges so merrily massive that they'll be put into teams of two.First, the bakers must weave magic as they create Christmas cookie quilts.One team will have the rug pulled out from under them as they're eliminated.Then, the three remaining teams construct gigantic stadiums worthy of the finest North Pole games that also incorporate ingredients perfect for watching a snow bowl: eggnog, hot chocolate, apple cider or mulled wine\" (per Food Network).Keep the holidays extra sweet with \"Christmas Cookie Challenge,\" airing new episodes Thursdays on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Ree Drummond and Eddie Jackson from \"Christmas Cookie Challenge\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Of course I am afraid. What sane man is not?\" Today's deal illustrates a time when a player sitting second hand must not be afraid to play high.South is in three no-trump, and West leads the spade queen. What happens after that?Opposite a 15-17 notrump, when responder has 10 points, no interest in the majors and no singleton or void, he should just blast straight into three no-trump.(When your minimum combined count is 25, bid game. When your maximum combined count is 25, settle for one no-trump unless you also have a five-card suit.)South has seven top tricks: two spades, three hearts and two clubs. He must establish two diamond tricks to get home.When declarer has two stoppers in the suit led and two high cards to dislodge, normally he should duck the first trick. (He could win the first trick here as long as he ducks the second round of spades.) After taking dummy's spade ace at trick two, South calls for a diamond.East knows that his partner's suit is one lead from being established. When this is the situation, he should do his utmost to win the next defensive trick. Here, East must play his diamond king. Then, when he holds the trick, he can lead his last spade. West's suit is established, and West has the diamond ace as his entry card. The defenders take two diamonds and three spades.Note that if East does not play his diamond king, West's ace will be gone before his spade suit is ready to run. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You might be surprised by some of the opening leads they find. For example, they would do a lot better if they always led fourth-highest from their longest and strongest against no-trump (not a minor-suit singleton, which I have seen a few times).In today's deal, though, the robot found a terrific opening lead. West dealt and passed. South opened one spade in fourth position, North responded one notrump, and South rebid two spades, ending the auction. What would you lead as West?South's rebid showed a minimum opening with at least six spades. No one else felt called on to compete. However, if East is psychic, he can make three no-trump! Against two spades, it looks obvious to lead the heart ace. That isn't fatal, but suppose West shifts to the diamond queen. Declarer wins with dummy's ace and plays its trump. Now at double dummy (you can see all of the cards), East must play his spade queen!At my table, though, West made life much easier for his side. The robot led the club six. East ruffed with the spade seven and returned a heart. West took that trick and delivered a second club ruff. West got back in with the heart ace and gave his partner a third club ruff.That was a quick five tricks for East-West, but where was the sixth defensive trick?Right -- West's spade 10, hiding behind the king-jack, was guaranteed to take the setting trick. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You might think that experts never fall from grace in this respect, but you would be wrong.Today's deal comes from a match between two different countries. How should South play in six hearts after West leads the diamond five?At the other table, North-South stopped in four hearts, making five. This pair was more adventurous. Three diamonds was a transfer bid, East doubling to show good diamonds. Throwing caution to the winds, North rebid a quantitative four notrump.(If he had wanted to ask for aces or key cards immediately, he would have used a Texas transfer at the four-level.) South, despite having minimum count and two diamond losers, took a shot at the slam.The declarer won the first trick with his diamond ace and drew trumps in three rounds. Then he paused to assess the situation - too late.He should have noted that he had only 11 winners: three spades, five hearts, one diamond and two clubs. It was necessary to capture a third club winner.The right line is to draw only two rounds of trumps, keeping an honor in the South hand. Then declarer plays off his three top spades, discarding one of dummy's clubs. A club to the ace, a club to the king and a club ruff follow. South, thankful to see the 3-3 split, plays a trump to his jack (or king) and cashes the club nine, discarding one of dummy's diamond losers. He concedes just one diamond trick. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "French food frenzy: Julia Child takes the cake in 'Chopped'\n\n November 16, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Caroline Col | Page: 14A | Section: News \n \n 392\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Sixteen chefs, one iconic kitchen: an all-new season of this fan-favorite cooking competition honors one of the greatest names in cooking, as \"Chopped\" returns with new Julia Child-inspired episodes. \"Chopped: Julia Child's Kitchen\" airs new episodes Tuesdays on Food Network.\"Julia Child was a chef, instructor, author and legend! Even today she influences modern chefs to achieve greatness and push themselves to be their best,\" Food Network recently shared. \"In this competition, four Julia Child fans compete in a preliminary battle with baskets inspired by Julia's recipes.\" Keeping to the same format as usual \"Chopped\" seasons, this \"Child-ish\" competition features three rounds, in which four chefs must use random and often unusual \"mystery basket ingredients\" to complete a tasty dish. Each round, one chef is eliminated until only two remain, together facing the judges in the final dessert round, where one is finally crowned the winner.This - \"Chopped's\" 55th season - will feature a panel of rotating judges, said to include the likes of Scott Conant (chef, host of \"24 Hour Restaurant Battle\"), Susan Feniger (\"Too Hot Tamales\"), Amanda Freitag (\"Iron Chef America\"), Alex Guarnaschelli (\"Ciao House\"), Nilou Motamed (\"Top Chef\"), Michael Voltaggio (\"Bobby's Triple Threat\") and Isabella Rossellini (who stars in \"Julia,\" premiering its second season two days later on Max). Each episode will also see the arrival of four new chefs, with each winner moving on to the tournament's finale, where the final four will fight for a grand prize of $25,000 and a Julia Childthemed dream trip to France.Upcoming episodes of the series feature bright and bold flavors - some Julia herself would never approve of - as the series' second episode promises that \"citrus and a salad are part of the puzzle in the appetizer round, and the three chefs who make it to the entrée round must make use of some unusual powder and fancy mushrooms,\" while a description for the third episode shares that: \"The chefs get an unusual piece of chicken and a potato product that would have made Julia cringe.\" However, in a season featuring fish stew, veal, processed cheese and more, host Ted Allen learns that the stinkiest thing of all might just be his cohorts' Julia Child impressions.As the chefs continue their journeys to France - and practice their accents - \"Chopped: Julia Child's Kitchen\" premieres an allnew episode, Tuesday, Nov. 21, on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Ted Allen from \"Chopped: Julia Child's Kitchen\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "All The Leaves Are Red, Yellow, and Orange - Top U.S. Destinations For Leaf Peeping And Other Fall Adventure\n\n November 16, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Pollick; Wealth Of Geeks | Page: 4A | Section: News \n \n 950\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The pumpkin spice lattes are flowing, and post-Halloween pumpkins are getting chunked.But there's still interest in family road trips, especially to destinations where the annual changing of the leaves is at its peak.A study by lawn care specialist LawnStarter reveals the top states for leaf peeping and other fall-related activities. Beyond Oktoberfest and Halloween, many cities offer harvest festivals as local crops come into season. Others organize arts and crafts shows or music festivals, while local wineries debut their latest releases.The allure of fall foliage may put cars on the road, but the states on LawnStarter's shortlist have found creative ways to reward visitors for their interest.TOP FIVE STATES FOR VIEWING FALL FOLIAGECaliforniaCalifornia ranks at or near the top in virtually every metric used in the LawnStarter study. It has the most national parks, the most scenic drives, and the most Fall-related attractions. Outside of Sacramento, Apple Hill features over 50 local farms and a fall festival with apple cider donuts and u-pick pumpkin and apple venues. The Napa Valley is famous for its fall foliage, along with wine tastings and grape stomping adventures.New YorkOne measurement used in the LawnStarter study was the number of peak days for the leaf-watching season. New York ranked highest, with a total of 31 days of ideal leaf peeping available. New York is also home to the Finger Lakes, renowned for their cideries. Other points of interest include the Adirondacks and the Catskills for hiking and historical towns such as Sleepy Hollow for ghost chasing.WashingtonWashington State's mountainous and forested terrain offers adventurous foliage seekers over 12 weeks of peak viewing time. Besides a generous number of hiking trails and national parks, visitors to Washington State can also visit the alpinethemed village of Leavenworth for its Autumn Leaf Festival and enjoy adult beverages at local wineries.MichiganMichigan's extended foliage viewing season of 12 weeks makes it very appealing for Midwesterners who seek a more local destination than coastal states. Michigan also has a high number of cideries, ranking second overall in the Lawn-Starter study. A scenic drive north of Harbor Springs is known as the Tunnel of Trees and offers travelers breathtaking views of hardwood trees and their colorful leaves. The Pumpkin Train is another popular Fall-related attraction located in western Michigan.PennsylvaniaPennsylvania's abundance of undeveloped forests helps land it in the fifth position on the Lawn-Starter survey. The view of tree-covered hills and rolling pastures has enticed visitors for literally hundreds of years. The Pocono Mountains host the annual Jim Thorpe Fall Foliage Festival, a ghost tour, and a scenic train ride.THE BEST TIME TO GO LEAF PEEPINGWhile the first leaves may start to change as early as mid-September, the peak Fall foliage season doesn't generally arrive until the middle to late part of October, when air temperatures also begin to drop in many regions. The most colorful part of the transition is often over by Thanksgiving, as leaves fade to brown and trees become bare.Min Park, Ph.D., Academic Program Coordinator School of Sport, Recreation, and Tourism Management at George Mason University, says, \"In general, fall foliage peaks in most parts of the nation in mid-October through mid-November.Some mountains in the northwest are often at their most colorful in mid-September to early October.\"As I live in Virginia, Virginia's Shenandoah National Park is one of the best for fall colors. The best time to experience gorgeous fall colors in Shenandoah National Park is in October. Visitors can make the scenic cruise along the 105-mile-long Skyline Drive, which offers 70 overlooks where travelers can hop out of the car for a better view of foliage with red, yellow, and orange leaves.\".FALL FESTIVALS AND OTHER ATTRACTIONSEven if fall foliage is not at its peak or travel options are limited, there are still many Autumnal activities individuals and families can enjoy. In many areas of the country, the temperatures and climate are still favorable for camping, hiking, and attending outdoor festivals.Rosa Abreu, Assistant Professor, Hospitality Management, New York City College of Technology, offers her suggestions for a satisfying fall-related excursion. \"Stay in a place that has a fire pit and roast marshmallows. Have a few drinks by the fire. Go glamping. Pumpkin and apple picking is always fun.\" Other fall-related festivals and destinations you might want to check out include: Morton Pumpkin Festival, Morton, Illinois The village of Morton, Illinois, produces almost all of the canned pumpkin products in the international market. The village considers itself to be the pumpkin capital of the world and celebrates annually with the Morton Pumpkin Festival in September.Salem, Massachusetts, Haunted ToursThe small coastal city of Salem, Massachusetts, has become a popular fall destination because of its association with the Salem witch trials. The city hosts several festivals throughout the fall season and guided tours of local landmarks.Vermont's Sugarhouses and Maple SyrupThe state of Vermont supplies over half of the country's maple syrup, and the fall months are the best time to watch the process unfold. Numerous sugarhouses in Vermont provide guided tours of their facilities, and guests also enjoy a taste of small-town New England life.World's Largest Corn Maze, Spring Grove, Illinois Corn mazes, hayrides, and harvest festivals are always popular destinations for families, and Richardson Farm in Spring Grove, Illinois, offers over 9 miles of hayride trails and mazes on its 28-acre cornfield.This article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n \n Caption: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/FLEMMING CHRISTIANSEN\n \nThere are plenty of places locally, across Maryland as well as travel spots nationally to check out autumn leaves and fall events.\n \nWIKIMEDIA COMMONS/LIZ WEST\n \nNew England is a popular destination to enjoy the sights of fall and the changing of the leaves \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Compounding that challenge is the strike that Archie's union calls, something he tries to keep from Edith (Jean Stapleton), unaware that she already knows about it.\"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\" (MeTV, Sunday, Nov. 19): The animated specials based on Charles M. Schulz's perpetually popular comic strip \"Peanuts\" proved so popular, their makers decided to go the big-screen route with them as well, making this the first of the franchise's several feature films. The 1969 release finds hapless Charlie Brown (voiced by Peter Robbins, reprising the job he'd had since \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\") a contestant in the National Spelling Bee.\"Runaway Train\" (MGM+ Hits, Wednesday, Nov. 22): Jon Voight gives an uncompromisingly gritty performance in director Andrei Konchalovsky's terrific 1985 thriller, which builds mightily upon the supposedly simple premise promised by the title. Voight and Eric Roberts (both Oscar-nominated here) play escaped convicts who hop aboard a locomotive, expecting a ride to freedom - but when circumstances send it out of control, they end up hurtling toward what could be their fate instead. Rebecca De Mornay also gets dirty, quite literally, as a railroad worker also trapped aboard the train. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Their discovery of an enormous family secret seems destined to unite all the parties or drive them farther apart but since this is Hallmark Channel, take a guess at which outcome prevails. The script is by \"Dateline NBC\" correspondent Andrea Canning, who has written a number of movies for both Hallmark Channel and Lifetime, and author Audrey Schulman (\"The Dolphin House\").Both Chabert and Wolf are familiar with the Hallmark brand of holiday tales, since both stars also have done them in the past. Wolf starred with Kristin Chenoweth in the 2019 film \"A Christmas Love Story,\" and Chabert is unquestionably one of the queens of such projects, having made at least one annually for a number of years.Among her seasonal Hallmark stories have been \"A Royal Christmas\" (2014), \"A Christmas Melody\" (2015), \"A Wish for Christmas\" (2016), \"The Sweetest Christmas\" (2017), \"Pride, Prejudice and Mistletoe\" (2018), \"Christmas in Rome\" (2019), \"Christmas Waltz\" (2020), \"Christmas at Castle Hart\" (2021) and \"Haul Out the Holly\" (2022). (The latter movie has a new sequel, the Chabert-starring \"Haul Out the Holly: Lit Up,\" which Hallmark Channel will debut Nov. 25.) \n \n Caption: Lacey Chabert stars in \"A Merry Scottish Christmas\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Which were the first and last ones he madeftA: The first was \"Love Me Tender\" (1956), which actually was renamed from the original \"The Reno Brothers\" to coordinate with the title song, a giant hit for Presley that he performed in the film. He played one of the Reno siblings during the Civil War, youngest brother Clint, who tended to the homefront while his brothers fought in the battle. Top-billed Richard Egan portrayed the oldest brother, while the role of another Reno was filled by James Drury, later to become \"The Virginian\" on weekly TV.Presley's final film as an actor was \"Change of Habit\" (1969), casting him as an inner-city doctor who became enamored of a colleague - unaware that she was a nun working incognito.The picture's leading lady was Mary Tyler Moore, in the last movie she made under a contract with Universal Pictures.Interestingly, another co-star (as a cop) was Edward Asner, a year before he and Moore began their legendary TV work together on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" he also had worked earlier with Presley in \"Kid Galahad\" (1962).If it's Presley's last movie overall that you're looking for, though, that would be the concert attraction \"Elvis on Tour\" (1972) - which earned its year's Golden Globe Award for best documentary film.Hampton Roads and Richmond in Virginia were among the stops featured, as were Jacksonville, Fla., and San Antonio, Texas. After that, what turned out to be the superstar's career-concluding performances were in a couple of TV specials, \"Elvis: Aloha From Hawaii\" (1973) and \"Elvis in Concert\" (1977). \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And while the cast and crew of \"Fargo\" had long since finished filming by the time Calgary received its most recent unseasonable dumping of snow, TV audiences are just now about to witness the magic (and crime - lots of crime) for themselves. Season 5 of \"Fargo\" begins Tuesday, Nov. 21, with back-to-back episodes on FX. Episodes are available to stream the following day on Hulu.Despite filming in Canada, the current season of the series created by Noah Hawley (\"Legion\") is set primarily in North Dakota (as indicated by its title). Expected to run for 10 episodes, \"Fargo's\" fifth season is set in 2019, making it the series' most recent timeframe to date. (For those interested, seasons 1 through 4 take place in 2006, 1979, 2010 and 1950, respectively.)Those unfamiliar with \"Fargo\" may not know that the critically acclaimed series is based on the 1996 film of the same name by the Coen Brothers (\"Blood Simple,\" 1984), which starred William H. Macy (\"Shameless\") and Steve Buscemi (\"Boardwalk Empire\") alongside Frances McDormand (\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\" 2017) in her Academy Award-winning role as police officer Marge Gunderson. Like the film, FX's \"Fargo\" is a black comedy, but rather than follow the same storyline as the film, the series opted to present its content as an anthology, jumping through timelines and to various locations in order to tell a series of related tales, each as unsettling - yet somehow inviting - as the next.Season 5 stars Juno Temple (\"Ted Lasso\") as Dorothy (Dot) Lyon, a Minnesota-based housewife who appears to lead a normal, happy lifestyle. But, when Dot ends up getting into trouble with the local authorities, her past comes back to haunt her - a past that is much more sinister than anyone would have expected from this average midwestern woman. As she tries to sort out the best course of action, Dot is pursued by North Dakota Sheriff Roy Tillman (Jon Hamm, \"Mad Men\"), Deputy Witt Farr (Lamorne Morris, \"New Girl\") and a mysterious man named Ole Munch (Sam Spruell, \"The Martian,\" 2015).Jennifer Jason Leigh (\"The Woman in the Window,\" 2021) joins the main cast as Dot's well-off mother-in-law, while \"Stranger Things'\" Joe Keery and \"Never Have I Ever's\" Richa Moorjani step into the roles of the sheriff's son, Gator Tillman, and Deputy Indira Olmstead, respectively.Meanwhile, David Rysdahl (\"Oppenheimer,\" 2023), Jessica Pohly (\"Stalker\"), Nick Gomez (\"She-Hulk: Attorney at Law\"), Lukas Gage (\"The White Lotus\") and Dave Foley (\"The Kids in the Hall\") star in recurring roles throughout the newest season. \n \n Caption: Jennifer Jason Leigh in \"Fargo\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In Vancouver, \"For your added convenience, this Post Office will be closed on Saturdays.\" And on Highway 11 in Ontario, \"You are now halfWay to the North Pole.\" That reminds me of the famous two-liner:\"Do you know the way to Town X?\"\"Yes, but you can't get there from here.\"Today's deal was played in a Canadian event, and South showed that he could circumnavigate the apparently unavoidable diamond finesse.After a takeout double of a preemptive opening bid, the advancer - -as the doubler's partner is called - is assumed to hold 6 points. He makes a simple response unless holding noticeably more than that. However, after North cue-bid to show a very strong hand with spade support, South was happy to control-bid his top heart card. North needed no more encouragement.Maybe West should have led a diamond, which would have killed the contract. However, he led his singleton, optimistically hoping his partner had the heart ace.After East allowed dummy's heart 10 to win the first trick, declarer cashed the spade king (hoping West had a singleton honor) and followed with a trump to his ace, getting the bad news.South continued with a heart to dummy's ace, ran the heart jack, played a heart to his nine and cashed dummy's top clubs, eliminating the rounded suits. With his preparations complete, declarer cast adrift with a trump. East won with the queen and had to lead a diamond away from his king into dummy's ace-queen tenace.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, as the English author Robert Burton wrote in \"The Anatomy of Melancholy,\" \"No rule is so general, which admits not some exception.\" Which is the exception in today's deal? South plays in three no-trump, and West leads a low spade. How many tricks should declarer win?South is right to open two no-trump despite the low tripleton in diamonds. He has a balanced hand with 21 points; no other sequence would describe this so accurately.Declarer saw that he had seven top tricks. He needed two more from the diamond suit. So, after winning the first trick with his spade king, South led a diamond and finessed dummy's 10.East won with the queen and returned a spade to South's ace. Declarer led a second diamond, capturing West's king with dummy's ace. A moment later South was claiming 10 tricks: two spades, one heart, four diamonds and three clubs.\"Why didn't you play the diamond king at trick two?\" asked East.\"Because my textbook says second hand low,\" replied West.\"Yes, that is right most of the time,\" observed East.\"However, here, with South trying to establish dummy's suit, you must disobey the rule. If you play the diamond king, dummy's suit is dead and we can defeat the contract.\" \"But what if South has the diamond queen?\" asked West.\"Then your king is dead anyway,\" explained East.Watch out for the suitkilling second hand high. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When holding 10 or more points and good trump support, North would have responded with a conventional two notrump.South, with only six losers, took a shot at game.West led the heart king.When the dummy appeared, South saw that the layout was ideal for a crossruff. To lay the foundation, after winning with the heart ace, declarer immediately conceded a diamond trick.The defenders did the best they could, cashing two heart tricks before switching to a trump, but it was to no avail.South won in the dummy, ruffed a diamond in hand, cashed the club ace and crossruffed home.If the declarer is planning a crossruff, clearly the defenders should lead as many rounds of trumps as possible. Suppose West leads a trump at trick one here.Can the contract still be madeftNot against best defense.South wins the first trick in the dummy and calls for a low diamond, but East steps in with the king and leads a second trump.Although it didn't apply in this deal, watch out for one other technique when planning a crossruff. You should cash all of your sidesuit tricks first. If you don't, an opponent might ruff one of those winners late in the play. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The owner, Randy Decker, has some festive plans in store that are perfect for families getting into the spirit of Christmas.In addition to touring the home's decorated downstairs, guests will depart through the kitchen, where fresh baked holiday cookies will be offered before the next part of the tour begins outdoors.The side yard will be festooned with countless Christmas inflatables that are perfect for fun holiday photo opportunities.Santa will be happy to pose for photos as well, as he is visiting the home tour.Unlike many traditional home tours, Decker wanted this tour to be fun for families of all ages.The home is well known in the area.

But is it possible to send a boy to do a woman's job? Of course it is!The bidding in today's deal was impressive, if slightly complex. South's two hearts was a transfer bid. When South continued with three diamonds, his second suit, North bid three hearts to show length and strength in that suit. After South rebid his six-card suit, North control-bid the heart ace.Finally, when South showed his first-round club control, North used the Grand Slam Force, asking partner to bid seven diamonds with two of the top three trump honors.South ruffed the club-king lead and cashed the diamond ace, getting the bad news.Now it was a matter of establishing his spades, in case they were dividing 4-2, and without losing trump control. Declarer unblocked dummy's top spades, ruffed a club to get back to hand and led the spade six. When West discarded, South wondered if it was safe to ruff with the boy: dummy's diamond six. But if he had, he would have fallen to defeat. After cashing dummy's diamond queen, South would have had to ruff a club to return to hand, leaving himself with only one trump to East's two.Instead, South ruffed the third spade with dummy's diamond queen. Then he led a low trump to his nine, drew the remaining trumps and claimed.Not bad to bid and make a grand slam with only a combined 26 high-card points. Still, a well-placed void may make a mockery of point-count.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When we are enjoying our Thanksgiving feast, we do not worry too much about the calories being consumed.Sometimes, when playing in a bridge contract, you have to be economical with your cards. In today's deal, the declarer had to be particularly careful with his handling of the trump suit.Despite having only 5 highcard points, North's hand, with four trumps and a doubleton, was well worth a single raise.After winning the first trick with the heart ace, South saw that he had two logical lines of play. He could cash the spade ace, hoping to drop a singleton king, or he could play for East to hold the club king. The former chance being only 26% (a third of the 78% probability of a 2-1 trump split), the declarer opted for the 50-50 finesse.So, at trick two, South led the spade jack from his hand. (This had a secondary advantage: West, afraid his partner held the singleton trump ace, might have ducked his king.) No luck this time, though. West won with the king, cashed his two heart tricks and switched to a diamond.South won with his ace and led the spade seven to dummy's queen. After the club finesse had worked, South played the club three to his ace. Now came the spade three to dummy's five.The club jack was covered and ruffed. Finally, South led his carefully preserved spade four to dummy's six and cashed the club 10, discarding his diamond loser.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Where did she get her start?A: The British Columbia native started out studying dancing as her principal path in show business, but her main attention shifted to acting when she was accepted at Toronto's Randolph Academy. She began doing guest roles on such series as \"Murdoch Mysteries\" and \"Star Trek: Discovery,\" then continued with appearances on shows including \"When Calls the Heart\" and \"The Bold Type.\" Around the time of the later guest shots, Kohan also started getting prominent parts in cable movies on the order of \"The Black Widow Killer\" (2018) and \"Love on Harbor Island\" (2020). The fact that those have been repeated often didn't hurt her chances to land the lead in \"Sullivan's Crossing,\" Among other movies that have featured Kohan are \"A Romance Wedding\" (2021) and \"A Whirlwind Wedding\" (2021), and she also was seen on the shows \"Batwoman,\" \"Transplant\" and \"When Hope Calls.\" Inspired by novels by Robyn Carr, \"Sullivan's Crossing\" (which already has been renewed for a second season) originated on Canada's CTV network, and its inclusion of two veterans of The CW in its regular cast - Chad Michael Murray (\"One Tree Hill\") and Scott Patterson (\"Gilmore Girls\") - likely got the latter outlet interested in picking up the series for the American market, especially when production delays linked to the entertainment-industry strikes made finding product from other sources a necessity. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

First, the 91st \"Christmas in Rockefeller Center\" will maintain the yearly tradition of the lighting of the giant tree in midtown Manhattan, though that obviously wasn't broadcast in its early years (it started as a local offering for the New York market before the full NBC network began showing it). Then, the first \"Christmas at Graceland\" special will showcase the Memphis, Tenn., estate that famously was the home of entertainment legend Elvis Presley.Kelly Clarkson (who's now doing her syndicated weekday talk show from \"30 Rock\") will host and perform on \"Christmas in Rockefeller Center,\" and it's a given that Radio City Music Hall's famed Rockettes will show their high-kicking stuff, while various other music stars - including icons Cher and Barry Manilow - put their own spins on famed yuletide songs.Members of NBC's \"Today\" broadcast team typically are featured on the special, and Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb, Al Roker and Craig Melvin are expected to be on hand for the two-hour show's ultimate highlight: the flipping of the switch that illuminates the giant holiday tree (which comes from Vestal, N.Y., this time) that's a \"must\" destination for countless tourists during the season. After that, the tree will be lit daily until Jan. 13.Actress Riley Keough (\"The Girlfriend Experience\"), one of' Elvis' granddaughters and now the sole owner of Graceland - following the passing of her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, last January - is among the executive producers of \"Christmas at Graceland.\" Its lineup of performers also hadn't been confirmed at press time, but it's certain that the song list will include tunes associated with Elvis, \"Blue Christmas\" surely being among them. In fact, \"Elvis' Christmas Album\" and \"Elvis Sings The Wonderful World of Christmas\" were among his musical releases, so there are a good number of seasonal numbers that he lent his touch to.\"Christmas at Graceland\" is being staged with Elvis in mind, and don't be surprised if it integrates clips from a famous telecast that he did himself: his so-called 1968 \"Comeback Special,\" which aired in December of that year. That program had been intended as a Christmas attraction, but it ultimately was broadened out to cover the full scope of Presley's music career. However, it did include \"Blue Christmas,\" and that would seem like a prime clip to be excerpted by \"Christmas at Graceland.\" \n \n Caption: Kelly Clarkson is hosting NBC's annual \"Christmas in Rockefeller Center\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Originally televised in 1962, this variation of the tale casts the famously near-sighted Magoo (voiced by Jim Backus, of \"Gilligan's Island\" fame) as legendary miser Ebenezer Scrooge and to its credit, the script stays pretty faithful to the Dickens original while also allowing Scrooge to adopt Magoo's quirks.Morey Amsterdam and Jack Cassidy also are in the voice cast. and the original songs are by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill, whose Broadway credits included \"Funny Girl.\" Be forewarned that despite Magoo's amusing demeanor, some of the moments here give heartstrings a forceful yank; we point specifically to Tiny Tim (voice of Joan Gardner) singing \"Alone in the World,\" which it might help to make an advance buyout of a whole tissue factory for. \n \n Caption: A still from \"Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Revisiting 'Australia': Film gets a revamp in new series 'Faraway Downs'\n\n November 23, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Sarah Passingham | Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 634\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n We all roll our failures over in our minds from time to time, so it would make sense that even blockbuster film directors are no different. In cultural memory, the 2008 epic drama \"Australia\" has remained a dim corner in director Baz Luhrmann's spectacular filmography, which includes massive hits such as \"Romeo + Juliet\" (1996) and \"Elvis\" (2022). Luhrmann went back to the drawing board to give \"Australia\" a second chance and came away with the new miniseries \"Faraway Downs,\" premiering Sunday, Nov. 26, on Hulu.Using additional footage cut from the original movie, \"Faraway Downs\" spans four hours, split into six episodes, adding new layers to the story told in \"Australia.\" The series, like the film, stars Nicole Kidman (\"Special Ops: Lioness\") as Lady Sarah Ashley, a British widow who inherits her late husband's sprawling cattle station, called Faraway Downs, on the cusp of the Second World War in 1939. Having made the trip to Australia to convince her husband to sell the property before he died, Lady Sarah has a man known simply as The Drover (Hugh Jackman \"The Son,\" 2022) lead the cattle to Darwin for sale.The pair lead a team and the cattle on a risky adventure across the outback and manage to thwart a rival rancher looking to achieve a meat monopoly in the region of Northern Australia. Lady Sarah and Drover find love on their trip to Darwin and return to Faraway Downs intent on making the station the success that her late husband couldn't.Trouble comes for them when the well-being of Nullah (Brandon Walters, \"Operation Buffalo\"), the Indigenous Australian boy that the two have been caring for like an adoptive son, is threatened and acts of war loom over Northern Australia.When the reworked miniseries was announced in June 2022, Luhrmann shared in a statement the intent behind both the original film and \"Faraway Downs,\" saying, \"I originally set out to take the notion of the sweeping, 'Gone With the Wind'-style epic and turn it on its head - a way of using romance and epic drama to shine a light on the roles of First Nations people and the painful scar in Australian history of the 'Stolen Generations.'\" In the film, Nullah is left orphaned after his mother dies trying to evade police, who are attempting to forcibly separate him from his family.The Stolen Generations of mixed-race Indigenous children were removed from their homes to live in church-run missions throughout the latter half of the 19th and into the 20th century, as late as the 1970s in some parts of Australia.Luhrmann added in his statement: \"While 'Australia' the film has its own life, there was another telling of this story; one with different layers, nuances and even alternative plot twists that an episodic format has allowed us to explore.\" Luhrmann alludes quite clearly to what \"Faraway Downs\" will expand on with its longer runtime and segmented installments. More depth will be paid to Indigenous history in the series and Luhrmann's original ending, cut in favor of a happier final act in \"Australia,\" will finally be seen by audiences.The first episode of \"Faraway Downs\" screened at SXSW Sydney Screen Festival in October, and The Guardian reported that the soundtrack was \"given a contemporary First Nations overhaul,\" including a song from Budjerah (\"Ready for the Sky\"), whose music plays over an opening credits sequence animated by Indigenous artists.\"Faraway Downs\" also stars Bryan Brown (\"Darby and Joan\") as Lesley (King) Carney, a rival cattle farmer; David Wenham (\"Pieces of Her\") as Neil Fletcher, the station manager at Faraway Downs who is secretly working with King Carney; Jack Thompson (\"High Ground,\" 2020) as Kipling Flynn, accountant of Faraway Downs; David Gulpilil (\"The Leftovers\") as King George, an elder and Nullah's grandfather; and David Ngoombujarra (\"The Circuit\") as Magarri, Drover's brotherin-law. \n \n Caption: Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman in \"Faraway Downs\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Future of Movie Theaters - How cinemas are navigating all the upheavals hitting Hollywood\n\n November 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; Apg National Enterprise Editor | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1768\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The movie business has gone through some blockbuster and generational sea changes in recent years with the streaming revolution, the shutdowns of the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing 40-year highs with inflation and this year's Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes.All those upheavals in Hollywood have also been impacting movie theaters - from large chains with suburban cineplexes to hometown operators and historic venues that are often nostalgic downtown centerpieces in America's small towns.Owning and running a movie theater is not an easy business even in the best of the times.It's even tougher in the worst and most challenging times.COVID and its shutdowns prompted an 83% drop in ticket sales and box office revenue from 2019 to 2020, according to Nash Information Services LLC.Ticket sales and box offices have bounced back this year - led by strong showings by \"Barbie\", \"Oppenheimer\" and \"The Super Mario Bros Movie\". They are up from the depths of the pandemic and 26% from 2022.With about six weeks to go in the year, 2023 box offices and ticket sales are off 28% from pre-COVID business in 2019.Three women operating smaller movie theater businesses in Montana face very similar challenges and have very similar resilient love and passion for their tiny slice of \"show business.\"A LABOR OF LOVESue and Larry Schilling bought the Choteau Roxy Theatre in 1988.The theater is in Choteau, Montana, just under an hour's drive from the next closest cineplex in Great Falls, and 90 minutes from the Canadian border.The Roxy was built in 1945 and first opened in 1946 with its first show on July 4. The Schillings added a stage several years ago to host other performances.\"We've had several plays and several live performances,\" said Susan Schilling.She said that has included local musical performances and events for community groups and nonprofits.The husband and wife team added digital projection equipment and new surround sound systems in 2013 and 2014.FAMILY FRIENDLYSchilling said the theater shows top 10 movies on their first runs just like its larger cohorts. She said the theater operates in a small town activities and sports kind of dig into (movie) attendance,\" she said.CHANGING EXPECTATIONSSmaller theaters also have less space and ability to expand concessions, restrooms and other amenities seen at larger cineplexes in the suburbs and urban areas with as many 24 screens, multiple concession stands, party rooms and ample restrooms.The Roxy has a small lobby and \"only two bathrooms\", Schilling said. She said the movie going experience and moviegoers expectations have changed.\"It wasn't about the experience, about eating popcorn,\" she said.But now, theaters face competition from other entertainment options as well as watching movies at home on big screen televisions and on streaming services.There are significantly more sports, especially football, on multiple days, competing for eyeballs.\"It's got to be better than sitting in their living room,\" Schilling said.This summer's slate of movies led by \"Barbie\", \"Oppenheimer\" and the latest installment in Tom Cruise's \"Mission Impossible\" franchise helped propel a strong movie season.\"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" had worldwide box offices of $1.45 billion and $949 million, respectively, while \"The Super Mario Bros. Movies\" brought home $1.36 billion, according to IMDB, which tracks the movies industry.\"We built our own Barbie Box. We kind of hyped it up,\" Schilling said. \"People want a good experience.\" The \"Barbenheimer\" summer phenomena helped remind people of the joys of going to the movies after the shutdowns of the coronavirus pandemic and waves of superhero franchise movies turned off some moviegoers.\"They had a different attitude when they walked in the door. People are really happy to be here,\" Schilling said.Movie chains and smaller operators have also had to grapple with four-decade highs with inflation after all the monetary and fiscal infusions undertaken in the U.S. and worldwide during the COVID pandemic.Many U.S. households are still feeling the pinch of high grocery prices, housing costs, car payments and health care outlays along with higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve aimed at lowering inflation.In Choteau, the Roxy's ticket prices are $8 for adults, $6.50 for kids and seniors with $7 for large popcorn.\"We stay very economical,\" Schilling said.TIME TO SELLThe 35 years owning the Montana theater has been a labor love but the Schillings, who had full-time jobs while operating the Roxy.But now the couple wants to spend more time with their grandchildren who don't live close by.\"We have grandchildren we want to go spend time with,\" Schilling said.The couple has listed the 4,800-square-foot theater for sale with an asking price of $284,000.Phyllis Bechtold, a local realtor and owner of Buy N Sell Montana, said property, with its vintage look and signage, is also an important part of the small town community.Schilling agrees.\"People are very appreciative that we are still operational,\" she said.BY THE NUMBERSMovie theaters and cineplexes employ 155,000 workers nationally, according to a March 2023 report by the Cinema Foundation.There were 38,474 indoor movie screens operating in the U.S. at the end of 2022, according to the National Association of Theater Owners. That's 5% fewer than 2019 before COVID.More than 48% of those screens are operated by the three largest cineplex chains - Kansas-based AMC Entertainment Inc., Knoxville, Tennessee-based Regal Cinemas and Dallas-based Cinemark USA Inc., according to the theater owners' group.But there are also plenty of smaller and regional operators across the country.NEW REVENUE STREAMSBecky Dupuis is a principal with Polson Theatres - a smaller chain with screen and properties in Montana and Idaho.Dupuis and Candis Harrop, CFO of the regional operator, said they have started renting out theaters more for special events - including gaming, birthday parties, baby and wedding showers - to generate more revenue.Parties, showers and other private gatherings include a private showing of movies.\"We've seen a big increase in people interested in private showings,\" Dupuis said.She said private showing interest started during and right after the pandemic but has continued. \"It kind of surprised us,\" Dupuis said.\"We just had a 50th birthday party.\" They said they charge $200 for the first hour and $50 for each additional hour or a flat $150 to $250 rate depending on the time of the event. Harrop said the trend has made the Montana chain think about other revenue generating options and how some people forgot the enjoyment and American cultural experience of 'going to the movies.' \"It's been kind of eye opening for us,\" she said, of the private showings and special events. \"Those kinds of things have really helped.\" Other theaters across the country have also looked to private events - including ones hosted by businesses and nonprofits - and special showings of concerts, operas, old movies and pay-per-view MMA and other fights.But Dupuis and Harrop said theaters, especially smaller ones with limited screens, waivers from movie studios and distribution networks if they supplant films already running at their properties.That's why special showings or private events are often in the mornings before regular movie times.Polson Theatres has 22 screens in 8 locations in Montana and Idaho, including theaters that first opened in 1914 and 1911. They are located in small, rural towns such as Dillon, Havre, Wolf Point and Lewistown, Montana and Salmon, Idaho.They have populations ranging from 2,600 to 6,000 people.\"Most of our theaters are twins,\" Dupuis said of the scheduling challenges that can arise from trying to book events and still abiding by studios' contracts with cinemas.'BIG CONCERN'While the writers' and actors' strikes have been settled with studios, the work stoppages are poised to offer some short-term challenges to theaters next year.Some movies have had their release dates moved forward because of the labor disputes - including the next installments of \"Dune\" and \"Mission Impossible.\" \"It's a big concern,\" Harrop said.Theaters have already seen the exponential growth of streaming services such as Netflix, Disney/Hulu, Apple TV and Amazon take movie and other productions from traditional venues.Movie theater operators - especially in small towns - have also seen their lineup of films dominated by superhero franchises. Those might appeal to younger demographics and families but not necessarily older audiences.\"We have a very large older population,\" Dupuis said.Though the Montana movie theater operators see potential in Christian and other faith-based films pointing to the success of \"Sound of Freedom\" earlier this year.Other theaters in states with larger Indian and South Asian populations have also shown 'Bollywood' films' to attract other office segments.'THAT's NOT NICE'Like other theaters - large and small, the Polson chain has felt consumer pressure to offer more food and drink options.\"We've never done anything but candy and popcorn,\" Dupuis said.But now they are offering Italian sodas, nachos and pretzels. That's still a way from the bigger national chains who offer sandwiches, pizzas, burgers and alcoholic beverages.Movie tickets at the Polson theaters are $9.25 for regular showings, $6.25 for matinees and $5 on Tuesdays.Keeping prices down for consumers is key with inflation coming off 40-year highs and many Americans living 'paycheck-to-paycheck' with high costs for housing, health care and car payments.\"We don't want to raise our prices,\" Dupuis said.But she also said theaters are getting hit hard with higher costs - especially for repairs and replacing equipment as well as the costs of doing any kind of upgrades to their properties.\"It's killing us,\" she said, pointing to some technology-related repairs and upgrades that are 30% higher than pre-COVID inflation wave levels.\"That's not nice,\" Dupuis said.'HERE TO STAY'Despite all the changes, the three Montana women at the two movie theater operations are optimistic the American cultural experience of 'going to the movies' won't disappear even with younger demographics glued to their phones.\"The movie theater industry has gone through a lot of ups and downs - but it has never shut down,\" Harrop said. \"We made it through COVID. People love the movies and they can't replicate the popcorn. I think it's here to stay.\" \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED PHOTO\n \nThe Choteau Roxy Theatre is located in a small town in Montana.

How should South weather the storm brewing in four hearts against the lead of the spade queen?When the dummy appeared, South saw that he could afford two trump losers, but not three. After winning trick one in hand with the spade king and cashing the heart ace, he could continue with a low heart or with the heart jack (or 10).Either would work if the suit was dividing 3-3, but if the opposing hearts were 4-2, declarer realized that he had to find either East or West with honordoubleton.So, at trick three, declarer continued with a low heart. When West had to win with the king, declarer smiled inwardly to himself.South won West's spade continuation in the dummy, cashed the diamond ace, ruffed a diamond in hand and drove out East's heart queen. Declarer ruffed the next spade, drew East's last trump and forced out the club ace. He had one trump left with which to ruff the fourth round of spades - all he needed.When you can play high or low, consider both carefully. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ideally, North-South would reach three no-trump, but that is easier said than done - unless you employ a modern gadget.On the first round, South makes a jump cue bid of three hearts. This shows eight or nine guaranteed tricks, usually with a long, solid minor, and asks North to bid three no-trump with a heart stopper. However, without this string to your bow, suppose you wind up in five diamonds.After winning trick one with the spade ace, you draw trumps. Then you lead a low heart from hand. When West puts in the eight, which card should you play from the dummy?Given that West has at least five hearts and opening-bid values, it looks best, at first glance, to put up the queen, playing West for the heart ace and king, but think back to the opening lead. If you were West, holding the spade K-Q and heart A-K, which card would you select? Right, the heart king (or ace).Therefore, because West didn't lead a heart, surely East has a singleton heart honor. Duck in the dummy and East's king or ace will fall on low cards. A moment later, you will lead toward the heart queen again and make your contract. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If so, you must do something to reduce the number. Today's deal features one such play technique.Against four spades, West led the club ace. When East signaled with the 10, West continued with the club king and a third club. East exited with the spade three: two, eight, king. How should South have continued?South's three-spade rebid was invitational. North, with the two top trump honors, had an automatic raise to game.With all of the side suits safe, declarer's only concern was the trump suit. If that was breaking 3-2, he would have no trouble, but what if East had started with four spades including the jack?(If West had jack-fourth, the contract was beyond resuscitation.) The only chance would be a trump coup. To reduce his trump length to the same as East's, South made the farsighted play of immediately cashing dummy's heart ace and ruffing a heart in his hand.After declarer had played a trump to dummy's ace, getting the bad news, he ruffed another heart in his hand. Then South cashed his three diamond tricks, ending in the dummy. Luckily, East had to follow suit throughout.South was left with the Q-10 in spades, and East had the J-5. When South called for a heart, East's apparent trump trick disappeared in a textbook trump coup.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Picking up speed: MI-5 agents ramp up in third season of 'Slow Horses'\n\n November 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dana Simpson | Page: D9 | Section: News \n \n 442\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The phrase \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks\" may or may not be true, but Apple TV+ has proven that, at least when it comes to horses, even the slowest ones can gain speed. Based on the Slough House book series by English novelist Mick Herron, \"Slow Horses\" begins its third season with two fresh episodes Friday, Dec. 1, on Apple TV+.The first season of the Gary Oldman (\"Darkest Hour,\" 2017)-led series kicked off on the streamer in April 2022 and made good use of Herron's first Slough House novel, \"Slow Horses,\" for which the show's is named. Season 2 continued the author's saga, taking its plot details from the literary series' second book, \"Dead Lions.\"Now, heading into its third season to be released within a year and a half, the newest instalment will follow the tradition of pulling content chronologically from the novels, this time focusing on Herron's \"Real Tigers,\" the third book in the series.On screen, the spy dramedy follows a group of aging and disgraced MI-5 agents, who all appear to have lived out their usefulness within the high-ranking British espionage organization. As such, the agents have been relegated to another department, \"known un-affectionately as Slough House,\" where a large part of their job involves sitting behind a desk and pushing papers; a lowstakes operation for agents who have made \"career-ending mistakes.\"Slough House is headed up by \"brilliant but misanthropic leader\" Jackson Lamb (Oldman), and also acts as a sort of workplace home to recovering alcoholic Catherine Standish (Saskia Reeves, \"Luther\"); former hactivist Roddy Ho (Christopher Chung, \"Waterloo Road\"); Louisa Guy (Rosalind Eleazar, \"Uncle Vanya,\" 2020), assigned to Slough House following a botched tailing job; and River Cartwright (Jack Lowden, \"Dunkirk,\" 2017), whose desire to redeem himself in the field set the tone for the premiere season.Other agents have come and gone over the seasons, including Jed Moody (Steven Waddington, \"Jamestown\"), Struan Loy (Paul Higgins, \"Apostle,\" 2018), Min Harper (Dustin Demri-Burns, \"Cardinal Burns\"), Shirley Dander (Aimee Ffon-Edwards, \"Peaky Bllnders\"), Marcus Longridge (Kadiff Kirwan, \"Ths Is Going to Hurt\") and Sidonie \"Sid\" Baker (Olivia Cooke, \"Bates Motel\"), the last of whom was a competent MI-5 agent assigned to Slough House for seemingly unknown reasons.Headed into Season 3, many Season 1 and/or 2 characters are expected to return, including Lamb; Cartwright; Ho; Guy and Standish; MI-5 director general and head of operations Diana Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas, \"Gosford Park,\" 2001); Cartright's grandfather, retired intelligence officer David Cartwright (Jonathan Pryce, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" 2003); and MI-5 agent James \"Spider\" Webb (Freddie Fox, \"Victor Frankenstein,\" 2015). Supporting characters Harper, Dander and Longridge are also scheduled for Season-3 return. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Those wishing to volunteer can reach out to Kilmon at deena@eastonedc.com.For Kilmon, who's been working and living in town for over 25 years, the community aspect is what makes the parade and this time of year so special.\"Coming downtown and seeing your neighbors and just enjoying the absolutely beautiful and charming town that we all live in and sharing that with each other - that's the spirit of the season,\" she said.Making connections through fun experiences like the holiday parade are crucial to making Easton better.\" When you have these memories, it makes you a stronger citizen and a person that really wants to work hard for the best of all of us, and that's why we do it,\" Kilmon said.Two holiday markets will also complement the parade.After a four-year hiatus due to the pandemic, the Easton Holiday Marketplace is back at the Waterfowl Building to feature the best arts and crafts presenters and vendors.The Holiday Marketplace is open Friday, Dec. 1, from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturday, Dec. 2, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and Sunday, Dec. 3, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.And for the first time, a holiday market featuring gifts and photo opportunities with Santa will be open in the historic Ebenezer Theater. Live holiday music will regale attendees on Friday, Dec. 1, from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Photos with Santa will be available on Saturday, Dec. 2, from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.Another new element this year is accessible parking and seating for the parade. Sponsored by The Arc Central Chesapeake Region, parking will be available in the Harrison Street parking lot. Those needing special accommodations will have access to a reserved seating area. \n \n Caption: A young girl excitedly shows Santa and Mrs. Claus her stuffed Clarice reindeer before the Easton holiday parade Saturday, Dec. 3.\n \nA Santa, joined by two elves, waves from an elaborately constructed chimney on a float at Easton's holiday parade Saturday, Dec. 3. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One was staged like the North Pole. The Grinch was there, if you looked for him. There was even a Starbucks.One set of cars is from the Tom Hanks movie \"The Polar Express.\"\"We put it on there because it is a steam engine and it is really cool,\" Tarrang said. \"We really like it because of its power. It's a model of the largest steam engine ever built.It is called 'Big Boy,' and there are two that are still in service.\"And like Where's Waldo, the firefighters asked visiting children to find the tiny donut shop.\"It keeps the kids entertained for a few minutes,\" Tarrang said.It took volunteers from Oct. 1 to Black Friday to build the displays.\"This is Lionel O gage. The train in the back is HF. It is smaller, and we did that to make it look far off in the distance,\" Tarrang said, showing off the Department's work. \"When I was a kid we used our allowance to buy HO trains, which shows how cheap they were. You can't do that anymore.\"\"These are all digitally controlled DCs,\" he said. \"We have two controllers for all the trains. There are certain degrees these trains can handle and it is relative to a real train.These are set up to mimic real trains.\" Tarrang built all the underpinning structure out of wood to support all the trains.The other person implementing and maintaining the train display is Barry VanVechten, who is also a firefighter.Once enough children were there, the lights were turned off. The train sounds seemed amplified, and the glow from the trains and villages filled the darkness. An audible gasp of wonder came from those in attendance. It was a moment of pure Christmas magic.This toy train spectacle will be open through Christmas Day, with an optional donation requested at the door. During the week, it is open from 6 to 8 p.m., and during the weekends it is open from 2 to 8 p.m. \n \n Caption: Every kid got to check out the trains and find the Grinch. Leah Maxwell, Caleb Maxwell, and Brooklyn Shortall got fire helmets from the EVFD.\n \nAn engine passes Santa on a white horse. One could also find the Grinch, a building on fire, a dinosuar and a miniature Easton Volunteer Fire House at the Holiday Trains Display.\n \nThere are several villages that the trains travel through, like the Dickens Village, the North Pole and the airport.\n \nThe Budweiser Clydesdale horses with attending Dalmatian dog can be found here. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "TCM will Grant you this: A double feature of Hugh\n\n November 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: D12 | Section: News \n \n 346\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Had it not been for his taking a sharp turn into romantic comedy, Hugh Grant might have remained consigned to classics and period costumes for the bulk of his acting career.Instead, he's reached a point where the audience is expected to be perfectly comfortable seeing him play an Oompa-Loompa in \"Wonka,\" the latest incarnation of the saga of Willy Wonka - he of chocolate-factory fame, now portrayed by Timothee Chalamet - that's slated to open in theaters Dec. 15.In preparation for that, Turner Classic Movies salutes Grant with a double feature Sunday, Dec. 3, with each attraction showcasing one of his screen specialties.First up is the picture that changed Grant's professional trajectory, the 1994 international hit \"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\" He plays Charles, a self-deprecating Englishman who's hesitant to commit to a woman unless he sees lightning strike, quite literally. He finally knows what love is when he falls for Carrie (Andie MacDowell), a visiting American with quite a lengthy history of romances and even when it looks like he's lost her to another man, he can't get over her nor the hope that things still might eventually work out for him with her.Another great aspect of \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" is the group of close acquaintances that director Mike Newell and writer Richard Curtis surround Charles with. Kristin Scott Thomas, Simon Callow, John Hannah, James Fleet, David Bower and the late Charlotte Coleman portray that bunch, and their easy camaraderie is one of the movie's foremost enduring joys.The second attraction on TCM's Grant double bill is director Ang Lee's 1995 version of \"Sense and Sensibility,\" for which star Emma Thompson adapted the script from Jane Austen's novel (and won an Oscar for doing so).Grant's role is what his norm was before the success of \"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\" as a houseguest who becomes involved with one of three sisters (the Thompson character) who have been left just about destitute after their father's death. Kate Winslet, Hugh Laurie and \"Four Weddings\" co-star Fleet also have prominent roles. \n \n Caption: Andie MacDowell and Hugh Grant in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Sunday, Dec. 3): The 1960s sitcom continues its weekend \"Binge\" that continues through early Monday morning, detailing the experiences of the staff and guests of the Shady Rest Hotel. Bea Benaderet (the voice of Betty Rubble on \"The Flintstones\") started the show's run as Kate Bradley, who ran the site with her three comely daughters (played by several actresses, including Linda Kaye Henning and Meredith MacRae) and less-than-energetic Uncle Joe (Edgar Buchanan). The show was a cousin of \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" and \"Green Acres\" with its similarly rural undercurrent.\"Walk the Line\" (Cinemax, Sunday, Dec. 3): Joaquin Phoenix is excellent country-music icon Johnny Cash in this fine 2005 drama, but an equally superb Reese Witherspoon was the film's Oscar winner as June Carter, who became Cash's performing partner and wife. Director and co-writer James Mangold captures the couple's stormy relationship superbly, with such other figures as Waylon Jennings (played by the real Waylon's son Shooter) and Elvis Presley (\"One Tree Hill's\" Tyler Hilton) factoring into the story.\"The Love Boat\" (MeTV, Sunday, Dec. 3): Mickey Rooney appears as a Pacific Princess passenger who has something magical about him in the seasonal episode \"The Christmas Presence.\" Rooney's wife Jan also has a guest role as a nun traveling with a boys' choir; Donny Osmond, Maureen McCormick (\"The Brady Bunch\"), Teresa Wright, Keenan Wynn and Henry Gibson are on board as well. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The movie also earned Academy Awards for best picture, director (Delbert Mann) and Chayefsky's adapted screenplay.Marty generally hangs out with his pals after work, but a visit to a dance hall introduces him to shy teacher Clara (Betsy Blair), and they take a real shine to each other but the critical comments of Marty's buddies make him doubt pursuing a relationship with her. The picture is alternately amusing and heartbreaking, but always affecting. Notable supporting players include Frank Sutton, who would become Sgt. Carter to TV's \"Gomer Pyle, USMC,\" and Jerry Paris - later one of TVs top sitcom directors (\"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" \"Happy Days\"). \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, maybe you agree with Eugene Ionesco: \"We haven't the time to take our time.\"At the bridge table, though, we should take our time.When the dummy appears, all three active players should pause to plan the campaign.Sometimes we must judge the right time to win a particular trick.Today's deal was declared by Roger Trezel, a Frenchman who died in 1986. How did he time the play in five spades after West had led the diamond king? West's bidding isn't recommended. First, why preempt when you might be able to make three no-trump? A two-diamond overcall is normal. Second, having jumped to four diamonds, West shouldn't have bid five.If he was willing to go to five diamonds, he should have bid it on the first round.Despite West's sacrifice, Trezel wasn't willing to assume that East had the club ace. To try to establish the heart suit without risking East's gaining the lead, Trezel ducked the opening lead.When West continued with a diamond to dummy's ace, declarer discarded a low heart. South drew trumps, cashed the heart ace, played a heart to dummy's king and ruffed a heart. Back to dummy with a trump, Trezel discarded two club losers on dummy's heart winners.Nicely done.At another table, South won the first trick with dummy's diamond ace. However, after drawing trumps ending in the dummy, he called for the diamond two. When East failed to put in the 10, South discarded a low heart and recovered from his earlier error. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some declarers, when they need a misdefense to make their contract, will play very quickly. This isn't kosher, but it often works.However, when defending, don't be hurried. Say that you want to take some time to think things through.Rather than rely on speed, it is preferable for the declarer to play his cards deceptively so that the defender doesn't see the trap in time.Playing in four hearts, the ingenuous declarer wins the first trick with dummy's club ace, draws trumps and plays a diamond to the king. Against some opponents, this will work. West will lead a second club, allowing South to ruff and discard one of dummy's spade losers on the diamond queen. However, against more sophisticated defenders, it won't succeed.First, East will play his two trumps in the order 5 then 2, trying to show a top honor in spades. Second, West will see that the club queen can wait. He will recognize the possibility of a discard and switch to the spade four at trick five.As South knows East has the club king and is marked with a top spade (West didn't lead the spade ace or king), West must hold the diamond ace.A more deceptive approach is to lead dummy's diamond at trick two and put in the nine. If West falls for the trap, later South can ruff out West's diamond ace and get his discard.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A view from behind the cameras - Filmmaker talks metaphors, process and independent films\n\n December 5, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Matt Hubbard; mhubbard@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1190\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ELKTON - For most of his life, filmmaker Samuel White has been focused on captivating audiences through the thought-provoking narratives and community-building aspects of his films, a drive that recently brought him recognition at the 2023 Cecil County Independent Film Festival.\"Through creating art, my hope is to get people wanting to talk about the art,\" said White. \"Even if they disagree, I want people to communicate, talk about ideas and get to know each other and I think that's the reason I make films.\" White, 33, of Elkton, developed an interest in filmmaking after he saw the 1960 film \"Psycho\" when he was 11 years old. White recalls seeing certain shots within the film the artistic intention of which peaked his interest.From that point forward, White took his enjoyment for writing stories and began to think of them as films until he began playing with his grandfather's camcorder to bring his ideas to life. Now, White says filmmaking is his favorite form of storytelling.\"I cannot picture a time in my life where I didn't think cinematically,\" White said. \"I don't know if I showed any talent as a filmmaker when I was a kid but at that time, I learned that the camera is an important storytelling tool.\" In high school, White was homeschooled under an umbrella program that granted him the opportunity to meet fellow students who were also interested in filmmaking. Based on their shared love of film, White and his friends created the Cinematography Club, where they would get together and practice different filmmaking techniques.From 2004 to 2008, when White was in high school, video production technology was rapidly evolving with the introduction of HD video and video cameras.After White's senior year of high school, digital single lens reflection (DSLR) cameras took over the market.\"With the DSLRs, it was like an 'oh my god, we could actually do this,' moment for me with filmmaking because of how video friendly and available DSLRs became,\" White said.DSLR cameras often have interchangeable lenses, shoot on compact flash or SD cards and are capable of both still photography and shooting high quality video. To learn more about video technology, White attended Cecil College where he majored in video production.\"When I was at Cecil College, I didn't have an interest in the actual degree, I wanted to get as much hand on tech experience as I could and I did,\" said White. \"It was fantastic because they gave me the tools and opportunities to work and learn with the technology and techniques.\" White said that his favorite course at Cecil College was called Gorilla Filmmaking, where he had the opportunity to to work with top of the line filmmaking equipment while receiving guidance and criticism on his work from professional photographer and videographer Floyd Dean.During that class, White created his first short film that documented a female character suffering from an unknown problem that was slowly destroying her body. The horror film utilized only music - no dialogue - which White says was intentional, as it left much of the film up for interpretation.\"For me, the girl running around with her face falling off asking for help and being ignored was kind of like personal feelings I have had throughout my life relating to personal things,\" said White. \"I enjoy films that are abstract that invite you to feel and interpret what you want.\" White graduated from Cecil College in 2012 and has gone on to build himself a filmmaking portfolio of 14 independent films; six of which he wrote and directed on his own.His most recent film, \"Safewords,\" follows a soonto-be bride and her adventure into an alternative lifestyle.The film won best full-length feature and best scriptwriting.\"Safewords\" took three weekends for White and his crew of three to create, which he said took about 10 years off of his life expectancy due to stress.\"I didn't give myself enough time, and it was a massive learning experience because of the amount of stuff I didn't know about while making an hour and a half long feature film,\" White said. \"I am proud of the film, and I am glad it turned out the way it did.\" White often holds his new films up against his 2020 film \"The Day Bingo Died,\" as he said it is his favorite film that he has made to date.The film follows a brother and a sister who return to their childhood home to euthanize their family dog.Both siblings grieve the loss and decide to go to a bar after burying the dog. The siblings later end up intoxicated and arguing over who loved the dog more, which White said is the \"weirdest mix between two adults acting like spoiled drunk children.\" Odd mix aside, White considers \"The Day Bingo Died\" to be his favorite film because it presents viewers with an uncomfortable, yet relatable, view of grief and family.\"It plays on the power behind words and the expression of grief and how the differences between the two speak to human nature,\" White said. \"I love putting people in that uncomfortable space where they don't know if they should laugh or not because the uncomfortable feelings come from situations being relatable.\" Much of White's inspiration comes from directors Alfred Hitchcock, Lars Von Trier and David Zucker, as well as his personal competitive streak to build and improve film ideas using metaphor.White explained that he often views everything in his life as a scene in a movie, which helps him grow as a filmmaker because it allows him to connect metaphors to true meaning.\"When something emotional or interesting happens to me, I ask what it would look like visually and how would that fit into a story,\" said White. \"If it's a fear of commitment, my metaphor would be a wedding ring stuck on a finger that irritates the skin - stuff like that.\" White's consistent hunt for metaphors to add into his films is what he says is the base of traditional filmmaking and is what makes his films art. But to keep the sense of traditional filmmaking alive, White said film festivals are essential as art on the big scene is slowly fading into the background.\"If you want to be a filmmaker, from now throughout the future, there will be less chances to get your film on an actual big screen, which is why I go to local film festivals - to keep the traditional art form of filmmaking alive because of streaming,\" said White.Looking to the future, White is working to grow his production company, Outsider Film Company, to a point where it can help independent filmmakers produce their work. The film company currently offers a variety of professional video services and can be found on Instagram or Facebook.\"I will be making art for the rest of my life,\" White said. \"If you're considering making movies, Cecil County is a great place and you're in a great time period.Get out and give it a try.\" \n \n Caption: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO\n \nSam White (left) uses a camera to record a musical performance.\n \nCONTRIBUTED PHOTO\n \nAn actress reads over her lines during the production of Sam White's \"Safewords.\"\n \nCONTRIBUTED PHOTO\n \nDirector Sam White stands with an award from the Cecil County Independent Film Festival.\n \nCONTRIBUTED PHOTO\n \nA screengrab from a scene in Sam White's \"Safewords.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A couple hundred children came to this free event, which was moved at the last minute from the courthouse lawn to the Anchor Church on 620 Goldsoboro Street due to concerns about the weather.Family after family streamed in the church's entrance, passing a giant blow up Frosty, many of their children dressed in holiday finery.There was face painting, professional photos with Frosty and a continuous screening of \"Frosty's Winter Wonderland\" in the church's sanctuary.A DJ played a continuous round of classic Christmas songs. That is, until he put on the \"Electric Slide\", during which lines of women formed to do the dance and clap in unison, a fun reminder that the holidays can be terrific and inclusive.For All Seasons, a community behavioral health center, put the whole three-hour extravaganza together. Community sponsors who made the event possible, including presenting sponsors Willow Construction and the St. John Foundation. Each sponsor donated a holiday blow up statue.Additional sponsors include The Chesapeake Bay Beach Club, the Fraternal Order of Police Cambridge-Dorchester Lodge Number 223, Easton Utilities, Tidewater Inn, WBOC, Ewing, Dietz, Fountain and Kaludis, P.A., Construction Services and Supply Inc., Qualifacts, and the Delmarva Pride Center. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCA LL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nThese girls are showing off their new face paintings.\n \nTOM MCCA LL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nFree cookies, hot chocolate with marshmellows and hot apple cider were all awaiting the children and their families.\n \nTOM MCCA LL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nGriffin Calaghan, 5, is stoic in his plate spinning.

East won the first trick with the ace, cashed the club king (the accepted way of showing a doubleton) and exited with a diamond.With a guaranteed spade loser, declarer had to find the trump queen to make his contract. Assuming West had five clubs to East's two, there were 11 empty spaces in East's hand for the heart queen, but only eight in West's hand. However, those odds of 11-to-8 weren't good enough for South. He wanted to find out more about the distribution before committing himself.Judging that West would have led a singleton diamond if he had one, declarer overtook the diamond king with dummy's ace and discarded his club queen on dummy's diamond queen.Now came the spade queen from the dummy. East won with the ace and returned a diamond.Immediately South ruffed with the heart ace, cashed the spade king (discarding dummy's club loser) and ran the heart eight. When it won, he repeated the heart finesse, drew the last trump and claimed.Why was South so confident about the hearts? Because East had passed as dealer and already shown up with 11 points: the club ace-king and the spade ace. He couldn't hold a queen as well. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Com | Page: 13 | Section: News \n \n 647\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n GREENSBORO - The misting rain held off as Whoville Honorary Mayor Doug Gray of Burrsville opened the fifth annual event 5 p.m. Friday, Dec. 1, at the Greensboro Volunteer Fire Company Community Hall.\"Behold, citizens of Greensboro,\" Gray proclaimed.\"The most magical time of the year has arrived.The Greensboro Whoville Village Holiday Park is back, more magnificent and grand than ever before.\"\"You see our big Whoville sign, but wait till it's dark; you can see it from space, I'm pretty sure,\" Greensboro Mayor David Spencer said.\"We're really proud that the fire company has partnered with us to allow us to move over here.\"Despite the forecast and the light rain that began a half-hour into opening night, visitors showed up to walk the 2,000-foot winding path past inflatables, about 50,000 lights and the Grinch's lair to enjoy the free festive holiday display hosted by the Town of Greensboro.\"We wish the weather could be a little better, but at least it's not freezing cold,\" Spencer said.The event takes place over the next two weekends.For the faint-of-heart intimidated by the Grinch's dreary lair, visitors had the option of walking along the outside of it. However, the Grinch, with his trademark onion, seemed fairly harmless as he sported a necklace made of Christmas lights.Over the past five years, town employees and volunteers have put on the event, adding elements and improving the experience.This is the second year the holiday village has been set up at the hall.Potential flooding from the Choptank River prompted organizers to move the popular event to higher ground last year.Inside the hall, about 15 local vendors had set up tables. By the last weekend of Whoville, there will be about 25, according to Town Manager Tammy Kelledes. Visitors could purchase hamburgers, hot dogs and drinks from the GVFC Auxiliary.Among the nearly two dozen volunteers were Spencer's grandchildren.\"It's a family affair,\" Spencer's wife Cathy said.Also represented were Public Works Director Brandon Cunningham's son and Community Outreach Coordinator Amanda Weaver's son, who volunteered as elves.Their job? \"To spread Christmas joy,\" Weaver said, smiling.Santa and Mrs. Claus greeted children in their cozy shed decorated by Brandon Cunningham's wife Katie Beebe-Cunningham.Although Santa Claus had seen only a few children during the first hour of the village festivities, he said he saw about 1,500 children last year on the first night of Whoville. Mrs. Claus said they usually gravitate towards her first, and then feel more at ease to visit the jolly old elf.At the end of the path was a silhouette Nativity scene set up by Greater Impact Church in Greensboro.It's been about a month of work for the town employees who set up Whoville this year.Public safety was top of mind for organizers, and Greensboro Police and Caroline County Emergency Services were on site.Although the town relies on sponsors and donations, it has yet to break even on the cost of putting on the event, Kelledes said.\"This splendorous affair is all thanks to the generous donations and in-kind contributions from our beloved community businesses and citizens,\" Honorary Mayor Gray proclaimed.\"It's a time to cherish with your loved ones, sip cocoa, and get lost in a wonderland of lights.\"For more information about Greensboro Whoville Village Holiday Park, visit the Town of Greensboro's Facebook page, call 410-482-6222, text 443-239-4160 or email aweaver@greensboromd.com. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nOpening the fifth annual Whoville in Greensboro are, back row from left, Whoville honorary mayor Doug Gray of Burrsville, Zac Braband as the Grinch, Brooklynn Spencer as Cindy Lou Who, Madison Braband as an elf, and, front row, Leonidas Weaver and Benjamin Beebe-Cunningham.\n \nCONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nDirectional signs guide visitors to along Whoville's streets behind the Greensboro Community Center.\n \nCONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nVisiting Whoville, Santa Claus and little Natalia Fanicase of Stevensville wave to her parents as Mrs. Claus looks on. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Away from it all: Luxury getaway goes south in 'Leave the World Behind'\n\n December 7, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Sarah Passingham | Page: D9 | Section: News \n \n 636\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A family's stay at a luxurious vacation home is unexpectedly extended due to a mysterious apocalypse in the new thriller \"Leave the World Behind,\" premiering Friday, Dec. 8, on Netflix.Based on the bestselling 2020 novel of the same name by author Rumaan Alam, the adaptation stars Julia Roberts (\"Ticket to Paradise,\" 2022) and Ethan Hawke (\"Moon Knight\") as married couple Amanda and Clay Sandford, whose family getaway to Long Island is steered far from the rest and relaxation they expected.After putting off a much-needed break from their busy day-to-day city life, Amanda tells Clay in the official trailer for the film, \"I figured if I made the reservation and packed our bags, it would eliminate most of the reasons to say no.\"Off they go to a sprawling home near the beach with their two children, teenager Archie (Charlie Evans, \"Everything's Gonna Be Okay\") and their youngest, Rose (Farrah Mackenzie, \"United States of Al\").While Amanda and Clay watch on as their children enjoy the pool and they all begin to settle into their temporary home, the peace and quiet begins feeling eerie. The cable and internet are mysteriously out, but the Sandfords try to make the most of it by pulling out games to pass the time. A knock at the door in the dark of night puts them face to face with two strangers in formal wear.Mahershala Ali (\"Swan Song,\" 2021) is G.H.Scott, the owner of the home, he explains to the bewildered couple blocking his doorway. This fateful introduction deepens the uneasiness that's beginning to build, when Amanda says to G.H. like an accusation, \"This is your house?\" G.H., joined by his daughter Ruth (Myha'la, \"Industry\"), face down their guests until they are eventually let into their home.Widespread blackouts led the Scotts to flee New York City for their Long Island residence, wanting to wait out the outage away from the panic of the city. Relegated to the basement in-law suite by a forcefully skeptical Amanda, the divide between the two families intensifies.If Amanda is determined not to make any friends in the apocalypse, her efforts are matched only by gruff contractor Danny, portrayed by Kevin Bacon (\"City On a Hill\"). Holding his shotgun as a warning in the trailer, Danny sternly tells G.H., \"I would do anything to protect my family.What you do is your business.\" A woman desperately clings to the passenger side door as Clay accelerates away, lost in this unfamiliar beach town, leaving the Sandford and Scott families no choice but to rely on each other for the time being.All they know for certain is that a countrywide cyberattack has caused sweeping power outages along the East Coast. Confirmed with an unsettling \"unrecognized emergency warning\" blasting bright blue light from the beach home's flat-screen TV, G.H.'s hunch that the seemingly unrelated disasters are connected grows.\"Leave the World Behind\" is written and directed by \"Mr. Robot\" creator Sam Esmail, who spoke with The Hollywood Reporter in October about adapting the novel shortly after it was published during the COVID-19 pandemic. Esmail shared, \"It was a crazy time, those early days [of the pandemic], and when I read the book what really resonated for me was this idea that in a moment of crisis, just how easily we could forget our common humanity.\"Alam executive produced the film with Tonia Davis (\"Rustin,\" 2023), Daniel M. Stillman (\"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,\" 2020), Nick Krishnamurthy and Barack and Michelle Obama (\"We the People\"). Esmail also shared what it's like to collaborate with the former president and first lady, saying, \"They gave notes on everything from the disaster elements to the characters.\" The director added, \"It's a highlight of my career that I got to work with the Obamas. They're some of the most brilliant minds on the planet and I'm really grateful for their involvement.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tony Shalhoub returns as \"Monk\" in new Peacock movie\n\n December 7, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: D12 | Section: News \n \n 502\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n With the way that popular series of the past have been recycled - even in the streaming era that has added so much content - the second coming of \"Monk\" may not be that huge a surprise.As it happens, streaming is the avenue by which Tony Shalhoub is reprising his multiple-Primetime Emmy-winning portrayal of obsessive-compulsive detective Adrian Monk. Peacock premieres \"Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie\" on Friday, Dec. 8, with the hugely phobic title character on a very personal mission to help his journalist step-daughter Molly (\"Home Economics\" alum Caitlin McGee) when tragedy strikes as her wedding nears. The film might claim that this is Monk's final investigation, but of course, a ratings triumph for the picture can change that notion easily. (Consider that there have been three movie sequels to another former USA Network series, \"Psych,\" and a fourth has been under discussion.) Also an executive producer of the new film, Shalhoub isn't the only \"Monk' veteran returning for it. Series creator Andy Breckman (\"The Good Cop\") wrote the script and returns as an executive producer as well (with \"Hit & Run's\" David Hobernan also reprising the latter job), and Randy Zisk (\"Midnight Caller\") - who directed many of the original show's episodes, including the finale - calls the shots again on the movie.Other familiar faces from the \"Monk\" cast also are back. Traylor Howard (\"Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place\") again plays Natalie Teeger, who was Monk's second assistant on the show; Ted Levine (\"The Silence of the Lambs,\" 1991) and Jason Gray-Stanford (\"A Beautiful Mind,\" 2001) return as the police-connected Leland Stottlemeyer and Randy Disher; Hector Elizondo (\"Last Man Standing\") resurfaces as psychiatrist Neven Bell; and Melora Hardin (\"The Office\") resurfaces as Monk's late wife Trudy.\"Monk\" premiered on USA Network in 2002 and enjoyed an eight-season run, with Shalhoub earning three Primetime Emmy Awards for it along the way. John Turturro (\"Barton Fink,\" 1991) and Stanley Tucci (\"Big Night,\" 1996) each picked up an Emmy for guest stints on the show, and Randy Newman (\"Toy Story,\" 1995) won two of the honors for his musical contributions to it. Shalhoub also won a Golden Globe and two Screen Actors Guild Awards for the program.The series brought stardom to Shalhoub after his tenure as a respected supporting actor on stage and screen. When \"Monk\" began, he was known to viewers largely as Antonio on the sitcom \"Wings,\" and he also had gained notice for roles in such movies as \"Big Night\" (1996, with the aforementioned Tucci) and \"The Siege\" (1998). He also had earned the first of what would be his four Tony Award nominations to date, for \"Conversations With My Father\" (1992); his others have been for \"Golden Boy\" (2013), \"Act One\" (2014) and \"The Band's Visit\" (2017), and he won the honor for the latter play.For now, though, it's back to \"Monk\" territory for Shalhoub's - and though \"Last\" is in the movie's name, don't necessarily bank on that being the fact. \n \n Caption: Tony Shalhoub in \"Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

South counted seven top tricks and anticipated getting two more from diamonds. He also knew an avoidance play when he saw one.South led a diamond to dummy's king, returned to hand with a spade and led a second diamond. If West had played the queen, South was planning to duck in the dummy, keeping East off the lead. However, when West played the 10, declarer put up dummy's ace and led a third round. South was pleased to see West win this trick, but he was less pleased when West promptly switched to the club nine (the high card denying interest in the suit) in answer to his partner's encouraging club seven discard on the previous trick.East won with the ace and returned a heart: down one.South's path required finding the diamonds 3-2, West's holding the club ace and West's having to win his side's diamond trick. However, there was a much better route available.Assuming West's heart three was an honest card, the suit had to be splitting 4-3. If so, South just needed to find West with the club jack. At trick two, South should have finessed dummy's club 10.His nine tricks would have been four spades, one heart, two diamonds and two clubs. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He doesn't count on sweet little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) having a beneficial effect on his grouchy attitude. Anthony Hopkins invokes much of the famous Seuss prose as the narrator of the tale, which has a wondrous production design here.\"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\" (ABC, Tuesday, Dec. 12): The Rankin-Bass production company's \"Animagic\" technique of stop-motion animation is in full evidence in this charming seasonal special, which debuted in 1970. Fred Astaire supplies the image and voice of a mailman who takes it upon himself to respond to several letters sent to Santa by relating the story of Father Christmas - whose voice is furnished by another legendary entertainer, Mickey Rooney.\"black-ish\" (FX, Saturday, Dec. 16): The first of two holiday episodes being shown back-to-back, \"Christmas in Theater Eight\" revolves around a tradition that many families have practiced over the years going to see a movie on the holiday, For Dre (Anthony Anderson), Bow (Tracee Ellis Ross) and their kids, though, it's an easy proposition since they can't come to a unanimous agreement on which film to see. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A world-renowned chef himself, Gordon Ramsay's daughter, Tilly, was previously a contestant on \"Celebrity Master-Chef Australia,\" proving that talent in the kitchen might just be genetic. The second-generation Ramsay is also set to join the cast as a judge of \"MasterChef Junior's\" upcoming ninth season, acting as a reminder of what young chefs can accomplish once they really get cooking.Bubbling over with family fun and holiday cheer, this seasonal special is sure to give fans a taste of what's to come in \"Master-Chef Junior\" Season 9. \"Master-Chef Junior: Home for the Holidays\" airs as a two-night event, Dec. 10 and 11, on Fox. \n \n Caption: Gordon Ramsay, Tilly Ramsay, Daphne Oz and Aarón Sánchez from \"MasterChef Junior: Home for the Holidays\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It appears there again on Sunday, Dec. 10, as Mike and Carol (again played by Robert Reed and Florence Henderson) decide to reunite their entire \"Brady Bunch\" for the holidays.Each of the grown children has his or her own dilemma, though ranging from Marcia's (Maureen McCormick) concern over her husband Wally's (Jerry Houser) sudden job loss, to Bobby's (Mike Lookinland) secret about his chosen profession. The enjoyable 1988 film also brings back Barry Willliams as Greg, Eve Plumb as Jan, Christopher Knight as Peter and Ann B. Davis as housekeeper Alice. However, there's a different Cindy, with Susan Olsen (who was on her honeymoon at the time of the filming) replaced by Jennifer Runyon. \n \n Caption: Christopher Knight, Jennifer Runyon, Florence Henderson, Ann B.

How long was he on \"The X-Files\"?A: The actor's run as FBI Agent Fox Mulder began in 1993, and he has said that he didn't expect the Fox series (now repeating on Comet) to last as long as it did, nor to be as popular as it became. His regular weekly run on the show went through the seventh season, when headlines were made by a lawsuit Duchovny filed against 20th Century Fox Television, alleging that it sold rights to repeats of the show to Fox-affiliated stations for less than they were worth thus costing him some profits.The suit was settled, but Duchovny's contract for the show was up, so he left as a full-time cast member (with Robert Patrick assuming the role of a Mulder surrogate, John Doggett). However, Duchovny returned for part of the eighth season, with the explanation that Mulder had been abducted by aliens.He also came back for the presumed series finale in Season 9, but as it turned out, he wasn't done with the show yet.Fox gave \"The X-Files\" revivals as a limited-run program in 2016 and 2018, which were deemed to be the 10th and 11th seasons of the show. Series creator-producer Chris Carter has inferred that there are more stories in that universe to be told, but any discussions of a continuation of the franchise haven't come to fruition. The show also yielded two theatrical films in which Duchovny played Mulder (opposite Gillian Anderson's Agent Dana Scully), \"The X-Files: Fight the Future\" (1998) and \"The X-Files: I Want to Believe\" (2008). \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When the game was first invented, many claimed it would be a quickly passing fancy. Nowadays, with fewer young players coming into the game, some are saying that bridge will die with the elderly in 20 years or so. Still, somehow I have a feeling it will be going as strongly as ever come 2043.We have heard about passing in the auction. But what about passing in the play? If you thought that was impossible, look at today's deal.The contract was four spades. West led the heart jack: three, ace, queen.Back came the heart six to declarer's king. Declarer cashed his top spades, receiving a shock when West discarded a low diamond on the second round. Suddenly South was faced with four losers: two spades, one heart and one diamond. However, he didn't throw in the towel.He realized he might win 10 tricks after all.Declarer played a club to dummy's king and ruffed a heart in hand. Then he played a club to dummy's ace and ruffed a club in hand.Next he cashed the diamond ace before playing a diamond to dummy's king. That gave declarer nine tricks. He could lead either dummy's last heart or club and leave East with no answer. If he didn't ruff in, South would trump for his 10th trick, whereas if East did ruff in, South would discard his diamond loser and be assured of one more trump trick with his remaining 5-4 doubleton.This play, which generated an extra trump trick, is called a coup en passant.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, it isn't immediately apparent how the declarer can thwart West's dastardly scheme.Also, even then an ice-cool West might thwart South's thwart!\nDefending against four spades, West leads the club ace: three, four, 10. He switches to the diamond nine, two, 10 How should South continue?\nGiven North's opening bid, West must have led a singleton club ace. South must win trick two, to stop the lethal club ruff. However, even with a singleton, West's lead is unattractive. So declarer can place king-third of spades with West: some measure of trump control.\nIf this is the position and he attacks trumps now, West is bound to score a club ruff, East having a diamond entry.\nHave you seen the key play?\nSouth must hope that West has the heart jack. At trick three, he leads the heart ace, squashing dummy's king.\nThen he cashes the heart queen, discarding one of dummy's diamonds, and continues with the heart 10.\nAssuming West covers with the jack, declarer discards dummy's last diamond.\nWhen South regains the lead, he plays the spade ace and another spade. East never wins a trick, so West never gets his ruff.\nHowever, if West has the courage to play low smoothly on the heart 10, he might deflect declarer to defeat.\nThinking East has the heart jack, South might decide his only chance is to ruff and play the spade ace and another spade, hoping the trumps are 2-2.\nIf an opponent wants you to play a particular card, don't. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Cedric the Entertainer and Wilmer Valderrama presided over the announcements from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where the show will also take place on Jan. 7.Films nominated for best motion picture drama included \"Oppenheimer,\" Martin Scorsese's \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" Bradley Cooper's \"Maestro,\" Celine Song's \"Past Lives,\" Justine Triet's \"Anatomy of a Fall\" and Jonathan Glazer's \"The Zone of Interest.\" In the best motion picture musical or comedy category, \"Barbie\" was joined by \"Air,\" \"American Fiction\" \"The Holdovers,\" \"May December\" and \"Poor Things.\" Yorgos Lanthimos' \"Poor Things\" and Scorsese's \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" both received seven nominations each. \"Poor Things\" saw nominations for Lanthimos, its actors Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe, and Tony McNamara for screenplay. \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" got nods for Scorsese, for direction and co-writing the screenplay with Eric Roth, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro.Stone, who was also nominated for the Showtime series \"The Curse,\" said in a statement that she was \"Feeling extremely bewildered and thankful for it all.\" She also said her \"Poor Things\" character Bella Baxter is her favorite.DiCaprio praised Gladstone in his statement: \"She is the soul of our film and helped to bring this sinister and painful part of our nation's history to life,\" he wrote. The film is about the murders of wealthy Osage individuals in Oklahoma in the early 20th century.\"Barbie\" tied for second-most nominations in Globes history with \"Cabaret,\" from 1972. Robert Altman's \"Nashville\" remains the record-holder with 11 nominations.It went into the morning as a favorite and got a big boost from its three original song nominations, including \"I'm Just Ken,\" and one of the year's new categories, recognizing cinematic and box office achievement. One person who was not nominated was America Ferrera, who delivered the movie's most memorable monologue.\"Succession\" was the top-nominated television program, with nine nods including for series stars Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin, followed by Hulu's \"The Bear.\" As always there were some big surprises, like Jennifer Lawrence getting nominated for her bawdy R-rated comedy \"No Hard Feelings\" for best performance by a female actor in a musical or comedy. She was nominated alongside Robbie, Stone and Fantasia Barrino (\"The Color Purple\"), Natalie Portman (\"May December\") and Alma Pöysti (\"Fallen Leaves\").Barrino heard the news from her husband who she immediately called back to make sure she wasn't dreaming.\"My voice is shot because I've been screaming, crying and just telling God, 'Thank you.' I almost allowed fear to hinder me from this role, to keep me from this role,\" she told the AP through tears.She's been on the road for work and said she's excited to go home and experience it with her children. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS - Visitors and residents of St.Michaels had plenty of holiday-themed entertainment to keep them busy Saturday.\nThroughout the day, Christmas in St. Michaels hosted a variety of events, including two parades: the Talbot Street Parade and the Lighted Boat Parade.\nThe Talbot Street Parade kicked off in the morning, beginning on Talbot Street at Perry Cabin and ending at Seymour Avenue.\nA variety of floats, fire trucks, antique cars and boats towed by trucks made their way down the street as parade-goers watched and cheered from the sidelines. Some of those in the parade came on horseback. There were 46 entries in the parade this year.\nInstruments, jingle bells and voices rang through town Saturday morning. From \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" to Christmas classics like \"Jingle Bell Rock\" and \"Santa Baby,\" there was something for everybody.\nBritany Francis was most excited to see her brother, Weston Dunlap, in the parade. Dunlap joined the St. Michaels Fire Department this year.\n\"I moved here almost two years ago,\" Francis said. \"So this is my first parade, my brother's first Christmas parade.\"\nDanielle Toth brought her two daughters, Emerson, 4, and Camryn, 2, with her to the Talbot Street Parade this year.\nCamryn liked the candy the most but also liked seeing Santa as well as the floats that spouted out bubbles to make it look like it was snowing.\nEmerson liked seeing the horses from the Tuckahoe Pony Club and the Maryland Rough Riders.\nAfter the sun set on Saturday evening, the second parade of the day, the Lighted Boat Parade, began. Eighteen boats lit up with colorful string lights and different Christmas decorations traveled around St.\nMichaels Harbor.\nFor the Redl family, who live in northern Virginia but have a house in Bozman, this was their first year seeing the lighted boat parade. The three of them said they would definitely come back to see it again next year.\n\"I think it was cool to see all these people who took their time to put up cool decorations and then come by and show us those lights,\" Benjamin Redl, the son of David and Amy Redl said.\nBenjamin and David Redl's favorite boat in the parade was one that had three Christmas trees, each covered in a different color of lights. Amy Redl liked the boat that had a lighted image of a dolphin wearing a Santa hat.\n\"It's a lovely thing that the Town of St. Michaels does for families and everyone,\" Amy Redl said about the parade. \"It's really nice.\"\nJay and Kim Anderson have been coming to the Lighted Boat Parade for seven years now. The couple from Virginia always walks in the Talbot Street Parade with their two Chesapeake Bay Retrievers and then sticks around for the Lighted Boat Parade.\n\"You don't see this anywhere else,\" Jay Anderson said. \"I mean we live on a lake in Virginia, and they have started doing the lighted boat parade the last couple of years, but just the it's the town, it's quaint.\"\nAnn Law, who has been to six Lighted Boat Parades in the last seven years, said she lives outside Philadelphia and has seen Philadelphia's boat parade.\n\"But it's too commercial,\" she said. \"This isn't.\"\nThe first place winner of the Lighted Boat Parade was Shannon Pickens' boat, Working Girl, with the theme \"Christmas in St.\nMichaels.\"\nEmma Brown and Bryan Hines' boat, Harbor Shuttle II, came in second place with the theme \"Santa's Workshop.\"\nBasil DeLashmutt's boat, Knot Knormal, came in third place with the theme \"Take it to Eleven.\"\nMike Kuperberg's boat, Karisma, came in fourth place with the theme \"It's Five o'Clock on the Chesapeake.\"\nSam Hughes' boat, Samron, came in fifth place with the theme, \"Oysters for Christmas.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus (last row) wave to those in the crowd at the Talbot Street Parade in St. Michaels on Dec. 9.\n\n MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Boats in the Lighted Boat Parade make their way toward the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St. Michaels Dec. 9.\n\n MA GGIE TRO VATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n A boat decked out with lights and colorful Christmas trees in the Lighted Boat Parade in St. Michaels Dec. 9.\n\n MA GGIE TRO VATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n A crab themed float at the Talbot Street Parade in St. Michaels on Dec. 9.\n\n MA GGIE TRO VATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Members of the St. Michaels Fire Department wave to people lining the sidewalks at the Talbot Street Parade in St. Michaels Dec. 9. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

How should South plan the play in five clubs, given that the trumps are breaking 2-1, not 3-0? West leads the heart king.\nTrue, three no-trump would have been a much easier contract. Maybe North should have rebid three spades over three clubs, but raising with primary support is rarely wrong.\nDeclarer could have banked everything on the diamond finesse, or he could have hoped for some luck in spades. However, South knew it was best to call on his opponents to play the spade suit for him. He won the first trick with his heart ace, played a diamond to dummy's ace and ruffed a diamond high in hand. He crossed to dummy twice with trumps and ruffed the last two diamonds, thus eliminating the minors. He then exited with his last heart.\nWhichever opponent wins the trick won't enjoy the experience. If he switches to a spade, declarer is assured of only one loser there.\nAnd if he returns a red suit, declarer ruffs in the dummy and discards his spade four.\nEither way, South loses only two major-suit tricks.\nGetting an opponent to help you is a design devoutly to be desired. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

What a wonderful event. Truly magical,\" said Trish Murchake of Church Hill, as she watched her granddaughter Leah Thomas, 7, skate on one of two iceless skating rinks set up near the town hall. It was Leah's first time on skates, she said.\nSaturday was their first time attending the winter festival, and they were having a lot of fun, Murchake said, adding, \"It's the perfect night for it.\"\nWhile all the attractions were free, there were more than 70 vendors and food trucks for visitors' shopping pleasure.\nThe Boggs family of Ridgely were enjoying the displays and activities in Railroad Memorial Park. They thought last year's festival was great but said this year managed to top it - more lights, more attractions, more everything.\nSteve and Kristel Vacek of Ruthsburg brought their children, Ellie, 8, Jackson, 11, and Mason, 13.\n\"We missed it last year. There's really a lot to see and do,\" Steve Vacek said. \"This is really cool.\"\nJenn Lowe and her daughter Ensle Joseph, 5, traveled an hour and a half from Salisbury to enjoy the festivities. Lowe said they were meeting a friend from Goldsboro. They had started on Central Avenue and were working their way through the attractions in the park on their way to the inflatables. Along the way, they got their picture taken in a lighted sleigh and visited Buddy the Elf, who was greeting fans inside a life-size gingerbread house.\nChildren and families got pictures with Santa inside the train station and told him their Christmas wishes.\nRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Yukon Cornelius and Abominable Snow Monster greeted visitors next to \"The Island of Misfit Toys\" display. Frosty the Snowman and Snoopy were also in attendance.\nReggie Cody of Hurlock brought his two kids, ages 4 and 6, to the festival.\n\"It was great,\" he said, adding that his children's favorite thing was the bounce house section.\n\"And the selection of food was good,\" Cody said. There was something for everyone. Drink choices included hot apple cider, hot chocolate, sodas and bottled water. Food choices ran the gamut from hotdogs and pizza to pulled pork and surf and turf. Cody ate from the Jimmy's Fat Rolls food truck, while the kids had nuggets and fries.\nSaturday marked their first visit to the festival, but it won't be their last.\n\"It's going to be a yearly event for us,\" Cody said. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY ANGELA PRICE\n\n Ensle Joseph, 5, of Salisbury visits with Buddy the Elf and his pet raccoon during Chrismtas in Ridgely on Saturday, Dec. 9.\n\n PHOTO BY ANGELA PRICE\n\n From left, Addison Boggs, 7, and her brother Grant, 11, of Ridgely, visit with Elsa from Disney's \"Frozen\" Saturday, Dec. 9 during Christmas in Ridgely.\n\n PHOTO BY ANGELA PRICE\n\n Foreground, from left, Troy Chester, 8, of Linkwood, Kennedi Johnson, 8, of Easton, and Serenity Chester, 10, try skating for the first time during Christmas in Ridgely on Saturday night, Dec. 9.\n\n PHOTO BY ANGELA PRICE\n\n Hungry visitors line up at food trucks at Christmas in Ridgely.\n\n PHOTO BY ANGELA PRICE\n\n From left, Parker Dietrich, 14, of Easton, Mady Shortall, 13, of Easton, and Cloee Welsel, 14, of Preston transform into elves during Christmas in Ridgely on Saturday, Dec. 9. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After seven weeks of cooking alongside some of the best in the game, celebrity chef Bobby Flay (\"Bobby's Triple Threat\") has one last chance to prove himself a festive-feast champion as \"Beat Bobby Flay: Holiday Throwdown\" airs its final episode Tuesday, Dec. 19, on Food Network.\"Food Network's favorites come together for holiday-themed culinary competitions and the chance to beat Bobby Flay,\" a series description given by the network explains. \"In each supersized episode, three chefs must bring their A-game and battle it out over two festive rounds to get to Bobby.\"\nIn true \"BBF\" fashion, the chefs must first compete against each other, creating spectacular dishes that feature secret ingredients of Bobby's choice. Whoever does it best moves on to the final round, then forcing Flay to cook their own surprise signature dish, with Flay testing his culinary prowess against the chef who knows it best. If Bobby can't cut it, the guest chef takes home the greatest prize of all: the pride of knowing they beat one of Food Network's best.\nSo far, this holiday special edition has seen Sunny Anderson (\"The Kitchen\"), Darnell Ferguson (\"Worst Cooks in America\"), Duff Goldman (\"Ace of Cakes\"), Chris Scott (\"The Great Soul Food Cook Off \"), Alex Guarnaschelli (\"Alex Vs America\"), Eddie Jackson (\"Outchef 'd\"), Michael Symon (\"Symon's Dinners Cooking Out\"), Antonia Lofaso (\"Cutthroat Kitchen\"), Damaris Phillips (\"Southern at Heart\") and more face off against Flay, with guest judges Tiffani Faison (\"Duck It!\"), Katie Lee Biegel (\"The Kitchen\"), Carson Kressley (\"BBQ Brawl\") and Bobby's own daughter, Sophie Flay (\"Bobby and Sophie on the Coast\"), all stopping in to give their say.\nDuring this upcoming season finale, however, the pressure (cooker) is on, as chef Jeff Mauro (\"Sandwich King\") taps in as judge and Flay faces his toughest competition yet: Andrew Zimmern (\"Family Dinner\"), Brooke Williamson (\"Top Chef \") and Jet Tila (\"Ready Jet Cook\").\nWith a slate of restaurants and businesses to his name, Bobby Flay is hard to beat. But if anyone can manage it, it's one of his Food Network colleagues. As this Christmas-party-turned-food-fight reaches its end, Tila, Zimmern and Williamson hope to take down their very own culinary Goliath.\n\"Beat Bobby Flay: Holiday Throwdown\" airs its final episode Tuesday, Dec. 19, on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Sophie and Bobby Flay from \"Beat Bobby Flay: Holiday Throwdown\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Opera star Rise Stevens appears as an opera star, a woman from Father Chuck's pre-clergy past. Crosby proved so popular in his role, McCarey crafted another film for him in the part: the following year's \"The Bells of St. Mary's,\" which TCM appropriately will show right after \"Going My Way.\" \n \n Caption: Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald in \"Going My Way\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It certainly pays to search through a contract with doubting eyes, looking for the best line of play. In today's deal, how should South plan the play in three no-trump? West leads the diamond queen.\nThe original declarer won the first trick with dummy's diamond king. (He might have ducked in both hands, but that would have risked a dangerous shift to hearts.) After a club to South's king won, declarer continued with the club queen. However, East won with the ace and returned his second diamond.\nNow South couldn't get nine tricks before the defenders took five.\n\"Why didn't you lead back a low club the second time?\" asked North, as irritating partners are wont to do.\n\"Because I haven't got X-ray vision,\" replied South curtly.\nWith six tricks on the side, South needs only three club tricks, and his A-10 of diamonds is safe from attack if West is on lead. So the best play at trick two is a club to South's nine.\nWest wins with the 10 and switches to the heart queen.\nDeclarer wins with dummy's ace, plays a spade to his ace and leads the club king.\nUnless clubs are 5-1, the defenders can never get more than four tricks: two hearts and two clubs. Here, South wins an overtrick.\n©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That also owes to Ives' performances of such songs as \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\" and \"Silver and Gold\" on the soundtrack, where the image certainly relates to the musical success Ives already had had by the time the special first aired in 1964.\nSimilarly, the mailman who tells the story in the 1970 show \"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\" (an annual ABC attraction lately) is meant to resemble iconic actor-singer-dancer Astaire, right down to his wiry physical build. Though Mickey Rooney voiced Santa in that program, Father Christmas has such a traditional look, the resulting image was sort of a hybrid of that and Rooney's own appearance.\nOther examples of veteran talents whose likenesses were used for their animated counterparts in Rankin/Bass shows included Jimmy Durante in \"Frosty the Snowman,\" Shirley Booth in \"The Year Without a Santa Claus,\" Angela Lansbury in \"The First Christmas: The Story of the First Christmas Snow,\" Ethel Merman in \"Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July\" and Danny Kaye in the Easter-themed \"Here Comes Peter Cottontail.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

These films run the gamut of genres, from thrillers to musicals.While nothing can replace classics like It's A Wonderful Life or Home Alone, these new titles will bring some excitement to the holiday season. With the house filled with gifts and decorations, who doesn't want to watch Christmas movies?\nNEW 2023 CHRISTMAS MOVIES Journey to Bethlehem Starring: Milo Manheim, Fiona Palomo, Antonio Banderas, Lecrae This musical version of the Nativity story starts at the beginning.\nWhen Mary (Palomo) discovers she's miraculously pregnant, she and her fiance Joseph (Manheim) have a hard time processing the news. Meanwhile, a threat from the jealous King Herod (Banderas) looms over them. Christian singer Lecrae also stars as the angel Gabriel.\nEXmas Starring: Robbie Amell, Leighton Meester Former teen heartthrobs Amell and Meester unite in the holiday staple that is the Christmas romantic comedy.

The Marvels' Teyonah Parris also co-stars in the holiday comedy.\nGenie Starring: Melissa McCarthy, Paapa Essiedu In this fantasy comedy, the Bridesmaids actress and comedienne plays Flora, a sprightly genie who helps a down-on-hisluck man, Bernard (Essiedu), win his family back before Christmas.\nFrom Richard Curtis, the writer of Notting Hill, Bridget Jones' Diary, and modern Christmas classic Love Actually, expect the same heartwarming, wholesome storyline that embodies the holiday spirit.\nThe Velveteen Rabbit Starring: Phoenix Laroche; voice performances by Helena Bonham Carter, Nicola Coughlan, and Alex Lawther as the titular rabbit.\nTold in a live-action-animation hybrid style, the adaptation of Margery Williams' children's classic unveils a hidden magical world that its protagonist William, played by Laroche, discovers after receiving a velveteen rabbit for Christmas.\nThe Crown 's Bonham Carter and Bridgerton 's Coughlan also lend their voices to this beautifully realized romp across a realm full of Christmas magic.\nThe Naughty Nine Starring: Danny Glover, Winslow Fegley, Camila Rodriguez In this adventure-heist kids' comedy, the naughtiest kid on Santa's list plans an Ocean's Eleven - style heist set in the North Pole.\nHe fields a team of kids on the naughty list to break into Santa's workshop and steal presents for themselves. Jumanji: The Next Level star Glover stars as Papa Christmas. Expect the familiar dreamy Disney Christmas vibe coupled with some Home Alone - style hi-jinks.\nA Biltmore Christmas Starring: Bethany Joy Lenz, Kristoffer Polaha Christmas isn't complete without the warm comfort of Hallmark Channel programming. With all the formulaic rom-coms on the channel, this one stands out for its ingenious time travel - meets-Old Hollywood spin.\nIn this romantic comedy, a screenwriter (Lenz) time travels to the 1947 film set of a Christmas classic that she was almost remaking. There, she meets and falls in love with the film's star (Polaha). However, as time-traveling plots often do, things soon take a wild twist. Can the star-crossed, time-bending romance find its happily ever after?\nThe Bad Guys: A Very Bad Holiday Voiced by: Michael Godere, Ezekiel Ajeigbe, Raul Ceballos, Chris Diamontopoulos This short feature is a holiday spin-off from the DreamWorks animated film. It brings back The Bad Guys' Mr. Wolf and his merry band of animals for a romp to revive the city's Christmas spirit.\nBilled as a prequel, the half-hour feature is set before the events of the film but retains the same manic charm that audiences loved in the full-length movie.\nCandy Cane Lane Starring: Eddie Murphy, Tracee Ellis Ross, Jillian Bell Comedy legend Eddie Murphy lends his one-of-a-kind comedic chops to this holiday film about a man who makes a deal with an elf (Bell) to win the neighborhood's Christmas decorating competition.\nThings take a wild turn when he finds out the elf gave him an evil deal that will turn him into a plastic doll. He races against time to reverse the curse before it's too late. Black-ish star Ross co-stars as Murphy's wife.\nSilent Night Starring: Joel Kinnaman This action-thriller about a man out for vengeance during the holiday season is perfect for those wanting a gritty Christmas. After losing his son and his voice in a gang war, Kinnaman's character goes on a Christmas Eve rampage to punish those responsible.\nDirected by Hong Kong's legendary gangster picture master John Woo, this promises to be a John Wick - meets-Die Hard, violent outing that offsets the holiday cheer. As the title suggests, the film has very little dialogue.\nThis article was produced and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n \n Caption: AP PHOTO/INVISION/EVAN AGOSTINI\n\n Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges stars in the Christmas movie \"Dashing Through the Snow.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2023-12-14",
    "author": "Dana Simpson",
    "content": "Lidia'S Life: Celebrity Chef Bastianich Reflects On Career With 'Culinary Jubilee'\n\n December 14, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dana Simpson | Page: A9 | Section: News \n \n 663\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Despite its ties to culture, religious practices, family economics, environmental concerns or political statements, food has a distinct way of bringing people together and encouraging conversation.Few people know this better than chef, author, restaurateur and TV personality Lidia Bastianich, whose catchphrase, \"Tutti a tavola a mangiare\" - or \"Everyone to the table to eat,\" in English - has united people for the past 25 years. Best known for her countless shows and specials on public television during the past three decades, PBS releases an up-close-and-personal look into the life and work of the celebrated chef; \"25 Years with Lidia: A Culinary Jubilee\" premieres Monday, Dec. 18.\nIn honor of this quarter-century milestone in her career, Bastianich welcomed the opportunity to speak with me about her childhood, her career, her own personal relationship to food and culture, and the moments that have meant the most to her throughout her journey thus far.\nCaught in what was no doubt a rare moment at her home in Long Island, N.Y., Bastianich joins our video call clad in a vibrant pink sweater and scarf that provide a cheerful contrast to the white bookcases and potted palm behind her. Easy to see why North American audiences have been captivated by her for 25 years, Bastianich begins sharing memories of where her close kinship with food began.\n\"My grandmother used to make a soup [I loved],\" Bastianich reminisces. \"It's called yota, and it's unique to the region that I come from, [Pula, Istria], which is right on the border in [what] now is Croatia. It's a bean and pasta soup, but instead of the pasta, she would put in sauerkraut, and I loved it.\"\nWhile this may be one of her most formative childhood food experiences, the association between food and family was just beginning for young Bastianich. Now 76 years old, the celebrity chef is quick to note that cooking, for her, \"goes beyond just nourishing the body.\"\n\"It's [about] nurturing the person, the soul and the sentiments that come with it,\" Bastianich says.\n\"Food is a communicator no matter what culture, if you sit down, and you eat each other's food, somehow doors open. You are accepting that person - through that food - for what they are.\"\nAnd there is no denying that this Italian food ambassador knows about people. As PBS's \"25 Years with Lidia\" shows through interviews with friends, family and colleagues of hers from throughout the years, Bastianich is an excellent communicator herself and values meaningful, deeply human connections above all else. To support this, the hour-long documentary features moments with fellow chef/restaurateurs Jacques Pepin (\"Jacques Pépin Heart & Soul\"), Mary Sue Milliken (\"Too Hot Tamales\"), Elizabeth Falkner (\"The Next Iron Chef \") and Geoffrey Zakarian (\"The Kitchen\").\nPerhaps the most surprising appearance in \"25 Years with Lidia,\" though, is that of celebrated actor and fellow Astorian Christopher Walken (\"Pulp Fiction,\" 1994).\n\"I came [to the United States] at 12 years old, as an immigrant, and we lived in Astoria, Queens.\nRight across the street was Walkens' Bakery,\" explains Bastianich as she elaborates on the sense of community among immigrants to New York City at the time.\n\"Christopher [Walken]'s father was a German immigrant and he was a great baker, so [then] a 16-year-old immigrant I applied and he took me on weekends,\" Bastianich says. \"Christopher's job was to fill the jelly doughnuts with jelly and he used to press them and make a mess. We were friends, you know, the weekends we were there.\"\nBeyond the interviews with Bastianich and those closest to her, \"25 Years with Lidia\" also features \"rare and never-before-seen video and photographs\" from the now-established chef 's journey to celebrity, including recollections of milestone moments such as her and her husband's critically acclaimed first restaurant, Buonavia, which opened in 1971, and her career-solidifying dinner with Julia Child and James Beard at her third restaurant, Felidia. \n \n Caption: Chef Lidia Bastianich and Christopher Walken in \"25 Years With Lidia: A Culinary Jubilee\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One might think he'd jump at the opportunity, but he bides his time in responding, which is both surprising and troubling to Richie (Ron Howard).\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" (MGM+ Drive-In, Tuesday, Dec. 19): The success of \"Star Wars\" prompted the powers that be at Paramount Pictures to give big-screen treatment to creator-producer Gene Roddenberry's legendary 1960s sci-fi series. William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy lead the original cast again as Kirk and Spock, as the retrofitted starship Enterprise heads deep into the galaxy to confront an artificial intelligence that has been destroying other vessels. Robert Wise directed the 1979 film; several of the movie sequels follow.\n\"The 25th Annual A Home for the Holidays\" (CBS, Friday, Dec. 22): Though this is a new special, it's also classic in a way, since it's the latest edition of a seasonal franchise that has advocated for adoption and moved audiences for a quarter-century. Celebrities - including Katharine McPhee (this year's host), Pentatonix, CeCe Winans and Gavin DeGraw - perform and offer true stories of youngsters who have found homes with loving families who have brought them in, and a box of tissues is a virtual requirement for watching the traditionally heartwarming program. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Paul Getty (who else?) said, \"If you can actually count your money, then you are not really a rich man.\"In rubber bridge for high stakes, if you can count the deal correctly, you will probably end up a rich (wo) man. South in today's deal tried--successfully--to find 10 tricks and so made his contract, despite the 4-1 trump break.\nPlaying in four hearts, South ducked the first spade trick, won the second and cashed his two top trumps, finding out that East had two certain heart tricks. How should South have continued? South might have rebid three no-trump, a contract he probably would have made, but that's another story.\nHaving won three of the first four tricks, South was faced with four major-suit losers. However, he spotted that he might be able to win 10 tricks before he lost four.\nAt trick five, declarer cashed his club ace. Then he played a club to dummy's king and ruffed a club in his hand, East discarding a diamond.\nNext came three rounds of diamonds, ending in the dummy. Luckily, East had to follow suit throughout.\nWith nine tricks in, declarer called for dummy's last club.\nSouth couldn't be stopped from making a trick from his two remaining hearts. His 10 tricks were one spade, four hearts, three diamonds and two clubs.\nWhat happened to the fourth defensive winner? Trick 13 could have been taken by either West's top spade or East's master trump. Two winners had been concertinaed--or telescoped, if you prefer--into one. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

What is it?The declarer enjoys a considerable advantage during the card-play. To try to balance the books (as my librarian phrases it), a defender makes the opening lead. Sometimes this is critical -- as in today's deal.\nNote that if the declarer plays first in four spades, he can draw trumps immediately, aided by the 2-2 split. Then he cashes his two top hearts and ruffs a heart in the dummy, bringing down West's queen. South graciously concedes three tricks.\nHowever, West made the opening lead tell. He selected the diamond two, which East won with the queen. As West had supported diamonds, East wasn't tempted to try to cash the diamond ace. Even if West had made an eccentric raise on three low diamonds, he would have led his highest diamond, not the two.\nEast switched to the club ace and continued with the club 10. After winning with the king, West saw what was needed to defeat the contract. He led another club, and East didn't let her partner down. She ruffed with the spade queen.\nSouth overruffed with the spade king, but now West had to win a trump trick. The uppercut had been decisively delivered.\nVoltaire said that marriage is the only adventure open to the cowardly. This East and West are not married, but apparently, after the deal was over, West said, \"Well defended, partner. I wish my wife played bridge as well as you do. She would have ruffed with the spade two.\"\nNo, I wasn't West.

The booth reads \"Guess Your Age - 25 cents.\" Inside, Lucy is sitting in another booth, with a big grin across her face. Her booth claims, \"Keep it a secret - $25.\" The segue from that to today's deal is obscure, even for me. Such is a bridge column occasionally.After a limit raise by North, South was in four spades.\nWest led the club jack.\nAfter winning in hand with his king and drawing two rounds of trumps ending in the dummy, South played a diamond to his queen and West's king. Back came another club. Confidently, declarer won with dummy's ace and played a diamond to his jack. However, West won with the ace and returned a club. Now South had to play the hearts for only one loser, but the defenders made no mistake, defeating the contract.\nWas South unlucky, or did he misplay?\nCertainly he was unlucky, but he also misplayed. After the club king and two rounds of trumps, South should cash dummy's club ace and ruff the last club in his hand. He returns to dummy with a trump and plays a diamond to his queen. After winning with the king, what can West return? If a club, it concedes a ruff-and-sluff. If a heart, South has only one loser in the suit. And if West continues diamonds, he establishes a trick for South.\nWhatever West does, the contract is made.\nHow did West guess to lead the club jack rather than a top diamond? Well, in real life he didn't, but after a diamond lead everyone made four spades. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Which do you think is better? Right - get the opponents to assist.\nNorth's two-no-trump response was the Jacoby Forcing Raise. South rebid four hearts to announce a minimum with no side singleton or void.\nDeclarer won the club lead in hand, drew trumps in two rounds and played a diamond to dummy's king.\nEast won with the ace, cashed the diamond queen and exited with a club. Now South had to find the spade jack for his contract. And as you have probably guessed, he didn't do it. He won the club return in hand, played a club to dummy's ace and led a spade to his king. However, West won with the ace and returned his last spade: down one.\nSouth should have taken the simple precaution of eliminating the clubs before playing a diamond toward dummy's king. Then, after the defenders have taken their two diamond tricks, they must either lead a club, which concedes a ruff-andsluff, or open up spades, which saves South the guess.\nFinally, back to Morley's quotation. He was talking about dancing. On this deal, South failed to step from trick to trick correctly. He trod on his own toes - and, I suppose, those of his partner. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

So if you wanted to go to a family-friendly happy, fun celebration out in your community, that's what this is.\" This year, even the buttons for participants are free. Kilmon said that while the collectable buttons have been something for purchase in the past, they are free of charge this year.\n\"A lot of people collect them, and this is the 30th-year button,\" Kilmon said.\nThe buttons are available at the Easton Visitor Center on Harrison Street. They can be picked up the day of the event or anytime before that. The center is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturdays.\nThis year will be Improv Easton's first time performing at First Night Talbot.\nKilmon said that aside from the crab drop, Improv Easton is a can't miss experience.\n\"They have been practicing and practicing and practicing for months,\" Kilmon said. \"I think that's going to be a great show.\" Kilmon said there will also be more arts and crafts activities for children at the Waterfowl Building this year.\nAnd although this is not Mike Elzey's first rodeo at First Night Talbot, this will be his first year at the Town Hall venue.\n\"It's kind of like a private concert venue versus being out in the open,\" Kilmon said of the change.\nFrom 6 p.m. to 8:45 p.m. at Town Hall, there will be a student showcase from Mike Elzey's Guitar Studio students. From 9:15 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., Elzey will host an air guitar competition with prizes.\nAlong with the Waterfowl Building and Town Hall, there will also be performances at the Avalon Theater throughout the night.\nBut the main event of the night is the crab drop - an 8-foot-wide Maryland blue crab sculpture created by Rich and Suzanne Hood 19 years ago - that will drop at 9 p.m. and at midnight.\nFirst Night Talbot Program Chair Carolyn Jaffe said that when the crab reaches the bottom of the rig, it lights up the numbers for the new year.\n\"It's just the greatest,\" Jaffe said. \"Everybody loves it - to take pictures of each other in front of the crab drop when it's lit up like that.\" This year, USA Today ranked First Night Talbot's crab drop the 6th best New Year's Eve drop in the nation.\n\"They actually had the New York City drop included in that,\" Jaffe said. \"But they weren't in the top 10.\" At an Easton Town Council meeting Monday, Jaffe was honored for her many years of contributions to First Night Talbot.\nKilmon said making the entire First Night Talbot event free gives everyone the opportunity to enjoy the event.\n\"All the stuff that's happening is going to be no charge to the families,\" she said. \"We certainly just want them to come out and enjoy their community.\" More information on First Night Talbot can be found on Facebook@FirstNightTalbot Inc. on on Discover Easton's website.\nQuestions can also be directed to the Easton EDC at 410-690-7348 or welcome@discovereaston.com. \n \n Memo: FIRST NIGHT TALBOT SCHEDULE\n\n Waterfowl building, 40 S.

    "content": "'Relatably funny' - 'Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer' parody celebrates Dorchester County\n\n December 22, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom Mccall; tmccall@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 576\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - Henry VanDyke was struck by a creative thunderbolt eleven years ago. His family has been playing his Dorchester version of \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\" every Christmas since.But the parody song, \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Sika Deer,\" gained some broader regional attention recently after it played on local radio station WINX-FM.\n\"Eleven years ago I was pumping gas and the original song came on the radio, and I just started singing with my words and about three quarters of the song was written right there,\" he said. \"That is what my wife and I do. We are always making up funny lyrics.\" To capture the yuletide magic of his holiday parody, VanDyke borrowed friends' recorders and laptops.\nFor the backtracking, he said, \"It is just an instrumental. We purchased a karaoke track and then put the words to it.\" There is a bluegrass bounce to it.\nParody is as old as the ancient Greeks, and VanDyke thinks it takes certain ingredients to work.\n\"So the secret to any music is relating to people. And when it comes to parody, it has to be funny. You know, relatably funny. I did all four verses like the original, but we noted a lot of Dorchester County things in the song,\" he said.\n\"Different businesses and things like that. Old tavern called the Stone House that is no longer in business.\nWe talked about Hoopers Island Nikes, which are the white boots and hip boots, and muskrat huts. Sika Deer obviously. Danny's Marine, which is a boat dealer. He is still open. Then we had Great Slates in there, which recently closed. It was a pool hall,\" he said.\n\"(The parody song) is so old that a lot of those businesses are closed now,\" Jeannie VanDyke, Henry's wife, said. \"Kaley (their daughter) and I called Mark Potter and told him to play it, and he did, because Kaley wanted to hear her dad on the radio. And then everybody is like, 'We heard your husband on the radio'.\" The song's local references garnered quite a bit of attention from the radio station's Eastern Shore audience.\n\"Kaley heard it on the school bus.\nShe was pretty excited about that.\nA lot of people don't believe it is her dad. She thinks it is funny,\" Henry said from his Central Texas style barbecue joint Lil' Bitta Bull on Race Street.\nHe had run a mechanic shop next door, but the barbecue started to take off.\n\"I realized that I probably needed to focus more on the food. It was a pretty big hit. I turn hobbies into careers,\" he said.\n\"I am afraid if I make too many more parodies, I will turn a hobby into a career, and then there I would go. I would have to get T-shirts and everything,\" he said. \"Somebody took the song and put it on YouTube.\nIf you search 'Grandma Got Run Over by a Sika Deer,' it will populate in your search. I think that is how the radio guy got it.\" VanDyke's song speaks to his local culture.\n\"Locals love it when they figure out you are talking about their hometown, their way of life, south country,\" he said. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Henry and Jeannie VanDyke show off his Will Ferell Christmas t-shirt at their barbecue joint Lil' Bitta Bull on Race Street. His Christmas parody of \"Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer\" can be found on YouTube. It's new title is \"Grandma Got Run Over By a Sika Deer.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

(Has your partner ever taken ages over a play and then made the wrong one?)Today's deal highlights a common unthinking error.\nAfter a lengthy auction to six diamonds, West led the ace and another heart.\nSouth won in hand with his king, played a diamond to dummy's jack, ruffed a low club in hand and cashed all of his trumps. He crossed to dummy's heart queen, discarded spades on the two top clubs and took the unavoidable spade finesse: down one.\nThe declarer grumbled about his bad luck, unaware that he had made a mistake.\nThere were two main chances for the contract: clubs 4-4 or the spade finesse working. As the latter could wait, South should have thought more about a possible even club break. To benefit from that, South had to ruff two low clubs in his hand and still have a dummy entry left.\nBy now, you will have seen the right play. At trick one, South must unblock his heart king under West's ace. He wins the heart continuation in the dummy, ruffs a low club, plays a diamond to dummy's jack, ruffs another low club and draws trumps. Dummy is entered with a heart and the top clubs cashed. When they break, South claims.\nHowever, if the clubs are not 4-4, the spade finesse is taken.\nWatch those entries. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bridge - Deception by deduction\n\n December 26, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Phillip Alder | Page: A7 | Section: News \n \n 254\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n John Ruskin, who was an English art critic, discussed painters when he wrote, \"The essence of lying is in deception, not in words.\" In bridge, sometimes you lie in words when you make, for example, a psychic bid.During the play, sometimes you lie by false carding. In today's deal, a defender fooled declarer by dropping an unnecessarily high card. However, it helped that he had calculated his \"generosity\" couldn't cost a trick.\nIn four hearts, declarer won the first trick with his club ace and cashed the heart ace, \"dropping\" West's queen.\nWorried that East had four trumps, South immediately ran the diamond 10. East kept up the good defense, ducking his king. Suddenly fooled, South repeated the diamond finesse, but East won with the king and gave his partner a diamond ruff.\nWest cashed the club queen, and the heart jack was the fourth defensive trick.\nCool - but how did West know he could afford to play the heart queen? Well, if South had started with A-Jx-x of hearts, he would have played a heart to dummy's king and taken the trump finesse. So, when South started with the heart ace, East was marked with the jack. Dropping the queen was safe. Also, it couldn't mislead East, because South was marked with four hearts from the auction. (If South had opened one no-trump with five hearts, he would have drawn two rounds of trumps before taking the diamond finesse.)\nHowever, remember, when trying a deceptive defense, be careful not to deceive your partner more than declarer. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A very good question! Do you and your partner agree? Unless you use the Lebensohl convention (which, following an overcall, employs an artificial two no-trump to increase the possibilities), you cannot do more than select one interpretation. I would vote for game invitational. With a game-force, you either jump to three no-trump or cuebid the intervenor's suit and hope it all works out.\nAt the table, West led his fourth-highest heart.\nDeclarer called for dummy's jack and, when it held the trick, played on clubs. The defense was dead.\nHolding three aces, West should lead the heart ace. If the dummy has, say, three hearts, West will continue with a low heart, playing for declarer to hold kingdoubleton.\nHere, though, West leads the queen at trick two, pinning dummy's jack and hoping declarer doesn't have the 10. As you can see, this defense kills the contract. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

If it wins, an extra trick is in the bag.However, you should always consider what will happen if the finesse loses. Would it be better not to finesse?\nIn today's deal, North might have passed over two no trump, but he decided that that contract was unlikely to make exactly. Either the hearts would be useful and nine tricks won, or they wouldn't and he would be conceding an extra under trick by bidding game.\nWest led the club king: four, five, two. (Yes, leading the seven would have worked much better, but with two apparent entries, leading the honor looked preferable.)\nWest continued with the club nine: eight, jack, 10.\nEast switched to the spade two. How should South have continued from thereft\nThe first declarer finessed his spade queen, but West, feeling relieved, won with the king and played another club. When South led a heart, West grabbed his ace and cashed the clubs for down three.\nThe second declarer rose with the spade ace at trick three and led a heart to dummy's nine. When that won, South played a diamond to his queen and led his second heart. With the favorable lie, nine tricks were there for the taking.\nThe first declarer claimed how lucky the other declarer had been to find both heart honors onside tripleton.\nHowever, if East holds the heart queen, the contract is probably doomed. For one thing, West is likely to hold the spade king and heart ace for his vulnerable two-level overcall. Also, if West has the heart queen, the spade finesse can wait. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

You return home from the former bored but refreshed. From the latter, you are enlightened but exhausted. You feel as if you need a holiday to recover from your holiday.In bridge, there are declarers who play as if they have their heads buried in the sand, and those who are all eyes open and aware of the possibilities.\nTheir differing approaches are highlighted in today's deal.\nNorth's raise to three notrump was correct, especially as East's opening bid had marked where the opposing cards lay.\nThe head-in-the-sand South won the first trick with the heart ace and immediately took the diamond finesse.\nHowever, East won with the king and cleared the heart suit. Declarer, with only eight tricks (two spades, two hearts and four diamonds), had to attack clubs. But East won immediately with the ace and cashed three heart tricks to defeat the contract.\nThe eyes-open declarer, who realized that East rated to have the club ace and diamond king for his opening bid, saw the right line. He crossed to dummy's spade king at trick two. Then he led a low club toward his king. East had to duck his ace, else declarer would have nine tricks via two spades, two hearts, one diamond and four clubs. After winning with the club king, South took the diamond finesse, setting up nine tricks: two spades, two hearts, four diamonds and one club.\n©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I particularly like deals in which the \"normal\" play isn't right, for whatever reason.However, I also enjoy deals like today's, because most players would go down in five diamonds. Still, if you think of the right play, immediately you will know that it is correct.\nBe warned, though, that the theme isn't quite in Herman Melville's class.\nIn \"Moby Dick,\" he wrote, \"Give me a condor's quill! Give me Vesuvius' crater for an inkstand! To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.\"\nSouth might (should?) have bid four spades over four diamonds, reaching an easy contract to make as the cards lie. However, in love with his eight-card suit, South went for five diamonds. After West led the club king, how should South have planned the play?\nThe declarer ruffed the lead, drew trumps and cashed dummy's top spades. This was reasonable play, because if West had the spade queen, the contract was always safe.\nHowever, when South led a third spade, East produced the queen and switched to the heart queen, defeating the contract. Where did South go wrong?\nAs so often happens, the error occurred at trick one.\nSouth should discard a spade. Let's suppose West continues with another club. South ruffs, draws the trumps, cashes dummy's top spades and ruffs a spade in hand. Declarer returns to dummy with a trump and discards his two hearts on dummy's brace of spade winners. Instead of down one, declarer harvests an overtrick. Then West will wonder if he should have found the lethal low club lead. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Sink in: Final season of 'La Brea' premieres\n\n January 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Sarah Passingham | Page: 12A | Section: News \n \n 540\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Science fiction stories help us escape the reality in which we live to fantastical worlds that are sometimes literally turning themselves inside out. The final season of \"La Brea,\" the sci-fidrama that explores a world full of time-bending portals and sinkholes, premieres the first of its last six episodes on NBC Tuesday, Jan. 9.Natalie Zea (\"Justified\"), Eoin Macken (\"I Used to Be Famous,\" 2022), Zyra Gorecki (\"Chicago Fire\") and Jack Martin (\"All Rise\") all return as the Harris family, who have been searching for each other, along with some answers about the La Brea tar pit sinkhole that opened up and separated them, for two seasons.\n\"La Brea\" will wrap up its story this season with six action-packed episodes tying together the threads between its several timelines. It all began in present-day Los Angeles, when a massive sinkhole opened up in the middle of the city, sending everything and everyone deep into the past. Sinkhole survivors land in what they learn is the place from which they fell, but all the way back in the year 10,000 BCE.\nTwo members of the Harris family were sent through the sinkhole time portal: mother and office manager Eve (Zea) and her teenage son, Josh (Martin). Now separated physically from her estranged husband, former Air Force pilot Gavin (Macken), and her daughter, Izzy (Gorecki), Eve struggles to understand the new world she was dropped into and tries to find her way back to solid ground in present-day L.A.\nChiké Okonkwo (\"Being Mary Jane\") is Dr. Ty Coleman, a therapist who befriends Eve and Sam in 10,000 BCE. Ty is living with a terminal brain tumor when he is sent through the sinkhole, an unimaginable event that changes his perspective on life. His adventure into the past includes falling for Paara (Tonantzin Carmelo, \"The English\"), a Tongva woman who connects with him over complicated past relationships. Though their relationship had its struggles - they come from two completely different centuries, after all - the pair married in a rare moment of celebration among the survivors.\nEve and Ty emerge as leaders among the new sinkhole society early on, joined by former Marine and surgeon Sam Velez (Jon Seda \"Chicago P.D.\"), who entered 10,000 BCE with his daughter, college student Riley (Veronica St. Clair, \"Unbelievable\"). Rohan Mirchandaney (\"The Newsreader\") is Australian stoner Scott Israni, whose knowledge as an anthropology graduate student becomes a commodity after he winds up falling through the sinkhole. Scott becomes close with Josh and Riley, but often gets himself into dangerous situations with others - like when he was almost killed by The Exiles before Gavin stepped in last season.\nA well-armed group of warriors who, like the \"Sky People\" who fell from L.A. into the distant past, The Exiles seem to have arrived from another time. Led by Taamet (Martin Sensmeier, \"Alaska Daily\"), who happens to be Paara's ex-husband, The Exiles use steel weaponry, something that is not historically consistent with 10,000 BCE. The Exiles are foes, not friends, to anyone new they encounter, taking Eve hostage in the second season, along with Veronica (Lily Santiago, \"Vineyards,\" 2023) and former Air Force pilot and longtime friend of the Harris family, Levi Delgado (Nicholas Gonzalez, \"The Good Doctor\"). \n \n Caption: Jon Seda and Eoin Macken \"La Brea\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Darnell invites two pairings of chefs who have some kind of food feud to bring their knives and bury the hatchet once and for all. In the end, the two Grudge Match victors walk out with a $10,000 cash prize, a prized knife from the losing chef's knife roll and bragging rights for life!\" Throughout this second season, Ferguson has invited some highly talented Food Network alumni to take part in his challenge, with upcoming episodes seeing the likes of Jay Ducote (\"Food Network Star\"), Joe Sasto (\"The Great Food Truck Race\") and many others enter into the ring. More exciting names are still to come, however, with new episodes rolling out weekly and Food Network promising appearances from chefs Aarti Sequeira (\"Aarti Party\"), Brian Malarkey (\"Beachside Brawl\") and Antonia Lofaso (\"Top Chef \"), along with food critic Troy Johnson (\"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\").\nDuring this season's finale episode, for example: \"longtime rivals compete in two epic all-star battles for the favor of judges Eric Adjepong [\"The Great Soul Food Cook-Off \"] and Stephanie Izard [\"Top Chef \"],\" Food Network shares.\n\"In the first match, chef Nate Appleman [\"The Next Iron Chef \"] takes on chef Amanda Freitag [\"Chopped\"] to show the world that he's ready to join the elite corps of chefs who compete on 'Tournament of Champions'.

    "content": "Taylor Swift Tops List of Spotify Earners in 2023\n\n January 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 8A | Section: News \n \n 868\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After being named Time Magazine's Person of the Year, pop star Taylor Swift has another achievement to cap off 2023: she's the first artist to earn more than $100 million from Spotify, according to Billboard Magazine.Spotify listeners played her music more than any other artist this year. The streaming giant released its Wrapped analysis on Nov. 29, showing Swift's songs were streamed more than 26 billion times since Jan. 1, 2023.\nThrough Spotify, those streams rack up $97 million in royalties, with the busy singer on track to earn $100 million by the end of December.\nIf you include publishing revenue, the ubiquitous \"Lavender Haze\" artist is estimated to receive about $131 million in royalties from Spotify this year. However, this is from one streaming platform alone.\nBillboard estimates that her total earnings this year will approach $200 million if recording and publishing royalties from other streaming services like Amazon Music, Apple Music, and YouTube Music are also included.\nThanks to Swift re-recording her \"Taylor's Version\" of four albums, Fearless, Red, Speak Now, and 1989, she has the master rights to all her music. That means most of that $200 million will go into her bank account, which is in good shape already, thanks to the $1 billion grossed by her Eras tour.\nScooter Braun, Scott Borchetta, and Taylor Swift: What Happened?\nSwift signed with Big Machine Music and its founder Scott Borchetta when she was 15. She tried to earn back the rights to her master recordings for years.\nThen, in 2019, Ithaca Holdings, which record executive Scooter Braun owns, acquired Big Machine.\nTo put it lightly, she was not pleased to have her masters in the hands of Braun, whom she called an, \"incessant, manipulative bully\" in her Tumblr post.\nSo, because her master recordings - that is, the original recording from which all copies are made - were now owned by someone she didn't like, she set out to re-record and re-release all her albums as new recordings.\nBy doing so, she now wholly owns all the new masters and completely controls her songs. So far, she has created her own \"Taylor's Version\" of four of her six albums. The albums Taylor Swift and Reputation are still in the works.\nSwift has changed some lyrics and the sound of several songs on her re-recorded albums. She also released several songs not released on the original albums, including the tearjerker \"We Were Happy.\" Perhaps the step that generated the most attention was releasing a 10-minute version of one of her saddest songs, \"All Too Well,\" which also included a short film music video starring actors Dylan O'Brien and Sadie Sink.\nFans have responded positively to the renewed albums.\n1989 (Taylor's Version) actually performed better than the original release, according to Vulture.\nTaylor Swift + Spotify Hasn't Always Been a \"Love Story\" Although she's now earning millions from her devoted fans' streams on Spotify and other music streaming platforms, Swift's relationship with the platform hasn't always been cordial.\nIn fact, in 2014, her then-label Big Machine Music removed all of her music from the platform entirely. At the time, music labels were pivoting from selling music downloads to charging for access to streaming music. Many took issue with the fact that Spotify users could listen to the music they owned free of charge through the app.\nAccording to Rolling Stone, Spotify told artists and labels at the time that the royalties would get better once more people started paying for the app's premium version. The platform said it paid out $500 million in royalties in 2013, compared to $ 5 billion in 2020 and $7 billion in 2021. That said, artists continue to say their pay from the major streaming services is inadequate.\nFor the record, Spotify doesn't pay out directly to artists. The platform pays the artists' distributors, labels, etc., who then pay the artists.\nThe outcry has led to efforts to introduce a fairer system.\nIn 2022, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., introduced House Concurrent Resolution 102, recognizing the need for fairer compensation for artists' labor. The resolution notes that it requires 800,000 streams for an artist to make the equivalent of $15 an hour.\nIn November, Spotify announced it is updating its royalties system \"to better support those most dependent on streaming revenues as part of their livelihood.\" The changes target artificial streams and noise tracks aiming to game the system and redistribute small payments that aren't reaching artists.\nBy making these changes, Spotify says it will be able to drive an additional $1 billion toward emerging artists and smaller artists in the next five years.\nEras Tour Traditions Swift may be famous for her lyrics that draw from her love life, but her Eras Tour has sparked a friendship-based activity for attendees: creating and trading handmade friendship bracelets.\nFans showed off their arms stacked with bracelets before Swift's concerts on the 52-show tour of the United States. The craze may have drawn inspiration from an Instagram post Swift shared in 2019, or perhaps from the lyrics of the song \"You're On Your Own, Kid,\" encouraging the listener to make friendship bracelets.\nThis article was produced by Orchestra Central and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n \n Caption: AP HPOTO/NATACHA PISARENKO\n\n Taylor Swift performs at the Monumental stadium during her Eras Tour concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Thursday, Nov. 9, 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The first film released under the Touchstone banner, it makes good use of Hanks' ordinary-guy persona as his character falls in love with a woman who turns out to be a mermaid (Daryl Hannah).

His steadiest sidekick was played by Pat Buttram, later known as Mr. Haney on \"Green Acres.\" \"Citizen Kane\" (Turner Classic Movies, Thursday, Jan. 11): If you're serious about loving movies, you likely know a lot about Orson Welles' 1941 masterpiece already. Regarded by some as the best film ever made, the drama stars producer, director and co-writer Welles as a media titan partially based on William Randolph Hearst who was furious about being a model for such a depiction, Stylistically innovative in many ways, the picture was edited by Robert Wise, later a director of note himself. The cast of supporting players from the Welles-co-founded Mercury Theatre includes Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ray Collins and Everett Sloane. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She also has a secret life as an assassin for hire, a secret that her husband David (David Oyelowo) discovers when the couple decide to spice up their marriage with a little role play. This thriller also stars Bill Nighy and Connie Nielsen.\n\"Grimsburg\" - Season 1 (Jan. 8)\nThis new animated comedy stars Jon Hamm as Marvin Flute, who may be the greatest detective ever to catch a cannibal clown or correctly identify a mid-century modern armoire. But, there's one mystery he still can't crack - his family. Now that he's back in Grimsburg, a town where everyone has a secret or three, Flute will follow every lead he's got to redeem himself with the ex-wife he never stopped loving.\n\"The Trust: A Game of Greed\" (Jan. 10)\nEleven strangers are given a quarter of a million dollars to split evenly. Will they take their fair shareft Or will the allure of more money cause them to vote each other out to keep more for themselves? It's the ultimate test of human nature, as greed and mistrust threaten to destroy the strongest relationships. In this game, everyone starts as winners and they can all leave as winners - if they choose to share \"Bluey\" (Jan. 12)\nIn 10 all-new episodes, this family-favorite children's animated series showcases the joyful simplicity that can be found in families turning everyday events of family life - like making a cubby house (blanket fort) or a trip to the beach - into unique adventures that bring to life how children learn and grow through play. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Is that true?A: Yes two of them, in fact. Her earliest professional credit is \"The Edge of Night,\" on which she appeared for several episodes in 1984. Soon afterward, she joined \"As the World Turns,\" playing the dual roles of Frannie Hughes and her look-alike relative Sabrina. She earned a Daytime Emmy Award for her work on that show, which she did continuously from 1985 to 1988; she then made a return appearance in 2010.\nMoore began doing primetime TV parts during her \"As the World Turns\" run, notably opposite Valerie Bertinelli in the 1987 miniseries \"I'll Take Manhattan,\" then she was hired for TV-movies including \"Money, Power, Murder\" and \"The Last to Go.\" Around the same time, she also moved into theatrical films with \"Tales From the Darkside: The Movie\" and \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,\" and that became her principal venue from the early 1990s forward, with her eventual win of an Academy Award for best actress for \"Still Alice\" (2014).\nAfter doing guest stints along the way on \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"Sesame Street,\" Moore made a particularly significant return to TV by playing former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2012 HBO project \"Game Change.\" She won a Primetime Emmy Award for the dramatization of the 2008 election season, with Ed Harris playing Sen. John McCain, who chose Palin as his running mate \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Sundance presents the 1977 comedy hit - directed by Reynolds crony and former stuntman Hal Needham - Saturday, Jan. 13, featuring the star as a fast-driving troubleshooter hired to transport a cargo of beer illegally across state lines.While his partner (Jerry Reed, who also supplies some of the music here) hauls the physical stash in a large truck, the Bandit (Reynolds) scouts for trouble en route and that actually finds him, in the form of a runaway bride (an amusing, engaging Sally Field) whose would-be father-in-law (Jackie Gleason, playing it broadly and hilariously) is a \"Smokey\" or lawman who's determined to catch the wily Bandit.

Fans of the superhero genre have long been divided into camps - DC versus Marvel, for instance - but those seeking any form of visual entertainment, from art to books to film and television, would be hardpressed to find a medium that did not cater in some way to caped crusaders or leotard-clad superhumans.That said, ever since The Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel Entertainment in 2009 (for a whopping $4 billion), the company's streamer, Disney+, has been one of the greatest proponents of the \"super\" genre. Newest to join the ranks is \"Echo,\" the \"Hawkeye\" spinoff series premiering Wednesday, Jan. 10, on the platform.\nWhile hardly new to the Marvel Universe, Echo is best known to current Marvel fans in the form of budding actress Alaqua Cox, who was born and raised in the Menominee Indian Reservation in Keshena, Wisconsin, and is of the Menominee and Mohican nation. Starring alongside Jeremy Renner (\"The Hurt Locker,\" 2008) and Hailee Steinfeld (\"Dickinson\") in the 2021 miniseries \"Hawkeye,\" Echo was introduced in a supporting role and garnered plenty of attention for her two-fold inclusivity and incredible fighting abilities. As is the case with nearly all superheroes and villains in the MCU, Echo's backstory is somewhat complicated and varies significantly between sources, but at least three things remain consistent: her name, her background and her deafness.\nBorn Maya Lopez, Echo is the highly gifted daughter of secret mob enforcer William Lopez (Zahn McClarnon, \"Dark Winds\") - sometimes referred to as William Lincoln in other related source material - a proud Native American man of the Cheyenne Nation, and a Latina mother, known vaguely as \"Ms.\nLopez,\" who abandoned the family when Maya was young. Upon his untimely death related to criminal activities, William urges hulking mobster Kingpin, a.k.a.\nWilson Fisk (played in \"Echo\" by Vincent D'Onofrio of 1987's \"Full Metal Jacket\"), to look after his young daughter at all costs. Nothing if not a man of his word, Fisk agrees - and so begins Lopez's journey as Echo.\nPer the Marvel website, the Disney+ series is Echo's origin story and \"revisits Maya Lopez, whose ruthless behavior in New York City catches up with her in her hometown. She must face her past, reconnect with her Native American roots and embrace the meaning of family and community if she ever hopes to move forward.\" By reconnecting with her hometown, her roots and her own morals and desires, Maya tries to let go of what no longer serves her and embrace the feelings that have been driving her down the same dangerous path as Kingpin and the father she lost during her childhood. Along the way, however, there is plenty of violence, bloodshed and \"real consequences\" (per Freeland) - hence the series' TV-MA rating.\nBehind the scenes, Navajo filmmaker Sydney Freeland (\"Reservation Dogs\") and Australian/Gunaikurnai creative Catriona McKenzie (\"Satellite Boy,\" 2012) direct the series. Naturally, Freeland and McKenzie were excited to begin work on a project focused on the only deaf Indigenous superhero in entertainment media. Beyond that, the official trailer for \"Echo\" also prominently features the hero's prosthetic leg, an addition to the original source material to provide added inclusivity and incorporate Alaqua's own, real-life prosthetic into the storyline.\n\"Representation was extremely important to myself and to everyone on the crew,\" Freeland stated at an October 2023 news conference.\nBut neither Alaqua's amputee status nor the character's deafness was front and center while plotting the show's details. Sure, the creators gave thought to her disabilities and incorporated them into the storyline, but her so-called \"disabilities\" - as \"Hawkeye\" fans have clearly already noticed - are hardly disabling. Instead, creators laid much of the focus on the toll anger, resentment and physical trauma can take on a human being as they interact with the oft-cruel world around them.\nAt the end of the day, Freeland noted, \"Echo\" is \"an exploration of trauma - how we deal with it, how we cope with it, how it affects us, how we affect it, how it affects those around us.\" \n \n Caption: Alaqua Cox stars in \"Echo\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But if you did think of it, you knew immediately that it was right. Today's deal is similar, except that it is even harder to find the best play.Don't peek at the East-West cards. You (South) reach four hearts after West has overcalled in diamonds. He starts the defense by cashing the two top trumps, East following both times, and switching to the spade nine.\nWhat now?\nNorth, with three hearts and a side-suit singleton, was fully justified in driving to game.\nSouth won the third trick with dummy's spade ace, ruffed a spade in hand, cashed the diamond ace, ruffed a diamond in the dummy and ruffed another spade in hand. When the suit didn't break 3-3, South fell back on the club finesse. However, it lost, and a diamond to West's king spelled down one.\nDid you spot the best play?\nAfter the first spade ruff in hand, South should lead the diamond queen from his hand!\nWhen West wins with the king, as he surely will, he may have no good return.\nAnother spade, if West has one, will probably establish dummy's suit. A diamond is into South's A-10 tenace.\nA club is thrown from the dummy, and South's club loser is ruffed in the dummy.\nFinally, a club switch by West gives South two chances. He plays low from the dummy, winning three club tricks whenever West has either the 10 or the queen.\nAs John F. Kennedy said, \"You can't depend on your judgment when your imagination is out of focus.\" ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "The Most Anticipated Films of 2024\n\n January 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Wealth of Geeks | Section: Entertainment \n \n 835\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Now that Hollywood is back at full production, 2024 is poised to be a great year at the movies.After the billion-dollar box office from Barbie: The Movie, the 2023 movie year was a successful one. As usual, sequels and prequels dominate the 2024 release calendar. However, if Top Gun: Maverick and Avatar: The Way of Water proved anything, it's that truly well-made sequels are worth seeing.\nFor the first time in a long while, superhero movies won't dominate the 2024 roster due to the back-to-back misfires in 2023. That means other genres are set to succeed at the box office, giving audiences plenty to choose from. There are some highly anticipated Hollywood titles hitting theaters in 2024.\nDune Part 2\nU.S. release date: March 1, 2024\nThe sequel to 2021's Dune Part 1 was set to be released in November 2023, but it was delayed due to the prolonged SAG-AFTRA strike. Part 2 continues the journey of Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) in seeking revenge for House Atreides' downfall in the hands of the evil Emperor (Christopher Walken) and his right hand, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). To do that, Paul must mobilize the Fremen, the native Arrakis tribe, who see him as their prophesied savior.\nKung Fu Panda 4\nU.S. release date: March 8, 2024\nAfter a long wait, the food-and-martial-arts-loving panda is back in action. Po and the gang will travel to a new city and face their most formidable foe yet in the form of a cunning chameleon. Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, and Seth Rogen also reprise their roles in the DreamWorks Animation movie.\nGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire\nU.S. release date: April 12, 2024\nFollowing their first big showdown in 2021's Godzilla vs Kong, the two giant beasts must work together to stop a mutual foe from destroying the entire planet. Once again directed by Godzilla vs Kong 's director Adam Wingard, this film promises the same epic battle scenes in various landscapes worldwide.\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\nU.S. release date: May 24, 2024\nA prequel to the Academy Award-winning Mad Max: Fury Road, the action-adventure film will chart the origin story of fan-favorite Furiosa, played by The Queen's Gambit actress Anya Taylor-Joy. Stolen from her birthplace, a young Furiosa gets caught in a feud between two warlords. Also directed by George Miller, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga promises to deliver plenty of high-octane vehicular thrills.\nInside Out 2\nU.S. release date: June 14, 2024\nGet ready to feel the feels once more as Joy, Sadness, and the rest of the gang are back for another Pixar adventure. Riley is now a teenager experiencing turbulent emotions, as teenagers do. That means Joy's control room will be welcoming a host of new feelings like Anxiety, Envy, and Embarrassment. Amy Poehler returns to voice Joy, while Stranger Things ' Maya Hawke comes on board as Anxiety.\nDespicable Me 4\nU.S. release date: July 3, 2024\nThe Illumination franchise chugs on with a fourth installment of the flagship film series following 2022's Minions: The Rise of Gru. Reformed evil guy Gru and his growing family are back for more hijinks. Of course, expect Gru's beloved yellow Minions to return with their absurd hilarity. This is the family film of the summer.\nDeadpool 3\nU.S. release date: July 26, 2024\nFollowing the Fox and Disney merger, the merc (mercenary) with a mouth finally joins the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and not a moment too soon. MCU could use some help after their disastrous 2023, and who better to assist than Deadpool, whose last two films grossed over $1.5 billion combined? For his latest romp, Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) receives the helping claws of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), whose return from death will be one of the most intriguing aspects of the film.\nJoker: Folie à Deux\nU.S. release date: October 4, 2024\n2019's Joker was a surprise hit in many ways. Not only did it gross over $1 billion against a $70 million budget, but it was also nominated for 11 Oscars — a record for a comic book movie.\nFive years later, Joaquin Phoenix returns to reprise his Oscar-winning role as Joker, the actor's first sequel ever. He will be joined by pop superstar Lady Gaga, playing the DC rogue's girlfriend, Harley Quinn. Not much is known about the film other than it will be a musical.\nWicked, Part I\nU.S. release date: November 27, 2024\nThe adaptation of the record-breaking Broadway musical has had an arduous road to the big screen. But finally, Glinda (Ariana Grande) and Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) will fly to theaters next Thanksgiving. The film charts the beginning of the two witches of Oz long before Dorothy's arrival. Elphaba, the misunderstood outcast, is befriended by the popular Glinda, but ambition and jealousy soon threaten to jeopardize their bond.\nMufasa: The Lion King\nU.S. release date: December 20, 2024\nThe lions of Pride Rock will roar once again in this CGI live-action prequel of Disney's 2019 mega-hit Lion King. Directed by Oscar-winning filmmaker Barry Jenkins, the film simultaneously follows Mufasa's early life and Simba's effort to teach his offspring about their legacy.\nThis article was produced The Money Dreamer and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "MPT series Chesapeake Collectibles back for 11th season\n\n January 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 800\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OWINGS MILLS — Following a three-year pause, Maryland Public Television's original series \"Chesapeake Collectibles,\" returns for its 11th season with a treasure trove of captivating finds.A producer of the program, Patrick Keegan, noted that ever since the hiatus, partly due to Covid-19 restrictions, there's a need to see the show's reemergence.\n\"The public is hungry for it,\" Keegan said. \"We're always willing to give the public what they want.\"\nFor those unfamiliar with the program, he described it as a regional version of \"Antiques Roadshow.\" Guests bring in their items to be assessed by expert appraisers who reveal fascinating facts about the items' history, provenance and value.\nIn this season, folks from Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and even West Virginia filled MPT's new studio for their June taping.\n\"It's interesting; it's a great community event and also a television show,\" Keegan added.\nWhile guests had paintings, old writings, custom tools, vintage toys, or anything else evaluated, producers scrambled to find the most interesting pieces to put on the show.\n1,000 people came and brought 3,000 items they were curious about.\nWith only 80 slots this season, a small percentage of the 1,000 people were put on-air.\nThose who did, fell into one of three parameters, Keegan said.\nThe producers ask, is the item interesting in itself?\nFor example, one gentleman brought in Titanic memorabilia. He had medals from soldiers aboard the ship on that fateful day in 1912.\nDoes the item tell a good story?\nKeegan pointed out it's not as compelling a tale if a wealthy person purchased a painting from an auction and had it appraised.\nBut, if someone inherited the painting, or if someone found something invaluable at a junk shop, it plays better with the audience.\nAnd since this is \"Chesapeake Collectibles,\" how does the item relate to the region?\nOn the program, there are portraits from artists living around the Chesapeake Bay, tools used in ship construction from the 1800's and memorabilia from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad company, to name a few.\nSome items are interesting without much context.\nOne of the most amazing finds in episode 1 was an Apple 1 computer, hand-built by Steve Jobs in 1976.\nOne woman brought in the first ever Barbie doll from 1959. She had no idea of the valuable item in her possession.\nImagine her surprise when she found out.\n\"That's what we producers live for; that reaction shot,\" Keegan said.\nIn many cases, the possessor of the item is just as interesting as the item.\nFor instance, on the show was one of the teachers who trained for the Space Shuttle Challenger. She had reached the final testing period before she was taken off the project, fortunate because the shuttle broke apart in flight, killing the seven crew members aboard in 1986.\nShe had a fascinating story, and was on \"Chesapeake Collectibles,\" displaying her NASA memorabilia from that training time.\nThere were some intriguing guests on the show from Talbot County, John Bosman Kerr and his wife Lucy Hamilton Stevens Kerr. Residents in Central Maryland brought in portraits of their descendants.\nKerr was appointed as the chargé d'affaires, (a diplomatic official) to Nicaragua by President Millard Fillmore.\nKerr had passed down his family Bible, printed in 1599. In the back of it was a narration of Kerr's entire family history.\nSeeing stories unfold like that is rewarding for Keegan, who said he's never felt closer to the audience in his television career.\nHe spent many years working with the \"BBC, Animal Planet and Discovery.\" He aided in programs like \"Whale Wars, River Monsters and Pitbulls and Parolees,\" where he saw many exotic locations and events.\nHe appreciates those programs, but he sees working at MPT as leaving a legacy, producing shows in Maryland; his home of 20 years now.\n\"MPT's mission is to give back to the community, and we hear from our viewers all the time. That's what I'm proud of,\" he said.\nOn that note, Keegan would like to hear from the public. Taping for season 12 is June 22 or 23. He encouraged them to go to mpt.org to sign up or reach out to them by phone.\n\"You have plenty of time,\" he said, referring to the cut-off in early June.\nIn the meantime, check out \"Chesapeake Collectibles,\" and look for your Maryland neighbors and their shocked reactions when something in their attic is worth $10,000.\nAs a bonus award for longtime viewers of the program, one of the most beloved and popular hosts, Rhea Feikin, the \"First Lady of MPT,\" returned for episode 1, this time as a guest.\nIt's just another example of MPT listening to their public. They're thankful for their faithful viewers in a TV climate where everything is on-demand or on thirty-second TikTok clips.\nWhile you're tuned in to MPT, check out Keegan's other programs like \"Destination Maryland,\" and \"Made in Maryland,\" for more content that speaks to a local audience, educating and enlightening them.\nSeason 11 airs on Mondays at 7:30 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The performance will be held at the Avalon's Stoltz Listening Room in downtown Easton.\nThe musical trio are \"college friends turned bandmates\" who intermingle country music with indie rock and other genres.\nThe band is made up of Madison Cunningham, John R. Miller and Orville Peck.\n\"The music of Dallas Ugly shimmers with an iridescent nostalgia. Built on a foundation of mellow interchanges of electric guitar and pedal steel, the rhythm and flow evoke an old-school country version of lofi hip hop radio. But combined with soaring fiddle and heartfelt vocals, it becomes something wholly new — a sound as unique as it is dreamy.\" the Avalon quotes music writer Kara Kundert in an announcement promoting the upcoming show.\nFor more: https://www.avalonfoundation.org/ and https://www.dallasugly.com/ \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Something funny’s going on at the Garfield Center\n\n January 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 768\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — What do you do when, to inherit a large sum of money, you must take a dead guy on his last planned vacation to Monte Carlo? We're all going to find out starting on Feb. 9 with the Garfield Center for the Arts' 2024 Season opener, the over-the-top musical comedy Lucky Stiff.Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty met and wrote their first song together at the Lehman Engel BMI Musical Theatre Workshop in 1983. According to Ahrens, one song led to another, songs grew into musicals, and musicals grew into a body of work. The two later went on to collaborate on the well-known musicals Ragtime, Seussical and Once on This Island.\nTheir first successful collaboration, the musical Lucky Stiff, had its premiere at New York's Playwrights Horizons in an extremely limited run in 1988, but had a longer and more successful run at Maryland's Olney Theatre starting in May 1989. It won the 1990 Helen Hayes Award for Best Musical, and landed its lead actor, Evan Papas, an award for Best Actor in a Musical. In 1994, a studio cast recording was released and the musical had its British debut at the Theatre Royal in England, followed in 1997 by a West End production in London. Since then there has been a film adaptation of the musical, and the production has been successfully staged all around the world.\nBased on the novel \"The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo\" by Michael Butterworth, the musical tells the story of how London shoe salesman Harry Witherspoon is set to inherit $6,000,000 because his distant uncle, Anthony Hendon, has been murdered. Harry is Anthony's only living relative, but he only gets the money if he takes the embalmed, wheelchair-strapped body on his Uncle's planned vacation to Monte Carlo. Harry must follow his Uncle's detailed itinerary for the trip, or the money will go instead to the Universal Dog Home of Brooklyn, whose director, Annabel Glick, follows Harry, hoping he'll make a mistake. Add in an abrasive gangster's girlfriend, a nervous optometrist, a boisterous Italian playboy, a sexy French cabaret singer, and a variety of other over the top characters, and it all results in a story of mistaken identities, disguises, surprising love interests, plot twists and unexpected reveals.\nIn the upcoming Garfield Center production, playing the role of Harry is Max Hagan, who appeared at the GCA in Shrek, Prescription: Murder and Sweeney Todd. Playing Annabel is Shannon Carter, who also appeared in Shrek, Sweeney Todd and The Play That Goes Wrong, among others. Melissa McGlynn, who plays Rita, has appeared in countless Garfield productions, including Annie, Shrek, The Play That Goes Wrong and many more. As Vinnie, JW Ruth again appears at the GCA after memorable performances in The Addams Family, Psycho Beach Party and The Play That Goes Wrong. Natalie Hagan returns to the Garfield stage to play Cabaret performer Dominique after her terrific performances in The Addams Family, Prescription: Murder, and Shrek. Matthew Newman, who sings in the Chester River Chorale, makes his GCA stage debut in the role of Luigi. And in the pivotal role of The Body, the GCA is thrilled to announce that longtime favorite Jim Landskroener is back on stage entertaining our community.\nThe show also boasts a seasoned group of performers in the Ensemble, with each actor-singer playing multiple roles. Appearing in the Ensemble is Heather Joyce-Byers, Nic Carter, Heather Robuck and Steffi Ricketts. Heather Joyce-Byers was last seen as the Narrator in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat at the GCA. Nic Carter, the Garfield's Theatre Manager, has appeared on our stage many times, including roles in Sweeney Todd, The Play That Goes Wrong, and he directed last season's Prescription: Murder. Heather Robuck and Steffi Ricketts both return to the GCA stage after appearing as Ancestors in The Addams Family.\nDirecting the production is GCA's Executive Director Steven Arnold, the Music Director is JW Ruth, Choreographers are Jennifer Tosten and Natalie Hagan, the Costume Designer is Barbi Bedell, and the Props Designer is Wendy Wiseman. Jordan Dixon is the Stage Manager, Benji Price is the Sound Engineer, Butch Clark is the Technical Director and Builder, Nic Carter is the Lighting Designer, and Beverly Hall Smith is the scenic painter.\nLucky Stiff opens Feb. 9 and will run weekends through Feb. 25. Show times are 8 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, and 2 p.m. on Sundays. Tickets may be secured anytime online at www.garfieldcenter.org or purchased in person or over the phone during regular box office hours on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The box office number is 410-810-2060. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mainstay musical events to showcase original talent, tribute to Beatles, and more\n\n January 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Music \n \n 650\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For Marylanders looking for invigorating musical events in the upcoming weeks, The Mainstay in Rock Hall has got you covered.Captain Mark Einstein, owner of Blue Crab Chesapeake Charters, and board member at The Mainstay, a nonprofit music venue on Main Street shared his excitement, \"There's lots of cool stuff happening.\"\nLike many personalities you'd meet during open mic nights the second Wednesday of each month, Einstein balances his work on the water, with his entertaining talents. He was recently a participant in \"Kent's Got Talent\" with his trio \"The Singing Captains.\"\nTheir now infamous song, \"Doin the Rock Hall Rag,\" had everyone waving towels in the air in bemusement.\nHe's at it again this year and brought some of his talented friends.\nEinstein credited Mainstay Executive Director Matt Mielnick for drawing performers from all over the map to the establishment.\nEncouraged by these connections, over the summer, Einstein and a group of talented folks created a local singer/songwriters association, Delmarva Singer/Songwriter's Association (DSSA). They performed in monthly meetings, fostering their gifts and sharing ideas.\nSpringing out of that came an exciting notion — to do their part to help heal the world through music.\nDrawing from music videos like 1985's, \"We are the World,\" which attracted singing sensations like Diana Ross, Prince and Billy Joel, to raise money for famine relief in Africa, the Songwriter's Association decided to make a music video addressing world issues.\nWith The Mainstay closed during January, Einstein thought that might be the ideal time to work on a video project.\nEnthusiastic replies followed.\n\"We have a multitrack recording device, a PA system, and the ability to stream videos...so why not,\" he said.\n\"Songs of Hope 2024\" is a compilation of 12 artists performing original songs, each containing an inspiring message. A brief intro explains a little about the artist and his or her message.\nThe video shoot begins on Jan. 20. Upon completion, it will be available to stream.\nEinstein hopes the video inspires a \"world needing it.\" \"We're inundated with reasons to be sad,\" Einstein said. \"Wars, elections, and everything. We want to give people a reason to be happy.\"\nHe sees music as a great unifier, bringing people together, transcending politics, skin color or age.\nA good example of songs bringing people together through the decades are the Beatles oldest works like \"All You Need is Love,\" and \"I Want to Hold Your Hand.\"\nUniversally known, their music will be performed at The Mainstay on Feb. 7; a tribute to when they first appeared on the Ed Sullivan show Feb. 9, 1964. The project, \"Sing-A-Long Beatles USA,\" is a 60th anniversary tribute, where their famous tunes will be performed by The Mainstay players.\nEinstein recalls watching the program on prime time television with his parents. It left a powerful memory, and he was inspired to play the drums when watching Ringo playing left-handed on a right-handed kit.\nThe audience will hear songs from their first album, \"Meet the Beatles,\" to the more experimental and esoteric, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\"\nFor only $10 a ticket, people can sing their favorites while eating oysters, and bond through tunes.\n\"Everybody knows the melodies,\" Einstein said. \"It's noteworthy because this literally transformed the history of society and culture.\"\nHe said there are so many Beatles fans and also excellent musicians, so they put together an ensemble of Mainstay community players, consisting of Mielnick, Barbara Parker, president, and fellow board members.\nSponsors now include, Barts Records and The Listening Room, at 332 and 320 Cannon St. Chestertown. A surprise sponsor is Leland Castro, an impressionist painter from Hawaii. Castro's work can be seen in advertisements for the event and online at https://leland-castro.pixels.com/\nBecause the Beatles are so all-embracing, the decision to allow the audience to participate was a no-brainer.\n\"We figured we can't stop them from singing if we tried, so why bother,\" Einstein said with a chuckle.\nIn the wait time between Rock Hall's version of \"Beatlemania,\" you might find Einstein performing at Watermen's Crab House on Friday nights. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Specters sought at historic Kitty Knight House\n\n January 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 766\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n GALENA — On a blustery, wintry Friday night while some were eating salty treats watching football, guests showed up at the inn, ready to spend hours searching for paranormal clues. They dined, and, like a reality show, they got to know each other, sharing stories that drew them to this particular place at this particular time.Eighteen guests met with Tony Avallone, founder of the Mid-Atlantic Paranormal Project, (MAPP), and seven other members for an overnight investigation a the historic Kitty Knight Inn in Galena.\nTheir goal, to seek out supernatural activity using Avallone's ghost-tracking equipment.\nAnd for a longtime ghost hunter, Avallone, who's had his share of disconcerting experiences, he wants to bring a positive light, even some fun, to this activity. \"MAPP's here to help businesses and families understand the unexplained,\" he said.\nBefore embarking on their adventure, guests shared past stories, those having left a phantom handprint on their lives from an early age.\nSomebody mentioned their deceased grandfather had appeared to her and told him his feet were cold. Later, when she told her grandmother, she was informed he was buried without shoes on. Some had experienced voices and shadows flitting in and out. Some felt heavy oppression at abandoned penitentiaries where tormented spirits lurked.\nOthers had doors swing wide open without the wind's provocation, and the doorknob shake violently. One couple said they travel far and wide looking for places like this — open to all phenomenal experiences.\nLike any group of adventurers and believers, there was a skeptic among them as well. \"I'm just along for the ride,\" he said, arms folded. He was unsure what the night would bring.\nThe air crackled with positive excitement that only increased when Avallone introduced himself halfway into their meal. Avallone gave them a rundown on what would happen through the night.\nUsing electromagnetic frequency detectors to follow electromagnetic activity, audio recorders to track electronic voice phenomena and DVR cameras in every room — a total of 12 devices would run for eight hours, from 8 p.m. to 3 a.m., he explained, the time when it's said that supernatural activity peaks.\nThe house itself has a mysterious history.\nDirector of Marketing for the Jamestown Hospitality Group, which owns the property said in an interview with Chesapeake Bay Magazine, \"We definitely have chatter about the house being haunted. Guests say that doors will shut, or you'll hear voices when no one is there.\"\nAvallone attested that when previously staying in Knight's bedroom he awoke completely cold. Unexplainable because the thermostat wasn't touched when he watched the footage back.\nThe night started off slow with little responses in the tavern. Then they broke up in teams of three, rotating through the three main \"hots spots\" — Room 4, Kitty Knight's Room, where Avallone felt that intense cold years back, Room 8 where a spirit of a little boy they call \"Captain\" is alleged to resides, and the basement — where voices from the Civil War era and voices of children playing had been reported to be heard.\nAs the evening progressed, guests donned a blindfold and put on noise-canceling headphones. Known as the Estes method, they listened to what Avallone called, \"the spirit box,\" an AM/FM radio that speeds through the dials so fast no words get through.\nBut when they do, it is believed to be something speaking from beyond.\nIt was a big thrill for the guests.\nGuests on the other side of the room asked questions and if the guest with the headphones answered, that meant something supernatural was speaking to him or her.\nThe results were both fascinating and disturbing. \"Ninety-five percent of the questions were adequately aligned with the questions asked,\" Avallone remarked.\nIn the morning, Avallone met the guests at breakfast and answered their questions. It will take weeks for him to comb through the collected data, but he promised to share the results.\nIn the several years Avallone has been visiting the inn, he's discovered a whispery, hushed, \"Hi,\" and in the basement sounds of of children at play. He's heard footsteps when all was still and an entire conversation that could have revealed knowledge of an earlier time period.\nHe's also seen a glowing orb, which looked like a lot of insects in a group, yet not moving like bugs, but more like hovering.\nHe's seen shadows that looked human-like.\nBut he's never felt threatened by the Kitty Knight Inn experience.\n\"Whatever is there, enjoys having the company of the guests,\" he said.\nFor those intrigued on the next adventure, don't miss out, the Mid-Atlantic Paranormal Project will be having their last public investigation of the season at Kitty Knight Inn on Feb. 3.

Instruments styled after those of the '60s were used, and there was lively banter among the performers as well as with the audience.\nThe hairstyles were modeled after the Beatles' moptops, and after tunes such as \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"Can't Buy Me Love,\" the audience seemed to transfix on the stand-ins of John, Paul, George and Ringo.\n\"It's great to be back here in the colonies,\" joked John as he played the harmonica as accompaniment.\n\"We were very impressed with their body language and facial expressions, as well as their vocal impersonations. It felt like we were actually at a Beatles show,\" said Dr. Jean Carlson of Easton, who attended the show. She mentioned that she had seen the real Paul McCartney five times in the U.S.\nAs one hit after another rocked the Avalon, a feeling of reminiscence and delight poured over the packed house.\nInstead of the swoons of the '60s, there were smiles and deep satisfaction, singing along with the words so remembered as to be never forgotten and recalling thoughts of a simpler time.\nThe group performs 70 or so shows per year, but this year it has planned at least 80 shows due to an increased demand during the 60th anniversary of the Beatles coming to America.\nThe Avalon, located at 40 East Dover Street, is a historic theater located in downtown Easton, originally built as a cinema in 1921. The Avalon was billed as the \"showplace of the Eastern Shore.\" Today it serves as the prime venue of the Mid-Shore for the performing arts nationally and locally. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland author pens 'Betrayal on Beltane'\n\n January 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 933\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Maryland author Carol Amorosi recently self-published her novel \"Betrayal on Beltane.\"The book, which was released Feb. 1, is the inaugural novel in the Dun Cael Mysteries series.\nAmorosi, who is from Bryans Road, has also published a three–book series titled \"The McKay Mysteries.\"\nShe and her husband Dan, who recently moved to Bryans Road, has two cats and a Border Collie/Corgi mix Widgit, the History Hound, who Amorosi said \"joins us on our adventures.\"\nTo order the book, go to www.amazon.com/Betrayal-Beltane-Cael-Mysteries-Book-ebook/dp/B0CRF5FHD7 or go to https://carolamorosi.com/.\nHow long have you been writing, and how did you get started?\nWriting is something I always wanted to do someday. There just never seemed to be time. Then, in 2020, COVID hit, and the lockdowns where we lived in Germany were tight. When my son challenged me to join a writing course he was doing, I thought it would be a lark, something to fill the time. But I loved it, and I've never looked back.\nWhat inspires you to write?\nHistory. I've always had a fascination with history, especially the everyday lives of people. I want to share that passion with others. My books are written for entertainment but also to let people know that history can be fun.\nDo you consider writing to be a career?\nAs I start the new series, yes, I do. I currently have a three-book series based in Colonial America and have started a new one set in the time of the ancient Celts in Europe.\nWhat kind of writing process do you use?\nMost writers are somewhere along the scale between pantsers (who write by the seat of their pants) and plotters (who have every detail worked out before they start). I definitely fall closer to the pantser end of that scale. That is the main reason I write mysteries. There is an underlying story to be resolved, which prevents me from including every cool historical tidbit I learn and keeps me moving.\nWho are some of your favorite authors and why?\nI love the classic mystery authors such as Agatha Christie, P. D. James, Dorothy L. Sayers, and Ruth Rendell, to name a few. I enjoy their characters, and it's fun to solve the murder along with the protagonist. And I have to admit Ellis Peters' Cadfael series and M. C. Beaton's Hamish Macbeth, with their depictions of a community, heavily influenced my first series, \"The MacKay Mysteries.\"\nWhat are you working on now?\nMy current work-in-progress is a new series set in a time when ancient Celts dominated mainland Europe. Recent archaeological finds paint a different picture of these people than was previously known from the writings of the Romans and Greeks. While we lived in Bavaria (ancient Bohemia), I became fascinated by the art and culture of this early civilization.\nWhat do you want readers to know about you?\nI already mentioned I love history. My second passion is travel. I love to explore new places. Being married to a retired Naval aviator who still works for the Navy means we've moved a lot. And I've enjoyed every moment of it, especially the years we spent in Italy, Greece, and Germany. I have a daughter in North Carolina and a son in England, so I hope to continue traveling.\nPlease include a brief description of your book\nBorn into the warrior elite, Jannon showed great promise as a fighter. But that life was not for him. Despite his father's intentions, he fostered with the Master Bronzesmith to learn his trade.\nBut when a dead man is found in the smithy, his father demands he return home. In desperation, Jannon and his friend, Leuca, embark on a perilous journey to uncover the truth behind the stranger's death. Amidst a web of motives and treachery, they unearth a series of events leading to a shocking betrayal that threatens the very heart of their tribe.\nWill their quest for justice expose the culprit in time, or is the village's fate sealed?\nPlease include an excerpt from the book\nIn the early morning hours, Jannon returns to the smithy after a night at his family home.\nAs Jannon opened the door, he heard a rustle in the dim interior. Someone moved inside. He froze in the doorway. \"Who's there?\"\n\"It's me,\" Garos answered. Jannon could barely make out the figure of the young lad sitting on his sleeping bench. \"When did you get up?\"\n\"Get up? What do you mean?\" Jannon asked.\n\"From the workbench.\" Even in the dim light, Jannon saw Garos' eyes grow wide as he stared at the table.\nJannon's eyes followed the boy's gaze. The light was beginning to filter through the window cover, revealing a dark shape on the workbench. Someone was sleeping on the top. Chills ran down his spine. \"Who is that?\"\n\"I t-t-thought it was you.\" Garos stuttered, pulling the fur tighter around him.\nAs Jannon crossed the room, a beam of light broke through the mist and shone through a slit in the hide covering. Jannon stiffened momentarily, stopping in his tracks. Then he slowly approached the other side of the workbench, not quite believing what he saw.\n\"Light a torch,\" he told Garos.\nThe young lad's face was pale as he crawled from under the pelts. But he quickly rushed to the shelf to grab a pine stick coated in pitch. He plunged it into the banked embers of the hearth. Flickering light illuminated the space immediately surrounding him. When Garos joined Jannon on the other side of the table, he sharply sucked in a breath.\nIn the light, it was clear — a man sprawled face-down on Jannon's workbench. A dagger stuck out of his back. Once again, red blotches splattered across the surface — but this time, it was blood. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The exhibition will inspire visitors to take action to support orchid conservation and introduce young visitors to career opportunities in conservation.\n\"'The Future of Orchids' is a rare and spectacular opportunity to take a deep dive into the weird and wild world of orchids,\" said Joy Columbus, director of Smithsonian Gardens. \"The exhibit celebrates the diversity of orchids, which, with an estimated 30,000 species, is one of the largest and most diverse families in the plant kingdom. With this immersive exhibit, visitors can check out their bright colors, showy patterns and unexpected forms, and maybe catch a smell of their wildly varying aromas too.\"\nThe 2024 orchid exhibit will feature artworks by Howng, who is known for her large-scale paintings and immersive installations that explore the complex relationships between humans and nature.\nBaltimore-based Howng will present a series of newly commissioned paintings and sculptures, titled \"The Orchids' Fungi Garden Paradise,\" which includes her \"Mountains\" series. She drew inspiration for her work from Smithsonian Gardens' vibrant Orchid Collection. Howng adapted 3D scans of orchids created by the Smithsonian Digitization Program Office, which specializes in advanced 3D imaging of the Smithsonian's collections.\nSculptures inspired by these 3D digital renderings will be showcased alongside hundreds of colorful orchids from the Smithsonian and U.S. Botanic Garden's living collections.\n\"It is a joy to continue this collaboration to spotlight the beauty of orchids, the challenges they face and the opportunities we have to save them,\" said Susan Pell, executive director of the U.S. Botanic Garden. \"Both of our institutions help conserve rare and endangered orchids through our international collections stewardship and our collaboration on the North American Orchid Conservation Center.\"\nThis orchid exhibition is the 28th annual collaboration between Smithsonian Gardens and the U.S. Botanic Garden. The annual exhibition was established to provide the public with the opportunity to learn about both institutions' rich and biodiverse orchid collections.\nThe Smithsonian Gardens Orchid Collection, which was started in 1976, contains more than 5,000 species and hybrids.

    "content": "Chesapeake Music bringing Ensemble/132 to Ebenezer Theater\n\n February 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 324\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Chesapeake Music will present an exciting program for its Interlude concert on March 10 at 2:00 p.m. at Easton's Ebenezer Theater.\"A piano quintet of artists from ensemble/132 will delight the audience with a one-of-a-kind chamber music experience. The quintet includes pianist Sahun Sam Hong, violinists, Abi Fayette and Stephanie Zyzak, violist, Luther Warren, and cellist, Zachary Mowitz. Chesapeake Chamber Music patrons will remember Sahun Sam Hong and Zachary Mowitz as members of the Trio St. Bernard, the 2018 Lerman Gold Prize winner of the Chesapeake Chamber Music Competition\" the Easton-based music nonprofit said in a press release promoting the performance.\n\"I'm particularly excited for ensemble/132 to bring this delightfully eclectic program to Chesapeake Music. It shows so much of what chamber music can be. Every piece has something entirely unique to offer, whether it's Haydn's exquisitely and cleverly crafted trio, a dramatic cast of characters such as those in Schumann's Carnaval, Perkinson's thrilling blend of a jazz idiom with a classical approach to counterpoint and form, or Petrouchka with its timeless story, its folk dances, and its symphonic scope. It doesn't hurt that Sam's arrangements — Carnaval and Petrouchka — capture the essence of these wonderful pieces while bringing a new palette of colors that we all get to explore together,\" Cellist Zachary Mowitz said.\nEnsemble/132 is comprised of eleven chamber musicians. Marcy Rosen, Artistic Director of Chesapeake Music, is the artistic advisor to ensemble/132.\nFor more information and to purchase tickets, please visit the Chesapeake Music website at https://chesapeakemusic.org. There you will find information for upcoming events including the 11th International Chamber Music Competition on April 13, community concerts featuring Competition finalists on April 14, the Chesapeake Chamber Music Festival running June 7 through June 15, the Steven Philip Harvey Octet on July 20, and the Isidore String Quartet on October 5.\nBased in Easton, Maryland, Chesapeake Music is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to bring renowned jazz and classical musicians to the Eastern Shore. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They put out information about things like this every year. They told us it was one of the biggest ice cream promotions, so we joined in three years ago.\"\nNeboshynsky, who won a national award at the annual Ice Cream Convention in Las Vegas last year for her handmade natural fruit popsicles, is no stranger to being creative. And she's all about serving quality products.\nAll of the ice cream sold at the Tasty Toucan is 100%, \"cow to cone,\" made on the Eastern Shore.\nThe menu included a variety of breakfast-inspired treats, including a donut sundae, a hot cocoa float, a cinnamon-roll-inspired ice cream sandwich, a Pop-Tart milkshake and even a unique bacon sundae.\nNational Ice Cream for Breakfast Day was started by a mom of six living in Rochester, New York, during the mid-1960s. It was late January, and schools were closed due to a raging blizzard there. It was too cold to go outside, and the children were restless.\nThe mom, Florence Rappaort, is purported to have announced to her children, \"Okay, we're going to have ice cream for breakfast.\"\nThe family continued to enjoy the event once every winter. It became a family tradition. Over the years, the family served the ice cream, topping breakfast items such as pancakes, waffles and donuts.\nWhen the children went off to colleges, they shared their tradition with their college dorm colleagues. From there, it grew in popularity with students going home and sharing it with other family members. The tradition continued to spread.\nSomewhere in this creation, the first Saturday morning in February became the nationally recognized day of celebration. Neboshynsky notes one of their regular customers recalls her family partaking in the tradition when she was a child.\n\"We're going to continue to do this the first Saturday in February every year,\" said Neboshynsky. \"It's a lot of fun.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Included among the group named in honor of King's College in Cambridge, England, where the original group was formed are two baritones, two countertenors, one bass and one tenor.\n\"This is the group's first time in St. Mary's City in recent history,\" Johnathan Howard, who sings bass for the group, said. \"And I know that the group is very excited to perform here as the first stop on this month's tour of the United States of America. The group has an extraordinary history of performing in Maryland, and it always feels like a homecoming when we land in the state for the first time after an extended absence.\"\nHaving earned the reputation of having established the veritable gold standard among a cappella singing group's on the world's greatest stages for over 50 years, The King's Singers will only make a brief stop at the St. Mary's College of Maryland for one concert. Their travels resume almost immediately with concerts slated every two days through the remainder of the month before making the long trek for a performance in Nanjing, China on March 9.\n\"This concert is a deliberate mix of music from lots of favorite recent projects,\" Howard added. \"Including music from our 'Finding Harmony' album that celebrates songs from brought people together throughout history, our 'Tom & Will' album [which includes music by two of England's greatest renaissance composers] and 'When You Wish Upon a Star.' The concert is designed to feel quite a wild ride, and we're really excited to take the audience on the journey with us.\"\nRenowned largely for their unrivaled technique, musicianship and versatility, which stem from both the group's rich heritage and its drive to bring an extraordinary range of new and unique works, collaborations and recordings to life, The King's Singers extensive discography has led to numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, an Emmy Award and a place in \"Gramophone\" magazine's inaugural Hall of Fame. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "\"The subtle beauty of sitting still': Glen Phillips, Shawn Mullins at Rams Head on Stage\n\n February 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 489\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Glen Phillips — who was the lead singer and main songwriter for Toad the Wet Sprocket — and Shawn Mullins will perform at Rams Head on Stage on Thursday, Feb. 22.The show starts at 8 p.m with doors opening at 7 p.m.. Tickets are $39.50.\n\"During his years as lead singer and main songwriter of Toad the Wet Sprocket, Glen Phillips helped to create the band's elegant folk/pop sound with honest, introspective lyrics that forged a close bond with their fans. When Toad went on hiatus, he launched a solo career with Abulum, and stayed busy collaborating with other artists on various projects including Mutual Admiration Society, with members of Nickel Creek and Remote Tree Children, an experimental outing with John Morgan Askew,\" Rams Head said in a write up on the upcoming concert.\n\"Until recently, I've seldom allowed myself to stay in one place for very long,\" Phillips said in the Rams Head announcement, explaining the genesis of his new album, There is So Much Here. \"I was lucky during the COVID lockdown to move in with my girlfriend, now fiancée, and to stay home for the longest stretch I've had since the birth of my daughter, 20 years ago. I began noticing the little things. After a life of travel and seeking out peak experiences, I began to appreciate the subtle beauty of sitting still.\"\nPhillips continues:\n\"I've been playing a songwriting game with Texas folksinger Matt The Electrician, for about ten years. Every Friday, he sends out a title. We have a week to write a song that includes it. The process allows me to write songs I wouldn't write on my own. When my friend John [Morgan Askew] asked me to come up to his studio and make music, I said, 'Yes!' I collected a bunch of the new songs and headed up to Bocce Studios, in Vancouver, Washington. John invited drummer Ji Tanzer and bass player — / — multi-instrumentalist Dave Depper along. When we started playing, I wasn't sure we were making an album, but as the process unfolded, the songs began to make sense to me,\" he said, according to Rams Head.\n\"After a series of indie releases and growing buzz in the Atlanta music scene, Shaw Mullins' critical and commercial breakthrough came when 1998 Soul's Core shot him to fame on the strength of Grammy-nominated No. 1 hit, \"Lullaby\" followed by AAA/Americana No. 1 hit \"Beautiful Wreck\" from 2006's 9th Ward Pickin' Parlor,\" the concert announcement reads. \"Shawn revisited the music of Soul's Core by recording two new versions of the album. He calls this Soul's Core Revival. This is not a remix or a remaster of the original, but rather brand new recordings with new arrangements of the songs — one album is stripped down solo performances, some on guitar, some on piano and maybe one a cappella and the second is a new studio recording with his full band, Soul Carnival.\"\nFor more: https://www.ramsheadonstage.com/ \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Smithsonian presents Mother Tongue Film Festival, 'Finding Balance'\n\n February 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 756\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The annual Mother Tongue Film Festival will take place at the National Mall in Washington D.C., from Wednesday, Feb. 21, to Saturday, Feb. 24.Featuring 23 films in 27 languages from communities around the globe, the festival will explore the theme \"Finding Balance\" through personal journeys and will examine the path to building harmony within our world, societies, families and selves.\nThe ninth annual festival will open on the United Nations International Mother Language Day and take place in various locations in Washington, D.C. All screenings are free and open to the public.\n\"From children to adults, families to the individual, we are highlighting the unique journeys of people searching for enduring balance and harmony,\" said Joshua Bell, festival co-director and chair of anthropology at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. \"We could not be more excited to bring these beautiful and important films to viewers.\"\n\"Language is culture,\" said Amalia Córdova, festival co-director and supervisory museum curator of world cultures at the Smithsonian's Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage. \"In our efforts to strengthen cultural knowledge, it's crucial that people have access to diverse stories through the lens of language diversity. The festival will be another opportunity for filmmakers to connect audiences to these stories.\"\nThe Mother Tongue Film Festival is hosted by Recovering Voices, an initiative of the Smithsonian founded in response to the global crisis of cultural knowledge and language loss.\nViewers can visit the Mother Tongue Film Festival webpage at mothertongue.si.edu for the schedule and registration. All screenings and events are free.\nFestival highlights include:\nOpening ceremony and \"Frybread Face and Me\"\nWednesday, Feb. 21, 7 p.m. at Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian\nFollowing opening remarks from Smithsonian organizers, the festival presents \"Frybread Face and Me.\" The film features two adolescent Navajo cousins from different worlds who bond during a summer herding sheep on their grandmother's ranch in Arizona while learning more about their family's past and themselves. The screening will be followed by a Q&A with Charley Hogan, who plays one of the film's protagonists, Frybread Face.\nRegeneration\nThursday, Feb. 22, 7 p.m. at Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden\nStories of loss, revelation and recovery can lead people on the path to restoring a sense of wholeness. In this program, which features films \"Mother's Tongue\" and \"Mamá/Mom,\" youth confront generational trauma and seek to break through for a brighter future. Following the screening, the audience is invited to stay for a Q&A with \"Mamá/Mom\" director Xun Sero.\nBridging Worlds\nFriday, Feb. 23, 7 p.m. at Planet Word\nIn this program, two films intersect at the crossroads of love and resistance. \"Aikane\" and \"Y SŴN\" illustrate the spiritual connections that can be formed and the cultural ties that can be broken in the fight against political repression. Though artistically varied, both display the transformative power of commitment, be it to a person or a cause, iterating the fight for identity as a universal narrative. The screening will be followed by a Q&A with \"Y SŴN\" director Lee Haven Jones and Eoghan O'Regan, the deputy head of North America from the Welsh Government based in the British Embassy.\nHidden Letters\nSaturday, Feb. 24, 1 p.m. at Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art\nNüshu, a clandestine language created and used solely by Yao women in Hunan Province, offers a unique legacy that unites its practitioners. Delving into the lives of women in modern China bound by the once-secret script, \"Hidden Letters\" is a poignant exploration of female bonds and the generational echoes of gendered oppression in China. The documentary artfully portrays two women's journeys as they grapple with the complexities of independence and traditional expectations that both define and confine them. The screening will be followed by a virtual Q&A with one of the film's directors, Violet Du Feng, diving deeper into Nüshu's enduring legacy.\nAbout the festival and Recovering Voices\nAll films are fully open captioned or subtitled in English.

    "title": "The most American pop culture phenomenon of them all",

    "content": "The most American pop culture phenomenon of them all\n\n February 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Katherine Meizel The Conversation | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1152\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n \"American Idol\" was \"born\" exactly nine months after 9/11. The timing was significant, because since its premiere on June 11, 2002, the show has become an integral part of the country's coping strategy — a kind of guidebook for our difficult entry into the 21st century.By carefully curating a distinctly American mix tape of music, personal narratives and cultural doctrine, \"American Idol\" has painted a portrait of who we think we are, especially in the aftermath of tragedy, war and economic turmoil.\nAs the show concludes after 15 seasons, it's worth looking at how the past and present collided to create a cultural phenomenon — and how we're seeing shades of the show's influence in today's chaotic presidential race.\nAll our myths bundled into one\nThe premise of \"American Idol\" — the idea that an ordinary person might be recognized as extraordinary — is firmly rooted in a national myth of meritocracy.\nThis national narrative includes the dime-novel, rags-to-riches fairy tales of Horatio Alger, which were intended to uplift Americans struggling to get by after the Civil War. Then there was the American Dream catchphrase — first coined in 1931 by James Truslow Adams in his book \"The Epic of America\" — that promoted an ideal of economic mobility during the hopeless years of the Depression.\nIndeed, decades before host Ryan Seacrest handed out his first golden ticket to the first golden-throated farm girl waiting tables while waiting to be \"discovered,\" we'd been going to Hollywood in our dreams and on screen.\nThe show has shown us archetypes of immigrant narratives, like when Season Three contestant Leah Labelle spoke of her Bulgarian family's defection to North America during Communist rule. It has demonstrated how to rely on faith in the face of hardship, exemplified by Fantasia Barrino's victory song, \"I Believe,\" performed with a gospel choir. Meanwhile, it served as a stage for patriotic passion, broadcasting two performances of Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the U.S.A.\" when the United States entered Iraq in 2003. Meanwhile, the many \"Idol Gives Back\" specials remind us of American philanthropic values.\nThe show has celebrated failure as both a necessary stumbling block and a launchpad to fame. Many singers needed to audition year after year before they earned their chance to compete. For others, such as William Hung, their televised rejection brought fame and opportunity anyway.\n\"American Idol\" has also served as a course in American music history, featuring discrete genres like Southern soul and Southern rock, together with newer, blurrier categories like pop-country and pop-punk.\nMaking the old new again\nIn one sense, \"American Idol\"'s format was nothing new. In fact, British entertainment executives Simon Fuller and Simon Cowell — who shepherded in a 21st-century version of the \"British Invasion\" — fashioned their juggernaut show as a new take on old business models.\nThere is something distinctly American about contestants standing in a Ford-sponsored spotlight, judges sipping from Coca-Cola glasses, and viewers sitting in front of television screens texting their votes on AT&T phones. The show's conspicuous commercialization recalls the earliest days of television, when programs were owned and produced by advertisers. And \"Idol,\" like that early programming, was intended to be \"appointment television,\" bringing families together at the same time every week.\n\"Idol\"'s production model is also a throwback. It's structured like Berry Gordy's Motown — a one-stop fame factory that offers stars a package of coaching, polishing, a band, album production and promotion.\nThe format also draws from amateur regional and national radio competitions of the early 20th century. (Frank Sinatra got his start winning one on \"Major Bowe's Amateur Hour\" in 1935, with the Hoboken Four.) Another influence is the half-ridiculous and totally political \"Eurovision Song Contest,\" the hugely popular and mercilessly mocked annual televised event that pits nation against nation in (almost) friendly singing competition.\nA vote that counts?\n\"Eurovision,\" which originated in 1955 as a test of transnational network capabilities and postwar international relations, introduced telephone voting a few years before \"Idol\" premiered.\nAnd like Eurovision, the impact of \"American Idol\" extends far beyond our annual crowning of a new pop star. The show's rise has taken place at a time when the boundaries between entertainment, politics and business have become increasingly blurred.\nSeason after season, \"American Idol\" fans have placed votes for their favorite contestants — options which, somewhat like our presidential candidates, have been carefully cultivated by a panel of industry experts looking for a sure bet.\nThe initial success of \"Idol\" heralded not only an era of similar television programming, but also a new era in which we're given the opportunity to \"vote,\" whether it's for dum-dum pop flavors or the world's most influential people.\nConsidering these trends, it's not so farfetched to suggest that the wild popularity of shows like \"American Idol\" played some role in setting the blinding chrome stage and slightly \"pitchy\" tone for this year's election.\nIt isn't just that Donald Trump presided over \"The Apprentice,\" a reality competition that rode in on \"American Idol\"'s coattails.\nHis persona also seems to meet the same sadistic public need satisfied by original \"Idol\" judge Simon Cowell: the executive heir, the imperious arbiter of taste who owes his fortune at least as much to his superiority complex as to any financial acumen. At the same time, personas like Cowell and Trump deign to give an ordinary, hardworking American a chance.\nThat conceit, though, is mitigated cleverly by both moguls: they capitalize on what Cowell has identified as a universal desire to feel important.\nThe crux of their personal appeal is that they understand that everyone wants to matter, and we are willing — as TV viewers or as citizens — to risk an awful lot just to feel like we do. We each want to imagine our own sky-high potential, and laugh in relief when we see others who will never get off the ground. We want to be judge and jury, but also be judged and juried.\n\"Idol\" gives Americans permission to judge each other, to feel like our opinion makes a difference. Trump's unfiltered rhetoric has done something similar, giving his supporters implicit and sometimes explicit permission to mock, dismiss, exclude and even attack others based on racial and ethnic identity, religion or ability.\nAnd so now, as \"Idol\" makes its final journey from Studio 36 to the Dolby Theatre, we deliberate over whose victory will herald the last \"Seacrest — out.\"\nWhatever happens, and whichever way our presidential election goes, the U.S. is on the brink of something new, a major cultural shift. Wherever we're going, \"Idol\" has served its purpose, and we don't need it in the same desperate way anymore.\nI think, though, that we'll always be searching for the next big thing. And we'll always be glad we had a moment like this.\nKatherine Meizel is an associate professor of ethnomusicology at Bowling Green State University.\n(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Dozens of well carved ice sculptures decorated Easton's historic district.The event kicked off on Friday night with live music, fire demonstrations and beautifully lit ice sculptures ranging from pianos to ice chests with frozen treasure.\nOver the weekend, residents and tourists enjoyed outdoor ice skating, live music, a children's icehouse at the Talbot County Free Library, fire performances and restaurant specials.\nHoward Maxwell of Easton bundled up his granddaughter in a warm jacket and hat so she could enjoy the event.\n\"We brought my granddaughter, and she enjoyed seeing all the different sculptures, and she's having a really great time,\" Maxwell said.\nFeatured during the weekend were plenty of musical performances, including Saved by Zero performing during the festival's 80's Glow Party, Jimmy Maguire playing in the Fire Pavillion tent, and DJ Howard Barnett giving a music and light show on North Harrison Street.\nThree watermen were shucking oysters in the cold, as a line of people savored the oysters and thanked the watermen while donating money to the Talbot Watermen Association.\nAmid the cold, a man with flames covering the torso of his shirt stood in the center of a crowd, waving around long sticks with live flames at the end of it. Carlos Mir, known by his stage name \"Cascading Carlos,\" beamed joyfully as he asked volunteers to blow out the live flames.\nMir said he brings the fire to the Fire & Ice Festival. The Guinness World Recorder winner said Friday evening he was scheduled to perform throughout the festival and teach people how to juggle. He said the committee does a great job with putting together this event.\n\"They work so hard to make sure that this is so flawlessly perfect,\" Mir said.\nMajor sponsors of the festival include The Town of Easton, the Peoples Bank, Merry Maids, Soistman: Family Dentistry and Associates and the Talbot County Free Library. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Competitive eaters throw down at Cult Classic\n\n February 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ERIC SYLVIA Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 769\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE — \"There's not much else to do on a cold February Saturday — football's over, NASCAR hasn't started and March Madness is still a couple of weeks away,\" quipped Rohry Flood, owner of Cult Classic Brewing on Kent Island.\"That's why this event is a perfect way to spend the day,\" Keith Graffius, organizer of the 14th annual Crawfish Boil and Muskrat Leg Eating Contest held Feb. 17, said.\nGraffius has run the event since the beginning, and he says it has grown year over year to its current size. The 2024 event saw more than 1,000 spectators, all eager to witness the competition.\nThe eating contest didn't kick off until 5:30 p.m., but by noon the taproom floor was already crowded, karaoke was being sung in the listening room, local merchants were selling their wares at one end of the taproom and the food tent was pumping out crawfish and muskrat themed dishes.\nThe food was provided by Palm Beach Willies, a local favorite in Taylors Island. Willies chef John Butz and his team cranked out quesadillas, spring rolls, muskrat barbecue and steamed crawdads. The line for food was steady, with many of those in line looking to try the signature dish, muskrat, for the first time.\nGraffius explained, \"We started this event as an add on to the Dorchester County Outdoor Show, but over the years we have outgrown the various venues we've used for past events. Bringing this event to Cult Classic was a perfect way to continue the tradition and provide a premiere event.\"\nFlood added, \"Some of the proceeds will go to the Waterman's Association, while others will be used to support a new scholarship fund.\" The new scholarship fund was set up in the name of Ralph \"Peg Leg\" Bramble, a two time champion and hall-of-famer who was always a fixture at this event as well as the Outdoor Show. \"He did so much to keep these traditions alive — traditions that are at the heart and history of Dorchester County,\" Graffius said.\nBramble passed the baton and his crown to the 2023 and 2022 world champion, Daniel \"Chunky\" Hesson. Hesson, a 17-year-old Dorchester native, will be attending Salisbury State next fall.\nHe has been participating in the event since he was twelve and says Bramble was a mentor. Wearing a t-shirt with a picture of the two of them from a past competition on the front, Hesson said, \"Ralph always watched over me during these events, since I am usually one of the youngest competitors.\"\nWhen asked about the tie-in with crawdads, Graffius explained it is linked to Cameron Parrish, Louisiana that plays host to a similar annual event, the Louisiana Fur and Wildlife Festival. Guests from Cameron Parish made the trek to Dorchester County this weekend for the National Outdoor Show in Church Creek to help crown Miss Outdoors and observe the muskrat skinning semi-finals.\nThe afternoon saw a steady increase in spectators. The listening room of Cult Classic transitioned into the un-official Blues Emporium of Kent Island as DC Blues legend Jimmy Cole and his Delmarva All-stars took the stage.\nThe band features a who's-who of blues music, including Ron Holloway on tenor sax, Sam Paladino on the Hammond organ, George Sheppard on drums, Bryan Smith on bass and Jimmy Stepanson on lead guitar.\nBy 5 p.m. the room was filled to capacity, and the anticipation was palpable as the nine contestants took the stage, one by one. The contestants included Hesson, as well as past competitor Mike Detmer, also of Dorchester County, and several first timers, some of whom had never had muskrat before.\nDetmer is known from past contests as \"Dirty Legs\" Detmer, due to the amount of meat he has been known to leave on the bones during the contest.\nAs he took the stage for the finale, he stripped off his camo jacket to reveal a gold sequin shirt, which turned out to be somewhat prophetic, as Detmer would go on to win the event by a tenth of a pound over Hesson.\nDetmer paid tribute to his fellow competitors, \"The rest of the competition is great — they are truly champions and I am surprised I won,\" he said.\nAs the event concluded, Detmer accepted the trophy from Flood and Graffius, amid calls for a re-test from Hesson's supporters. First-time entrant Cody Fenzel from Millersville rounded out the top three.\nGraffius is hoping to bring the event back to Cult Classic for the 2025 edition. Flood said they were \"psyched\" to be hosting this year's event.\n\"It's a perfect partnership between the weird and wonderful things we love about where we live and the crazy creativity of our neighbors,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2024-03-01",

    "content": "Maryland's Munro Leaf was author of 'Ferdinand the Bull' and 'Wee Gillis'\n\n March 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1378\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Maryland Writers' Association created the Writers' Round Table Program to encourage writers, poets, playwrights and authors through monthly articles and activities.The Notable Maryland Author articles and associated Fun With Words writers' prompts are the centerpiece of the program. Each month, Southern Maryland Newspapers will feature a Maryland Writer's Association article about an author. Marylanders are encouraged to read the articles and try their hand at the writing prompts each month.\nAuthor: Munro Leaf\nGenre: Children's books, written especially for children, usually classified by genre or the intended age of the reader, and contain pictures or illustrations that compliment the story.\nSample reading list: \"How to Speak Politely and Why,\" \"The Story of Ferdinand,\" \"Wee Gillis,\" \"The Story of Simpson and Sampson,\" \"Four-And-Twenty Watchbirds\" and \"Sam and the Superdroop.\"\n\"Early on in my writing career I realized that if one found some truths worth telling they should be told to the young in terms that were understandable to them.\"\nMunro Leaf was born Dec. 4, 1905, in Hamilton, Md., but raised in Washington, D.C. He earned a bachelors of arts from the University of Maryland in 1927, taught English at Belmont Hill School in Boston a few years and earned a masters in English literature from Harvard University in 1931. He also worked for Frederick A. Stokes publishing company, which is where he developed an interest in writing and illustrating children's book. It was a career that would span 40 years.\nHis most famous work, \"The Story of Ferdinand,\" in 1936 he wrote in one sitting and tells the story of a large, gentle bull on a farm in Spain who is stung by a bee. His violent reaction to the sting impresses a man looking to aggressive bulls for bull fighting. He happily buys Ferdinand who is sent to the ring, but won't fight. He wants to smell flowers. The story ends with Ferdinand being taken back to his farm where he sits under a cork tree smelling flowers.\nThe book sold 14,000 copies in 1936, 68,000 in 1937, and in 1938 it sold 150,000 copies to beat \"Gone With the Wind\" as the top selling book in America. The book has never been out of print. In 1939, his book \"Wee Gillis\" tells of a boy living in Scotland halfway between his father's family in the Highlands and his mother's in the Lowlands was listed as a Caldecott Honor Book.\nThe release of \"Ferdinand\" overlapped the beginning of the Spanish Civil War and because it was about a peaceful bull in Spain it was viewed by supporters of Dictator Francisco Franco as a pacifist book and banned in Spain and elsewhere. Leaf said he wrote the story on a whim one afternoon in 1935 to give his friend and illustrator Robert Lawson a book to work on. The rest of the world loved \"Ferdinand\" and Disney won an Academy Award in 1938 for his animated version.\nLeaf put his talents to use for the federal government during WWII, when he and Ted Geisel — also known as Dr. Seuss — wrote \"This is Ann\", a pamphlet to prevent the spread of malaria.\nLeaf went on to write 25 books after his service in World War II and died in 1976 at the age of 71.\nFun With Words\nThe MWA invites writers to have fun writing a children's book like Munro Leaf. In 100 words, write the beginning of a whimsical children's story that identifies the main character and hints at the plot. In parenthesis add 10 additional words to describe the illustration that would go with the words you wrote. Title your work and send to https://marylandwriters.org/Notable_Maryland_Authors by the 22nd of the month to receive an MWA Fun With Words submission certificate. Selected responses will be published with next month's article and on the MWA Website.\nLast month writers were asked to be a women's fiction writer like Sophie Kerr and place a plucky heroine in a working environment confronted by gender or class issues.\nHere are some regional selections:\nTo Victoria Go the Spoils\nVictoria piloted her crab boat from Pasadena down the bay to Kent Island. When the early storm came up, she took shelter behind the island, secured her boat, and walked to the local marina. Three men at the bar scoffed at her and commented on how a woman shouldn't be crabbing in a storm. She ignored them and called a buyer. \"I got a bushel of males before the storm broke.\" She turned with the phone in her hand, \"You fellows want to sell your crabs? He'll take 'em all.\" The red-faced men shook their heads and mumbled, \"Didn't get any.\"\n- Cindy Herndon, Sunderland\nLileft\n\"And this the garden thou forsakest?\" spake Adam unto Lilit.\n\"Yes,\" said she, her mien exceedingly lofty, giving that single word all the potency of Language in a mere three letters.\n\"And what shalt thou hast elsewhere? — Fool that thou art! Why stayest not?\" Adam's tone was strained, hoarse with desperation.\n\"But what have I here?\" returned Lilit; held between her arms was already the Apple Tree's bough — wisdom with which she shall travel thence: the wisdom Adam ate of not.\n\"Thou knowest not what festereth there, in that blasted world beyond.\"\n\"Then I shall find out.\"\nAnd she left.\n- Eric Waldow, La Plata\nPumping Iron-y\nI don't need steroids, estrogen supplements, or any other booster. I've worked years, not just on my body but also on my style and technique. It hasn't been easy, but well worth the effort. I am amphibious, a creature comfortable on land and in the water.\nFrom my earliest days, I was taught that biology is a constant. Hanging out or all tucked in, we are what we are. But today the politicians chasing votes are wobbling. You can be whatever you choose to be.\nOK. Ed(wina) might out swim me today. But I'll kick his candy-ass tomorrow.\n- Leslie Dickey, Prince Frederick\nSilent Roars The Wounded Heart\nOne white-hot June morning, two days shy of year five turning wrenches at Road Worriers Automotive (\"Leave knocks and pings to us\"), Karleen Blokely heard boss \"Toothless\" Tom Sook say to her, \"K, I can't have you work here no more.\"\nShe knew why. From the shop's center bay all four reasons smirked. Male techs held you to a higher stand-ard. Accelerating past that standard proved a fireable offense.\n\"I'll send guys,\" she said, \"for my tool chests.\"\nTom's drinking buddies wanted salty waterworks. But she never much cried. A life of dignity in public meant keeping your tears private.\n- Lawrence McGuire, Waldorf\nHome on the Range\nHis head bloodied and right leg broken just above the ankle. The stampede had subsided. I raced to Buck's aid, though he was the one resistant to me driving herd.\nI threw him on his horse and found the doc in Cowpoke Crossing. Buck looked at me in a thankful, apologetic way. He knew I could punch out cows or cowboys. I could out-ride, out-rope, and out-shoot most drivers. Buck needed a hand and gave me a chance, sure I would quit.\nIt gets lonely out here, just me and my pride.\n- Gary Gunnelfsen, Chesapeake Beach\nFerry Princess\nMary Grace surveyed the river from the pilot house of the \" Traveler\", the boat used to traverse the river on a ferry boat route continuously run since colonial times with only male captains. She smiled when she reflected that for the first time the hand on the helm belonged to a body with a slip between the legs rather than a tiller. Now she studied the vehicles on deck. All the drivers were women. A workboat passed by slowly with a woman at the helm. It seemed today the river was ruled by sooks and hens.\n- Eleanor O'Mara, Oxford\nThe Paragraph About Nothing\nFrank C. and Cosmo K. (From Kramerica Industries of GEORGE-town) had developed a jiggle-reducing-frontal-torso support-device for men. Business was slow so they hired a well-endowed front-office gal to attract attention. Right off the bat Elaine B. had to endure the argument about what their JERRY-rigged contraption should be called \"The Mansiere\" or \"The Bro.\"\nElaine stuck out her chest by asking: \"Do you two boobs even know about cup size?\"\nFrank and Cosmo retorted in unison: \"What do you know about these things?!?...You're a girl!\"\nElaine replied: \"Look! I've been dealing with these things since before either of you had hair on yours! Now listen up before this business goes bust!\"\n- Steve Baker, Waldorf \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Celebrate National Oreo Cookie Day",

    "content": "Celebrate National Oreo Cookie Day\n\n March 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1100\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n National Oreo Cookie Day is today, March 6, and what a great cookie the Oreo is.In 1898, several baking companies merged to form the National Biscuit Company, also called Nabisco. This was the beginning of the corporation that would create the Oreo cookie.\nIn 1912, Nabisco had an idea for a new cookie, though it wasn't exactly its own — two chocolate disks with a creme filling in between had been done already by the Sunshine Biscuits company in 1908, which called the cookie Hydrox.\nSo how did we get to \"Oreo?\"\nSome speculate that the name is a combination of taking the \"re\" from \"cream\" and sandwiching it, just like the cookie, between the two o's in \"chocolate\" — making \"o-re-o.\" Though the true naming process may never be revealed, that has not affected Oreo sales.\nThe first Oreo appeared in a grocery store on March 6, 1912 in Hoboken, New Jersey. It was called an \"Oreo Biscuit.\"\nAs of 2023, it was estimated that 480 billion Oreo cookies have been sold since 1912.\nEverybody has their favorite brand of cookie, and my family has always loved Oreo anything. Eating at our favorite Italian restaurant in Ocean City recently, everyone asked \"are we going to Dumser's for a Oreo cookie milkshake?\" My son John, who is usually the chauffeur, replied \"Yes indeed.\"\nSitting there in West Ocean City took me back in time. Of course, this Dumser's location is way busier now than it was in 1964, but nevertheless, the Oreo cookie milkshakes were just as good as they were 60 years ago.\nSome changes to Oreo cookies in recent years that are very popular, especially during the various holidays, include different creams in the centers. Halloween features peanut butter; Christmas centers include mint and various other flavors.\nIn honor of National Oreo cookie day, let's explore this amazing cookie and all that can be created with it.\nOREO COOKIES AND CREAM COOKIES\n2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 tsps cornstarch,1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 4 ounces full-fat brick cream cheese (softened to room temperature), 3/4 cup unsalted butter (softened to room temperature), 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 cup packed light or dark brown sugar, 1 large egg at room temperature, 2 tsps pure vanilla extract, 1 cup white chocolate chips, 1 1/4 cups roughly chopped Oreos (10 whole Oreos).\nWhisk the flour, cornstarch, baking soda and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside. In a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium-high speed until completely smooth and creamy. Add the butter and beat until combined, scraping down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. Add granulated sugar and brown sugar and beat on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low speed until combined. With the mixer running on low speed, beat in the white chocolate chips. Add the Oreos and beat on low speed or gently fold in with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon (dough is heavy) until combined. Cover and chill the dough for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator (and up to 4 days). If chilling for longer than a few hours, allow to sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite hard.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside. Roll cookie dough, a heaping 1.5 tbsps of dough per cookie (I use a medium-size cookie scoop), and place 3 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 12–13 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The centers will look very soft. Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. While the cookies are still warm, I like to press a few more white chips or Oreo pieces into the tops — this is only for looks. Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.\nOREO BROWNIES\n2 cups sugar, 3/4 cup butter (melted), 1 package unsweetened baking chocolate (melted), 4 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 1/4 cups flour, 12 Oreo cookies (chopped, divided).\nHeat oven to 350 degrees. Spray 13x9-inch (33x23-cm) pan with cooking spray. Mix sugar, butter and melted chocolate in a large bowl until blended. Add eggs and vanilla; mix well. Stir in flour until blended. Stir in 1 cup chopped cookies; spread onto bottom of prepared pan. Sprinkle with remaining chopped cookies. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with fudgy crumbs. Do not overbake. Cool completely.\nOREO CHEESECAKE\n34 Oreo cookies (divided), 1/4 cup butter (melted), 3 packages. brick cream cheese (softened), 3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup sour cream, 1 tsp vanilla, 3 eggs, 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream (whipped).\nHeat oven to 325 degrees. Reserve 1 cookie for later use. Coarsely chop 9 of the remaining cookies; set aside. Crush remaining cookies into fine crumbs; mix with butter until blended. Press onto bottom and 1 1/2 inches upside of the 9-inch pan. Beat cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer until blended. Add sour cream and vanilla; mix well. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating on low speed after each just until blended. Stir in chopped cookies; pour over the crust. Bake 55 minutes to 1 hour 5 minutes, or until the center is still soft but almost set. Run the knife around the rim of the pan to loosen the cake; cool before removing the rim. Refrigerate cheesecake for 4 hours. Top with whipped cream and garnish with reserved cookie before serving.\nOREO COOKIE MILKSHAKES\n6 Oreo cookies, 1 tbsp chocolate syrup, 1 1/4 cups milk, 2 1/2 cups vanilla ice cream (softened), 1/4 cup whipped cream.\nCut 1 cookie into quarters: reserve for garnish. Chop 4 of the remaining cookies; set aside. Crush the remaining cookie into fine crumbs; pour into a shallow dish. Brush rims of 4 glasses lightly with chocolate syrup. Dip tops of glasses, one at a time, into cookie crumbs, turning to evenly coat each rim with crumbs.Blend milk and ice cream in a blender until smooth. Add chopped cookies, pulse just until blended. Pour into prepared glasses. Top with whipped cream and reserved quartered cookie pieces. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bridgerton Season 3: Teasers, Trailers, and the Tale So Far\n\n March 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Ananyaa Bhowmik Wealth of Geeks | Section: Entertainment \n \n 713\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Netflix has announced that season three of Bridgerton was coming. It also revealed a twist — the season will be a two-parter, unlike any of the ones before.The first episode of Bridgerton season three is all set to release this May, way sooner than its gentle fans could have hoped. Based on the Bridgerton books, the series has given us a fake dating arc and an enemies-to-lovers saga. Now, it seems it is the season of #Polin, i.e., Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton, as they go from friends to lovers, from bashful novices to experts in the game of love.\nWhat We Know So Far\nSince the announcement of the imminent arrival of season three of the Regency romance series, updates have been pouring in. In the announcement, Lady Whistledown revealed the most dramatic secret — the third season's release date. The first installment of new season drops on May 16. The first part will consist of episodes one to four, while episodes five to eight, arrives just one month later, on June 13.\nProduction of the new season began in the summer of 2022. The official Instagram account posted a reel of the cast all set and ready to step back into the Regency era. In the reel, Jonathan Bailey, who plays the rakish Anthony Bridgerton, makes a hand gesture that the other cast members soon copy. At the end of the reel, Nicola Coughlan and Luke Newton — who play Penelope Weatherington and Colin Bridgerton, respectively — jump onto a carriage together, foreshadowing the era of #Polin.\nBut that's not the only update. On Feb. 1, an official teaser offered a sneak peek into the lives of the characters, namely that of Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton. Together, they seem to be engaged in a sort of play-flirtation, with the lady revealing what she would say to woo him if he were a suitor. Another update soon followed, and on Feb. 14, the first official clip debuted, presumably of the first few minutes of the new season.\nIn it, Penelope confronts Colin when the latter says that he misses the former. She blames him for being cruel, claiming he would never consider courting her in front of the ton. As it dawns on Colin that she knows about him humiliating her, for whatever reason, Penelope walks resolutely away, apparently leaving all of it — including Colin — behind. But the story, gentle reader, may not be over just yet.\nA Season of #Polin and #Peloise\nIf the exclusive photos Netflix released are any indication, a roller-coaster ride awaits. Anthony Bridgerton and Kate Sharma — the star couple from last season — still seem very much in love. But the younger male Bridgerton seems to be struggling with his feelings.\nSo far, it seems, Penelope was just his sister's best friend and a close confidant who just happened to be female. But these dynamics are all set to change this season.\nEloise Bridgerton — now aware that Penelope Weathering is none other than Lady Whistledown herself — cannot forgive the latter for tainting her reputation and pretending to be her friend still. Conversely, Colin realizes Penelope is not just his sister's best friend but something else entirely. She is someone he holds dear, but whether those feelings are romantic is something he must understand before it's too late.\nChances are that Colin will learn Penelope's entire Lady Whistledown-sized secret soon. It would be interesting to see how this discovery affects their relationship, especially once he realizes she had a major role in Marina Thompson's downfall. This threw a wrench into Colin's plans of marrying her.\nOn the other hand, Penelope must realize that she has put Colin on a pedestal. She had always seen him as this perfect prince who could do no wrong. But his supposed cruelty at the party — when he disses Penelope in front of a gaggle of partygoers — shatters her illusion. It will be interesting to see where she goes from that point onward. For now, it seems what Penelope needs is not a handsome beau; Penelope must value herself and see beyond the opinions of the town and even those of the best friend she has been in love with since the start.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Onlookers will even have the chance to meet and get a selfie with Oscar the Osprey, enjoy live music and move through nature activity stations.\nAlthough the event will take place at Drum Point Park, there is limited parking in the neighborhood and those planning to attend should park at Patuxent High School in Lusby and take the courtesy shuttle to the park.\nAdmission is $10 per single individual attendees or $20 for an entire family. Also, guests should keep in mind that there are absolutely no pets allowed on site, with the exception being for service animals.\n\"One thing that people should realize is that the osprey is not only an amazing bird, but also vital to the Chesapeake Bay and surrounding ecological system,\" said Sal Icaza, the driving force behind the outset of the Maryland Osprey Nature Festival in 2022. \"Each winter they basically migrate to South America, but they always return right around St. Patrick's Day and they are truly amazing to watch any time of day.\"\nIcaza noted that ospreys derive \"99%\" of their diet from fish and they can be seen diving toward the surface of the water for a catch from morning to sunset.\nFellow organizer Rick Smith commended Icaza for his work organizing the annual event and admitted that he also has a genuine bird's eye view of the ospreys from his home. He said the birds never cease to amaze him.\n\"Each year once the ospreys return from their migration south to the Chesapeake Bay they truly are exceptional birds to behold,\" said Smith, who noted the ospreys have rebounded from declining numbers in the 1970s after pesticides were reduced.\n\"They are able to dive into the water at perhaps 40 miles per hour and dive well below the surface to catch fish,\" he said. \"They rarely come up without something in their talons. Whereas bald eagles dive down and basically skim the surface of the top of the water for their catch, ospreys can dive well below the surface and come away with a fish.\"\nIf you go\nThe third annual Maryland Osprey Nature Festival will be held at Drum Point Park on Saturday, April 6, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Parking for the event is scheduled for Patuxent High School, located at 12485 Southern Connector Boulevard in Lusby, with a courtesy shuttle provided. Entry fee for the event is $10 per person or $20 per family.\nIf you love birds, wildlife and nature, or just want to learn more, come out and be part of this festival for a great cause.\nFor more information about the festival, visit https://marylandospreyfestival.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Recorded live at the museum, the videos feature the artists who make the music and provide insight into American musical history, including Taj Mahal, Allison Russell, Flaco Jiménez, Max Baca, Rhiannon Giddens, The Blind Boys of Alabama with Ruthie Foster.\nThe series explores the American musical past and how it might affect present-day American music. In a conversation format punctuated by live music, Krystal Klingenberg, musicologist, curator and host of the museum's \"Collected\" podcast, explores important genres of American music with these artists, discussing their work, influences and legacy. Recordings of the four-installment \"Roots to Pop\" series are available online at https://americanhistory.si.edu/explore/exhibitions/entertainment-nation/roots-to-pop.\nThe four programs took place in the museum's Taubman Hall of Music, an intimate space that provides excellent acoustics. Klingenberg guides the conversation around themes that resonate with the histories of Americana music and the larger history of the United States, and where appropriate, places objects from the collection in dialogue with the artists.\n\"Music offers us all a portal into understanding history,\" Klingenberg said. \"Through these videos, the public can understand the various genres under the umbrella of Americana and how those roots dynamically contribute to the sound of today.

    "content": "Did you fall for these well-known April Fools' Day jokes?\n\n March 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dan Morris Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1139\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n April Fools' Day has become a global playground for brands and media alike. Each year brings a new batch of ingenious hoaxes that catch the unwary off guard and offer a moment of levity in our sometimes all-too-serious world.It's a day where the rulebook is thrown out the window, and the absurd becomes momentarily plausible, inviting everyone to share a laugh at marvelously executed jokes. This tradition of trickery has given rise to some of the most memorable pranks, from fake announcements that baffled the masses to products so bizarre they could only be a joke.\nThe following tales of tomfoolery not only highlight the fun that can be had but also illustrate the sheer creativity that April Fools' Day can inspire. Did they fool you?\nBBC's spaghetti trees\nThe BBC's Spaghetti Tree hoax is a timeless April Fools' Day prank that tricked a nation. It aired on April 1, 1957, on the BBC's \"Panorama\" program.\nNarrated by the respected Richard Dimbleby, the segment showed a Swiss family harvesting spaghetti from trees, credibly explaining that a mild winter and the eradication of the spaghetti weevil had led to an exceptional spaghetti crop. The footage of women delicately plucking strands of spaghetti from branches and then laying them out to dry captivated viewers, many of whom were unfamiliar with how spaghetti was made or where it came from, given its rarity in the UK's diet at the time.\nThe prank's success was monumental, prompting hundreds of viewers to inquire about growing their own spaghetti trees. The BBC's reputation for serious journalism lent the story an air of credibility, making the reveal that it was a hoax all the more delightful and embarrassing for those duped.\nTaco Liberty Bell\nThe Taco Liberty Bell prank is one of the most memorable April Fools' Day jokes in American history, carried out by Taco Bell on April 1, 1996.\nIn a bold move, the fast-food chain announced in major newspapers across the country that it had purchased the Liberty Bell, a cherished symbol of American independence located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The company claimed it was renaming the historic icon the \"Taco Liberty Bell\" as part of a strategy to help the national debt. This audacious announcement stirred a mix of disbelief, outrage and confusion among the public, many of whom failed to recognize the date and took the news at face value.\nThe prank quickly became a national sensation, leading to scores of calls to Taco Bell and the National Park Service from concerned citizens and history buffs alike. The uproar lasted until Taco Bell disclosed later that day that it was just an April Fools' prank, reassuring the public that the Liberty Bell had not been sold and remained in its rightful place.\nSTIHL Bonsai Chainsaw\nStihl's Bonsai Pruning Chainsaw prank is another clever entry in the annals of April Fools' Day lore. On April 1, 2017, the chainsaw manufacturer announced the launch of a revolutionary new product: a tiny chainsaw designed specifically for the intricate task of bonsai tree pruning.\nThis so-called bonsai chainsaw was said to combine Stihl's cutting-edge technology with the delicate art of bonsai maintenance, supposedly offering precision cutting capabilities that could navigate the nuanced curves and tight spaces of miniature trees with ease.\nThe announcement was accompanied by convincing product specifications and promotional materials, showing an arborist in full protective equipment using a ridiculously small chainsaw to prune a bonsai tree.\nDuolingo's emoji course\nDuolingo's emoji course prank, launched on April 1, 2017, successfully tapped into the digital zeitgeist, fooling users and emoji enthusiasts with the promise of mastering the \"language\" of emojis.\nThe language-learning platform announced it was introducing a comprehensive course designed to help users become fluent in emoji, presenting it as the newest and most contemporary language offering. The announcement was detailed with course outlines, lesson plans and testimonials from supposed beta testers who praised the course's effectiveness in helping them communicate solely through emojis.\nThe prank's believability was bolstered by Duolingo's reputation for offering courses in a wide variety of languages, some of which are endangered or constructed, adding a layer of credibility to the announcement. Many users and tech enthusiasts were momentarily tricked into believing they could actually enroll in a course to achieve proficiency in emojis.\nIKEA's highchair for dogs\nOn April Fools' Day 2011, IKEA announced the HUNDSTOL Highchair for dogs, an easy-to-believe prank that captured the imagination of pet owners worldwide.\nThe fictional highchair was made to integrate dogs into the family dining experience, featuring a unique design tailored to canine needs. It boasted custom features such as holes for the dog's tail to ensure a comfortable seating position, an integrated bowl for food or water at the table level, and a stylish aesthetic consistent with IKEA's minimalist design philosophy. The prank was detailed with mock-up images and specifications that lent it a veneer of authenticity, suggesting that IKEA had genuinely considered the dining needs of pet family members.\nThe public's response to the HUNDSTOL Highchair prank was a mix of amusement and disappointment, as many people were initially fooled into believing the product was real due to the convincing presentation and IKEA's reputation for innovative product design. Social media platforms buzzed with excitement from dog owners who expressed eagerness to purchase the highchair, sharing the announcement and tagging friends.\nUpon realizing it was a prank, reactions ranged from laughter and admiration for IKEA's creativity to expressions of genuine disappointment from those who had hoped to integrate their pets more fully into family meal times.\nApril Fools' Day pranks\nApril Fools' Day serves as a yearly reminder not to take everything at face value, inviting people from all walks of life to partake in a global tradition of laughter and light-hearted deception.\nGabriela Covay, Founder and Managing Director at Bright Valley Marketing shared, \"These April Fools' pranks really show us the magic of PR campaigns that grab your attention and don't let go. Many of these pranks were so surprising, so out-there, that you just had to share them with someone else. It's a smart move for brands to jump on days like April Fools' to get their name out there.\"\nThese examples not only showcase the boundless creativity and sense of humor of brands and organizations but also highlight the public's willingness to believe the unbelievable, if only for a moment.\nThese pranks, ranging from the blatantly absurd to the cleverly convincing, underscore the day's spirit: A pause in the everyday where the fantastic becomes momentarily feasible, and the world unites in the universal language of laughter. As we reflect on these tales of tomfoolery, we're reminded of the importance of humor in creating shared moments of joy and the enduring charm of a well-crafted April Fools' joke.\nDaniel Morris is the founder ofFire and Saw, a blog that focuses on chainsaws, wood stoves, fireplaces, axes and related topics.

    "content": "Pack a basket of flavor for National Picnic Day\n\n March 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Cindy Rainey Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1113\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n With the winter quickly passing by and springtime approaching, there's no better way to welcome the season than with National Picnic Day on April 23. This cherished tradition invites you to savor the warmer weather by breathing in the fresh air and enjoying a delicious meal in nature.Whether lounging at a local park, basking on a sandy beach or reveling in the peace of your own backyard, a picnic is the perfect way to enjoy alfresco dining. Read on to find out how you can make this your best picnic yet.\nThe allure of al fresco dining\nPicnics are a break from the hustle of your everyday, offering a moment to relax and connect with the natural world. Their informality and simplicity make them accessible to everyone regardless of age or background. Moreover, the benefits of dining outdoors are numerous and enriching.\nSpeaking to the history of picnics, this is a tradition woven through times and cultures. Since the medieval hunting feast, picnics have been a canvas for social expression, adapting to the changing tides of culture. As explained by Saltwater Picnic Co, it was in the 19th century that picnics became a symbol of communal unity as people began gathering in public parks to share meals. This egalitarian spirit continues to inspire the cherished gatherings we still relish.\nAlong with their social benefit, the act of dining outdoors is a holistic experience that nourishes the body, mind and soul. According to the Smithsonian Magazine, proximity to nature and exposure to sunlight has been shown to elevate moods and reduce stress. The open air also encourages physical activity, turning a meal into an opportunity for bonding and rejuvenation.\nPicnic preparation\nPacking for the perfect picnic is both an art and a science. Consider carefully the unique demands of outdoor eating and the practicality of food transport.\nWhen choosing your menu, aim for dishes that hold well in containers without spillage and don't get soggy. Sturdy veggie and grain salads, wraps and pastries are excellent choices as they maintain their texture and flavor on the go. Items that can be served comfortably at any temperature, like pasta salads, cold cuts and cheese platters are a great option for excellent taste without the need for reheating.\nAs well, keep in mind the logistics of outdoor eating and select foods that aren't messy or don't require too much hardware to eat. Finger foods like sandwiches, skewers and hand pies are perfect for a utensil-free picnic experience. Likely, this food will also be out of refrigeration for a while, so choose safe dishes, avoiding things like mayonnaise and raw fish. Instead, choose vinegar-based dressings and vegetarian options to ensure food safety.\nMost importantly, make sure to include a variety of sweet and savory crowd pleasers to be enjoyed by a variety of tastes and dietary preferences. Gluten-free or vegan dessert options can be a great way to cater to all your guests needs.\nFood safety during outdoor eating\nFood safety is paramount when dining outdoors to ensure that this experience is enjoyable and safe. The challenges of maintaining food at safe temperatures and preventing contamination can be managed with careful planning and the right tools.\nKeep food chilled\nInvesting in a high-quality, insulated cooler to keep perishable items like meats and dairy chilled can safely increase the variety of your picnic grub. Using frozen water bottles as ice packs in your cooler has the dual purpose of keeping your food cold and providing a refreshing drink as they thaw.\nPrevent contamination\nSegregating cooked and raw foods using individual containers prevents cross-contamination. In particular, using airtight containers ensures that your food is safe from outside contamination and also avoids spills and leaks. Most importantly, using sanitizers to keep your hands and surfaces clean helps to reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses.\nPacking and serving smart\nWhen using a cooler, place items you will eat last at the bottom of the cooler to minimize the time they are exposed to warm temperatures. Similarly, use insulated thermos for hot foods and promptly dispose of dishes that have been left out for more than a couple hours.\nMaking the most of National Picnic Day\nTo make the most of this day is more than just enjoying delicious food; it's about creating an experience that will be remembered fondly. Selecting the perfect location and adding an element of fun is key to creating long-lasting memories and starting traditions with your family.\nChoosing the perfect location\nThe ideal picnic spot is one that seamlessly blends natural beauty with convenience. The obvious and popular choice is local parks, which often offer amenities like tables and restrooms with picnicking in mind. As well, the open green spaces and equal access to shade offer a safe way to enjoy the outdoors.\nOutside of public parks, beaches provide a scenic backdrop with the additional benefit of a refreshing swim. Community gardens can offer a unique, serene and lesser-used setting for picnics surrounded by lush plant life. Least considered, but arguably the most convenient, is your own backyard which can easily and harmoniously be transformed into a personal and welcoming picnic haven.\nIncorporating fun and games\nAdding games to your picnic can help to turn a simple meal into an engaging and memorable outdoor event. Classic outdoor games like Frisbee or disc golf require minimal equipment and can be enjoyed by all ages. Similarly, sack races and tug-of-war can be played with household items and foster team spirit.\nInteractive games like picnic blanket bingo, where guests mark off items they see around them, or a scavenger hunt that encourages exploration of the area, add an element of adventure. For those who prefer seated activities, bringing along a deck of cards or portable board games can provide entertainment without the need for physical exertion.\nEnjoying the springtime\nNational Picnic Day is more than just an excuse to enjoy a meal outdoors; it's a celebration of the simple pleasures in life. As the spring sun beckons, pack your basket with a feast of flavors, find your perfect spot and create lasting memories on this delightful day.\nTake advantage of the spring weather with a picnic, where the joys of combining good food, good company and the beauty of nature come together. Whether it's on April 23 or any other splendid spring day, let the spirit of National Picnic Day inspire you to savor the great outdoors in the most delicious way possible.\nCindy Rainey, an expert home cook with more than 40 years of general cooking experience and 10 years as a plant-based eater, is the creative force behindVeggie Fun Kitchen, a vegan recipe blog.

    "content": "Sabedra pens song for childhood friend who died in fire\n\n April 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Reid mreid@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 686\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For 39 years Derek Sabedra had only memories of a beloved classmate who died tragically, but now the former Southern Maryland resident has something tangible after a song he wrote about her was recently recorded.Denise Evans was 16 years old when she died in a house fire, along with her 14-year-old brother Shawn, in Prince Frederick on Dec. 22, 1985. Luke Doran, 19, also perished in the accident, which started when a discarded cigarette was placed in a paper trash container.\n\"She was very sweet, caring, and I never saw her angry,\" Sabedra, who now lives on the Eastern Shore in Vienna, said. \"She was just a sweetheart everybody talked to. She was friends with everybody.\"\nSabedra penned \"Denise, Denise (My Brightest Angel)\" in about 15 minutes after awakening from a dream in 1992 and the song was arranged by Calvert County native Joe Barrick in July 2023. Sabedra imagined it as sounding something along the lines of Elton John's \"Your Song\" with some Gordon Lightfoot vocals in the background.\n\"I could tell this was a person that meant a lot to him,\" said Barrick, who now lives in Nashville and runs Arcade Management, which manages musical artists. \"The whole chorus ... is the highest respect he can pay this person because she's in heaven and he's singing to her. It was very emotional and passionate.\"\nBarrick, who grew up in Lusby and graduated from Patuxent High School, said he reached out to some colleagues to help him.\n\"We listened to it and we said, 'Let's find a guitar pattern that will work, and then let's throw some bass and piano and drums behind it, and then we started building the song that way,'\" Barrick said. \"And then everything just came together to create the song. I remember sending it to Derek and he said, 'Yeah, I love it. I can't believe the song is finished. It finally came to life.' He was all fired up.\"\nBy last December the song, which turned into a country tune from a pop ballad, had been streamed 60,000 times.\nSabedra, Denise Evans, Karen Fletcher, Linda Call, Christine Ridgeway, Adam Dudley, Ben Tilley were part of a close gang in middle school, then at Calvert High School.\nSabedra said he and Evans never dated and that \"she was like a younger sister and it always stayed like that.\"\nThe six classmates — Sabedra called them the \"Smarties\" — would regularly attend school football games, the local drive-in theater and go to parties together.\n\"School dances were the bomb,\" Sabedra said of both middle and high school get-togethers. \"We were the dancing group because we didn't care.\"\n\"The favorite was lunch time because that's when everybody would talk about what they were going to do and how they would spend their weekend,\" Sabedra said.\nOn that fateful night four decades ago, Sabedra was invited to the get-together by Chris McWilliams, but turned it down. McWilliams managed to escape the blaze and Sabedra now sees him regularly at tennis events.\n\"I've thought about what would have happened if I was there, but it was just timing or just ... weird,\" Sabedra said.\nHe learned of the fire the next morning, and said he was \"just stunned. I didn't know how to react. I just couldn't talk for about a day.\"\nHe said it took him 30 minutes of composing himself in a church parking lot before he had the courage to walk inside. The tragedy capped off a brutal three-month period for Sabedra, whose father died in October of that year while his grandmother passed in November.\nSabedra graduated from Calvert High School and earned his bachelor's degree in criminology from the University of Maryland College Park. He also worked from 2000 to 2019 as a teacher, counselor and tennis coach for St. Mary's County Public Schools.\nSabedra is trying to get a local radio station to play the song, which would mean he \"could die happy,\" but so far has struck out, he said.\nHe added that he expected Denise to accomplish big things.\n\"I think she would be a lawyer, doctor or therapist now because of how she was with people,\" Sabedra said. \"I think about her often.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Chesapeake Bay log canoes are elegant, fast, and–at times–perilous. Maryland Public Television is excited to introduce viewers to this historic fleet of racing sailboats and the people keeping the heritage alive through weekend regattas.\"\nFirst broadcast last spring during Chesapeake Bay Week, \"Water's Edge: Black Watermen of the Chesapeake\" explores previously untold tales of industry trailblazers, including an ambitious steamboat captain who revolutionized recreation for Black Marylanders in the early 20th century, a pair of renowned sailmakers from Chestertown, and innovative present-day captains who are surviving by shifting their businesses to meet a changing market. This year, the film will air on MPT on Monday, April 22 at 8:30 p.m. and Saturday, April 27 at 10 p.m.\nIn total, the Chesapeake Bay Week lineup features eight new programs, including \"A Passion for Oysters,\" which screened at CBMM, along with a discussion with the filmmakers, in January.\nFor more: cbmm.org/events. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I always wanted to write a children's book on the life of a waterman mainly because I never saw one and having worked in the school system for over 30 years in the Bay area, I truly believed it was important to let the younger generation know about this occupation.

    "content": "Fair Hill family and its 'star' pet dog featured on television show\n\n April 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1116\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n All five members of the Sottnick family in Fair Hill, Maryland made their television debut this week. But the star of the show was the family's beloved pet Corgi — Ollie.Wizard of Paws, an animal-niche program that airs on BYUtv, Hulu and Disney+, featured the Sottnicks and 3-year-old Ollie on a 27-minute Season 6 segment that premiered on Sunday (April 14).\nDerrick Campana, who owns and operates Bionic Pets in Sterling, Virginia., is the Wizard of Paws host. Campana specializes in crafting custom-made prosthetics for animals with missing limbs.\nCampana has successfully created prosthetic limbs for an array of deformed animals, including foxes, goats, rabbits, ducks and all sorts of other birds and even an elephant in Thailand.\nThe gist of Wizard of Paws: On each episode, Campana and his film crew travel to the home of a selected family that owns a pet with a missing or deformed limb and then he builds a prosthetic designed exclusively for that animal.\nThrough on-camera interviews, owners of the handicapped pets tell their stories. The show's nail-biting climax always hinges on this: Will the pet accept or reject its new prosthetic and will it help the animal walk and run better?\nThe Sottnicks were selected for the show because Ollie was born with a deformed front limb because of condition known as ectrodactyly, a term used mostly by veterinarians. Laypeople commonly refer to it as \"split-foot\" or \"lobster claw.\"\n\"Ollie is basically a tripod,\" Kara Sottnick said, explaining that standing and walking was difficult for Ollie because both rely heavily on balance. \"He could actually run better than he could walk.\"\nThe Sottnicks also were picked because of the upbeat vibe that the family projected during a couple of Zoom interviews with Wizard of Paws producers, after Kara had emailed information about her family and Ollie as the first step in the process for show consideration.\n\"They are just as interested in the family's story as they are their pet's story,\" Kara said.\nIn addition to Kara, the Sottnick family includes her husband, Kris, who is an aviation inspector, and their three children — Gavin, 21, who works at Williams Chevrolet in Elkton; Abrey, 20, who works at Elkton-based Terumo Cardiovascular; and Kody, 17, who is a junior at Tri-State Christian Academy, also in Elkton.\n(In addition to Ollie, the non-human side of the Sottnick family includes two other pet dogs — 7-year-old Toby and 3-year-old Huxley, both of which are Cavalier King Charles Spaniels; and an outdoor cat named Little Pea.)\nBEHIND THE SCENES\nSo Campana and a seven-person film crew came to Fair Hill in October and spent five days at the Sottnick's home. Campana brought his mobile lab, so he could create the special prosthetic limb for Ollie on location while filming the Wizard of Paws segment that is cleverly and appropriately titled, \"Ollie, Ollie, Running Free.\"\nThe crew members filmed for four days, between eight to 10 hours each day before heading back to their hotel after every session. Filming also involved cameramen getting B-Roll away from the Sottnicks' property. The crew, for example, went to a historically-significant spot known as The Beehive on Telegraph Road (Route 273) in Fair Hill and filmed the annual Apple Butter Festival held by the Elk Creek Land Preservation Society.\n\"We absolutely fell in love with the film crew and Derrick (Campana). We became friends with them,\" Kara said. \"The sound guy is in a band out in L.A. On breaks, he and Gavin would go into our basement and jam together on the guitars and drums.\"\nKara made friends with the producer who hails from Australia and they still keep in touch through email and social media. Abrey and a personal assistant on the crew also hit it off, piquing her interest in that profession.\nThe crew brought breakfast for the Sottnicks every morning when they arrived and also treated them to lunch, with all that food coming from Cecil County restaurants. Crew members also provided cupcakes and sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Gavin when he turned 17 during the filming week.\nAfter the last day of filming, the Sottnicks, in turn, treated the crew to dinner at Schaefer's Canal House in Chesapeake City to show their appreciation. Earlier in that week, the Sottnicks also treated the crew members to cider doughnuts from Milburn Orchards near Elkton, providing another opportunity for them to sample local food favorites. \"They loved the cider doughnuts,\" Kara said.\nCampana was affable and accommodating, too. \"He cared for us and for Ollie's needs above the filming. He made sure there were plenty of breaks,\" Kara summarized.\nAs for the \"Ollie, Ollie Running Free\" segment's moment-of-truth ending (SPOILER ALERT, if the title didn't already give it away), Kara commented, \"He loved it, and took to it right away. There was a 50/50 chance that the prosthetic would work.\"\nIn addition to the free prosthetic limb for Ollie, the Wizard of Paws representatives gifted the Sottnicks with six free hydrotherapy sessions for Ollie at BluePearl Pet Hospital's rehabilitation center in Newark, Delaware.\nPATH TO 'PAWS'\nInterestingly enough, Kara's goal wasn't for her family and Ollie to be featured on Wizard of Paws. In fact, she didn't know that the TV show even existed when she embarked on her original quest — getting a prosthetic limb for Ollie.\nThe Sottnicks are dog lovers. They strive to always have two dogs in their home for the sake of pet companionship. After Rigley died from cancer in 2020, the remaining pet dog, Toby, was alone. So the family started searching for another pet dog — specifically a Corgi.\nIn a way, the Sottnicks picked the runt of the litter after meeting with the breeders, who, as it turns out, did not even advertise Ollie, most likely because of his deformed front limb.\n\"I think they saw him as problematic. It was almost like they discarded him,\" Kara said, before remarking, \"But we thought he was absolutely adorable. He was so cute and we were up for taking on the challenge. We sort of rescued him.\"\nAfter consulting with the veterinarian, Kara started exploring the possibility of getting a prosthetic limb for Ollie and, during her research, she learned about Campana's business, Bionic Pets. When she visited its website, Kara learned that Campana was a TV star.\n\"That's when I learned about the show,\" Kara explained.\nHaving worked as a hairdresser until 2020, Kara now devotes her time to \"building Ollie's social media account.\" OllieTheTripodCorgi can be found on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, she noted.\nReflecting on the week-long Wizard of Paws filming in October and this week's premiere of the segment featuring her family, Kara marveled, \"I would have never guessed in a million years that they'd pick us to be on the show. The filming of it was the highlight of 2023 for us.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The podcast is compiled by Managing Editor Wendy Weitzel.\nFor those who have not listened to a podcast before, it is just an audio version of a story, similar to a radio broadcast.\nTo create the podcast, we are using software called Speechify Studio, which generates voices to \"read\" the stories. The podcast is about 5 minutes long. Each is designed so you can listen to them in your car on your way to work or school or while you are doing a workout or taking a morning walk.\nWhile we are starting out producing these podcasts once per week, we may do them more frequently in the future.\nI'd love to hear what you think about the podcasts. Do we feature the right stories in them? Are they too long or too short? Will you listen to them regularly? Send me a note at jjohnson@chespub.com.\nThe podcasts were a suggestion from the Star Democrat Reader Advisory Board, a group of readers who meet with the newspaper's top managers and offer suggestions on ways the newspaper can improve.

    "content": "Unlock the secret to a perfect, stress-free Mother's Day\n\n April 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Samantha Erb Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 951\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Samantha ErbFood Drink Life\nDon't spend Mother's Day faking a smile. From self-care rituals to low-stress family activities, here's how to actually enjoy your day.\nThis Mother's Day, you can have everything you want and need to make your day special. You just have to ask for it.\nIf you're a mom, you've probably experienced the unpleasant feeling of Mother's Day plans gone wrong. Perhaps you were surprised with a pancake breakfast — and the bonus gift of having to clean it all up afterward. Or maybe you were hoping for some quality family time, but no one made time for you.\nThis year, you deserve a Mother's Day that doesn't involve faking happiness when you're actually feeling disappointed. So why not ask for it? And if you don't know where to start, keep reading for a list of effortless options that can restore the joy, relaxation, and family bonding that Mother's Day should be all about. After all, it's your day.\nA peaceful, grounded start to your dayWhoever came up with the idea of a loud, messy and chaotic breakfast in bed to kick off Mother's Day definitely wasn't a mom. In the immortal words of Chief Hopper, \"Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.\" So if you're not into getting toast crumbs all over your sheets, why not start a new tradition?\nThink about what you'd actually like to get out of your morning, and then tell your family so that it actually happens. Maybe your perfect morning involves reading a book or taking a solo walk to a coffee shop. If possible, ask your partner to step in so that you aren't dealing with childcare during what ought to be a restful morning.\nEasy activities and recipes to enjoy as a familyIf quality time with your children is an important part of your Mother's Day, choose manageable activities that won't get out of control. Playing a board game or doing a puzzle together is a great way to bond as a family without the mess of elaborate craft projects or baking endeavors.\nGetting in the kitchen is another easy way to spend time together with a fail-proof recipe like three-ingredient peanut butter balls. With minimal cleanup — that will ideally be taken care of by someone else — and no baking involved, these treats will still allow your family to feel like they're spoiling you on your special day.\nOn Mother's Day, take time for yourselfMother's Day can be complicated. Having a difficult relationship with your own mom or dealing with grief are just a few of the factors that can make Mother's Day an emotionally charged time.\nIf you would benefit from having time to yourself on Mother's Day, ask for it. Working on your favorite hobbies, trying an art or fitness class, getting your nails done or just lounging around on the sofa are all excellent ways to take care of yourself on your special day.\nWhatever you do, just don't feel any pressure to cook, clean, run errands or otherwise be helpful. Enjoy your relaxation time, because you've more than earned it.\nLow-stress family outingsDoes your ideal Mother's Day involve a family outing? A simple picnic in your local park can be a stress-free way to enjoy the outdoors together. Gather some sandwiches, water bottles and healthy-ish snacks like fresh fruit and fruit dip. Better yet, let someone else pack the picnic basket and you're ready for a fun-filled afternoon in the sun.\nLet your family treat you to Mother's Day dinnerDepending on how old your kids are, you can wrap up your Mother's Day by preparing a favorite meal together. Cooking together in the kitchen, especially if someone else washes the dishes, can be just as meaningful as enjoying the meal itself. End your night sweetly with an easy dessert like canned peach pie, which only requires ten minutes of prep time.\nIf you don't even want to think about the kitchen during Mother's Day, why not order your favorite takeout food for dinner? This easy option gives your family plenty of time to decompress, especially if you've had a day packed full of activities.\nEnd the day with a cozy family movieCan anyone say no to a family movie night? Cuddling up together and watching a movie before bed is a great way to conclude Mother's Day. Laughing over a favorite film or discovering a new one together is the perfect way to wind down the day. Alternatively, let the kids have a movie night while you and your partner enjoy some alone time.\nPracticing gratitude as a familyTowards the end of the day — perhaps over dessert, or just before bed — take a moment to reflect upon what everyone was grateful for during Mother's Day. It might sound cheesy, but acknowledging the love and effort that your family members put in can start a beautiful new tradition that will ultimately bring the family closer.\nA Mother's Day tradition worth startingInitially, asking for what you want on Mother's Day might feel overly demanding. It's ironic that even on a day that's supposedly for them, moms are expected to put their families first.\nA self-planned Mother's Day doesn't have to add a ton of items to your to-do list, either. A simple conversation with your family before the big day, or even on the morning of, will keep your Mother's Day from falling flat. Sometimes, dropping a hint just isn't enough.\nIf all else fails, just send your loved ones a link to this article. Then, get ready to enjoy a day that is truly focused on you. You — and all moms everywhere — deserve it.\nSamantha Erb is the owner of Everyday Family Cooking, a recipe website focused on providing simple meals with few ingredients that still pack on the flavor. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The music and performing arts venue is located at 40 E. Dover Street in Easton. Here's a rundown of upcoming shows with performance descriptions from the Avalon.For ticket prices and more show and venue information at the Avalon and its Stoltz Listening Room online check out avalonfoundation.org.\nThe Met: Live in HD Madama Butterfly\nSaturday, May 11th\nDoors: 12:30pm / Show: 1:00pm\nAvalon Theatre\nExtraordinary soprano Asmik Grigorian tackles the demanding role of Cio-Cio-San, the loyal geisha at the heart of Puccini's devastating tragedy. Tenor Jonathan Tetelman stars as the callous American naval officer Pinkerton, whose betrayal destroys her. Mezzo-soprano Elizabeth DeShong reprises the role of the steadfast maid Suzuki, and baritone Lucas Meachem is the American consul Sharpless. Acclaimed maestro Xian Zhang takes the podium on May 11 to conduct Anthony Minghella's vivid production. This live cinema transmission is part of the Met's award-winning Live in HD series, bringing opera to movie theaters across the globe.\nDar Williams with Guest Heather Maloney\nSaturday, May 11\nDoors: 7:30 a.m.; Show: 8 p.m.\nAvalon Theatre\nDar Williams' lyrics contain bouquets of optimism, delivered on melodies alternating between beguiling lightness and understated gravity.\nAlways in the right place at the right time for the success she's had over a 25+year career, Dar rose out of the vibrant mid-90's Boston scene, inspired by the eclectic influences of alt-rockers, Berklee jazz musicians, slam poets, and folk artists like Patty Griffith, Melissa Ferrick, the Throwing Muses, Vance Gilbert, and Jonatha Brooke.\nThrough all the ups and downs, however, it's always been about staying true to herself. \"Good and bad things happen, and it's not necessarily a reward or indictment. I've just got to meet it,\" she observes. \"Like, I'm bringing my whole life to this moment; it will surprise me, challenge me, show me where I was wrong, even make a fool out of me, but my job is to show up and not take adversity personally. Real happiness doesn't have to feel like Snoopy dancing with Woodstock; it can just be knowing you have the resilience to meet whatever comes to you. I will call that a good life.\"\nDar will be joined by special guest Heather Maloney, a Massachusetts-based singer songwriter whose voice is her \"not-so-secret weapon\" (Boston Globe) and whose \"lyrics cut to the chase\" (Huffington Post).\nMinor Gold\nWednesday, May 15\nDoors: 6:30 p.m.; Doors: 7 p.m.\nStoltz Listening Room\nMinor Gold are ARIA-nominated artists Tracy McNeil and Dan Parsons. Canadian and Australian, respectively, this Trans-Pacific duo echo '70s cosmic Americana with an easy charm and potent honesty.\nThe strength of the songwriting and the indeterminate perfection of how these two artists' voices lock in together hit right where the emotions live inside us. With dynamics ranging from the intense restraint of campfire intimacy through to open-throttle abandon, Minor Gold delight and enthrall as they weave masterful harmonies and deft guitar playing around unforgettable, stripped-back performances.\nSince releasing their critically acclaimed self-titled debut album in August 2023, the duo have been on the road—recently returning from a 30-date North American album tour with supports for The Teskey Brothers and an official showcase at AmericanaFEST in Nashville, as well as the 2024 Folk Alliance International in Kansas City. https://www.minorgoldmusic.com/\nJulian Brezon\nFriday, May 17, 2024\nDoors: 6:30 p.m.; Show: 7 p.m.\nStoltz Listening Room\nNew York-based Easton native Julian Brezon returns to the Stoltz with a stellar quartet presenting jazz standards and original compositions. As a saxophonist, composer, and educator, Julian brings a fresh ear to the world of modern creative music. His compositions strike a delicate balance of harmonic adventurousness and familiar listenability while his takes on standards blend a love of tradition with an ear for experimentation.\nJulian recently earned his Master of Music degree in jazz performance at the City College of New York in Harlem. He has studied with jazz greats Gary Thomas, Steve Wilson, Jason Rigby, and Vincent Herring. https://www.julianbrezon.com/\nBoy Band Review\nSaturday, May 25\nDoors: 6:30 p.m.; Show: 7 p.m.\nAvalon Theatre, 40 E.

Coming up in the Philly scene, he played around town and in area clubs before landing his first tour opening for Joe Jackson. Since then he's toured across the U.S. and Europe with his musical brother, Amos Lee, who discovered Mutlu's music just as both of their careers were taking off.\nIn addition, he's found an advocate with Daryl Hall & John Oates, who invited Mutlu to support a national theater tour. http://www.mutlusounds.com\nSouthside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes\nFriday, June 7, 2024\nDoors: 7:30 p.m\nAvalon Theatre, 40 E. Dover Street, Easton, MD\nSouthside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes emerged from the New Jersey shore scene in 1974, and though they carried over a significant influence (and some key personnel) from Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, the Jukes evolved as more of an R&B horn band in the Memphis Stax Records tradition.\nOrganized by singer John Lyon, guitarist/songwriter Steve Van Zandt (who decamped for the E Street Band in 1975, but continued to produce, manage, and write songs for the Jukes) and Richie Rosenberg, the band is well known for high-energy shows and no-holds-barred songs, including \"I Don't Wanna Go Home,\" \"Havin' a Party,\" \"The Fever,\" \"Talk to Me,\" \"Trapped Again,\" and \"This Time It's For Real.\"\nStill tinged with the exuberant rhythm and blues feel that is the Jukes' trademark, and loaded with the driving sound of the legendary Jukes horn section, Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes continue to expound their signature Jersey Shore sound – all for the sheer joy of it. https://www.southsidejohnny.com/\nThe Brothers Comatose\nThursday, June 20\nDoors: 7:30 p.m.; Show: 8 p.m.\nAvalon Theatre\nWhether traveling to gigs on horseback or by tour bus, Americana mavens The Brothers Comatose forge their own path with raucous West Coast renderings of traditional bluegrass, country and rock 'n' roll music.

When they're not headlining The Fillmore for a sold-out show or appearing at Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, the band is out on the road performing across America, Canada, Australia, and hosting their very own music festival, Comatopia, in the Sierra foothills. https://www.thebrotherscomatose.com/\nThe Wailers 2024 Legend Anniversary Tour\nWednesday, July 3\nDoors: 7:30 p.m.; Show: 8 p.m.\nAvalon Theatre\nThe Wailers are a rare breed of musicians who have earned their place in the annals of music history.

I was 'Captain Space' because I played progressive rock.\"\nWhile they talked, food vendors served and in between the rainfall people jetted out to grab a carbonated beverage and some food then hurried back for the live music.\n\"It wouldn't be a radio celebration without music, right. So we've assembled a great variety,\" Singleton told the crowd.\nLOCAL TALENT\nSombarkin' played blues and some toe-tapping gospel. Justin Singleton and the Shorebillies performed soulful country-style songs with original lyrics. Philip Dutton and the Alligators rocked out Louisiana-style, and the Blake Thompson Band performed later that day with some classic rock/blues/folk music.\nOn the smaller stage, Maryland Delegate Jay Jacobs presented Singleton a citation of recognition.\nThe station also received a certificate of recognition in March from the Kent County Commissioners.\nWhile the crowd mingled, Singleton's junior students, the class of 2025, took the sound coming from the stage and broadcasted it out for those who couldn't make it that day.\nThe \"on-air\" on the barn wall above the bands wasn't just for decoration.\nSingleton was appreciative of the community support.\n\"It's pretty amazing. Everybody coming together from all walks of life today, celebrating for a common cause. We're the only high school radio station in Maryland and still going strong.\"\nYou can discover Singleton and his crew's work on the radio dial at 90.5. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Simplify your Baking: Quick bread basics for beginners\n\n May 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maike Corbett Wealth of Geeks | Section: Entertainment \n \n 766\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Making bread at home intimidates many home bakers who don't have tons of experience making yeast bread. Several steps are involved, and there's no guarantee of an edible end result. Plus, making bread is time-consuming. That's probably part of the reason why the global bakery market is expected to reach $9.62 billion by 2030, according to 360iResearch.It's convenient for shoppers with busy schedules to grab a loaf of bread or another pre-packaged bakery item. They're available in every grocery store, reasonably inexpensive, and the quality is consistent. However, home cooks who like to know what's in their food may still want to try their hand creating their own baked goods. Quick bread is an excellent solution to that dilemma.\nWhat Is Quick Bread?\nQuick bread is a type of bread that does not use yeast or another biological agent for leavening. These goods include pancakes, waffles, zucchini bread, banana bread, American biscuits, Southern cornbread, and more. This category also includes flatbreads like naan or tortillas.\nAccording to the Wheat Foods Council, quick breads became more popular during the mid-19th century, when baking soda and baking powder came on the market. After the Civil War started, home cooks needed bread recipes that didn't require several hours to let yeast doughs rise. The result was what we now know as quick bread.\nAmerican biscuits are one of the earliest types of quick breads, although making them before the Civil War wasn't quick. Since yeast was hard to find and expensive, bakers kneaded the dough to incorporate enough air into it so it would rise when baked. Baking powder makes the process much easier.\nWhy Quick Bread?\nQuick breads don't have to rise, and the dough doesn't always need to be kneaded. Quick bread recipes are usually easy. Since they don't require specialized techniques, they're great for beginners, including kids. Most quick bread recipes are \"dump and stir.\"\nMaking a quick bread is a good way to learn several basic cooking techniques, including correctly measuring and sifting flour. The loaves don't have to be shaped, either. The cook only needs to pour the batter into a greased baking pan.\nQuick breads yield consistent results. If the person follows the recipe, the results should come out well. It's hard to mess up quick bread. Another reason these are great starter recipes.\nQuick breads are also versatile. The recipes are forgiving; cooks can add different ingredients to suit their family's preferences. For example, if no one likes walnuts, the cook can add pecans to banana bread or omit the nuts entirely. They can also add chocolate chips or even dried blueberries or cranberries for a different take on the bread.\nAnna Chesley, with Salt in My Coffee, says, \"I make a lot of quick breads, and our favorites vary with the seasons. In spring, we love rhubarb quick bread, topped with a maple streusel crumble. In the summer months, we go through a lot of zucchini bread, and by late fall, we're so ready for cranberry orange bread — our favorite through the cold weather months.\"\nThose with a bumper crop of zucchini in their gardens often make zucchini bread in the summer. They may also try pumpkin bread if they have a pumpkin in the garden. It's a good way to use surplus vegetables so they don't go to waste.\nHealthier Choices\nIf people are concerned about gluten in their food, eat a plant-based menu, or have other dietary concerns, quick breads are a viable option. You may think quick breads are sugary and carb-heavy, but that's not always true. The best part of making a quick bread is that the cook controls the ingredients. There are low-sugar recipes and low-carb options that incorporate almond flour or another lower-carb flour to lower the carbohydrate count.\n\"We make whole food plant based oil free banana bread with dairy free chocolate chips,\" says Jacqueline Sanchez of My Plant Based Plan. \"It's a great breakfast with a side of fruit and coffee or an afternoon snack after school for the kids.\"\nQuick breads aren't necessarily loaves, either. Flatbreads are quick and a popular alternative to the standard white sandwich bread. Tiffany McCauley with The Gracious Pantry says, \"My favorite is Socca, a chickpea flatbread. It's super quick and easy to make and is totally gluten-free. It tastes great and even works as a pizza crust. I use it that way often and love it.\"\nFor those who don't have time to work with yeast bread, making quick bread is a good way to have savory or sweet baked goods that can be served for any meal.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It just really speaks to me. And I love all the dresses, too, so that's a lot of fun.\"\nShe will compete in honor of her grandfather, Bob Richardson, who was a prominent figure in St. Mary's County Babe Ruth Little League and the county's recreation and parks department who died earlier this year.\nBecause of the various clubs and activities she is involved in, McDowell is no stranger to being on stage. As a 5-year-old she won a cute baby contest at the St. Mary's County Fair.\nFor the upcoming state competition, she's planning on wearing a dark green formal gown that is \"prominent and catches the eye.\" She also will wear a fitness outfit, business suit and a traditional pink cocktail dress to match her fellow competitors.\n\"I feel I interact well with adults, and I feel I can talk to the judges well,\" said McDowell, who added she hopes her genuine personality and her \"contagious smile\" will help her stand out with the judges.\nShe has been practicing answering sample questions with her mother.\n\"The big thing is just be yourself and showcase your personality,\" she said.\nThe 17-year-old has been her class president for the past three years, a treasurer with the National Honors Society, secretary of the Key Club, a member of the SGA and a member of the Potomac Voices, Leonardtown High's chamber choir. She plays forward for the varsity field hockey team.\n\"All the more power to her,\" said Leonardtown High School media specialist Brenda Hager, who also teaches McDowell journalism. \"She is a bright beaming light to every room she enters. She is a refreshing, positive energy to our student body. The best word to describe Lily Belle is her kindness; it just overflows. She's something special.\"\nIn 2023 she was awarded the Relentless for a Cure award by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Fly4ACure for her fundraising efforts, and this year as a team leader, she helped raise $88,000, good for first runner-up in the state.\n\"I'm really excited to go there for the experience, to meet new people and to learn from them as well,\" she said. \"I honestly would love to win the whole thing. I feel like that would be amazing, and I'd enjoy that.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Angie Harmon is suing Instacart and a former shopper who shot and killed her dog, Oliver\n\n May 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 461\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Actor Angie Harmon has filed a lawsuit against Instacart and one of its former shoppers who fatally shot her dog in March while delivering groceries at her North Carolina home.The lawsuit filed earlier this month in Mecklenburg County seeks to hold the shopper and Instacart liable for accusations of trespassing, gross negligence, emotional distress and invasion of privacy, among other allegations. It accuses Instacart of engaging in negligent hiring, supervision, retention and misrepresentation. The suit seeks monetary damages, to be determined at trial.\nInstacart says the shopper has since been permanently banned from its platform.\nHarmon is known for her work on TV shows including \"Law & Order\" and \"Rizolli & Isles.\" She told ABC News that it was \"so unfathomable to think that there is somebody in your front driveway that just fired a gun.\"\n\"I think Instacart is beyond responsible for all of this. This didn't have to happen,\" Harmon said in the interview that aired earlier this month on \"Good Morning America.\" ABC News described the dog as a \"beagle mix.\"\nAccording to the complaint, Harmon ordered an Instacart groceries delivery from a Charlotte store on March 30. The Instacart app showed a shopper named Merle with a profile photo of an older woman, with whom Harmon believed she was exchanging text messages about her order, the lawsuit says.\nLater that day, Harmon was upstairs filling her squirrel feeders when a \"tall and intimidating younger man,\" not an older woman, showed up to deliver the groceries, the lawsuit says.\nHarmon said she heard a gunshot sound and rushed outside. She found her dog, Oliver, had been shot, and saw the delivery person putting a gun into the front of his pants, according to the suit. Her teenage daughters, who had already been outside, were \"in distress,\" it says. The dog died at the veterinarian's office.\nThe shopper told police that he shot the dog after it attacked him, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department told news outlets, adding that they did not pursue criminal charges.\nIn an Instagram post last month about the encounter, Harmon wrote that the shopper \"did not have a scratch or bite on him nor were his pants torn.\"\nInstacart says it immediately suspended the shopper after receiving the report about the shooting, then later removed him permanently. The company says it runs comprehensive background checks on shoppers, prohibits them from carrying weapons and has anti-fraud measures that include periodically requiring them to take a photo of themselves to ensure the person shopping matches their photo on file.\n\"Our hearts continue to be with Ms. Harmon and her family following this disturbing incident,\" Instacart said in a statement. \"While we cannot comment on pending litigation, we have no tolerance for violence of any kind, and the shopper account has been permanently deactivated from our platform.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Side dishes for Memorial Day\n\n May 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 675\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Memorial Day will always mean the same no matter the situation at home or abroad.Memorial Day is an American holiday celebrated the last Monday of May. This day honors the men and women who died while serving in the United States Military.\nOriginally known as Decoration Day, it originated in the years following the Civil War and became an official federal holiday in 1971.\nMy fellow Americans, I fly the United States flag each day to honor all who died in the line of duty — military, law enforcement, first responders, and anyone who lost their life while helping their fellow people. Stand proud of these people as they gave all for you and me and the USA. Fly those flags with great pride as we all know someone who answered \"the call.\"\nThis year's celebrations may be different since gasoline and supplies are so expensive. Remember the \"carpooling\" days a few years ago?\nPlan a day at home to barbecue, play outside games, safely have a few fireworks, make homemade ice cream, watch home movies or catch up with family. These will be some of your most cherished memories in the years to come.\nSit under the shade tree or on the front porch with the older folks and listen to their \"recollections\" of years gone by.\nWhen the crowd gathers for food, the host may ask for each family to bring a dish, so today I will give you some recipes that can be easily prepared.\nUsually the host prepares the meat, so side dishes are appreciated. Let us begin with a favorite.\nGERMAN POTATO SALAD\nCook 5 large potatoes (peeled and sliced) until tender, drain and set aside. Saute one bunch of sliced green onions and 1 small, diced onion in 6 tbsps butter until tender. Add 1/3 cup vinegar, 1/3 cup sugar, 2 tbsps mustard, 1/2 tsp thyme, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the potatoes and toss. Cook over low heat for 15 minutes to blend flavors. Do not refrigerate.\nCUCUMBER SALAD\nMix 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1 tbsp sugar, 2 tbsps vinegar, 2 tbsps milk, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well and pour over three peeled and thinly sliced cucumbers. Let stand for at least an hour before serving.\nSTRAWBERRY ICEBOX CAKE\n8 oz. cream cheese at room temperature, 1 cup powdered sugar, 3 cups heavy cream (divided), 1 tbsp vanilla bean paste or extract, 1 tbsp lemon zest, 40 graham cracker squares, 2 pounds strawberries (sliced about 1/4-inch thick), 3/4 cup sliced almonds (optional).\nBeat cream cheese in a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer until smooth. Add powdered sugar; beat until smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add 1 cup of the heavy cream and beat at low speed until smooth. Add the remaining 2 cups of cream; beat at medium to medium-high speed until soft peaks form, increasing speed as the mixture begins to thicken. Fold in the vanilla and lemon zest. Spoon 1/4 cup of the cream mixture into the bottom of a 9-by-9-inch pan or baking dish; spread into a thin, even layer. Top with graham crackers in a single, even layer, breaking them as needed to fit. Spread about 1 1/2 cups of the cream mixture over the graham crackers, smoothing into an even layer using a spoon or offset spatula. Top the cream mixture with an even layer of berries (about 1 1/2 cups). Sprinkle evenly with 1/4 cup almonds, if using. Repeat two more times with the remaining graham crackers, cream mixture, berries, and almonds. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least four hours and up to overnight.\nMARINATED PEAS\nMix together in a bowl: two one-pound cans sweet peas, drained, with one chopped onion, one chopped green pepper, 2 stalks chopped celery, 1/4 cup oil, 1/2 cup vinegar and 3/4 cup sugar. Cover and let marinate for 6 hours before serving.\nArrange a tray of sliced pickles, a variety of cheeses, onions, olives and other fresh veggies. Deviled eggs and plain hard-boiled eggs are great for any gathering and don't forget the chips. Enjoy your day together. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The audience of all ages was rapt.\nThere was a palpable sense of joy as the ringmaster announced each act in a booming voice.\nChildren had their faces painted like butterflies and queued to hold a real albino snake. One happy grandmother from Trappe, waving at her grandson, said, \"I am already in for $100, but it is OK.\"\nIn the darkened tent, the spectacle glowed on the children's faces.\nThe balancing act was like a surfer on a board. He placed seven cylinders beneath his board and stood 30 feet above the ground wobbling. The crowd was in awe of this seemingly dangerous act. He dismounted with his arms up in victory.\nThere was a 20-foot inflatable koala bear teetering around the ring and providing photo ops for children.\nThere were two clowns that were supported by timely sound effects. The whole tent was laughing with them and at them.\nHorses pranced and jumped and put their forward hoof on stands in unison. Mini donkeys performed the same tricks.\nMost of the performers are from Mexico but are based in Florida, according to employees of the circus, and tour the East Coast.\nThey travel from Rock Hall to Collcoon to Woodstown, performing two or three shows in each spot, and then roll it up and head to the next town. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2024-05-30",
    "author": "Leah Ingram Food Drink Life",
    "content": "Sweet tea smackdown: which iced tea version is best?\n\n May 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Leah Ingram Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1013\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Order a glass of iced tea in the South and you're guaranteed to get sweet tea. In most other places in the United States, your server will likely ask if you want your iced tea sweetened or unsweetened. In time for June's National Iced Tea Month, here is a look at why some Americans prefer one kind of tea over another.The popularity of tea\nMany cultures around the world prefer to drink hot tea. However, in the United States, tea lovers tend to enjoy it cold and over ice. The National Tea Association said that 75% to 80% of all tea that Americans drink is done so cold.\nFun fact: the very first versions of American iced tea were more akin to that bar favorite the Long Island Iced Tea. It wasn't until the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, says National Public Radio, that Americans really developed a taste for non-alcoholic iced tea. \"The hot summer weather caused fairgoers to ignore hot beverages in favor of cold ones — including iced tea,\" said an NPR article. \"The fair's 20 million visitors cooled themselves with iced tea and brought the new style back to their homes throughout the United States and the world.\"\nThe South becomes synonymous with tea\nAbout 100 years before the St. Louis World's Fair, tea drinkers in the South had already developed a taste for sweet tea. A few things contributed to this trend. One was the abundant access to ice, so they no longer had to drink tea hot. Another was the sugar trade reaching America's southern shores.\nPerhaps the biggest contributor, though, was the fact that South Carolina farmers had been growing tea since the 18th century. They planted Camellia Sinensis on Wadmalaw Island, near Charleston, South Carolina, on land the Bigelow Tea Company now owns. That flower is one that, even today, you can plant in your backyard to grow tea.\nMap of iced tea consumption\nToday, sweet tea is synonymous with Southern cuisine. Why else would Dolly Parton's character in the movie \"Sweet Magnolias\" refer to sweet tea as the \"house wine of the South\"?\n\"In the South, if you order an iced tea, it is almost always going to be sweet tea,\" added Susannah Brinkley Henry of Charlotte, North Carolina, who writes the beverage-heavy Feast + West blog. \"It is always easy to recognize a non-Southerner at a restaurant. They will either order unsweet iced tea or send it back when it is too sweet.\"\nIf you were to draw a map of where tea drinkers prefer sweet tea over regular iced tea, it might look a lot like The Sweet Tea Boundary. This iced tea map appears on a University of Alabama fan page called Tide Fans.\nStates that lean toward sweet tea include South Carolina — not surprising, given its tea roots — along with North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Arkansas and Tennessee. After that, the map includes states that supposedly have tea lovers of both persuasions — sweet tea drinkers and those who drink unsweetened iced tea. Those states are Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri and Illinois.\nThe remaining 37 states are either agnostic on iced tea — no preference stated — or presumed to prefer unsweetened iced tea. Interestingly, within those agnostic areas, there are cities that lean heavily towards sweet tea. One such city is Richmond, Virginia.\nBrewing iced tea at home\nWant to brew iced tea at home in time for National Iced Tea Month? Here are a few things to keep in mind. First and foremost, never use straight-from-the-tap water, unless you have a filter system installed. Basically, public or well water can give off an odd flavor or odor when brewing tea so it's best to avoid using it at all, unless you have that aforementioned water filter system. Otherwise, purchase bottled spring water for your tea brewing.\nAlso, when brewing iced tea, you'll want to use double the amount of tea bags as you would when brewing hot tea. Why? Because when you add ice to the drink, it tends to dilute the flavor as it melts. To retain the tea taste, you brew iced tea to be doubly strong.\nThis is true whether you're brewing a one-off glass of iced tea or a whole pitcher. Jere Cassidy of Northern California has learned to make tea on the spot when ordering iced tea when she goes out to eat. \"If a restaurant doesn't serve unsweetened tea,\" said Cassidy, who writes the One Hot Oven blog, \"I will ask for teabags and hot water and brew my own. Then, I pour it over ice cubes.\"\nThe long and short of brewing iced tea\nHow you brew iced tea depends on how much time you have. There are methods that call for a long, overnight brew and others that you can make as quickly as you would a hot cup of tea as Cassidy does. You can find the recommended brewing times on the box the tea bags came in. Set a timer on your phone so you'll know when steep time is over and you should remove the bags. If you compost your food scraps, you can add the used tea bags to your compost pile.\nWhen brewing a pitcher of hot tea to turn into iced tea, remember to double the tea bags to avoid diluting the flavor when serving over ice. Also, if you're making a sweet tea, you add the sugar, honey or molasses when the tea is still hot and brewing. It's not something you add after the fact to make it sweet.\nFinal thoughts on which tea America prefers\nIf that aforementioned iced tea map were an indicator of which kind of iced tea Americans prefer, there is a clear winner, based on population alone. With only seven Southern states on team sweet tea, it appears that unsweetened iced tea is the leader in the United States. However, don't tell that to a sweet tea drinker. Chances are they'd rather drink seawater than tea that hasn't been sweetened.\nLeah Ingram developed a taste for iced tea during the Snapple heyday. These days, she writes a food blog called Bagels and Lasagna. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Time to get crabby: Annual Lions Club festival on tap\n\n May 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Ted Black tblack@somdnews.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 537\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The 38th annual St. Mary's County Crab Festival will be held Saturday, June 8. at the St. Mary's County Fairgrounds in Leonardtown.The crabs are the main attraction on Saturday at the fairgrounds. But there will also be live music provided by a pair of local bands — \"Totally Stoked\" and \"Reagan Years\" — food vendors and, fittingly, a crab-picking contest that will serve a duel purpose of providing competitive entertainment and crab meat for those who indulge.\nGeorge Kirby has been associated with the Leonardtown Lions Club for the past decade and now he is among the committee members who are seeking to make the annual crab festival even more festive each year. In recent years, Kirby noted several new items have been added to the entertainment venue and each of them has been received in appreciable fashion.\n\"One thing that we added a few years ago, and it has become really popular, is the crab-picking contest,\" Kirby said. \"We started a new tradition last year. Instead of just giving away a trophy to the winner, we have a big trophy with the name of each annual winner engraved on it. It started last year and we'll keep adding a name to it each year.\"\nIn addition to the crab-picking contest, the St. Mary's County Crab Festival also features a classic car show, homemade craft exhibits, a petting zoo, a face painter and free hearing and vision screenings, all of which debuted a year ago and are free to the public.\n\"I think we're expecting about 30 to 40 cars for the show,\" Kirby said. \"There are a lot more car shows around now, so that number could be a little lower. But we're still going to have a contest with judges and trophies to the winners. ... Our health screenings are free and they're important.\"\nWhile there are a bevy of eating and entertainment options for patrons throughout the eight-hour outing, the crab-picking contest has evolved into a must-see event. Hardly a subjective viewing event, the champion of the crab-picking contest is the individual who picks the most crab meat during a brief, contentious, four-minute window, and then is immortalized on a trophy that could someday emulate the Stanley Cup.\n\"I hope in my heart that people come out because the Leonardtown Lions Club is a good community service group and we'll use all the money we get to give back to the community,\" Kirby said. \"And a good humanitarian fundraiser is for some people worth coming to just to sit around and say 'I helped.' We do really good things and part of that depends on people coming. We just want people to have a good time.\"\nIf you go\nThe 38th annual St. Mary's County Crab Festival will take place this Saturday, June 8, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the St. Mary's County Fairgrounds, located at 42455 Fairgrounds Road in Leonardtown.\nThis event will feature hot crabs, an animal zoo, jump houses, crafts, car shows, a crab-picking contest, free vision and hearing screenings and performances from local bands Totally Stoked (noon-3 p.m.) and Reagan Years (4-7 p.m.).\nTickets for the event are $10, while children under 12 get in free.

Accomplished musician Gabe Stillman is the festival headliner and will also feature performances from Walking Eagle, Everyday Everybody and Shamans of Sound with Carly Harvey, a 2007 St. Mary's College alumna, serving as mistress of ceremonies.\n\"At St. Mary's College, we value our liberal arts foundation — the diversity of thought and expression, creativity and respect for self and others,\" Jordan said. \"We teach students how to express themselves in order to add color and life to our world in a way that only each unique individual can. In this spirit of creativity, I initiated the Mulberry Music Festival in order to bring people together around the universal language that is music.\"\nHeadlining the Mulberry Music Festival is Stillman, a graduate of Boston's Berkley College of Music whose honors include an invitation to support ZZ Top, Eric Gales, Blues Traveler, George Thorogood and several others. Stillman was a Blues Music Award nominee in the Best New Emerging Artist album category, and the Gabe Stillman Band was selected as the Best Blues Band by the third annual Central PA Music Awards.\nAnother prominent performer on Friday evening is Walking Eagle, an artist from Northern Virginia whose debut album \"As Is\" was released in the spring of 2023, and his version of \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was released last October. Walking Eagles was a season 24 contestant on NBC's \"The Voice\" and currently has two new singles that will be released this year. He believes that music is fun, life-giving and spiritual and a gift that he is eager to share with everyone.\nJoining the entertainment is Shamans of Sound, a reggae group that seeks to unite listeners through peace, love and social consciousness. Comprised of nearly a dozen members from the Washington, D.C. area, Shamans of Sound has earned its reputation as one of the city's finest reggae performing acts, seeking to rebuild the vibe and help heal the nation together from its brand of musical performances.\nAlso performing on Friday is Everyday Everybody, a nine-member group that has been performing together since 2012 and often produces an upbeat, retro groove sound influenced by Funk and Soul, Jazz, Afro-funk and Motown-era pop. The combination of their sound and energetic live performances have earned them numerous awards, including Best Local Original Band and Best Funk group by the Washington Area Music Association.\nSpectators are encouraged to bring lawn chairs, blankets and food, although there will be food vendors on hand, although guests are reminded that pets are strictly prohibited from attending this event.\nIf you go\nThe Mulberry Music Festival will be held on the Townhouse Green on the campus of the St. Mary's College of Maryland located at 47645 College Drive, St. Mary's City, on Friday, June 14, from 6 to 9 p.m.\nThis event is free to the public and will feature performances from Gabe Stillman, Walking Eagle, Everyday Everybody and Shamans of Sound with Carly Harvey serving as mistress of ceremonies.

    "content": "Kid-friendly recipes for summer vacation\n\n June 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1100\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Schools are closed, buses are parked, shoes are off and summer clothes are on. Children are excited and parents are rearranging schedules, and the grocery list is growing.Summer day camps and programs are a great help because after the first couple of summer vacation you start hearing \"I'm bored.\"\nWell let me tell you, after growing up on a farm, I never said those words. Just when you thought the chores were done, then came three or four more. Something always needed to be raked, hoed, picked, stacked, washed out, cut or finished.\nMy first job at age 16 at the Mann's Potato Chip Factory was great — most of the afternoon workers were teenagers like myself, and we had fun. I probably did not eat chips for two to three years after that job. The next couple of summers, I worked as a desk clerk in a popular Ocean City motel, the Oceanic. One comment on that job — at least the chips could not complain.\nWhen the schools are closed, the kids soon get bored not seeing their friends, and the grandparents are exhausted, it is time to explore other options.\nVacation Bible school, summer camps, camps held by the school system and Parks and Recreation help to wipe out boredom. Assigning chores at home, and when completed, a swimming trip to the local pool or a water hose fight in the backyard are also options.\nMy mom would take us clamming and crabbing at least once a week if the chores were done. We would eat our lunch outside, slice a big homegrown watermelon and have water hose fights. These activities did not just happen in the country, but our town friends did the same.\nEnjoy these childhood activities, and as an adult, go back in time and revisit your memories of these fun days of summer vacations.\nLet's make some fun food that kids like.\nAIR FRYER PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICHES\nUsing any kind of sliced bread, spread with your favorite jelly and peanut butter and place in the air fryer. Set the temperature to 400 degrees. Cook for 4 minutes, 2 minutes on one each side. Enjoy.\nCHOCOLATE CHIP PEANUT BUTTER SANDWICHES\n1/4 cup creamy peanut butter, 2 tablespoons honey, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 2 tablespoons miniature semisweet chocolate chips, 4 slices whole wheat bread, 1 medium banana (thinly sliced).\nMix peanut butter, honey and cinnamon; stir in chocolate chips. Spread over bread. Layer two bread slices with banana slices; top with remaining bread. If desired, cut into shapes using cookie cutters.\nOYSTER SNACKERS\n3/4 cup canola oil, 1 1/2 teaspoons dill weed, 1 envelope (1 ounce) ranch salad dressing mix, 2 packages (10 ounces each) oyster crackers.\nIn a small bowl, whisk the oil, dill and salad dressing mix. Place the crackers in a large bowl; pour dressing mixture over crackers and toss gently to coat. Allow to stand at least 1 hour before serving.\nPBJ-KABOBS\n2 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, 1 cup seedless red or green grapes, 1 small banana (sliced), 4 wooden skewers (5 to 6 inches).\nCut sandwiches into 1-inch squares. Alternately thread grapes, sandwich squares and banana slices onto each skewer. Serve carefully if children are under the age of 6.\nFLYING SAUCERS\n1/2 cup mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, 8 pita pocket halves, 8 lettuce leaves, 16 thin slices bologna, 8 thin slices fully cooked ham, 16 thin slices tomato.\nCombine the mayonnaise and mustard; spread about 1 tablespoon into each pita half. Stuff each with one lettuce leaf, two slices of bologna, one slice of ham and two slices of tomato.\nCRUNCHY GRANOLA STICKS\n1 package (12 ounces) dark chocolate chips, 24 pretzel rods, 1 cup granola without raisins.\nIn a microwave, melt chocolate chips in a 2-cup glass measuring cup; stir until smooth. Pour into one side of a large shallow dish. Roll each pretzel halfway into chocolate. Allow excess coating to drip off, then sprinkle pretzels with granola. Place on waxed paper until set. Store in an airtight container.\nTEXAS TUMBLEWEEDS\n1 cup butterscotch chips, 1 cup creamy peanut butter, 1 can (9 ounces) potato sticks (about 6 cups).\nIn a large microwave-safe bowl in a microwave or in a large metal bowl over simmering water, melt butterscotch chips and peanut butter; stir until smooth. Gently stir in potato sticks. Drop mixture by rounded tablespoonfuls onto wax-paper-lined baking sheets. Refrigerate 10 to 15 minutes or until set.\nCHOCOLATE POTATO CHIPS\n3 cups regular or kettle-cooked potato chips, 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips, 1 teaspoon shortening.\nArrange potato chips in a single layer on a wax-paper-lined baking sheet. In a microwave, melt chocolate chips and shortening; stir until smooth. Drizzle over chips. Refrigerate 5 minutes or until set.\nGARLIC TOAST PIZZA\n1 package (11-1/4 ounces) frozen garlic Texas toast, 1/2 cup pizza sauce, 1 package (3-1/2 ounces) sliced regular or turkey pepperoni, 2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place Texas toast in a 15-by-10-inch baking pan. Bake for 5 minutes. Spread toast with pizza sauce; top with pepperoni and cheese. Bake until the cheese is melted, 4 to 5 minutes longer. You can also use crumbled up sausage in place of pepperonis or a good variety of other toppings.\nSTRAWBERRY TACOS\n1/3 cup cream cheese (softened), 1 tablespoon honey, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/3 cup vanilla yogurt, 1 3/4 cups quartered fresh strawberries, 2 tablespoons butter, flour tortillas (6 inches).\nIn a large skillet, heat 1 teaspoon butter over medium-low heat. Add 1 tortilla; cook each side until light golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack. Repeat with remaining butter and tortillas. Beat together cream cheese, honey and cinnamon; slowly mix in yogurt until blended. Spread tortillas with cream cheese mixture; top with strawberries.\nICEBOX WHIPPED SANDWICHES\n1 package (3.4 ounces) instant vanilla pudding mix, 2 cups cold 2% milk, 2 cups whipped topping, 1 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips, 24 whole graham crackers (halved).\nMix pudding and milk according to package directions; refrigerate until set. Fold in whipped topping and chocolate chips. Place 24 graham cracker halves on a baking sheet; top each with about 3 tablespoons filling. Place another graham cracker half on top. Wrap individually in plastic; freeze until firm, about 1 hour. Serve sandwiches frozen.\nHOT DOG ROLL UPS\n8 hot dogs,1 block (4 ounces) cheddar cheese (cut into 8 strips), 2 bacon strips (cooked and crumbled), 1 tube (8 ounces) refrigerated crescent rolls.\nCut a lengthwise slit in each hot dog; fill with a strip of cheese and about 1/2 teaspoon bacon. Separate crescent dough into eight triangles. Place a hot dog on the wide end of each triangle; roll toward the point. Place cheese side up on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees until golden brown, about 12 minutes. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Police say Scott was drunkenly yelling at people on a yacht at the city marina and disobeyed their order to leave early Thursday, June 20.The 33-year-old Scott, who is one of the biggest names in hip-hop, posted his $650 bond and was released from jail before noon. His attorney says the arrest stemmed from a misunderstanding.\nAfter his release, he posted on the social platform X, \"Lol.\"\nHis attorney, Bradford Cohen, said in a statement that Scott was \"detained due to a misunderstanding.\"\nTen people were fatally crushed at a 2021 Scott concert at Houston's Astroworld amusement park when the crowd surged.

Rising senior at Kent Island High School Madison Mitchell is the answer.At 17 years old, Mitchell is already an active member of her community.\nShe is a junior member of the American Legion Auxiliary, where she organizes and carries out events like the Mother's and Father's Day brunches. She is also a founding member of the KI Scouts of America chapter, where she has earned over 60 merit badges.\nHer Eagle Scout project provided six pressure-treated benches to the Blue Heron Nature Preserve. In addition, Mitchell also loves fishing and is a part of the KI Fisherman's Club, where she helps with events like the Fishing Flea Market for about 2,800 people.\nExcitement came in the mail when Mitchell received an invitation for an open call for the National American Miss Contest.\n\"I'm trying to get more out of my comfort zone. When I got the open call, I wanted to try,\" she said.\nTwo days after her open call, Mitchell found out she was a state finalist for the National American Miss Pageant for 16 to 18 year-olds.\nWhile many beauty pageants focus on judging outward physical appearances, the National American Miss Pageant organization focuses on \"creating future leaders and equipping them with real-world skills to make their dreams a reality. The program is based on inner beauty, as well as poise and presentation, and offers an 'All-America' spirit of fun for family and friends.\"\nMike Mitchell, Madison's father, describes his daughter as \"a good kid who is shy and close with her family. She has been a leader in her Eagle Scouting and is well-organized with structuring events, programs, and event coordinating. She has great follow-through.\"\nMitchell shines through her community service as she received many awards to date including a Governor's Citation for \"outstanding services for the citizens of (Maryland),\" a Congressional award for service, as well as many Eagle Scout awards.\nNow, Mitchell prepares for the pageant on Aug. 17 to 19, in Reston, Virginia. Events will include a formal wear competition, an interview, a personal introduction and optional pay-to-participate events that include Top Model Search, Runway Model, Casual Wear and more.\nAs one of the only Queen Anne's County finalists, she hopes that this experience will not only take her \"out of her comfort zone but will also boost her confidence and public speaking.\"\nIn the near future, Mitchell aspires to encourage \"youth empowerment and support those in need.\" If she wins, she said she would, \"visit school field days to volunteer, read books to local schools, and donate (her) time to community events.\"\nTo support Mitchell's fundraising efforts, visit https://iam.buzz/5vrz5m or email mmitchell@lrwillsonandsons.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'He made Delaware famous': Native son George Thorogood honored for rock, blues chops\n\n June 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1114\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n George Thorogood, whose humble beginnings playing at the University of Delaware and at Newark bars led him to worldwide fame as one of rock 'n' roll's icons, returned to Newark last month for a celebration of his decades-long career.The celebration marked the 50th anniversary of Thorogood's first show, held on a small bandstand at UD's Lane Hall dormitory.\nUD presented Thorogood with its highest non-academic honor, the Medal of Distinction, which is given to people who have made significant cultural, humanitarian, scientific or intellectual contributions to society or in their profession. Thorogood is the first entertainer to receive the award.\n\"We celebrate a rock 'n' roll and blues legend whose music has echoed for the last five decades,\" said Bill Lafferty, vice chair of the UD Board of Trustees. \"A native Delawarean and former semi-pro baseball player, George Thorogood isn't just a musician. He's a storyteller whose guitar speaks the language of freedom and grit and maybe a little bit of rebellion, too.\"\nAfter the formal presentation at the Green Mansion Bar on Main Street, officials unveiled a plaque honoring Thorogood near the site of the former Stone Balloon, where he played many shows. The sign designates the alley between the Washington House and Main Street Plaza as \"Thorogood Alley.\"\n\"Thank you for what you've done for Newark, putting us on the rock 'n' roll map, and what you've done concurrently for the University of Delaware,\" Mayor Jerry Clifton said. \"We can't say thank you enough for the contributions that you have made.\"\nThorogood accepted the honors with self-deprecating humor.\n\"It really proves something I always knew, and that is Delaware always had questionable taste,\" Thorogood quipped.\nHe added that he and bandmates Jeff Simon and Bill Blough were surprised to be invited to such a prestigious event.\n\"Jeff and Bill and I are taken aback because of all the places we weren't invited to, and all the places we were invited to leave,\" he joked. \"So this is more than an honor, it's a shock.\"\nRock 'n' roll history\nA native of Wilmington, Thorogood spent his early 20s traveling the country as an acoustic street musician. When he returned home for his sister's wedding in December 1973, Simon booked the Lane Hall gig without telling him. The two had grown up playing music together informally but had never played an official show.\nThorogood bought an electric guitar at a pawn shop, and the rest was history.\n\"We had the place rockin',\" Thorogood recalled in a biography posted on his website. \"We must have played 'One Bourbon' three times. It may have been a bit unpolished and primitive, but we were connecting with the audience in a major way. From that very first show, Jeff and I knew we were onto something.\"\nAfter that show, George Thorogood and the Delaware Destroyers began playing gigs at Newark venues like the Stone Balloon, Deer Park Tavern and the Rathskeller, the UD-run beer hall that is now a study room in the Trabant University Center. They then expanded their reach regionally and nationally.\nThe band's major recording debut came in 1977 with the release of a self-titled album.\nThorogood's popularity increased in the 1980s, when the band opened for the Rolling Stones, appeared on Saturday Night Live and devised an aggressive touring schedule that included performances in all 50 states within 50 days.\nHis single \"Bad to the Bone,\" which remains his most well-known song, debuted in 1982. Other hits include \"I Drink Alone\" and \"One Bourbon, One Scotch and One Beer.\"\nIn the '80s, he owned a house on West Chestnut Hill Road in Newark.\nIn 1983, while at the height of his popularity, he returned to Lane Hall to perform a surprise concert in front of 500 people to mark the band's 10th anniversary.\nThorogood and the Destroyers are now in the midst of a tour celebrating their 50th anniversary, which was delayed by a year due to Thorogood's health issues. One day after the ceremony in Newark, they are scheduled to perform at the Freeman Arts Pavilion in Selbyville.\nThorogood's contribution to Newark didn't stop at music. In the late 1970s, he built a baseball field at the corner of Casho Mill Road and Barksdale Road because the city was lacking space to play the sport. A few years later, he sold the field to the city, which renamed it Leroy Hill Park. The field is now used by Newark American Little League and Newark Charter School.\n'He did a lot of good for the city'\nMelissa Forsythe, owner of Rainbow Records, came to Friday's event with several of Thorogood's albums for him to autograph. The rocker's music continues to sell well at Rainbow, she said.\nHis impact goes even farther than that, she added.\n\"He's given people the reality check that it's possible to be from Delaware and do something cool,\" she said.\nDemitri Theodoropoulos remembers being 11 or 12 years old, playing baseball on the field Thorogood built.\n\"Every once in a while, he would show up and almost coach us,\" Theodoropoulos said, adding that he didn't realize at the time who he was. \"We had no idea; he was just this guy who showed up.\"\nAs the owner of Wonderland Records, Theodoropoulos certainly knows who Thorogood is now.\n\"That blues-rock crossover, that's kind of where he is,\" he said. \"He's not full-on blues, and he's not pop rock. He's one of the very few crossover musicians. A lot of people learned to play guitar to his albums.\"\nDave Mackenzie, the longtime engineer at the campus radio station WVUD, said Thorogood played several on-air shows to help the station when it was in its early years. He also remembered working sound for one of Thorogood's Deer Park shows in 1978.\n\"It was New Year's Eve, downstairs in the back room,\" Mackenzie said. \"It was loud, and the train came through every now and then. It was a fun night.\"\nBill Stevenson, who ran the legendary Stone Balloon, recalled that when Thorogood was starting out as a solo musician, he wasn't old enough to get into the music venue.\n\"He used to sit out in front on the wall, play his guitar with the guitar case open and make as much as the musicians made,\" Stevenson said.\nWithin a few years, though, Thorogood became a mainstay at the Balloon, playing some 50 shows there.\n\"He made Delaware famous,\" Stevenson said. \"Everyone in the world knows who George Thorogood is. He did a lot of good for the city.\"\nThe fact that Thorogood was a regular at the Balloon helped Stevenson book other prominent acts.\n\"He brought a lot of credibility to the town,\" Stevenson said. \"We had Bruce Springsteen, Metallica. I couldn't have done it without him being from here. I would keep telling everyone back in the '70s and '80s, 'Well, George plays here all the time.'\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to Appetite, \"Social media may implicitly affect our eating behavior by communicating social norms.\" The more people post appealing photos and videos of nostalgic summer drinks, the more consumers are likely to be interested in trying them. Licensed bartender, Michelle Price says, \"There are many reasons why retro cocktails are gaining so much popularity lately. With all the changes in the world, it's comforting to have a cocktail that brings back memories of 'the good old days.' Couple that with the younger drinkers who love to share their food and drinks on social media and try new flavors, retro drinks fit the bill on both counts. They have a great aesthetic and they aren't the same-old same-old flavor profiles either.\"\nAdventurous palatesMillennials and Gen Z are interested in exploring new and unique flavor combinations using retro drinks like fresh squeezed lemonade. The Hartman Group's research shows that more than 32% of Gen Zers surveyed said they love trying new types of cuisines and foods, while 39% say they prefer foods they're familiar with. For millennials, retro drinks might bring back childhood memories. Retro drinks represent a past era that Gen Z can explore creatively and put their own twist on. Using vintage drinks as a base, both generations can add unique ingredients and flavors to create something new and adventurous.\nHow are they making a comeback?Between high-end cocktail bars, home bartending and the resurgence of classic ingredients, nostalgic summer drinks are making a comeback. This trend is fueled by a desire for comforting flavors and a sense of nostalgia.\nHigh-end cocktail barsHigh-end cocktail bars are innovative while respecting tradition. According to The Tasting Alliance, \"Through the application of scientific principles, bartenders manipulate textures and flavors, transforming familiar ingredients into unexpected forms — spherifications that burst in the mouth, foams that enhance aromatics, and gels that concentrate flavors.\" Instead of mass-produced syrups and bitters, they are making their own using fresh ingredients like herbs and spices. They might make a rosemary-infused simple syrup for a fresh take on a mojito, for example.\nBars are also using modern techniques like liquid nitrogen to create new textures and presentations. A classic daiquiri might be transformed into a fluffy foam. They are taking inspiration from the classics and creating an updated drink with modern ingredients, techniques and presentations.\nHome bartendingThe rise of home entertaining and craft cocktail kits is making it easier for people to experiment with retro recipes at home. The Inspired Home Show reported in 2023 that 82% of consumers expect to entertain in their homes at the same or increased frequency in the next year. Craft cocktail kits include pre-measured ingredients and sometimes even include garnishes which makes it easier to create classic cocktails for guests without a well-stocked bar. Oftentimes the kits revolve around a specific theme like the Roaring Twenties or the Mad Men era, which allows people to experiment with retro recipes they may not have heard of before. Some kits include recipe cards with historical information about the drink, which allows people to appreciate the origin of these vintage drinks.\nResurgence of classic ingredientsDistillers are looking through archives and recipe books to recreate forgotten liquors. Some distilleries are also going back to older techniques to create that old-school taste. Instead of large-scale processes, they are using wood-fire stills, special regional grains or open fermentation vats to achieve a more historically accurate flavor profile.\nDistilleries used to rely on local grains, fruits and herbs because it was what was available nearby. Some distillers are going back to that to add a unique twist and to help capture the essence of a particular place that may be associated with a certain liquor. According to Wine Enthusiast, \"Some [distilleries] seek to spotlight homegrown flavors or the impact of terroir; others want to support local businesses; and still others just can't resist experimenting with whatever materials are at hand, even recently emptied barrels.\"\nOther retro revivalsCocktails aren't the only vintage drinks making a comeback. Mocktails and other classic non-alcoholic drinks are also gaining popularity again, often with a modern twist.\nNon-alcoholic drinksDiner staples, such as the chocolate milkshake, are also becoming popular again with gourmet additions. Gourmet versions feature high-quality ice cream, decadent chocolate syrups and playful toppings. Fresh squeezed, homemade lemonade is also gaining popularity as people appreciate the simplicity and health benefits it provides. According to Credence Research, \"the global market for lemonade drinks is expanding largely because of growing public awareness of the negative health impacts of chemically flavored beverages.\"\nMocktailsMany people are focusing more on healthy lifestyles so mocktails are gaining popularity. Mocktails also allow everyone to participate in the social aspects of drinking together, whether they drink alcohol or not. More and more people are cutting back on alcohol or staying sober and mocktails offer a satisfying alternative. A 2021 NielsenIQ omnibus survey showed that \"22% of consumers showed that they were cutting back on consuming alcohol and drinking less.\" Classics like the Shirley Temple and the Roy Rogers are being requested more. Cocktails minus the alcohol like virgin pina coladas and strawberry daiquiri mocktails are also being asked for.\nFinal thoughtsWhether you're seeking a taste of nostalgia ignited by social media trends or your adventurous palate craves a bygone era's cocktails, this summer is the perfect time to raise a glass — or mocktail — to the resurgence of retro drinks, both at home and in high-end bars. These throwback beverages offer a delightful escape, transporting you to a different time and place with every delicious sip.\nHeidi is also a vintage recipe blogger at Real Life of Lulu, where she focuses on recipes that are at least 50 years old, many from her grandparents' kitchens. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They say things like: I'm tired, but grateful. I'm beautiful, and I will die. I'm here- see me. Sometimes I put a twist in my painting, giving my objects a sense of whimsy, making them more provocative and interesting, but never forcing the concept. I like to evoke the idea of something rather than focus on the exactness.\"\nRubin carries on the tradition of teaching/mentoring in the old Dutch Masters tradition of oil painting. His teaching studio, Marc's Art, provides customized group and private painting classes. Along with The Artists' Gallery in Chestertown, Rubin's art may be seen at the Broadmoor Gallery in Colorado Springs, Mary Woemer Fine Arts in West Palm Beach, and his studio in Elmira, New York. Previously, Rubin taught fine art oil painting at Elmira College as an adjunct professor and was an instructor at 171 Cedar Arts Center in Corning, New York\nThe Artists' Gallery invites the public an opening reception for Rubin and exhibit from 5-7:30 p.m. on First Friday, July 5 for light refreshments and to meet the artist.\nRubin's paintings will be featured in The Artists' Gallery throughout the month of July. The Artists' Gallery is located at 239 High Street in Chestertown and is open Tuesday-Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sundays from 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. For more information about The Artists' Gallery, please visit www.theartistsgalleryctown.com or call the gallery at 410-778-2425. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2024-06-28",
    "author": "NIAMBI DAVIS Special to the Bay Times Record Observer / Star Democrat",
    "content": "Stitched together: Old-Fashioned Independence Day Picnic on Saturday, July 6\n\n June 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: NIAMBI DAVIS Special to the Bay Times Record Observer / Star Democrat | Section: Entertainment \n \n 618\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On July 6, the Queen Anne's County Historical Society will host an \"Old-Fashioned Independence Day Picnic\" at Wright's Chance, 119 S. Commerce Street in Centreville. The event will feature s'mores by the fire pit, music by the Chesapeake Bay Community Band, and an opportunity to learn and celebrate the success of Bryan's United Methodist Church to preserve a significant piece of Queen Anne's County history.Chris Pupke, former Queen Anne's Historical Society President, and Kay Brown, Grasonville resident and member of Bryan's United Methodist Church will share church history and good news about the grant awarded to the church by the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture and the Maryland Historical Trust's African American Heritage Preservation Program.\nFor Pupke and Brown, this work grew from their desire to share the story of local United States Colored Troops and African American history in Queen Anne's County. Pupke pored through records of the National Archives, particularly for USCT muster roles and military records. He contacted Drew University's National Methodist Archives and History Center, the Maryland State Archives, and Delaware's Barrett's Chapel. His research led to more than one dated cornerstone, to 200-year-old hand-hewn beams, and \"a tantalizing clue\" from a document that Pupke has yet to find. The historical hint dates the church back to 1800; the land was given to the congregation by the Bryan family, large landowners with holdings that stretched from the location of Bryan's Church over to the Wye River.\nFrom its beginning, Bryan's United Methodist Church has been a focal point of service and community activism. The community hall made the church a place of worship and community gathering. The church was home to a chapter of the Order of The Galilean Fisherman, a mutual aid society based in Baltimore that provided health benefits and funeral costs when insurance was unavailable to African Americans. In 1866, the congregation established a school later replaced by a Rosenwald School.\nFor Brown, the mission began after meeting Pupke. \"After I heard the history of my church and learned of the USCT soldiers, I took a walk in what is practically my backyard. And there they were. I wanted to get the word out to the larger community,\" she recalled. With no experience, she undertook the challenge with Pupke's assistance. \"I was just turning 50 and it was the first time I'd ever written a grant,\" Brown said, recalling the questions that needed answers and the forms to be filled out. \"It was a labor of love and I'm honored to have done it. I still get goosebumps when I think about it. I stand on the shoulders of very strong women — my mother, Barbara Brown who attended the March on Washington; my grandmother Geneva Brown, who was NAACP secretary, and the late Bertha Emory, my godmother and principal of Grasonville Elementary School.\"\nBut Pupke and Brown want more historical recognition for the African American citizens of Queen Anne's County. \"There is no official recognition of our history,\" Brown insists. To her point, Pupke notes that out of the County's 29 state historical markers, only one mentions African Americans in any capacity. \"It's a marker that praises the action of an enslaver who manumitted a number of the enslaved. He deserves some praise for his actions to be sure, but that should not be the only reference to African-American history in Queen Anne's County.\"\nBrown and Pupke's work is part of an ongoing effort to bring to the fore a history that should no longer be hidden or ignored. \"History can weave us together when it's done at its best,\" he believes. \"I hope we can put a stitch in the history of Queen Anne's County that will weave us together. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The summer is just getting underway with schools closed, swimming pools open and just a few more trips to the all-u-can pick strawberry patches.\nAs a child, when we completed picking, loaded up in the back of the pickup farm truck and headed home, we were one sorry looking bunch, clothes wet from the heat, dirty faces and starving.\nAs soon as we hit the yard, we jumped out of the truck, ran to the water hose and soaked ourselves, along with the pigs, cow and any chickens that didn't run.\nEach year, this holiday is dear to my heart, as it was my late mother's birthday. Laura Hudson Hitchens was born in the early morning hours of July 4, 1911 in a farmhouse in the St. Martin's Neck area of Bishopville.\nWe the family would gather on the farm at West Line Road to spend a day celebrating, making homemade ice cream, full course meals, desserts of various cakes and cold slices of watermelon. In later years, it became Family Reunion Day\nFly those American flags to honor the independence of our country and honor those who fought, have fought and are still fighting for our rights.\nSTRAWBERRY SPINACH SALAD\n1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice,3 tbsps honey, 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, 1 tbsp poppy seeds, 2 tsps Dijon mustard, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp ground black pepper, 2 5-oz containers baby spinach, 1 lb strawberries (halved or sliced), 2 oranges (peeled and sliced), 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans (toasted), 4 oz goat cheese (crumbled).\nFor the dressing: In a small jar, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, honey, vinegar, poppy seeds, mustard, salt and pepper. Seal the jar; shake vigorously to combine. Set aside.\nFor the salad: Just before serving, add the spinach to a large bowl or platter; top with half of the strawberries and orange slices. Drizzle with half of the dressing; gently toss to coat. Top the salad with the remaining berries, orange slices, pecans, and goat cheese. Drizzle with your desired amount of the remaining dressing, and serve the remainder on the side, if you like.\nSTRAWBERRY MUFFINS\nNonstick cooking spray, 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup granulated sugar, 2 tsps baking powder, 1/2 tsps baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 3/4 cup melted unsalted butter (cooled), 2 large eggs (room temperature), 1/2 cup plain yogurt (room temperature), 2 tsps vanilla extract, 2 cups chopped strawberries (divided), 1 tbsp sugar.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees. Line muffin pan with paper cups, and spray cups with nonstick cooking spray. Stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Set aside. Whisk together the melted butter, eggs, yogurt and vanilla in a medium bowl. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients; stir together just until combined. Fold in 1 1/2 cups of the strawberries. Batter will be thick. Using a 2 1/4-inch scoop, drop a level scoop of batter into each lined muffin cup. Top scooped batter evenly with the remaining 1/2 cup berries; sprinkle with turbinado sugar if desired.nBake until the tops are golden brown and the wooden pick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes.\nEASY STRAWBERRY PIE\n1 refrigerated pie crust, 1 1/2 qts fresh strawberries (halved), 3/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 3 tbsps corn starch, whipped cream for serving.\nFor the crust: Bake one refrigerated pie crust according to package directions. Let it cool completely. For the strawberry filling: Mash 1 ½ cups the berries with a fork and combine with the sugar, vanilla and ¼ cup water in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a low boil, stirring and mashing frequently, and cook until the fruit begins to soften and break down more, about 5 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and ½ cup water. Stir the cornstarch mixture into the simmering strawberry mixture and return the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from the heat and fold in the remaining fresh strawberries. Immediately transfer the strawberry mixture to the pie crust. Let cool slightly, about 15 minutes, then place in the refrigerator to cool completely, about 4 hours.\nSTRAWBERRY BUTTER\n1/2 cup sliced strawberries, 1 stick softened salted butter.\nCombine strawberries and butter in a food processor. Pulse on and off until the butter is combined. Spread on toasted pound cake or bread.\nGRILLED CHICKEN & STRAWBERRY WRAP\n2 chicken breasts, 1/2 cup balsamic vinaigrette, 1 package (12 oz) mixed salad greens, 12 medium strawberries (hulled and quartered), 4 green onions (sliced), 1/4 cup chopped pecans, 4 oz goat cheese (crumbled), 6 large whole wheat tortillas.\nPlace the chicken breasts in a large plastic storage bag. Seal the bag, leaving a small opening, then use a rolling pin to pound the breasts until they're a uniform thickness. Pour in half the balsamic vinaigrette, then seal the bag and marinate in the fridge for 1 hour. After the chicken has marinated, grill it until it's done in the middle, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly. Dice up the chicken when it's cool enough to handle. Add the salad greens to a large bowl. Add half of the remaining dressing and toss it to coat the greens. Add more if it needs it. Add the strawberries, chicken, green onions and pecans. Toss it gently a few times until it's all combined. Top with crumbled goat cheese and toss a couple of times. Place an equal amount of salad down the middle of each tortilla. Roll up, then slice in half. Serve wraps with chips and extra strawberries.\nSTRAWBERRY BREAKFAST TACOS\n2 tbsps butter, 6 flour tortillas, 1/3 cup cream cheese (softened), 1 tbsp honey, 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/3 cup vanilla yogurt, 1 3/4 cups quartered fresh strawberries.\nIn a large skillet, heat 1 tsp butter over medium-low heat. Add 1 tortilla; cook each side until light golden, 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack. Repeat with remaining butter and tortillas. Beat together cream cheese, honey and cinnamon; slowly mix in yogurt until blended. Spread tortillas with cream cheese mixture, top with strawberries.\nSTRAWBERRY-BANANA BREAD\n¾ cup all-purpose flour, ¾ cup whole-wheat flour, ½ tsp baking powder, ¼ tsp baking soda, ¼ tsp kosher salt, 4 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese (softened), ¼ cup unsalted butter (softened), 3 tbsps canola oil or grapeseed oil, ¾ cup granulated sugar, 1 large egg, ½ tsp vanilla extract, 1 cup mashed ripe banana (about 2 bananas), ¾ cup chopped fresh strawberries.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly coat an 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Whisk all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat cream cheese, butter and oil on medium speed in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sugar; beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in egg and vanilla. With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the flour mixture alternately with banana, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Fold in strawberries. Spoon into the prepared pan. Bake until a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes. (Shield with foil after 45 minutes, if needed, to prevent excessive browning.) Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Remove from the pan and cool completely, about 1 1/2 hours.\nSTRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE COOKIES\nCooking spray, 3/4 cup chopped strawberries, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1/2 cup plus 1 tbsp granulated sugar, 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp kosher salt, 1/2 cup butter softened, 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar, 1 large egg, 1 tsp pure vanilla extract. For the filling: 4 tbsps cream cheese (softened), 3 tbsps powdered sugar, zest of 1 lemon.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper and grease with cooking spray. Make cookie dough: In a small bowl, stir strawberries, lemon juice and 1 tbsp granulated sugar until combined. Let sit for 10 minutes, then drain. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat butter, remaining ½ cup sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla extract, then stir in flour mixture until just combined. Using a wooden spoon, very gently fold in strawberries. Set aside. Filling: Line a large plate or baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, powdered sugar, and lemon zest until smooth. Scoop into 12 small balls (about 1 ½ teaspoons each) and place on a prepared baking sheet. Using a medium cookie scoop, scoop heaping tablespoons of dough (about 24 balls) and flatten into pancake-like circles on the baking sheet. Place cream cheese filling on top of 12 pieces of dough. Place remaining dough on top of filling and pinch edges together. Roll gently into balls. Arrange stuffed cookie dough balls 2 inches apart on baking sheets and bake until cookies are set and just golden around edges, about 18 minutes. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Many wore red, white and blue apparel, festive hats and body paint.\nThe carnival provided countless activities for families to partake in, including ring tosses, water gun race games, slides, high speed rides and plenty of food and sweet treats.\nBrittany Middleton, an attendee, came to the carnival with a group of teens so they could all enjoy the holiday together.\n\"We had a wonderful time; it was great,\" Middleton said. \"What I had the most fun with was watching all the teens have fun and enjoy the rides. It was great just spending quality time together.\"\nMichelle Gallup, a carnival attendee, said it had been about seven years since she had come to watch the fireworks, which rounded out the evening's celebration. She was happy to take the time to go to the carnival and spend time with her friends and family, she said.\nBehind the carnival was a stage and open field for people to bring chairs and blankets to enjoy live music. Throughout the evening, bands played covers of songs by artists like Olivia Rodrigo, The Temptations and Neil Diamond.\nAs the sun set on the warm day, groups of people made their way to the open field to snatch themselves the best spots possible to watch the fireworks.\nWhen the first firework went off, all eyes were on the sky. People clapped and cheered, children stared in awe at the lights and couples across the field held each other closer. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I got to put scrapple in there too.\"\nSugar powder dust came off of the funnel cakes while the condiment bar was buzzing with people adorning their french fries.\nAll the rides were well attended. Kids rode on a fire truck, and teens enjoyed larger rides like \"the Zipper.\"\nThis carnival has been going on for over 50 years.\n\"At one time, the fire company used to own their own rides when it was down in town,\" said Rich Covert, the fire company's president. \"Fifty-one years ago, they made all of their own hamburgers and did their own rides.\"\nThe fundraiser has brought in thousands of dollars to help support the fire company in it's 51-year history. The fire company has had such success with the carnival that it has added a few more annual events to its calendar — including a rodeo, which will take place July 22 and 23, and a tractor pull, which was held in May. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Northern Media group. It was the first time a ceremony was held since the pandemic.\nMeier received awards for \"The Dung Beetles of Liberia\" (Top Honors; 1st Sequel), \"Blood Before Dawn\" (1st Sequel; 1st General Fiction), \"No Birds Sing Here\" (Top Honors; 2nd General Fiction), \"Guidance to Death\" (2-time 1st Genre Based; 1st General Fiction) and \"Bloodroot\" (3-time HM General Fiction).\nHe has worked as a flight instructor, an air taxi pilot and a pilot examiner for the Federal Aviation Administration and for 20 years was an Aviation Safety Inspector.\nHis first novel \"The Dung Beetles of Liberia\" and its sequel \"Blood Before Dawn\" as well as his latest book \"Guidance to Death\" are largely aviation-based.\nHe is currently working on the second book in his Frank Adams Investigator series.\nBookLife said the inaugural Frank Adams book \"is crisp and convincing, and the frozen setting shines as a hostile, miserable place, captured with the touch of hard-edge poetry — like bursts of rain that hit 'the windshield and froze there in hard, flat teardrops' — of Meier at his best.\"\nFor more information on Daniel Meier, go to https://danielmeierauthor.com.\nHow long have you been writing, and how did you get started?\nI have been writing on and off all my life. I majored in history at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, then went on to study American literature at the University of Maryland graduate school. In 1980 I published an action/thriller titled \"Mendoza's Treasure\" under the pen name of Vince Daniels. After seeing the revenue (or lack thereof) from a thriller published by a New York publisher and realizing that they owned all the rights, I decided to find a job within the industry of my other passion in life: Aviation.\nWhat inspires you to write?\nIt's a nice way to be heard. I, like everyone, have certain opinions and beliefs. I can't say that I am cynical, but I have become quite realistic regarding many people's motives and passions. Writing fiction allows me to paint a picture of why people act the way they do and show the consequences. All of my books, I try to point out underlying motives that are usually hidden by a glossy façade.\nWho are some of your favorite authors?\nIn the realm of fiction, I enjoy Saul Bellow, Philip Roth and Bernard Malamud. They certainly do not influence my style of writing, but I do like to look to them as truly fine authors and aspire to their level of expressive thought. As far as my latest genre goes, I have always enjoyed the Inspector Maigret mysteries.\nWhat are you working on now?\nIn my latest book, Frank finds himself traveling to the small town in North Carolina where he grew up (and had vowed never to return) investigating the airplane crash and subsequent death of the local college chemistry professor. It's not what everyone thinks.\nWhat do you want readers to know about you?\nI would like readers to know that I will never lie to them. Fiction is tricky. It's made up, but the messages I send to the reader are straight from the heart, and the research I put into the books is as valid as I can find.\nPlease include a brief description of your book \"Guidance to Death.\"\nIt was cold and rainy, with low visibility. A perfect morning for sabotage. The company jet carrying a Senior VP mysteriously crashes shortly after taking off from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board says it was an accident. The victim's wife says it was murder.\nFrank Adams, an independent aviation accident investigator has been hired to find out. Mounting evidence and an additional murder convinces Adams that there was indeed foul play.\nAs what seemed to be unrelated events become increasingly linked, Frank reveals a crime of international dimensions. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Explore Maryland: Weekend event highlights historic lighthouses\n\n July 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Ted Black tblack@somdnews.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 713\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n This weekend the National Lighthouse Weekend will literally shed the light on buildings that were once at the forefront of shipping destinations along the east coast and lighthouses in Calvert County and St. Mary's County will take center stage among local tourists and history buffs.On Aug. 3 and 4 a quartet of lighthouses — two each in Calvert and St. Mary's counties — be on display for interested onlookers. Both the Cove Point Lighthouse and Drum Point Lighthouse in Calvert and the Piney Point Lighthouse and St. Clement's Island in St. Mary's will offer tourists a genuine chance to take a glimpse into the past.\nOne of the more popular spots in Calvert County, the Cove Point Lighthouse has been restored and re-purposed over the last century and in 1973 it secured its significance when it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior. The restored keeper's house sits on the seven acre spot that is one of the narrowest places on the Chesapeake Bay.\nBuilt nearly 200 years ago in 1828, the Cove Point Lighthouse and adjacent keeper's house were built of locally manufactured brick. Then exactly 100 years later the original kerosene light was converted to electric and the beacon was visible for 12 nautical miles. Then in 1986 the lighthouse was completely automated, including a computer program to monitor operations.\nOwnership of the Cove Point Light Station was eventually transferred from the U.S. Coast Guard to the Calvert County government in September 2000 and two years later the Calvert Marine Museum began offering tours.\nThe refurbished keeper's house can be rented as a vacation home and sleeps up to 16 guests. From May to September, the lighthouse grounds and visitors center are open to the public Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays from 1 to 4 p.m.\nThe Drum Point Lighthouse, now located at the Calvert Marine Museum where it has also since been restored and complete with furnishings from the early 20th century, is described as a screwpile, cottage-type light and is only one of the three remaining from the original 45 such designs that once served the Chesapeake Bay at the start of the 20th century. It was relocated to its present spot in 1975, roughly 15 years after falling prey to vandals.\nIn St. Mary's County, both the Piney Point Lighthouse Museum and St. Clement''s Island Museum will be part of the National Lighthouse Weekend. The Piney Point Lighthouse Museum and Historic Park will open open Aug. 3 and 4 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Guests will have the chance to tour the lighthouse tower and get a glimpse inside the keeper's quarters and learn about the Lightkeeper William Yeatman and his wife's long career of operating the lighthouse for years.\nGuests will also have the chance to visit the Blackistone Lighthouse on St. Clement's Island during the National Lighthouse weekend. Visitors can tour the museum and discovery the history of a landmark that was instrumental in Maryland's history. Admission both days is $7, but it includes a ferry ride to the island.\nIf you goThe annual National Lighthouse weekend will shed some light on a quartet of lighthouses throughout Southern Maryland, two each in Calvert and St. Mary's counties. The Cove Point Lighthouse overlooks the Chesapeake Bay is located at 3500 Lighthouse Blvd. in Lusby.\nThe Drum Point Lighthouse located at the Calvert Marine Museum at 14150 Solomons Island Road in Solomons, features the screwpile, cottage-type light is only one of three remaining among the 45 that once served the Chesapeake Bay at the outset of the 20th century. Decommissioned in 1962, the lighthouse fell victim to vandals then when relocated to its present site in 1975 and has since been restored, complete with furnishings from the early 20th century.\nThe Piney Point Lighthouse Museum, located at 44720 Lighthouse Road, will be host to a free celebration of National Lighthouse Weekend Aug. 3 and 4 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.\nThe St. Clement's Island Museum located at 38370 Point Breeze Road in Coltons Point will showcase the Blackistone Lighthouse Aug. 3 and 4 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., a $7 admission includes museum admission and ferry ride. The state of Maryland traces its roots to the island where this exact replica of the historic lighthouse stands. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tapping away: Author pens children's book using 'early 100-year old Royal typewriter'\n\n July 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 693\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Author David Wright recently published his first book, \"Marty McSwirl,\" through Dorrance Publishing.Wright grew up in Sudbury, Mass., graduated from the Air Force Academy in 2000 and have been serving since. He has flown the F-15, F-22 and A-10 and is currently the deputy commander of the 175th Wing, Maryland Air National Guard.\nHe and his family live in North Beach.\nThe 30-page book retails for $39 — the eBook is $34 — and is available at https://bookstore.dorrancepublishing.com/.\nHow long have you been writing, and how did you get started?It was [Sudbury, Mass.- based Josiah Haynes Elementary School teacher Lee] Jones, my fourth grade and to this day, favorite teacher, who inspired me to be a writer. Despite my rambunctious nature which was not ideally suited to being a student, he managed to tease out a bit of creativity. I must have a penchant for alliterative titles because my favorite project that year was story about a Viking named Pudgy Pinkinson. Yet I think my path was set when Mr. Jones assigned us to create an auto-biography, the last chapter being a prediction of what we would be in the future. In that last chapter I said I would go to the Air Force Academy, become a fighter pilot, and finally become an author. Thus far the first two have come true and I suppose that \"Marty McSwirl\" is the first step towards making the latter come to fruition.\nWhat inspires you to write?My children John, Anna and Andrew and a lone, tired-looking squirrel inspired me to write \"Marty McSwirl.\" Years ago, I had just finished raking leaves and the kiddos immediately began rollicking in the pile, exactly the way kids should. Despite the chaos, a squirrel joined the fray, apparently looking for acorns. I thought to myself, \"He must be a tired dad squirrel gathering food for a big family,\" and thus was born \"Marty McSwirl\".\nDo you consider writing to be a career?Not yet, but like my fourth grade autobiography predicted, I hope it will be one day.\nWhat kind of writing process do you use?I sit down at my grandmother's old roll-top desk, slide a piece of paper into my nearly 100-year old Royal typewriter, and tap away. I started using a typewriter years ago after reading an opinion in the newspaper lamenting the lost art of letter-writing. Sharing an admiration for things that have stood the test of time, I determined to resurrect that lost art, yet my handwriting is terrible. So I bought an old typewriter and now, when I sit down in front of the Royal, I drift away to wherever my imagination leads me.\nHow did you publish your book?\nAfter writing \"Marty McSwirl,\" it lay dormant for years, gathering dust among the pile of unpublished works in a desk drawer. Eventually, I applied for a copyright through the Library of Congress and once granted, a number of publishing companies contacted me asking if I would like to publish. I ended up choosing Dorrance Publishing, who walked me through the project.\nWho are some of your favorite authors and why?Julia Donaldson is the first author who comes to mind. I've been reading to the kids every night since birth and they always responded best to books that told a good story in the form of a poem. When I began writing \"Marty McSwirl\" it was with my kids in mind, hoping to create a book that I could one day read to them before bed.\nWhat are you working on now?I have a few unpublished works ready for an eager illustrator and book agent.\nPlease include a brief description of your bookMarty McSwirl is the tale of a squirrel who invents an acorn harvester with the help of some friends. Their efforts meet with success and Marty decides to share the fruits of his labor with family, friends and neighbors. In essence, the story is a woodland creature Thanksgiving origin story.\nPlease include an excerpt from the book\"When Marty came back with his acorn sack at the end of each long day,\nMrs. McSwirl was there with a hug,\nHis children snuggled upon the rug,\nBut despite all his care, the cupboard lay bare, he must find an easier way.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Fair Food: What in the world are watermelon fries?\n\n July 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1463\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n FAIR HILL — Watermelon fries are like regular fries — in name and shape only.Contrary to what they are called, watermelon fries are not fried (nor baked, broiled, roasted, seared, grilled or cooked in any fashion whatsoever). They are cool to the touch.\nWatermelon fries look like fries because of their finger-like shape and because those strips are served in a little, cardboard basket.\nThose strips, however, are made out of watermelon — not potatoes — and they are dipped into a small container of strawberry yogurt — not ketchup — before every bit. And it's probably not a good idea to shake salt onto watermelon fries (Editor's note: We acknowledge, of course, that there is no accounting for personal preference.)\nIt's also important to note that watermelon fries are pinkish-red in color — not golden, tannish-yellow in hue.\nWith all of that said, the watermelon-fries menu item is an example of some of the interesting food choices offered at the Cecil County Fair, which started on Friday (July 19) and runs through Sunday.\nWatermelon fries is the brainchild of Dan McGrath, who owns and operates the Real Deal food truck. Watermelon fries are sold during the fair at a Real Deal vending tent that is beside the Real Deal food truck.\n\"It's usually hot at the fair, so he was looking for something refreshing and different and came up with watermelon fries. This is the first year,\" outlined North East-area resident Alicia Sipe who, along with her husband, Dan, operated the watermelon fries tent on Wednesday night. \"It's also a healthier alternative to other foods.\"\nWatermelon fries sales have been OK, according to Sipe, who referred to fairgoers in general and opined, \"They don't understand what they are.\"\nGranted, watermelon fries certainly are a tad unusual when compared to the standard fair food, such as thin-crust carnival pizza slices, Italian sausage brimming with fried onions and green peppers on a sub roll, hotdogs, hamburgers, cheesesteaks, funnel cake and ice cream.\nBut watermelon fries, as it turns out, isn't the only food that causes double-takes and even some grinding halts to make inquiries when attendees see the item listed on a vending tent or food truck menu while walking on the fairgrounds.\n\"Yeah, there's some weird stuff out there,\" chuckled Cyn Marie Schafer, whose Cyn Marie Concessions is next to the Real Deal watermelon fries tent.\nNot too far out there, either, geographically speaking.\n\"We have deep-fried pickles,\" Schafer said. \"We make ours with fresh batter and we put a little hot sauce in that batter. We use pickle spears to make ours. We coat the pickle spears in the batter and then deep fry them. Each serving comes with ranch dressing, so you can dip the fried pickle spear in the dressing.\"\nShe acknowledged that fried pickles are nothing new under the sun, before explaining that Cyn Marie Concessions puts its own spin on the culinary creation. \"The fried pickles you get at restaurants are breaded, round pickle chips that are frozen. We make our own fresh batter and the hot sauce in it makes them just a little bit spicy, but not overly.\"\nLooking for something different, Schafer came up with the recipe a few years ago. Schafer admitted that she had some reservations while attempting to create a dish that would appeal to other palates, not necessarily her own.''\n\"I honestly thought it would be gross,\" said Schafer, who was pleasantly surprised with the result.\nThere has been some trial-and-error along the way, according to Schafer, who commented, \"The first couple of years, we tried putting Hershey's chocolate syrup on the fried pickles.\" That sweet option did not attract many followers, though. But that's OK because Cyn Marie Concessions' version of the deep-fried Oreo cookie is quite popular. A deep-fried Oreo cookie was a cutting-edge specialty years ago, but now is pretty common.\n(Schafer owns and operates Cyn Marie Concessions with her husband, Wayne, who also has owned and operated a Pennsylvania-based barbecue catering company called Big Fat Daddy's since 1982.)\nThen there are the hugely-popular loaded baked potatoes sold at the Gifford's Farm stand, which can be found simply by looking for the longest line of customers on the fairgrounds. (Service is swift, and the lines move very fast.)\nSure, loaded baked potatoes can be found at many places in and outside Maryland, even at some fast food restaurants. But they likely pale in comparison to the overstuffed versions made by the Gifford family and their helpers.\nThe baked potatoes used to make the dish are roughly the size of Idaho. (Editor's note: Slight exaggeration there.)\nThe names of the varieties of stuffed baked potatoes include Maryland Loaded and Piggy Potato. For those with an appetite surpassing the satiation that would be provided by the colossal Piggy Potato, there is the Double Piggy Potato. It features melted butter, cheese, pork BBQ, bacon, Old-Bay corn, sour cream and chives. It weighs about 50 pounds. (Editor's note: Another slight exaggeration.)\n\"We've already had one this week, and we're back again,\" said Elkton resident Christy Kluh on Wednesday night as she and her husband, Tom, waited in line at the Gifford's Farm loaded potato stand.\nThere were at least 25 people ahead of them in line, but Tom and Christy were not discouraged as they kept their eyes on the prize.\n\"It moves pretty fast, and it's worth it,\" Kluh said, breaking into a smile.\nKelly Gifford, one of the family members working steadily to serve the crowd, told the Cecil Whig that the stand would go through 120 cases of spuds during the week-long Cecil County Fair, which translates to approximately 5,000 big potatoes. (Sweet potato versions of the loaded potato also are offered.)\nProviding more information to show the briskness of the loaded potato business during the fair, Kelly's sister, Kacey Gifford, reported that the stand was expected to use 600 pounds of sour cream.\nGifford's Farm & Feed on Joseph Biggs Highway (Route 274) near Rising Sun typically sells the loaded baked potatoes for a limited time in the fall, when the farm's beautiful sunflower fields are in bloom, and once again during the annual week-long Cecil County Fair.\nUnlike the Kruhs, North East-area resident Mark Bowers ate his first Gifford's Farm loaded baked potato on Wednesday night, after wondering what all the buzz was about.\n\"I heard about this and had to try it,\" Bowers said, some four or five hearty forkfuls into his Maryland Loaded. \"It's good.\"\nBrian Williams described eating a Gifford's Farm loaded potato as a \"Cecil County Fair rite of passage\" and noted that the loaded baked potato's good reputation precedes it.\n\"I break food down into two categories: Convenience and destination. The Gifford's Farm loaded baked potato is definitely one of those destination foods for the fair or for anywhere. People will travel specifically to get one,\" Williams opined.\nThat is a pretty big compliment, too, because Williams is quite knowledgeable about preparing delicious food that makes customers come back for more. Williams and his wife, Natalie, own and operate the popular CRAVE Eatery in Elkton and the equally-popular CRAVE food truck, which is stationed on the fairgrounds this week, selling its style of smash burgers, tacos and other dishes.\nBeneath a canopy beside that food truck, CRAVE also is selling fresh limeades prepared in an interesting way. Instead of putting the limes in a conventional blender, which typically is powered by electricity and uses metal agitators to break down the limes, Natalie Williams and other servers place the limes into a pneumatic blender, which uses compressed air to do the job.\nGenerally speaking, a conventional blender pulverizes whatever is put into it — limes, in this case — while a pneumatic blender gently presses the limes.\n\"It (the pneumatic blender) presses the lime but doesn't break it down. Breaking it down causes oil and flavor to escape. Pressing the lime keeps the oil and flavor,\" Natalie explained, noting that mashing the limes results in a bolder lime flavor after the juice and pressed limes are mixed with other ingredients, including ice and water, to create the limeade.\nNow back to those watermelon fries or, more specifically, the guy who came up with the idea to make them.\nDan McGrath created watermelon fries so he Real Deal business would have a cool, healthier item on the menu. But make no mistake, the Real Deal food truck sells Italian sausage smothered in fried onions and green peppers and similar foods more in line with typical fair fare.\nReal Deal also sells a pretty interesting dish called The Mac Attack, which is listed on the menu as a \"fair special.\" It features the Real Deal potato stacker topped with nacho cheese, macaroni and cheese, pulled pork and barbecue sauce and, by all accounts, it is quite delicious and super filling.\nThe Mac Attack is hot and gigantic and, compared to watermelon fries, it clearly falls on the other end of the food spectrum. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They are cool to the touch.\nWatermelon fries look like fries because of their finger-like shape and because those strips are served in a little, cardboard basket.\nThose strips, however, are made out of watermelon — not potatoes — and they are dipped into a small container of strawberry yogurt — not ketchup — before every bit. And it's probably not a good idea to shake salt onto watermelon fries.\nIt's also important to note that watermelon fries are pinkish-red in color — not golden, tannish-yellow in hue.\nWith all of that said, the watermelon-fries menu item is an example of some of the interesting food choices offered at the Cecil County Fair, which ran July 29-28.\nWatermelon fries is the brainchild of Dan McGrath, who owns and operates the Real Deal food truck. Watermelon fries are sold during the fair at a Real Deal vending tent that is beside the Real Deal food truck.\n\"It's usually hot at the fair, so he was looking for something refreshing and different and came up with watermelon fries. This is the first year,\" outlined North East-area resident Alicia Sipe who, along with her husband, Dan, operated the watermelon fries tent on Wednesday night. \"It's also a healthier alternative to other foods.\"\nWatermelon fries sales have been OK, according to Sipe, who referred to fairgoers in general and opined, \"They don't understand what they are.\"\nGranted, watermelon fries certainly are a tad unusual when compared to the standard fair food, such as thin-crust carnival pizza slices, Italian sausage brimming with fried onions and green peppers on a sub roll, hotdogs, hamburgers, cheesesteaks, funnel cake and ice cream.\nBut watermelon fries, as it turns out, isn't the only food that causes double-takes and even some grinding halts to make inquiries when attendees see the item listed on a vending tent or food truck menu while walking on the fairgrounds.\n\"Yeah, there's some weird stuff out there,\" chuckled Cyn Marie Schafer, whose Cyn Marie Concessions is next to the Real Deal watermelon fries tent.\nNot too far out there, either, geographically speaking.\n\"We have deep-fried pickles,\" Schafer said. \"We make ours with fresh batter and we put a little hot sauce in that batter. We use pickle spears to make ours. We coat the pickle spears in the batter and then deep fry them. Each serving comes with ranch dressing, so you can dip the fried pickle spear in the dressing.\"\nShe acknowledged that fried pickles are nothing new under the sun, before explaining that Cyn Marie Concessions puts its own spin on the culinary creation. \"The fried pickles you get at restaurants are breaded, round pickle chips that are frozen. We make our own fresh batter and the hot sauce in it makes them just a little bit spicy, but not overly.\"\nLooking for something different, Schafer came up with the recipe a few years ago. Schafer admitted that she had some reservations while attempting to create a dish that would appeal to other palates, not necessarily her own.''\n\"I honestly thought it would be gross,\" said Schafer, who was pleasantly surprised with the result.\nThere has been some trial-and-error along the way, according to Schafer, who commented, \"The first couple of years, we tried putting Hershey's chocolate syrup on the fried pickles.\" That sweet option did not attract many followers, though. But that's OK because Cyn Marie Concessions' version of the deep-fried Oreo cookie is quite popular. A deep-fried Oreo cookie was a cutting-edge specialty years ago, but now is pretty common.\nThen there are the hugely-popular loaded baked potatoes sold at the Gifford's Farm stand, which can be found simply by looking for the longest line of customers on the fairgrounds. Service is swift, and the lines move very fast.\nSure, loaded baked potatoes can be found at many places in and outside Maryland, even at some fast food restaurants. But they pale in comparison to the overstuffed versions made by the Gifford family and their helpers.\nThe baked potatoes used to make the dish are roughly the size of Idaho.\nThe names of the varieties of stuffed baked potatoes include Maryland Loaded and Piggy Potato. For those with an appetite surpassing the satiation that would be provided by the colossal Piggy Potato, there is the Double Piggy Potato. It features melted butter, cheese, pork BBQ, bacon, Old-Bay corn, sour cream and chives. It weighs about 50 pounds ... or so it seems.\n\"We've already had one this week, and we're back again,\" said Elkton resident Christy Kluh on Wednesday night as she and her husband, Tom, waited in line at the Gifford's Farm loaded potato stand.\nThere were at least 25 people ahead of them in line, but Tom and Christy were not discouraged as they kept their eyes on the prize.\n\"It moves pretty fast, and it's worth it,\" Kluh said, breaking into a smile.\nKelly Gifford, one of the family members working steadily to serve the crowd, told the Cecil Whig that the stand would go through 120 cases of spuds during the weeklong Cecil County Fair, which translates to approximately 5,000 big potatoes. Sweet potato versions of the loaded potato also are offered.\nProviding more information to show the briskness of the loaded potato business during the fair, Kelly's sister, Kacey Gifford, reported that the stand was expected to use 600 pounds of sour cream.\nGifford's Farm & Feed on Joseph Biggs Highway (Route 274) near Rising Sun typically sells the loaded baked potatoes for a limited time in the fall, when the farm's beautiful sunflower fields are in bloom, and once again during the annual week-long Cecil County Fair.\nUnlike the Kruhs, North East-area resident Mark Bowers ate his first Gifford's Farm loaded baked potato on Wednesday night, after wondering what all the buzz was about.\n\"I heard about this and had to try it,\" Bowers said, some four or five hearty forkfuls into his Maryland Loaded. \"It's good.\"\nBrian Williams described eating a Gifford's Farm loaded potato as a \"Cecil County Fair rite of passage\" and noted that the loaded baked potato's good reputation precedes it.\n\"I break food down into two categories: Convenience and destination. The Gifford's Farm loaded baked potato is definitely one of those destination foods for the fair or for anywhere. People will travel specifically to get one,\" Williams opined.\nThat is a pretty big compliment, too, because Williams is quite knowledgeable about preparing delicious food that makes customers come back for more. Williams and his wife, Natalie, own and operate the popular CRAVE Eatery in Elkton and the equally-popular CRAVE food truck, which is stationed on the fairgrounds this week, selling its style of smash burgers, tacos and other dishes.\nBeneath a canopy beside that food truck, CRAVE also is selling fresh limeades prepared in an interesting way. Instead of putting the limes in a conventional blender, which typically is powered by electricity and uses metal agitators to break down the limes, Natalie Williams and other servers place the limes into a pneumatic blender, which uses compressed air to do the job.\nGenerally speaking, a conventional blender pulverizes whatever is put into it — limes, in this case — while a pneumatic blender gently presses the limes.\n\"It (the pneumatic blender) presses the lime but doesn't break it down. Breaking it down causes oil and flavor to escape. Pressing the lime keeps the oil and flavor,\" Natalie explained, noting that mashing the limes results in a bolder lime flavor after the juice and pressed limes are mixed with other ingredients, including ice and water, to create the limeade.\nNow back to those watermelon fries or, more specifically, the guy who came up with the idea to make them.\nDan McGrath created watermelon fries so he Real Deal business would have a cool, healthier item on the menu. But make no mistake, the Real Deal food truck sells Italian sausage smothered in fried onions and green peppers and similar foods more in line with typical fair fare.\nReal Deal also sells a pretty interesting dish called The Mac Attack, which is listed on the menu as a \"fair special.\" It features the Real Deal potato stacker topped with nacho cheese, macaroni and cheese, pulled pork and barbecue sauce and, by all accounts, it is quite delicious and super filling.\nThe Mac Attack is hot and gigantic and, compared to watermelon fries, it clearly falls on the other end of the food spectrum. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'New stories, new ideas': Film festival will bring 49 independent short films to Delaware\n\n August 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1716\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n More than a decade after the popular Newark Film Festival ended its seven-year run, a new event is set to bring dozens of independent short films to Main Street.The Newark Independent Film Festival will feature 49 films of all genres during a two-day event at Main Street Movies 5 in Newark Shopping Center on Aug. 9 and 10.\n\"I'm incredibly proud of this lineup. I think there are some ridiculously talented filmmakers that have submitted to this festival,\" organizer Kazy Tauginas said. \"People are going to be really amazed at the quality.\"\nThe festival received submissions from as far away as Germany, and a number of Delaware filmmakers have work included in the festival as well.\nThe films are split into six blocks. Tickets are $15 per block and available online at newarkindependentfilmfestival.com.\n\"Every block is going to take audiences on a bit of a roller coaster,\" Tauginas said. \"You're going to see something that might scare you a little bit, you might see something that makes you laugh, you might see something that just kind of wells up tears in your eyes. It's really just all over the map.\"\nHe said he hopes to give independent filmmakers a way to showcase their talent.\n\"There's a lot of talented people that are good at what they do if they are just given a shot to show it,\" he said. \"I think that's what's so great about the festival, is you're giving a shot to everyone to show their project.\"\nIndependent filmmaking is a grind that Tauginas knows well.\nAn actor and filmmaker himself, he has written and starred in more than 20 independent films, including \"Standing Eight,\" which won awards at film festivals and is now streaming on Amazon Prime. Inspired by Tauginas' mother's fight against lupus, the film is about a boxer who is forced to retire and contend with life outside of the ring after being diagnosed with systemic lupus.\n\"I think independent voices that can be overlooked by studios might have some of the most interesting stories,\" Tauginas said. \"Instead of beating known IPs to death and making multiple sequels and spin-offs, there are independent voices that have new stories, new IPs, new ideas. They're incredibly talented, and they're ready.\"\nA native of Chicago, Tauginas first came to Newark to attend the University of Delaware, which he selected for its figure skating program. After college, he spent four years running the Korner Diner on Main Street.\nHe had always had a love for movies, but it was a chance encounter at the diner that caused him to catch the acting bug. A customer asked to use the diner to film a mock commercial and when one of the actors didn't show up, Tauginas took his place. The customer told him he had a knack for acting, and the seed was planted.\nAfter the diner closed in 2008, Tauginas moved to New York and attended the New York Film Academy. He went on to have an acting career that included guest spots in major television shows like \"Person of Interest,\" \"Blindspot,\" \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,\" \"Turn: Washington's Spies,\" \"Blue Bloods,\" \"The Good Cop\" and \"Sneaky Pete.\" He has also appeared in several movies, including \"The Equalizer 2,\" starring Denzel Washington.\nWhile auditioning for Hollywood roles, he also pursued his own projects.\n\"I've always encouraged my acting brethren, like, hey, you need to wear your producer hat, you need to wear your writer hat,\" he said. \"You have to think about doing things in between the time of when you're actually working.\"\nDuring the pandemic, he moved back to Newark, where he works as a real estate agent and serves on the city's planning commission while still pursuing independent film opportunities.\nThe film festival fulfills a vision Tauginas has had for several years.\n\"What this festival is really all about is celebrating diverse journeys that filmmakers have gone on and diverse stories that they're telling,\" he said. \"And that's why I'm so incredibly proud of our lineup because I feel like there's going to be some thought-provoking films out there, and they're going to hit everyone differently.\"\nAlong with showcasing filmmakers, Tauginas also wants the festival to showcase Newark as a city.\n\"Newark is an ideal place for a film festival. Main Street is almost like a mini Park City,\" he said, referring to the small Utah town that hosts the prestigious Sundance Film Festival.\nMany of the filmmakers and attendees coming into Newark are staying at the new Hyatt Place hotel on Main Street, and Tauginas expects them to patronize local restaurants and bars before and after the shows, providing a boost to businesses during a traditionally slower time of the year.\n\"The accessibility and walkability of the downtown area is really a draw,\" he said. \"If we continue doing this year after year, I think it can be something great for the community.\"\nNewark Independent Film Festival lineup\nBlock 1, Aug. 9, 4 p.m.All Four Won — The troubled lives of four young brothers are put to the test when they become the unexpected new guardians of their baby sister.\nPoker Match — A group of independent intervention agents must operate at Reck's mansion and chaos ensues.\nThe Bottle — A grieving man's life takes an unexpected turn when his message in a bottle receives an odd reply back.\nBeer Can: A Love Story — Dive into the love triangle of the craft beer world.\nShakespeare for All Ages — Shakespeare's works are timeless and this film proves it!\nSandalen mit Socken — A Latin American immigrant in Berlin tries to adapt to German customs and habits.

I thought it would be fun to have them around,\" she said, noting that felt sideburns, goatees and eyebrows of different styles also were inside the bag.\nUnable to resist, Pietro had applied one of those fake mustaches to her face earlier that day before entering a family room where Cooper, Cullen and Kamryn were playing on their electronic devices.\nDeeply immersed in their activities, the boys were oblivious.\n\"I said, 'Is there something on my face? I feel like there is something on my face.' I kept trying to get them to look up from their electronic devices,\" Pietro recalled.\nWhen she asked the question again, the boys looked up and noticed the mustachioed woman in the room.\n\"They put their electronic devices down and started laughing,\" she said.\nWith their electronic devices lying nearby, essentially forgotten by the youngsters, they sampled the assortment of fake facial hairpieces.\nAnd what followed was some old-fashioned fun.\n\"They spent the next 45 minutes getting in front of the mirror and putting on the mustaches and cracking up,\" Pietro said.\nA little bit later, she informed the boys that she was going grocery shopping at Walmart and that they had to accompany her.\nIt's important to note that the boys had been in tow on countless trips to Walmart in the past and that a grocery store is a boring place for a kid, especially on a sunny day amid summer vacation.\nBut it's equally important to note that children are blessed with a sense of wonder. It often enables them to excitedly look forward to something — even a mundane thing like grocery shopping with an adult.\n\"They said, 'Can we wear them in the Walmart?' They were so excited about it,\" Pietro said.\nPietro gave the boys permission.\n\"The pharmacist was the first one who noticed them. We went through the drive-thru because Cullen was asleep at that point,\" Pietro said. \"The pharmacist asked me, 'Do you have some sophisticated, refined gentlemen with you?'\"\nThat playful comment sparked laughter from the boys.\n\"That's exactly what they were looking for — to get noticed,\" Pietro said.\nAnd that was just the beginning. During the shopping trip, several smiling customers noticed the trio of \"sophisticated, refined gentlemen.\"\nAs I had mentioned earlier, I was one of those shoppers who noticed the comically incognito youngsters. I identified myself as a Cecil Whig reporter to Pietro, and then, after receiving her permission, I took photos of the boys.\nI wasn't precisely sure why I felt the need to do so.\nAlthough I'm a little jaded after writing predominantly about crime for the past 40 years, I still sensed in some indescribable way that there was some sort of story there — something bigger than meets the eye, maybe something even magical.\nSearching myself for the answer in the days that followed, I started thinking about when I was a kid, and then it hit me: some of my really good childhood memories aren't linked to major events.\nInstead, the source of some of my fondest childhood recollections are those seemingly trivial pockets of time that materialized out of nothing.\nLike that massive, super fun kick-the-can game beneath the corner streetlight one warm evening when, only an hour or so earlier, no neighborhood kids seemed to be around. And like that bike ride I took with friends in a gentle, steady summer rain while wearing, for no particular reason, dish rags on our heads.\nAnd hopefully Cooper, Cullen and Kamryn will look back someday, decades from now, and smile as they remember that summer day when they were \"sophisticated, refined gentlemen\" in the local Walmart.\nPietro holds that same hope.\n\"Absolutely, this will be a very good memory for them,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There were funnel cakes, grilled hot dogs and quarter games like the dunk tank. This was a family event, and families gathered to take in the festivities.\nJimmy Eason, vice president of Cordova Volunteer Firemen's Association, said the fair is the fire department's biggest fundraiser of the year.\n\"In 2026 the fire company will be celebrating 100 years. The fair — we are going on like 60-something (years),\" he said. \"This is a community event with good cheap food. It is family-oriented. Prices are low. 100% of what is spent on these grounds, stays on these grounds. We have no outside vendors.\"\nThe association has a big expenditure coming next year. They have to buy a new fire engine with a $1-million price tag.\n\"It is nothing extravagant. It is just what we need for the next 30 years,\" Eason said.\nBill Dulin is a trustee and engineer with the association.\n\"Today we are prepping to make this fundraiser a success. We have been at it for a week and a half. The rides are our big draw. The kids like to hear that siren and stuff,\" Dulin said.\nThere were lots of strollers and little kids chasing each other around the grounds.\n\"This is a family thing. People make sure they are not on vacation for this weekend. This is the only time they see some people this year. They are sitting around in lawn chairs. It gets people out,\" Eason said.\nKatie Dulin, president of the fire association, said, \"It is a good time for community. Inexpensive entertainment with the games. We have our Little Miss and Miss Fire Prevention Contests. We have fire truck rides and hay wagon rides. I am here under our recruitment and retention tent in case anyone has interest.\"\nRobert and Barbara Saathoff live so close to the fair that they walked.\n\"We have been here ever since this fair started. We have been married 63 years,\" Barbara said.\nRobert said, \"When I got out of high school in 1958, I went to work for her dad. I got the farmer's daughter.\"\nAround 8 p.m., the excitement for the Little Miss Cordova pageant began to rise. The girls' hair was done up, and their party dresses were just right.\nCourtney Fike, reigning Miss Cordova, was the emcee for the competition. She wore a sash and a tiara.\n\"We are just here to support the girls. I will be asking them questions out of the fishbowl, so they have to think off of their toes,\" Fike said.\nThe winner will be in a lot of parades in the coming year, from Easton, to Preston, to Federalsburg, to Trappe and Ocean City.\n\"I like watching the little girls open up more into it, because a lot of them have never done this before. I did it when I was their age,\" Fike said.\nAfter the contestants had been delivered by a tractor pulled cart with hay bales for seats, they were asked fire-related questions like, \"Do you know your 911 address for an emergency?\"\nThe winner, Aubrie Stichberry, 5, was asked what fire prevention means. She is going into kindergarten at Chapel Elementary.\nShe said leaving the stage, \"I am going to keep my crown on.\"\nThe Cordova Fair continues on Saturday.

    "content": "America's favorite hobbies revealed: Our ten favorite ways to spend free time\n\n August 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Melanie Allen Wealth of Geeks | Section: Entertainment \n \n 836\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Americans spend more than five hours every day on leisure activities and hobbies, ranking second only to sleep in the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2023 time use survey.Though we all love leisure time, we don't spend it the same way. Some pastimes are far more popular than others.\nAmerica's Favorite Hobbies\nA Statista survey of more than 60,000 Americans determined which hobbies we love the most.\nDiscover something new to try as we explore America's favorite pastimes.\nBecause respondents could choose more than one hobby, reported percentages surpassed 100.\nCooking/Baking\nCooking and baking top the list of America's favorite hobbies. Two in five respondents (41%) spend their free time in the kitchen.\nTiffany McCauley of The Gracious Pantry explains why she loves cooking so much. \"Cooking is therapeutic for me,\" she says. \"To be able to tune out the world and all its problems, turn on some music, and just let myself have 30-60 minutes of creativity with my food simply soothes my soul.\"\nMcCauley adds that sampling her creations is an added bonus. \"Ending up with a dish that tastes amazing is a whole new level of comfort on top of the stress relief. The entire process is basically an escape with a delicious finale.\"\nReading\nAmericans love relaxing with a good book — 37% of respondents report reading as a pastime. Good reads come in many forms and can transport audiences to new worlds, educate, motivate, enlighten, and excite.\nReading has immeasurable benefits: it enhances creativity, reduces stress, and provides much-needed stimulation as we age. Additionally, increased internet and library access means reading comes at little to no cost to many.\nPets\nAmericans rank spending time with pets among their favorite hobbies. Around 35% spend free time caring for furry friends. These figures are unsurprising as 95% of pet owners consider their pets family.\nInteracting with animals isn't just a fun hobby; moving and exercising with a pet positively benefits animal and human health and wellness. Animals provide companionship, reduce stress, keep humans active, and stimulate the production of feel-good chemicals like oxytocin.\nVideo Games\nAbout one-third of all Americans unwind with their favorite video games.\nGaming provides a fantastic escape from real life. Players can be the hero one day and an evil villain the next. Some games build critical life skills, like team building, problem-solving, and enhanced focus.\nOutdoor Activities\nMore than 30% of survey respondents said they engage in outdoor activities. In 2019, the National Recreation and Parks Association surveyed people to learn what \"outdoor activities\" they prefer.\nThe survey found that most (58%) consider outdoor gatherings with family and friends — playing games, barbecuing, or having a picnic — their favorite outdoor activity. Nearly half (48%) said they enjoy going to the pool, while 45% reported hiking as their favorite outdoor activity.\nShopping\nNearly one-third of Americans spend their free time shopping.\nCritics may say shopping isn't a hobby, but for many, activities performed to relax count as hobbies, which means shopping fits the bill.\nUnfortunately, unmanaged retail therapy can lead to overspending.\nTraveling\nAround 29% cite travel as their preferred hobby, though this and other more expensive interests would likely attract more people if they weren't as cost-prohibitive. A 2023 travel study says more than 50% of non-travelers report they can't afford to travel or can't take time off work.\nTraveling is a fantastic hobby because it allows us to visit bucket list destinations, learn about different cultures, and experience the world from a fresh perspective.\nArts/Crafts/DIY\nAround 25% of respondents report enjoying arts, crafts, and DIY activities in their free time, such as sewing, woodworking, drawing, painting, and other hands-on tasks.\nPhotography and writing scored high enough to merit their own categories, with 19% of respondents saying they spent time on each activity.\nArts and crafts are ideal hobbies for those with little time, money, or space. Anyone can start drawing with just a pencil and paper, crochet with a needle and yarn, or make paper mâché crafts with old paper and flour.\nSocializing\nFriendships are crucial to health and happiness. Studies show that people with thriving social lives are happier, healthier, and live longer than those who spend time in solitude.\nDespite its importance, only 26% of respondents reported socializing as a hobby.\nBoard Games\nAbout 26% of respondents enjoy playing board games during downtime. Tabletop games span several genres, including traditional offerings like Monopoly, solo games like puzzles, trading card games like Magic: The Gathering, and roleplaying games like Dungeons & Dragons.\nPlaying board games has many benefits, including education, cognitive improvement in older adults, and improvement of ADHD symptoms in children.\nMore Favorite Pastimes\nAmericans enjoy a wide variety of activities. Approximately one-fifth of survey respondents participate in hobbies like gardening, meditation, working on old cars, fitness, photography, and writing.\nHealth Benefits of Hobbies\nEngaging in fulfilling hobbies is crucial to health, happiness, and overall life satisfaction. Many of America's most popular hobbies have well-documented impacts on health and wellness. Hobbies, in general, tend to reduce stress, decrease loneliness, and promote overall well-being.\nThere's no greater time than the present to start a new hobby and inject more happiness into your life.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Young filmmakers find inspiration on the Shore\n\n August 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LISA J. GOTTO Special to the Kent County News | Section: Entertainment \n \n 964\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The picturesque scenic byways, rural farmland, and winding pathways of Kent County have proven to be an advantageous creative backdrop for a pair of young filmmakers who have their sights set on making their mark in the ever-changing landscape of independent filmmaking.Recently, the pair compiled the portfolio of short film projects that they already have under their belts, cut trailers, and built an online home for their production company, Moosehead Pictures, a venture that was two-and-a-half years in the making.\nTheir personal narrative about how they got here, however, winds half-way around the world and back, and may have never turned out to be a story worth telling if not for the pandemic, as Will Freda of Chestertown and Vanessa Grapes, a native of Sterling, Virginia tell it. The couple met while teaching abroad in Thailand on a one-year Fulbright Scholarships prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nNow both in their late 20s, the couple clicked easily over their love of cinema and enjoyed taking in many films together during their time in Thailand. They bonded over their struggle to learn the language and they developed friendships with locals there that they are certain will endure despite the distance.\nDistance would also play a starring role in the relationship at this point, as once their Fulbright year was over, the couple would need to go where their careers were taking them. Will's would take him to China and Vanessa was hired to teach English at the high school level back in Virginia. They committed to making a go of a long-distance relationship, seeing each other whenever their schedules could align.\nWhile Freda was teaching middle school history in China, he learned his twin brother, James, coincidently, was also in China at that time studying for his master's degree. And it would be while the three of them were vacationing in Slovenia that the pandemic broke out and the travel restrictions kicked in. The brothers, unable to get back to Shanghai, returned to the States, and to Maine where James was currently living, and where they both grew up.\nLike many people enduring COVID at the time, it provided them the opportunity to re-examine their lives and re-connect as brothers over aspects of their shared childhoods. Part of that time as teenagers, Will said, was spent spitballing ideas for movie scripts.\n\"I just think it's interesting that COVID is what forced them to be living together and really explore what they wanted out of life,\" Vanessa said.\nThe brothers were all-in and made a commitment to pursue filmmaking, and they founded their company, Moosehead Pictures while riding out the Pandemic in Moosehead Lake, Maine.\nFrom there it has been a whirlwind of learning the industry from square one. Challenges came fast and furiously in the form of learning which cameras worked best for them, the dynamics of shooting in different locations and under varying conditions related to light and surroundings, and the aspects of casting and securing locations for shooting.\nAnd like most independent filmmakers, this team started out on a shoestring using mostly their own money to produce their first short, Jess at Christmastime, which was shot on location in Brooklyn, N.Y. They found that attending independent film festivals was a great way to meet like minds and learn how films were financed. They were also able to tap into some independent filmmaker resources, like the New England Film Industry, to get their first project produced.\nFor that first film, Vanessa said, she played the role of observer and basically helped out with whatever she could on set to support Will in his cinematic efforts. Going forward, she is flexing her artistic and creative muscles for their current project by designing a series of dramatic masks to be worn by some of the lead actors for their first feature film, Sol Sillion, for which they have already shot their \"proof of concept\" scenes.\nWhile they described their first two films as \"a slice of life\" narratives, they are now leaning in and creating what they described as \"elevated\" or \"intellectual\" horror films. The change in direction to the horror genre was a pragmatic one, they said.\n\"There's more money for low-budget horror films than there are for other genres… for whatever reason, horror films get bought a lot for distribution because there's a big audience for them,\" explains Will, who described the feature, Sol Sillion, as a take on Alice in Wonderland.\n\"If Alice walked into a pagan horror film,\" he added.\nThe team hopes to shoot the rest of this project at the end of the year in and around Kent County once they have raised the necessary capital to produce it. They are hopeful their growing body of work will resonate with potential investors in the arts who appreciate the passion and dedication it takes to create these works.\nIn addition to financing, the couple said they are always on the look-out for others who share their passion for film and wish to become part of something unique. Whether they would like to become extras, set-builders, artists, painters, or even dancers, the team is hoping interested local parties will reach out to them via their website.\nMeanwhile, the couple has some short- and long-term goals. This January they will return to the film festival circuit to show the full version of their film short, Rachel in Vacationland. (All of their trailers, including Bug Brain, their first horror film shot on location in Kent County, are available for viewing on moosedeadpictures.com.)\nAnd 'big picture', the couple hopes to one-day return to where it all began, Thailand.\n\"We have a script for a movie that we would like to make in Thailand,\" said Vanessa. \"So, we would like to live in Thailand for a few years filming that, and then settle down somewhere and have kids. So, we have a whole dream.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Cooking like The King\n\n August 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: News \n \n 1178\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Time for my yearly tradition, even though still a sad one.On Aug. 16, 1977, the Rock N' Roll world lost a legend — Elvis Presley. I remember that day as well as I remember the first time I heard his voice at the age of 10.\nMy brother, age 12, and I were sick of Honkytonk music and Boogie Woogie songs. Our older siblings were into those crooners. Our first Elvis experience was in 1954, and the song was \"That's Alright\" followed by \"Heartbreak Hotel.\"\nHe and I would take my sister's transistor radio outside and put on our little show until my sister came home and took her radio back. We had so much fun. We had a dance floor made with wooden chicken coops turned upside down.\nWhen you go to Graceland and take the tour. The kitchen is one of the most popular stops after the Jungle Room. It hasn't been touched since the late '70s and has been recreated the way it was the day Elvis died based on photos taken from the death investigation, right down to the bowls of fruit and veggies that are replaced every few days to keep up the magic.\nOne of the most interesting stories was about the microwave. Elvis had one of the very first microwaves ever produced. He paid around $1,000 for the microwave, which can still be seen in the kitchen to this day.\nAnother story told is how he fell in love with Texas-style food when he was stationed there with the Army. Elvis was drafted in December 1957 and was assigned to the Second Armored Division at Fort Hood for his basic training.\nElvis, who was raised on lower class Mississippi and Memphis food quickly took a liking to the spicy, meaty dishes he was now eating daily. BBQ Pork pizza was one of those dishes, and I'll include that recipe here in this column.\nAs I said above, I have been lucky to go to Memphis and Graceland as well as Sun Records and to stand right in the spot where Elvis recorded \"That's Alright Mama.\" I am thinking about going back in February for my birthday.\nMemphis is such a soulful town that you can't help but bob your head and tap a foot at the sounds of the blues coming out of every door on Beale Street. And the food! On top of the amazing barbecue at Charles Vergos' Rendezvous, there is Gus's World Famous fried chicken, whose fried green tomatoes are out of this world.\nI enjoy Elvis's music as I can associate it with many happy and tragic stages in my own life. Well folks this is my story from my heart. Enjoy today's recipes, which were Elvis's favorites.\nFRIED PEANUT BUTTER AND BANANA SANDWICHESSmear peanut butter on one slice of bread, and on the other slice smear the bread with mashed banana. Put the slices together, smear each outside slice with bacon grease and fry in a hot skillet.\nFRIED DILL PICKLES1 jar (32 oz) whole dill pickles, 1 cup buttermilk, 2 tbsps Louisiana-style hot sauce, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup cornmeal, 2 tbsps garlic salt, 2 tbsps paprika, 1 tbsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp pepper, oil for deep-fat frying, ranch salad dressing.\nDrain pickles, discarding liquid. Cut pickles into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Drain on paper towels; blot with additional paper towels until dry. In a shallow bowl, mix buttermilk and hot sauce. In another shallow bowl, mix flour, cornmeal, garlic salt, paprika, cayenne pepper and pepper. Dip pickles in buttermilk mixture, then in flour mixture. In a Dutch oven, heat one inch of oil to 375 degrees. Working in batches, fry pickles for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with ranch dressing, if desired.\nBBQ PORK PIZZA1 large ready-made pizza base or your favorite pizza dough, 2 cups of your favorite barbecue sauce, 2 tbsps vegetable oil, 1 1/4 pounds boneless pork tenderloin, 4 oz mild cheddar or American cheese (shredded), 10 oz mozzarella cheese (shredded), basil leaves.\nPrepare pizza dough according to the instructions on the package and set aside, or use a ready-made pizza base. Pour the barbecue sauce into a small saucepan and heat gently over medium heat, stirring occasionally.\nIn a medium skillet or frying pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the pork tenderloin and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden, turning to brown evenly. Add about 1/2 cup of the barbecue sauce and cook the pork over medium-low heat, covered, for about 20 minutes. Baste occasionally. Remove from heat and reserve any pan juices.\nPreheat the oven to 500 degrees. Place the prepared pizza base on a baking sheet according to the directions. Spread about 1 cup of the barbecue sauce over the base to within half an inch of the edge. Toss the cheeses together; reserve 1/2 cup. Sprinkle remaining cheese over the base and bake for about 10 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and the crust is golden. While cheese is melting, carve the tenderloin into slices, then shred the slices into thin strips. Remove pizza from the oven and sprinkle pork strips over the cheese. Pour over the remaining sauce and any remaining pan juices. Sprinkle reserved 1/2 cup cheese over top and return pizza to the oven for 5 minutes, until hot and bubbling. Divide into wedges and garnish with basil leave\nHAMBURGER STEAK2 1/2 pounds ground beef, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1/2 cup chopped green pepper, 1 tbsp garlic, 1 tbsp salt, 1 tbsp black pepper, 2 cups mushroom soup, 2 eggs (beaten).\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl mix together ground beef, chopped onions, chopped green pepper, garlic, salt, black pepper, mushroom soup and eggs. Mix well Shape into mini steaks and fry in a skillet with 2 tablespoons Crisco. Cook for about 12 to 15 minutes, making sure steaks are cooked inside well. Drain on paper towels and proceed to make gravy with grease left in the pan.\nELVIS BANANA BREAD2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 4 medium ripe bananas (mashed), 2 large eggs (room temperature), 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter, 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/4 cup canola oil, 2 tsps vanilla extract, 2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk the first six ingredients. In another bowl, whisk bananas, eggs, peanut butter, applesauce, oil and vanilla until blended. Add to flour mixture; stir just until moistened. Fold in chocolate chips. Transfer to three loaf pans coated with cooking spray. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in pans 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool. If you make multiple loaves like Mary Jenkins Langston would make for his plane rides to Las Vegas, you can freeze them and reheat. Securely wrap the cooled loaves and freeze. To use, thaw at room temperature or, if desired, microwave each loaf on high for 60-75 seconds or until heated through. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Couple converts school bus and hits the road\n\n August 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: News \n \n 544\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — It took three years to convert the old diesel school bus into a coastal-chic wandering machine.Now, Easton couple couple Caroline Petosa and Brandon Lund are ready to set off on their adventure.\nThe couple, who used COVID downtime to plan their adventures and renovate their Canadian-made 2004 Blue Bird bus, are scheduled to leave on a cross-country voyage Thursday.\n\"We got the bus on Facebook Marketplace out in Blackwater. That was three years ago,\" Petosa said. \"We knew we both liked to travel a lot. We were stir crazy during COVID, and you really couldn't fly, so how could we travel by land? The dream was born during COVID.\"\nPetosa has spent lots of time on boats and knows about their tiny showers and kitchens. A lot of her design choices keep in mind the economy of space that both a boat and a school bus require.\nThe bus has a shower, a bedroom, a living room and a sumptuous leather driver's chair fit for a king.\nThe design features coastal motifs, including a large blue octopus painted on the outside of the bus. The vehicle has a flowing name that goes with the decor.\n\"Her name is Auwana, which is Hawaiin for wander,\" Petosa said.\nThe 28 years olds both have remote jobs, and they will be taking their two dogs on the road as soon as the renovations are complete.\nLund, who works as an economist for the federal government, is good at working with the mechanics of the old bus. From pulling out rusty tail pipes to installing solar panels on the roof, he can figure it out.\n\"Before I got my bachelors, I was trained in automotive technology. Engines, suspension, brakes and electrical work on a 12 volt system. Carpentry is not my stong suit, but I have come leaps and bounds. There is a huge online presence for schoolies that I have learned from,\" he said.\nOne of the couple's favorite parts of renovating the bus was the two months of demolition. They took everything out, including the bus seats, which they sold on Facebook Marketplace.\nAs one of the final steps towards setting off on their journey, the couple sold their house.\n\"We did it for a little bit. We lived in our house for three years. I am glad we did it, but it is time for something different,\" Petosa said. \"It was too much space. I never went into half the rooms. We don't need to be locked into one spot, especially because we both work remotely.\"\nPetosa took over ownership of online wedding resource My Eastern Shore Wedding. She is an expert at social media, so their upcoming journey will be well-documented.\nThey plan to start out their journey in New England, where they will have six weeks to just explore. Then, over the winter, they will head to the warmth of the Florida Keys. They have two inflatable paddle boards on the bus.\nSome bucket list items include going to Banff, Canada, and Alaska next summer, but they are open to seeing other parts of the country and finding a place they love.\nWhen they are done traveling, they said they have no plans to sell Auwana.\n\"No, probably not,\" Lund said. \"We put too much blood sweat and tears in this thing.\"\nTo follow their adventure, visit auwanabus.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In all, six fireworks shows will be offered with three different local bands providing the musical entertainment on stage from 3 to 8:30 p.m., with the fireworks show lasting from 8:45 to 10:30 p.m. Advertised as a \"rain or shine\" event, severe weather could potentially postpone the event until Sunday evening at 8 p.m.\nBilled as a total adventure for all of your senses, the PyroJam will offer a fireworks competition that is a much more difficult chore than the average Independence Day fireworks show that onlookers are accustomed to witnessing at ball parks and other outdoor venues. PyroJam organizer Tim Jameson noted the response from the two previous shows at Jefferson Patterson Park was so overwhelming that tickets for this year's event have been selling rapidly.\n\"The first two years went very well and this one is on pace to be even more popular than they were,\" Jameson said. \"The competition is going to be tremendous. We have over 120 specialists from nearly 30 countries competing for spots in the final. There are three shows that make up the competition then the judges will determine the top three finalists for the grand finale, which promises to be even bigger than any July Fourth show anyone has seen.\"\nGates open at 2:30 p.m. and three musical groups will take the stage for performances beginning at 3. Loose Change will perform first, followed by Blair's West at 4:45 p.m. then First To Eleven at 7 p.m. The National Anthem will be performed at 8:30 p.m., followed by an appetizing opening fireworks display at 8:45 p.m. that will give onlookers a mild glimpse of what to expect in the main event.\nIn essence, the fireworks show is divided into three competitions for spots in the grand finale, with the first show getting under way at 9 p.m., followed by the second show at 9:20 p.m. and the third at 9:40 p.m. A panel of judges will select the top three performers based on various criteria and the finale at 10 p.m. is provide to take onlookers on an emotional roller coaster courtesy of the musical accompaniment to the numerous fireworks on display.\nGeneral admission parking is free, but there is a preferred parking option of $30 for those want to park close and be among the first to leave the venue. Organizers have noted on their website that all parking areas are within 2-6 minutes of the event.\nIf you go\nThe PyroJam musical and fireworks show is set for this Saturday, Aug. 24, from 3 to 10:30 pm. at Jefferson Patterson Park and Museum, located at 10515 Mackall Road in St. Leonard. In all, there will be a total of six fireworks shows starting at 8:30 p.m., with music provided by three local bands.

    "content": "Pirates and Wenches festival raids Rock Hall\n\n August 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 884\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ROCK HALL — Rowdy pirates and wenches from Baltimore, Pennsylvania, even Florida, in true buccaneer fashion, braved Tropical Storm Debby last weekend to travel to Rock Hall.Along Main Street, Sharp Street, Ferry Park Beach, Watermen's Crab House and several other places in town, the 17th annual Pirates and Wenches Festival took place; with record attendance that's hard to guess since they arrive by car or boat from all directions, according to organizer Laurie Walters of Main Street Rock Hall.\nWalters said she was happy with the turnout, and although there were some slip and room cancellations earlier in the week, that provided opportunity for others.\n\"Many others were happy to join us for what ended up being one of the most beautiful weekends of the summer,\" she said.\nPirates and Wenches weekend was the original idea of this year's co-organizer, Suzanne Einstein.\n\"We came up with the idea while at Waterman's Crab House on Halloween after seeing so many people dressed up as pirates! We thought, how fun would it be to have a Caribbean style party on our public beach, a decorated dinghy flotilla in the harbor, and a Buccaneer's Ball! It was clear to us that our little waterfront town on the Chesapeake was the perfect location to host such an event!\"\nShe added, \"we didn't know it then, but we built it and they came!\"\nThey sure did. On a drizzly Friday night, full of uncertainty of the weather the next day, they came anyway. Hats, swords, buckles, boots, frayed dresses and an attitude of fun in mind.\nAt the Haven Harbor South marina at the Admiral's Beachside Bar, there were $30 tastings with live music, while the Bay Ghost tours took strangers to the haunted sites around town.\nAt the American Legion, battle-weary scalawags sang along with one-eyed Mike and the Bedlam Bones.\nSaturday's events turned out to be blessed by sunshine, announced by cannons shot off in the woods by the Skullduggery Crew based out of Baltimore. The group not only came to Rock Hall, but stayed two days in tents, truly roughing it.\nAlong Sharp Street, people could meet a mermaid, or a mer-man, depending on the time, and could be regaled with music from the sea.\nOn the Sharp Street stage, musicians sung tunes about travel, like the Hipwrecks singing an old sea-shanty.\n\"Rolling down to old Maui. We're homeward bound from the Arctic ground,\" they sang.\nAnd about revenge, as performed by The Brigands.\n\"Find him, bind him. Tie him to a pole and break his fingers to splinters! Drag him to a hole until he wakes up.\"\nThe audience sang and clapped along in merriment.\nKids had plenty to do. On Main Street, they were drawn to the HoCo Pirate Adventure Treasure trail to partake in a treasure hunt that encompassed the entire festival. Fortune's Folly Pirate Show had kids laughing and jumping while the lovable character Israel Scoop lit off his cannon.\nOver yonder, near the real cannons, local-pirate children could try to dunk Kent County Middle School Principal Mark Buckel, or around noon, that conniving Mayor James Cook, into the drink, with the toss of a ball.\nPirates and wenches could seek sustenance with vendors like Cousins Main Lobster, Carribean Delight and BBQ Bueno.\nResidents could talk to artisans, who crafted nifty items out of sea shells, or offer face painting for kids, or body jewelry, or creators sharing their fantasy novel featuring Rock Hall or comic book based on time-travel and piracy.\nThe beach was alive, too, with a party, to the tunes of Jah People playing island jams. Neighbors went all out, presenting a Pirate Christmas lawn display, as youths frolicked in the waters under a blue sky.\nSaturday night the party was still in full swing. Watermen, pirates and wenches, dressed in their finery at Watermen's Crab House. A fun time was had with music by Wheel House, a Treasure Chest raffle, King and Queen Costume Contest, and a Graybeard Lookalike Contest.\nOn top of all that at the festivities there were jugglers, a woman on stilts with chicken feet and plenty of places to purchase pirate-related memorabilia. One person described it as a Renaissance Fair, just with pirates.\nThey were friendly pirates and wenches too, with tips on health and travel, and talking to some of them, you get a sense that being a pirate for them is not just a once-a-year affair. That was true of the vendor who goes by the affectionate name of Thudd, and whose brother named Jackal was bellowing one-liners next to the mermaid tank.\nThudd sees this event as a homecoming of like-minded friends and a way to create relationships with Rock Hall locals. He said that a neighbor even brought him a delicious carrot cake.\nHe's been coming here, peddling his wares of swords and other merchandise for 19 years and is impressed at the progress of the festival and the camaraderie found in Rock Hall.\nHigh praise from Thudd, indeed.\nWalters, looking back, says that the event has not as much grown as evolved.\n\"The past several years have seen us pivoting to promoting more family friendly activities and entertainment.\"\nCONTEST RESULTS\nFestoon Your Fort (house decorating)\nFirst place: Joe Monroe and family, Beach Road, Christmas-themed pirates.\nSecond place: Brooke Lasser, 21104 Sharp St., giant pirates and a shark.\nThird place: Tim and Aline Cullis 5754 Beach Road, pirate wedding.\nTreasure Chest Raffle Winners\nTracy ThomasCapt.

A bona fide traveling entertainer, Trae has been touring North America in a minivan since high school, learning to put on the show nobody knew they needed. He pulls inspiration from legendary storytellers such as Bob Dylan, the Eagles, and Randy Newman to form his unique songwriting palette and deliver a sound that can only come from the deep roots of an old West Virginia soul. A homebody at heart, Trae spends his time off of the road writing and recording in his attic studio or singing on the roof.\nTommy Dorsey Orchestra\nAugust 23\nDoors: 6:30 p.m.; Show: 7 p.m.\nAvalon Theatre\nIn Big Band history, the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra is recognized as one of the best all-around dance bands. It could swing with the best of them, and no other band could come close to Dorsey's when it came to playing ballads. Considered \"The Sentimental Gentleman of Swing\", Dorsey was a master at creating warm, sentimental, and always musical moods — at superb dancing and listening tempos. He sustained these moods through the arrangements of the likes of Paul Weston, Axel Stordahl and Sy Oliver, and he showcased singers like Frank Sinatra who could project them brilliantly. Dorsey's legacy continues today under Jeff Bush's leadership as the orchestra's Music Director. Jeff joined the band in 2000 when trombone legend Buddy Murrow was conductor, often playing many of the great Tommy Dorsey solos and fronting the band on occasion in Buddy's absence. After taking a break to begin graduate work at The Manhattan School of Music, Jeff has returned to lead one of the greatest big bands of all-time. https://www.tommydorseyorchestra.net\nTrio Music: Apart and Together with Quinn Parsley, Nevin Dawson, and Ashley Watkins\nAugust 30\nDoors: 6:30 p.m.; Show: 7 p.m.\nStoltz Listening Room\nDon't miss this eclectic summer's evening of music in the Stoltz highlighting three of the best musicians on the Eastern Shore today!

Building on the memorable themes of \"Rhapsody in Blue,\" Dominick Farinacci and his band will present a new interpretation of Gershwin's iconic work, supported by an incredible cast of jazz musicians spanning three generations. Farinacci's rendition of \"Rhapsody's\" ballad theme has captivated listeners, amassing over 3 million streams on Spotify. In addition to \"Rhapsody in Blue\", the concert will feature other beloved Gershwin classics and selections from his era, offering a rich and vibrant musical journey. https://www.dominickfarinacci.com/\nJake Shimabukuro\nSeptember 6\nDoors 6:30 p.m.; Show: 7 p.m.\nAvalon Theatre\nBy now, if you know the 'ukulele, you might know the name, the innovator who is Jake Shimabukuro. He has captivated audiences around the world with his unique and dynamic style. With his mother as his first teacher of the instrument, Jake embraced a deep love and respect for the 'ukulele and has explored new and unexpected ways to push the boundaries of what was possible on the humble four-strings. Each album has showcased his mastery of the instrument and his ability to weave together diverse genres to create a cohesive and captivating musical experience. Enter his newest, and most personal album yet. \"Grateful\" is a coming home for Jake. With a literal who's who of Hawai'i-based musicians, this collection of songs is performed live, in-studio with Jake's friends, contemporaries, mentors, and heroes — all kanikapila-style in a return to his roots. \"Grateful\" is the follow-up to his critically acclaimed duets album with artists ranging from Willie Nelson, Ziggy Marley and Bette Midler to Jimmy Buffett, Jack Johnson and Kenny Loggins.\nHugh Ellis Bennett\nSeptember 6,\nDoors: 7:30 p.m.; Show: 8 p.m.\nStoltz Listening Room\nNorth Carolina-based singer-songwriter Hugh Ellis Bennett improvises an indie/progressive bluegrass/folk sound through flatpicking and vocal melodies. The heartfelt musical style that results during Bennett's shows can't help but pull people together, despite their similarities or differences. Starting with a simple philosophy that assumes from dust to dust, we are all the same, Bennett sees his music acting as a thread that helps to hold us together and remind us of that crucial point in a world that seems to have forgotten it.\nCaleb Stine\nSeptember 12\nDoors: 6:30 p.m.; Show: 7 p.m.\nStoltz Listening Room\nCaleb Stine is a singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and visual artist. Though he makes his living as a folk musician, Stine wouldn't call what he does a job; he considers it a calling. His work is part-mystic poet, part-traveling preacher. As Americana UK observed, \"Stine's upfront personality [is] seeking to make a personal connection with everyone in the venue.\" The albums and shows are the tip of the iceberg; to get to where he is today, Stine has put in decades of daily practice, day jobs, and deep commitment to the craft of music. \"There's an element of endurance to almost everything I do,\" says Stine, who plays 100+ shows a year, has released 14 albums of original music, and shares a series of viral Instagram videos called \"Caleb Stine Says Keep Going,\" encouraging followers to dig deep into a creative practice of their own. It's his love of music that shines through his shows, imbuing them with a communal joy that spans generations and celebrates life at its most essential. https://calebstine.com/\nJames McMurtry with BettySoo\nSeptember 13\nDoors: 6:30 p.m.; Show: 7 p.m.\nAvalon Theatre\n\"The simple fact is that James McMurtry may be the truest, fiercest songwriter of his generation...\" Stephen King in Entertainment Weekly James McMurtry, the acclaimed singer, songwriter, and guitarist, began his interest in music at the age of seven when his father, novelist Larry McMurtry, gave him his first guitar. McMurtry's mother, an English professor, taught him how to play it. \"My mother taught me three chords,\" he recalls, \"and the rest I just stole as I went along. I learned everything by ear or by watching people.\" After 20 years in rock, folk, and Americana, McMurtry's most recent effort, \"The Horses and the Hounds\" (2021), backs personal narratives with effortless elegance and endless energy. The collection, which McMurtry says has \"the ghost of Warren Zevon stomping around among the guitar tracks,\" spotlights a seasoned tunesmith in peak form as he turns toward reflection and revelation. He will be joined on the Avalon stage by Betty Soo, a world-class vocalist who \"may well have the most gorgeous voice in Texas …if not in all contemporary folk — its purity and strength can be downright devastating.\" (Acoustic Guitar) https://www.jamesmcmurtry.com/ https://bettysoo.com/\nComedy @ the Stoltz with Jared Stern\nSeptember 14\nTwo Shows — Doors: 6:30 p.m.; Show: 7 p.m. Doors: 9 p.m.; Show: 9:30 p.m.\nStoltz Listening Room\nHeadliner Jared Stern has been making complete strangers laugh at him for twenty years and counting.

Other comedy shows where he has performed include the 2017 What A Joke Fest, the 2018 LaughFest, and the 2019 Oak City Comedy Festival. The Stoltz show, which also features Baltimore comic Jim Meyer, is hosted by Ryan Finch. https://jaredstern.com/\nBombadil \"Dancing in Color\"\nSeptember 18\nDoors: 6:30 p.m.; Show: 7 p.m.\nAvalon Theatre\nIn this collaboration between the folk-pop band Bombadil and contemporary dancer Madison Rivis, Madison has choreographed movements for herself and the band using their latest album \"In Color\" as inspiration.

    "content": "'They Live': A cult favorite alien invasion movie unlike any other\n\n August 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Richard Chachowsk Wealth of Geeks | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1592\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n John Carpenter is a man of many creative talents. A prolific filmmaker, a proficient composer, and an occasional actor, Carpenter has earned avid acclaim as one of the most lauded directors of the 1980s. Graduating from an indie background with projects like Dark Star and Assault on Precinct 13, Carpenter gained a newfound level of attention with his revolutionary 1978 slasher film, Halloween.From there, the cult filmmaker only enjoyed increased popularity throughout the remainder of the decade, culminating in fan-favorite movies like The Thing, Escape from New York, Big Trouble in Little China, and The Fog, among many others.\nNestled somewhere in the middle of Carpenter's sprawling filmography is a 1988 oddity by the name of They Live. A rip-roaring sci-fi comedy with an endearing message behind it, They Live might not be the first movie people think of when they hear Carpenter's name, but rest assured, it's assuredly among his finest films.\nOverarchingly comical yet also surprisingly thought-provoking in its thematic subjects, T hey Live is a masterclass in science fiction subtly wrapped around an over-the-top '80s movie. Without it, who knows what the current state of sci-fi might even be, with They Live helping to lay the groundwork for such later classics as The Matrix years down the line.\nWhat Is 'They Live' About?Set against the hustle and bustle of downtown Los Angeles, They Live tells the story of the ambiguously-named Nada (Roddy Piper), an unemployed drifter struggling to find work in La La Land. As he wanders in search of employment, Nada soon comes across a mysterious pair of sunglasses that allow him to see an alternative version of his surroundings. Presented through crisp black-and-white visuals, this alternative reality offers a glimpse into the world as it truly is: a hellish dystopia where alien invaders have successfully conquered humanity.\nDisguising themselves as average people living amongst us, these sinister alien overlords have managed to avoid detection by carefully constructing a reality for their hapless human adversaries. Distracting humankind long enough to transform Earth into the suitable living environment, these aliens hide behind their meticulous-curated reality when it comes to battling humans, using mass deception as their primary means of conquest.\nA film that in many ways could have only been made in the '80s, They Live was very much a product of its time. Designed as a satirical treatment of '80s-era classism and socioeconomic policies, Carpenter provided a damning portrait of social phenomena that was only just starting to gain traction in American culture, including mass consumerism, corporate greed, and Americans' growing obsession with material goods. Of course, Carpenter never tips his hand too much when it comes to his thematic subjects, balancing out his topical motifs with cliched action, kitschy humor, and enough '80s one-liners to fill the script for an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.\nBetween the witty one-liners and extensive action, Carpenter might have assumed he had a hit on his hands when the movie hit theaters in the fall of 1988. Unfortunately, most critics and casual viewers lambasted They Live for its attempts at social commentary, along with its tough-talking dialogue and equally ham-fisted acting.\nA critical failure that quickly faded into the pop culture zeitgeist, They Live 's esteem would only grow more favorable over time, contributing to its continued cult status today.\nAt the time, it's fair to say that most people simply didn't know what to make of a film as delightfully strange as They Live. After all, how many movies have a powerful critique of '80s capitalism and a comically drawn-out brawl that lasts a whopping six and a half minutes?\nIt's more than likely that the movie's satirical elements were simply too ahead of its day and age. In the decades since, contemporary viewers have hailed the film as a brilliant takedown of '80s consumer culture, as well as the ever-widening disparity between the wealthy elite and the lower-income working class. Yet, for all its social critiques, it's hard to take any movie seriously that includes Roddy Piper saying, \"Mama don't like tattletales\" with a straight face.\nHow 'They Live' Subverts the Standard Alien Invasion PremiseIn more recent decades, more appreciative viewers continue to praise They Live for its effective satirical undertones. Perhaps most famously, the film has directly influenced the widely known Andre the Giant Has a Posse campaign — a street art movement that uses the movie's line \"Obey\" as its foremost rallying crew. Shepard Fairey, the creator of the campaign, has even gone on record to say of They Live, \"The movie has a very strong message about the power of commercialism and the way that people are manipulated by advertising.\"\nAs profound They Live 's attack on the capitalist system is, it's also worth mentioning the movie's radical take on the stereotypical alien invasion vehicle. In the decades prior, most sci-fi films featured a more outright depiction of alien attacks, with our extraterrestrial nemeses using technologically advanced weaponry and military superiority to bend humanity to its will. In They Live, Carpenter trades in unique gadgetry for a far more insidious contraption: mass manipulation.\nRather than relying on ray guns and deadly lasers to subdue humankind, They Live 's alien adversaries employ mass media, advertisements, and material possessions to lull humans into a more docile state. Controlling us through subliminal messages that encourage everyone to \"consume,\" \"conform,\" \"reproduce,\" and — most importantly — \"obey,\" these aliens have learned that it's far easier to trick humans than it is to face them in a physical conflict.\nAs a result, Carpenter paints these alien overlords as the secret society controlling our every thought, turning the greatest aspects of our society (wealth, entertainment, and fulfilling careers) against us.\nHow 'They Live' Forever Changed Science FictionThrough this new, subtler depiction of an alien invasion, Carpenter managed to add a fresh new spin on age-old story concept in science fiction. Sure, movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers had pioneered the idea of disguised aliens living among us, but Carpenter took that idea one step further. Rather than aliens replacing us outright, Carpenter wondered aloud whether those same aliens could manipulate us into becoming our own worst enemies.\nLulled into a false sense of security through careful manipulation and rampant consumerism, They Live 's alien invasion succeeds because humanity wants to be tricked. So long as we're free to acquire wealth, power, and the pursuit of individual happiness, why should we care about aliens exploiting us for their own gain? I mean, let's be honest, doesn't that essentially describe the average American workplace?\nIt was a bold concept that proved somewhat too sardonic and cynical for the happy-go-lucky days of Ronald Reagan's America. Yet it's for this very reason that They Live remains every bit as enjoyable now as it did three decades ago.\nMixing humor and action together with some ever-present topical discussions, Carpenter offered a far different kind of alien invasion than audiences had ever seen before. While viewers at the time might not have appreciated it, the themes examined in the film ended up resonating with viewers in each subsequent decade, stylistically informing later films like 1999's The Matrix.\nOn the surface, it's hard to see any similarity at all between the Wachowskis' original Matrix film and Carpenter's work on They Live. In the case of the former, the Wachowskis dovetailed classic kung fu action with a rogue A.I. unit as sinister and omnipresent as Terminator 's Skynet. With the latter, Carpenter used tongue-in-cheek comedy and outlandish action to lampoon the traditional alien invasion film. Only when you examine each movie more closely do the resemblances start to emerge (not unlike Nada's first glimpse at the monochrome world beyond our own).\nThe Matrix tells the story of Keanu Reeve's Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer by day and hacker extraordinaire by night. Using the criminal alias \"Neo,\" Anderson uncovers the dark secret surrounding the seemingly ordinary world around him: that it is, in fact, a hyper realistic construct created by machines to keep humans at bay. Awakening from this artificial reality, Neo joins a group of resistance fighters attempting to destroy their robotic counterparts, freeing humanity from the yoke of their oppressors.\nAgain, it's difficult to see the similarities between The Matrix and They Live, but they are indeed present. Like the alien antagonists in They Live, The Matrix 's machines rely on a carefully-curated depiction of reality to subdue humankind, distracting us with our seemingly mundane surroundings as they use us as a literal power source.\nUsing deception and manipulation in lieu of outright violence, The Matrix 's antagonists need humanity to believe in the Matrix to ensure their survival — an attribute shared by the conniving aliens in They Live. In the case of each film, The Matrix and They Live even recruit human collaborators to their cause, promising them a chance for a heightened version of their artificial reality. (In the case of The Matrix, said collaborator takes the form of Cyrus, while in They Live, it's Holly.)\nWhile it's highly unlikely the Wachowskis looked to They Live as its primary source of inspiration, the influences are certainly ingrained in the film, nestled alongside the repeated references to Ghost in the Shell, Akira, and the filmography of Bruce Lee.\nThey Live might veer towards political satire and The Matrix might opt for more an existential approach, but the core ideas are the same in each film. For this reason alone, They Live would be worth remembering. On the other hand, admiring its narrative influence on The Matrix is just one more reason to love this under-appreciated 1988 action comedy, along with its effective humor, satisfying performances, and Carpenter's characteristically vibrant imagination. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2024-08-28",
    "author": "Ted Olson The Conversation",
    "content": "The real 'Big Bang' of country music: How Vernon Dalhart's 1924 breakthrough recordings launched a genre\n\n August 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Ted Olson The Conversation | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1259\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Country music's origin story has been heavily influenced by a romanticized notion of authenticity. Today, celebrations of the genre's origins tend to focus on one event: recording sessions in late July and early August 1927 in the small Appalachian city of Bristol, located on the Tennessee-Virginia border.The musicians were working-class Southerners, and depictions of the sessions often portray a savvy record company producer discovering talented but unknown performers.\nHowever, a recording session three years earlier, on Aug. 13, 1924, has a stronger claim to launching country music as a genre. That session instead featured a classically trained singer living in New York City who had previously recorded opera, pop and jazz.\nA legendary recording sessionIn the early 1920s, after years of catering to urban middle- and upper-class listeners — and with emerging competition from radio — recording companies were seeking new markets. They found potential new audiences in Black people craving performances by Black entertainers, as well as among rural white people yearning to hear music that reflected their own tastes and experiences.\nAfter attempting to satisfy these new markets with records made in established Northern studios, recording companies soon determined that it would be easier to discover new talent by recording \"in the field\" — that is, closer to where the audiences for the new records lived. Many of these commercial \"location sessions\" — to differentiate such sessions from noncommercial documentary recording by John and Alan Lomax and other folklorists — occurred in the South.\nAt a June 1923 location session in Atlanta, OKeh Records producer Ralph Peer recorded two performances by a musician from the north Georgia hills named Fiddlin' John Carson. That 78 rpm release quickly sold out its pressing of 500 copies, demonstrating country music's commercial potential.\nPeer moved on to work for Victor Records and produced the Bristol recording sessions. Among the musicians Peer recorded there were newcomers Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family. The so-called \"Bristol Sessions\" generated modest sales and didn't outperform other Appalachian sessions of the late 1920s.\nBut when the Great Depression slowed record sales and dimmed the record industry's spirit of experimentation, Rodgers — later nicknamed \"the Father of Country Music\" — and the Carters, who became known as \"the First Family of Country Music,\" continued to issue new releases. Because of the enduring influence of these two recording artists, scholar Nolan Porterfield dubbed the Bristol Sessions \"the Big Bang of Country Music\" in 1988.\nThe city of Bristol has promoted itself as \"the Birthplace of Country Music.\" The Bristol story has become the mainstream country music origin story, inspiring the Smithsonian-affiliated Birthplace of Country Music museum.\nCountry boy turned city slicker\nMore recently, though, that story has been reexamined by several music historians, including Porterfield, who in 2015 retracted the sobriquethe had coined.\nThe Bristol-centered origin story denies earlier — but no less vital — contributions to the genre by such pioneering recording artists as Carson, Uncle Dave Macon, Riley Puckett, Frank Hutchison and Vernon Dalhart.\nIndeed, if any artist should be considered as having proved the commercial viability of country music, it is Dalhart. Born Marion Try Slaughter II in Jefferson, Texas, on April 6, 1883, Dalhart grew up singing for family and neighbors in his East Texas hometown. Vernon Dalhart is a pseudonym derived from the names of two Texas towns near where he had worked as a summertime ranch hand during his youth.\nDalhart moved to New York City in 1907, hoping to pursue a career as a grand opera vocalist. He had taken vocal lessons at the Dallas Conservatory of Music before leaving Texas, and, once in New York, he continued his music studies with opera instructor Isador Luckstone. For several years, Dalhart toured nationally with light opera productions.\nAfter 1916, in part to remain closer to some family members who lived near New York City, Dalhart concentrated on a recording career, making light opera, pop and jazz records in a succession of New York City-area studios, including Edison Records, where he was reportedly one of Thomas Edison's favorite singers.\nBy the early 1920s, Dalhart was struggling for recording opportunities. Never realizing his aspiration to be received as a serious opera singer — and no longer touring for light opera shows — Dalhart had been relying on recording for his primary income. But he had failed to carve out a distinctive sound and personality to set him apart in the pop and jazz worlds.\nThen, on Aug. 13, 1924, Dalhart stumbled on a new path forward. On that day he recorded two songs for the brand-new, not-yet-named country music market: \"The Wreck of the Old 97\" and \"The Prisoner's Song.\" Victor released the two songs on a 78 rpm disc.\nCountry music's first big hitVirginia musician Henry Whitter had recorded \"The Wreck of the Old 97\" under a different title a few months earlier, to little fanfare. Thinking he could improve upon Whitter's recording, Dalhart covered this Appalachian ballad about a 1903 train wreck, and while he misinterpreted some of Whitter's lyrics, Dalhart introduced this now well-known narrative song to countless people beyond the mountains.\n\"The Prisoner's Song\" was the real revelation of this session. It was the perfect template for country music's enduring tradition of songs evoking love and unrequited love. Claiming that the song was composed by his cousin Guy Massey, Dalhart received a share of publishing royalties. The song ultimately brought Dalhart fame and a modicum of wealth.\nIn an era before records were played on radio, this release became country music's first major hit, selling an estimated 7 million copies (the first recording and subsequent versions combined) from 1924 to 1934 and an additional million copies as sheet music. Both of Dalhart's breakthrough recordings on Victor are enshrined in the Grammy Hall of Fame.\nBy the time of the Bristol Sessions, Dalhart had already recorded hundreds of country songs for dozens of companies, and a number of Dalhart's records had become widely popular, including \"The Death of Floyd Collins,\" a 1925 song about an explorer who had perished in a Kentucky cave; the 1927 smash hit \"Lindbergh (The Eagle of the U.S.A.)\"; and \"The Runaway Train,\" a song beloved in the U.K.\nIn the shadow of BristolWhile he was responsible for an estimated 3,000 commercial releases and was country music's bestselling recording artist of the 1920s, Dalhart has been marginalized. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1981, but today he has few champions despite the fact that many leading country music stars, including Johnny Cash, Marty Robbins, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson, have covered songs from Dalhart's vast repertoire.\nNeglect of Dalhart is likely the result of the impression that he, an opera singer with formal musical training, lacked the authenticity to be considered a country musician, despite his deep Texas roots. Dalhart recorded for many labels under many pseudonyms, and his massive discography defies easy characterization.\nThe only biography of Dalhart to date, published in 2004 and written by Dalhart devotee Jack Palmer, was an earnest effort to establish the singer as \"the first star of country music,\" but that book quickly fell out of print.\nTo acknowledge the centennial of Dalhart's emergence as a seminal figure in country music, Rivermont Records plans to release a box set in November 2024 featuring 100 of the singer's key recordings from throughout his career. I believe it will be just and overdue commemoration.\nThe Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.

    "content": "Planning your perfect European 'Beercation'\n\n August 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Danny Newman Wealth of Geeks | Section: Entertainment \n \n 873\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Europeans will drink an average of 10.0 gallons of beer per person in 2024, compared to an estimated 4 gallons worldwide. The combined revenue of at-home and out-of-home beer consumption will reach an estimated $170 billion in 2024 alone. To say alcohol is well integrated into European culture would certainly not be incorrect.Despite what appears to be a significant amount of alcohol, recent data shows that consumption in Europe declined by 21% between 2000 and 2019. The decline in alcohol consumption aligns with the World Health Organization's (WHO) efforts to encourage responsible drinking and reduce alcohol-related harm. But that doesn't take away from the local culture and prevalence of alcohol. Even when taking this into account, Europeans still consume the most beer globally.\nTourists in Europe stroll along the charming streets of cities like Madrid, Prague, and Vienna and responsibly experience centuries of local brewing. If you're lucky, everyone else will be exploring Italy, giving you your space to enjoy a brew peacefully.\nBest European destinations for beer\nA recent study by Danish shipping company Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab (DFDS), a prominent European travel expert and ferry operator, unveils unexpected contenders for the title of Europe's top beer destinations. Forget the legend of Oktoberfest. DFDS relies on a multidimensional approach and considers factors like bar or pub quality, social media hype, beer quality, and price rating, among others.\nMadrid, Spain\nMadrid is Europe's top beer hub, with a vibrant brew scene that scores 85 out of 100. Beyond the lively beer culture, it's important to consider the cost of living in Madrid, which drives relatively low alcohol prices. Here, you can enjoy a refreshing pint without breaking the bank. Domestic draft beers typically cost around $4.20, while imported bottled beers range from $3.00 to $6.00. If you prefer to dine out, a meal for two at a mid-range restaurant might cost around $72.00 for all three courses.\nBeer expert and editor of Keg to Differ, Shaun Hill, states, \"Just outside of the main city center is a must-visit brewery called Fábrica Maravillas. They offer artisan beers, and you get free nuts with every drink, so you find plenty of locals and tourists. My top choice is their FL IPA.\"\nPrague, Czech Republic\nAccording to National Geographic, the Czech Republic emerges as a global leader in beer consumption, with each citizen drinking an impressive 48 gallons per year. Known for pioneering iconic beer styles like Pilsner and Budweiser, Czech brewers have mastered the art of crafting delectable bottom-fermenting lagers.\nHill shares, \"When you go to Prague, it's all about the Pilsner. It's what all the locals drink, and most places only serve this, which you can get either light or dark.\" Brewers use local water and premium ingredients such as Moravian barley and Žatec hops to create their exceptional brews.\nToday, Czech brewers blend these traditional techniques with creative approaches that craft precise and approachable lagers that showcase their dedication to quality. Czech beer has become a symbol of national pride and a must-try for beer enthusiasts worldwide.\nVienna, Austria\nBeer lovers in Vienna are in luck as they can enjoy a variety of famous breweries that represent tradition and distinct flavors at the same time. Some must-visit places include Ottakringer, Vienna's oldest brewery, and Siebensternbräu, which is known for having a wide variety of craft beers.\nAustrian beer has high standards that the government enforces. That means there are very strict rules around the addition of preservatives and artificial flavors. One thing is certain: these standards maintain the high quality of the Austrian beer, which makes it an authentic experience.\nThe love of beer in Austria knows no bounds. There is even a Beer Party in Austria under the banner of Dominik Wlazny. Their campaigns vary from the proposition to bring public beer fountains to Vienna to improving the public health system. During the last elections, the party got a shocking 8.3% of votes.\nBudapest, Hungary\nIn the case of Budapest, beer enthusiasts have a wide variety of beers that are very affordable. Don't skip the high-quality beer places like Jónás Craft Beer House and Gravity Brewing. It is the perfect destination for people who love to explore the nightlife or just sample some of the local brews and craft beers.\nEvents like the Central European Brewers Conference at the Central European University Budapest show how big the brewing community is. It addresses the development of beer communities in American areas like Southern California, Western Oregon, and Central Colorado.\nThessaloniki, Greece\nThessaloniki offers affordable and a wide range of options to visitors. Beer prices in stores start from $1.51 for a 16.9-ounce domestic draught and can be $1.89 for imported 12-ounce bottles. The city offers a vibrant beer scene, like The Hoppy Pub and Bulldogs & the Beast. These places will make sure that whether you're local or a visitor, you'll have the best time exploring Thessaloniki's beer scene.\nIt doesn't matter whether you're a family of four or a solo traveler. Thessaloniki has a lot of cultural and historic sights to offer. You can easily explore the city in the morning, enjoy a local brew during lunch, and continue your explorations afterward. The diversity of the destination makes it one of the most exciting destinations for beer lovers and tourists.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chestertown’s casual gin connoisseurs\n\n September 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LISA J. GOTTO Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 1229\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — It all began with the little juniper berry, which actually isn't a berry at all, but what botanists describe as a seed cone with an unusually fleshy circumference and merged scales called a galbulus that gives it its berry-like appearance.It was this humble berry-like seed cone, however, that became the go-to ingredient for the all-important spirit and mixologist staple, gin.\nThe true origin of gin, has been historically debated, some tracing it back as far as the Middle Ages, where it was consumed for medicinal purposes only, and later in history it shows up again in the Netherlands in the 1700s as a more refined spirit called 'jenever' that was developed by a Dutch doctor, who also administered it for its healing properties.\nThis later iteration of gin was further developed in England after juniper berries were imported by Dutch merchants, who also talked up the wonders of the elixir derived from them. It is this history and, of course, the flavor profiles of the spirit that has made gin enthusiasts out of Lynn and Steve Mitchell of Chestertown.\nThe Mitchells are what you might consider casual aficionados of gin in the sense that they collect both common and rare varieties and are known to have about 20 different types on-hand at any given time. They enjoy entertaining friends and neighbors at smart gin-themed soirees and love discovering new gins on their various travels.\n\"With wine in the middle part of the 19th century becoming extremely expensive in England due to the duties placed on it, no one was buying wine, and they had to diversify,\" said Steve, a self-described fan of gins with a traditional juniper profile.\nAmong the bottles in their collection, Steve pulled out a large bottle of Gilbey's, which he described as a standard gin: one that offers good value for the money.\n\"If you're going to have a party and you're serving gin, this is the gin you want to serve,\" said Steve, who remarked that it is also a designated London Dry Gin, which historically means that it meets a standard for quality, although the term is often interpreted by some to be indicative of its flavor profile.\nThe distillers of Gilbey's gin, Steve said, were originally part of the larger contingent of wine producers that needed to pivot once those duties on wine and brandy were imposed. Gin consumption then became extremely popular in England creating what would become labeled as the \"Gin Craze.\"\nSteve, who attests to having more than a wee bit of British blood, (his mother was a World War II GI bride) said he learned later in life that he had ancestors who worked for Gilbey's early in the distiller's history. While he takes some of his ancestral tales with a grain of salt, he can verify that his great grandfather worked as a warehouseman for a liquor company in London.\nAs far as other solid, reasonably priced gins he pulled out a bottle of his secret weapon, something he said they often find at Costco.\nYes, Costco.\nIn fact, their Kirkland Signature label London Dry Gin made from natural botanicals is rumored to be produced by one of the most prestigious distillers in the world, although as part of the deal, Costco is forbidden to reveal which distiller it is.\nWhile the online scuttlebutt often surmises it is a Tanqueray or Gordon construct, Steve has his own theory.\n\"I think it may be Bombay gin,\" he said, noting the shape of the bottle and its characteristic handle molded into the glass. These are gins that you can easily pick up locally, but there are others in the Mitchell's collection that are harder, if not impossible, to come by stateside.\nThere are two similar bottles that take a prominent place in the collection from the Slingsby Premium label, one a rhubarb-infused gin, the other gooseberry. These, he said, are best enjoyed sans-mixer in the cocktail style of a martini.\n\"Those I know I can't get until I go back to England.\"\nSome of the smaller batch brands in the collection originate from as far away as Japan and New Zealand, and one organic seaweed gin from London-based distiller, Dà Mhìle, didn't even smell like seaweed at all, but does, indeed, leave the palate with a salty taste, according to Steve.\nThere's a gin from a boutique distillery once located in D.C. that has since closed that Steve is fond of called Green Hat. The name, he says, is a nod to the shady purveyor that supplied Congress members with alcohol during Prohibition. This particular purveyor was identified to those in-the-know by the green hat that he wore.\nThe \"Navy Strength\" designation, he said, denotes a 57% alcohol content, whereas traditional gin ranges between 40 to 45%.\nAccording to Wikipedia, the British Navy required all booze and rum to be at 57% or higher; because if the casks on their ship ever broke and the gunpowder was flooded, the gunpowder would still need to be able to fire.\"\nAnd then, there's a purple bottle of Hendrick's special edition gin in the grouping called Midsummer Solstice that was distilled for a limited time only.\n\"This gin was only produced in 2019 for one season, and I bought a bottle at Pip's (Liquors) and drank it, and figured they'd have it again the next year. They didn't [have it] and have not had it since then.\"\nFortunately, he received a call from the couple's daughter who lives in Cyprus, who told him she found a dusty bottle in a store there and asked if he wanted her to grab it for him. Needless to say, the answer was \"yes\", and that bottle has been consumed sparingly.\nWhen it comes to gin, Lynn differs from her husband when it comes to flavor profiles.\n\"I'm not a Juniper fan,\" she said. \"And coupled with my interest in gardening and cooking, I like more of the offbeat botanicals and the other flavors that are now being introduced.\"\nHer favorite is a Japanese Craft Gin called Roku which she usually enjoys with an elderflower tonic.\nAn avid gardener, Lynn, is attracted to its vibrant floral notes balanced with the subtle spiciness of the Roku. She is also a fan, overall, of the approach some boutique distilleries had on the evolution of gin, particularly Hendricks.\n\"I think Hendrick's was really the trailblazer with their cucumber and rose combination; it showed that there was potential in the market for something other than just juniper.\"\nSteve referred to Hendrick's approach to gin distilling as, \"…. the watershed moment where actually the person who makes Hendricks gin is a female. And she, I guess said, 'Why are we making gin out of just juniper? Let's try something different.'\"\nThis difference is being seen in the craft gin distilling business in a big way as it is now a more palatable option and is being favored by a newer generation of consumers, with a definite increase in popularity among women. According to a 2022 report by the American Distilling Institute, the gin category, and specifically the craft category, has seen exponential growth, specifically a 9% increase each year for nearly a decade.\nOur conversation winded down with what else, but a good, old-fashioned gin and tonic while the late day summer sun faded with the couple talking about the possibility of one last gin-themed gathering in their screened-in back porch, and the next trip to England they may take as part of a tour around the holidays. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A burnout contest even attracted a trucker and a motorcyclist, both engulfing the applauding crowd in smoke.\nAs judges walked up and down the rows of cars, a number of entries stood out across 13 separate classes, which included imports, police vehicles and motorcycles.\nSponsors Easton Auto Care and Denton Auto Care selected the top award on Saturday. Kevin Mezick, from Delmar, won the Best of Show trophy with his red 1969 Ford Mustang.\nOne of the most popular cars of the afternoon was the \"Batmobile,\" designed like the car from the Batman comics and cartoons. Darrell Hughes, who runs the group Heroes for Happiness, brought the car to Greensboro after it won an award earlier in the day at a Houston, Delaware car show.\nHughes said the group goes around Delaware and the Eastern Shore dressing up as superheroes for children's birthday parties and at children's hospitals. The Batmobile was named one of the top five 1980-2000 entries at the Greensboro Car Show on Saturday.\nAlso awarded a trophy was Rick Miner for his 2004 Harley-Davidson. Miner, from Harrington, Delaware, said he's had his motorcycle for four years.\nMiner said many are surprised when they find out his motorcycle has a Harley-Davidson engine but a Volkswagen transmission. He added that he rides it often and that it's not just for show or collecting dust in a garage.\nThe event was sponsored by many local organizations and businesses. Brandon Cunningham, the town's public works supervisor and one of the car show's organizers, thanked the sponsors.\n\"Without the help and the support of over 70 sponsors throughout the community, (this event) would not be possible, so thank you to everyone,\" Cunningham said.\nAt the conclusion of the car show, local band Rivers & Rhodes entertained fans before headliner and Nashville-based recording artist Trea Landon performed. It was Landon's first live performance in Maryland.\nThe event, which was free to all attendees, raised money to support the Greensboro Police Department's community basketball program.\nCunningham said the funds will help improvements at Greensboro's park and potentially other nearby parks. Proceeds help the program so that it can continue to be offered for free to local kids.\n\"Our goal is to venture out to help multiple areas, so we want to thank everybody,\" Cunningham said during Saturday's event. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Production of Shakespeare's Hamlet features1920s styles\n\n September 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Ted Black tblack@somdnews.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 667\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Those who enjoy plays by legendary playwright William Shakespeare will argue about which one of the Bard's works is truly best, and one of those plays typically in the discussion will be featured this month as the Twin Beach Players present \"Hamlet\" for eight shows beginning Friday, Sept. 20 in North Beach.Directed by Harvey Williams and Rachel Clites Cruz, who also plays the title character, the Twin Beach Players production of \"Hamlet\" will feature the numerous memorable characters and lines made famous by the Bard centuries ago although in costumes more reminiscent of the 1920s. In one scene, however, known as the play within the play, the characters don costumes more conducive to far more basic productions.\nIts numerous characters and plot twists are accompanied by memorable lines such as \"To thine own self be true\" and \"There are far more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy,\" and of course the engrossing soliloquy in which the title character initially asks, \"To be or not to be, that is the question\" as his madness approaches.\nWilliams, however, insisted that a hint of comedic tones were introduced to this version of the play.\n\"I've always loved Shakespeare,\" said Williams, who also plays King Claudius in addition to directing the play. \"I've read 'Hamlet,' I've seen the play and the movies and I've always wanted to direct it. But for our version I wanted to have a 1920s theme, complete with the costumes and a lot of the characteristics of the era.\"\nCruz, who also admits a passion for performing in Shakespeare plays dating back to her youth, yields most of the directing chores to Williams for this version while also playing the title character.\nHer willingness to assume the lead role came with the knowledge and understanding that Hamlet represents the ultimate challenge for any performer.\n\"Playing Hamlet is so challenging because his character is the epitome of all Shakespeare characters. He not only has the most lines and the most scenes, but he has seven soliloquies,\" she said. \"But I've always wanted to play Hamlet and be a part of this production. This is only my second time actually being up on stage with Twin Beach Players, but we have an amazing cast and crew here.\"\nMany of the Twin Beach Players regular performers each have key roles in \"Hamlet,\" including Cruz as the title character and Williams as King Claudius and Alexys Adams as Ophelia, Aaliyah Roach as Laertes, Terri McKinstry as Polonius and V. Stardust as Horatio, although audience members will notice that, by design, three characters typically deemed male are played by actresses and intentionally dubbed as female.\nCruz and Williams both noted that the strength of the Twin Beach Players over the years has been its willingness to attract and develop younger performers, with Addie Quinn, still one year removed from her freshman year at Huntingtown High School, playing dual roles as Rosencrantz and Marcellus.\n\"I got into the theater mainly because my older brother was an actor,\" Quinn said. \"I love working with the actors and directors here at Twin Beach Players. I usually have done other comedies, but I like being in something serious.\"\nIf you goThe Twin Beach Players production of Hamlet will run for eight shows at the North Beach Boys & Girls Club, located at 9021 Dayton Avenue in North Beach, from Sept. 20 to Oct. 5. Friday and Saturday shows will begin at 8 p.m. while the two Sunday shows on Sep. 22 and 29 will commence at 3 p.m.\nBased on the timeless classic by William Shakespeare and directed by Harvey Williams and Rachel Clites Cruz, the TBP production of Hamlet will include the characters made famous by Shakespeare and will offer the same intensity and drama that onlookers have always expected from the show, but with 1920s attire and occasionally some comedic overtones.\nDue to its adult content, dialogue and some scenes, however, this play is not recommended for children under 12 years of age.\nFor more information, go to twinbeachplayers.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

For Cascio says, \"as we experience our world through moving in it and dancing about it, we remind ourselves of the truth and knowledge that is stored, away from awareness. When a dance is performed and watched, both dancer and audience share another person's awareness conveyed by a language that is universal and for which no words suffice.\"\nIf you have questions about these events, would like to donate to the Carol Cascio fund, or want more information, please contact Peter Pucci at ppucci@carolecasciofund.org or visit the website at https://www.carolecasciofund.org/ \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Castro during his Avalon show.\nAccording to an announcement from the Avalon promoting the show, \"Cannon's love of music began at the age of nine, when he started playing the clarinet. Years later, holding a saxophone and breathing life into its soothing sounds, he discovered the soulful spark that ignites the palpable passion flowing from his horn each time he plays:\nThe Avalon said Castro is \"renowned for his creativity in neo-soul, jazz, fusion and hip-hop.\"\n\"J Castro's music speaks of love and life's struggles. His improvisational chops to contemporary jazz elevates the mind of his listeners with a sound that pleases their ears and sets their toes tapping,\" the venue said.\nSinger-songwriter Peter Bradley Adams will perform Saturday, Oct. 5 at the Avalon. The show starts at 7 p.m. Tickets are $30.\n\"Peter Bradley Adams, formerly one-half of the chamber Americana duo Eastmountainsouth, has gone on as a solo artist to scale back some of the 'mountain' and 'south' in his music for a more modern singer/songwriter approach,\" according to a concert announcement from the Avalon.\n\"Adams's musical journey delves into the nuances of tranquil and tumultuous romance, captivating audiences with emotionally charged lyrics. His brand of Americana nestles his often delicate, always heartfelt voice in the warm embrace of gentle guitar, tasteful dobro, subtle banjo, supportive bass, and unhurried percussion,\" the venue's announcement continued.\nFor more: https://www.peterbradleyadams.com/, https://avalonfoundation.org/, https://anthonycannon.com/ \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is the festival's 17th year, and the Friday evening VIP reception was sold out.The premier film, shown at noon Friday, was \"Call Me Dancer,\" which is directed by Leslie Shampaine and Pip Gilmour.\nShampaine won a Fulbright Scholarship for her work on this film. The film was about a young man from the streets of Mumbai facing challenges to achieve his passion for ballet.\n\"The film was finished before I received the Fulbright,\" Shampaine said. \"... My Fulbright was based on community impact in India for the film.\"\nShe said she is using the film to do a lot of outreach to underprivileged youth in India.\n\"One theme is everyone has a passion and the journey and obstacles that one goes through. Everyone has obstacles in their life. And the perseverance, hard work and hope that you need to keep going,\" Shampaine said.\nJohn King, executive producer of the film, said it took over five years to complete.\n\"The biggest challenge was that this was an international production. The fact that it went from India, to the U.S., to Israel, to London and back to the U.S. And for independent documentaries raising the money is a challenge,\" King said.\nCid Collins Walker, executive director of the film festival, gave opening welcomes and introductions. This is her eighth year with the festival.\nBy the time the festival ends Sunday, 17 short and feature length films will have been screened in Easton. Filmmakers are coming from a variety of locales, from Chile, to Romania, to Los Angeles.\n\"As a producer of an event like this, you are always looking for a film that will grab the public's attention. A good opening film is really important. It is the first thing that people see,\" Collins Walker said.\nCurating a film festival is an art in itself.\n\"I have learned over time that this is what the audience loves. The public loves to hear these stories right from the director or producer's mouth,\" Collins Walker said.\nShe said there is a driving purpose to her work.\n\"The arts are a great connecting force. It connects us all, and I believe we live in a fractured society, sadly. I like to produce these events to bring people together,\" Collins Walker said.\n\"The festival is good for the region. It is good for Talbot County. It is good for Chestertown. It is a hidden gem among our many arts celebrations. I would encourage people to check it out. I really love the way they highlight the unexpected,\" said Cassandra Vanhooser, director of the Talbot County Department of Economic Development and Tourism.\nThe festival has more screenings and events planned for Saturday and Sunday.

Rebranded now, the staff aims to create an event enjoyed by the entire community.\nOne of the organizers Prakash \"Chikki\" Shajwani emphasized this point, \"We wanted to give back to the community. This is a way of getting kids outdoors and for families to get together.\"\nMarketing Director Sara Dion echoed his statements, mentioning the new vendors this year to do that: the decoy table, duck and goose call makers, and some fun activities for kids along with food trucks.\nUnder the tent with the callers and decoy makers, there was a wealth of information from experts of their craft, people willing to discuss their workmanship, honed from years of experience.\nLike Sean Mann the World Goose Calling Champion of Champions. He won championships for duck calling and for making his own calls.\nWorking beside his son, Ian, who shows his talent for making calls, Mann said he owed his career path to the late Dan Edwards, an instructor at Anne Arundel College and a good friend.\n\"He made the dream possible. Without him none of this would have happened,\" Mann said.\nThese awe-inspiring stories weren't limited to just the vendors.\nLooking at crossbows, Delaware resident Rene Swing casually mentioned how she once got a bear using a Horton Legacy crossbow, in a deer stand, in Maine.\nThese outdoor stories were all over the place, uniting residents and visitors.\nOutside the tent, children enjoyed climbing the bouncy castle, The Triple Shots 4-H crew taught kids archery and beside them was a BB gun range run by the National Wild Turkey Federation along with the Queen Anne's County High School Clay Target Team, ensuring proper safety.\nWith cold beverages and good food there was also a nice mix of local talented musicians entertaining while spectators sat on hay bales.\nThe Quinn Arnold Band played on Friday, Joe Bryan sang and strummed classics on Saturday, and newcomer Elena Barnett with musician Justin Singleton, closed out Sunday with country, blues and rock covers.\nFor three days Molly's was bustling with activity.\nDion said last year they drew approximately 15,000. They anticipated recording as many this year, if not more.\nShajwani showed appreciation to all the volunteers such as the Chestertown Lions Club for helping park cars, the Kennedyville Volunteer Fire Company selling beer, and the Maryland State Police for helping on that busy stretch of road navigating people who came as far as Virginia and Baltimore for the event.\nAnd he thanked the community recalling when the place was called Vonnie's noting how it was a hub for Marylanders to meet.\nWith their tagline, \"Fuel your adventure,\" Shajwani said Molly's shows that same appreciation to the location's history and the culture while making their own mark.\nDion said, \"We want to express our gratitude to the wonderful members of our community who attended the event and continue to support Molly's. Kent County holds a special place in our hearts, and we are honored to be part of this remarkable community.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Folk legend Nash returning to Avalon\n\n October 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 527\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A Grammy Award-winning folk legend is coming to Easton in March. He wrote and sang the songs that defined a generation.This is the second time Graham Nash has come to the Avalon Theatre. Within hours, his two-night run on March 29 and 30 was nearly sold out.\nThe Avalon's 400-seat art deco theater is one of the most intimate places to see him perform. He is playing Wolf Trap and in much bigger markets like San Francisco, Dallas and Nashville.\nHe calls this this show \"Graham Nash — More Evenings of Songs and Stories.\"\nNash epitomized the creative hotbed of Laurel Canyon, California, and dated Joni Mitchell. Before he was the Nash in the Crosby, Stills and Nash, he played in another vocally rich group called The Hollies. Both groups have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nSuzy Moore, house manager and talent buyer at the Avalon, said, \"When he was here in 2019 for one night, he was a wonderful and warm performer. When he sang 'Our House' and welcomed everybody to sing along, it was magic. It was my top magic moment in the Avalon Theatre in my 22 years.\"\nShe still keeps that moment saved on her phone.\n\"I have known that song my whole life,\" Moore said.\nNash's biography on the Avalon's website says, \"Legendary artist Graham Nash, as a founding member of both the Hollies and Crosby, Stills and Nash, is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee. He has seen rock history unfold at some of its seminal moments — from the launch of the British Invasion to the birth of the Laurel Canyon movement a year later. An extraordinary Grammy Award-winning renaissance artist — and self-described 'simple man' — Nash was inducted twice into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, for his work with Crosby, Stills and Nash and his work as a solo artist.\"\nTo attract this kind of talent takes some effort.\n\"It is hard to get him. I have the relationships that makes this possible. This is one of the top agents in the country for venues our size. The artists that the agency represents speak so highly of their experience of the venue, the patrons that come and the town. We are known for providing a really great experience on the stage and while they are here in our community,\" Moore said.\n\"These shows are not possible without the support of this community who comes and buys the tickets to make these great experiences happen. It feels good that people are like, 'Yes we want them.'\nIn over 20 years of booking acts at the Avalon, Moore has seen a lot of talent come and go. She tries to gauge his level.\n\"At his level? Joan Rivers, Dionne Warwick, Wynton Marsalis, Randy Newman and David Sedaris. These are American icons,\" she said. \"He is a legendary musician and an American icon.\"\nNash will be joined on stage by Todd Caldwell (keyboards and vocals), Adam Minkoff (bass, drums, guitars, and vocals) and Zach Djanikian (guitars, mandolin, drums, and vocals), performing favorites from across his 60-year career.\nAside from VIP tickets, the house tickets are $125, $100 and $80.\nGo to avalonfoundation.org for more information. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Henry Price II, American Legion Post 246, took the act on the road — a quarter-of-a-mile down the road to be precise, at the Betterton Heritage museum.\nThe audience gathered on the lawn for some great music from 5 p.m. until dusk nodding to classics like \"Stop Dragging my Heart Around,\" originally performed by Stevie Nicks and the late Tom Petty and \"White Rabbit,\" by Jefferson Airplane.\nLead vocals Valerie Maitland easily hit those ranges.\nDevelopment corporation President Candi Sorge gave a speech to honor the volunteers, who work at the Betterton Heritage Museum on weekends. Each of the volunteers received key chains and a hearty show of gratitude from the over 50 in attendance.\nWerner said their last concert in June was popular, and so they decided to bring it back.\nWith refreshments available, and volunteers selling museum items like T-shirts and hats, Werner noted they received more donations than last time.\nHe added it was fortunate they didn't have to move the whole thing inside because of rain.\n\"We really lucked out,\" he said. \"It worked out well.\"\nYou don't need rain to urge you inside though.\nThe development group encourages the public to check out the museum for an expansive view of the town's storied past. Located in the Most Precious Blood Catholic Church, it is the result of a collaboration between the town and the Betterton Community Development Corporation.\nThe museum is \"intended to serve as a community center and a showcase for historic artifacts, the space was beautifully renovated to both honor the past and provide a functional meeting place for the present,\" as their website states. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The fundraiser gathered participants from throughout the Mid-Shore region to raise money for the Easton Volunteer Fire Department.This festival featured over 40 breweries, wineries and distilleries sharing over 120 craft beers, ciders, seltzers, wines and spirits from the region. Packed with live music, a variety of food, raffles and games, the Beef Fest, has become a staple on the Eastern Shore.\nChris Hash, Easton Beer Fest organizer and treasurer of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, said this fundraiser provides community engagement and a chance for residents to support their local fire department.\n\"It's a key fundraising event for the Easton Volunteer Fire Department and allows us to purchase equipment and do things necessary to live up to our motto, 'service for others,'\" Hash said.\nAccording to Hash, the event began in 2016 as a way to replace previous fundraising events such as Casino Night and Bull Roast. Now, nine years later, Beer Fest has become a large community event in Easton with a wide attendance from across the Eastern Shore.\nDoug Greene, an attendee of Beer Fest, said major highlights of the event were the live music by local band Black Dog Alley and the opportunity for locals and visitors alike to support local businesses.\n\"I think it's a great way to be a part of the community, to engage in different industries and also, obviously, support the fire department,\" Greene said. \"And one thing that I've always noticed is that a lot of people, after the day of the event, they go into town, they go to restaurants. They may stay for the night or the rest of the day. They really get involved in the area.\"\nCameron Swell, another attendee of the event, said Beer Fest is not only good for the community but helps attendees expand their horizons with local beers and helps them support local craftsmen and tradespeople from wineries to distilleries.\n\"(The Fire Department) had a ton of breweries, a bunch of rare beers, and they do one of the best jobs I've ever seen for an event, let alone a beer fest,\" Swell said. \"They put a lot of heart and soul into it, and I know every year they look to improve on the previous year.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Haunts throughout the country attract large crowds year-round, especially around Halloween.\nIn its 2023 Haunt Industry Report, HauntPay, a haunted attraction ticketing platform, reports 33% of haunts were expecting to receive upwards of 10,000 visitors, a notable increase from 2022. That year, 42% of haunted attractions saw visitor numbers between 1,000 and 5,000.\nVenture beyond the grave and visit some of America's scariest real-life haunts to celebrate the season.\n12 Terrifying Places in America to Embrace Your Spooky SideFrom abandoned prisons to historic homes and even a zoo, these are 12 of the scariest haunted locations in America worth visiting this month.\nEastern State Penitentiary, PennsylvaniaExplore the supposedly haunted grounds of Philadelphia's Eastern State Penitentiary — if you dare. This abandoned prison once held famous criminals like Al Capone and Willie Sutton before closing in 1971 and falling into disrepair.\n\"Visiting Eastern State Penitentiary is like stepping into a real-life horror movie,\" says Partners in Fire owner Melanie Allen. \"The desolate, crumbling halls and long-abandoned rooms hold an unyielding tension.\"\nVisitors can tour the prison year-round. The facility also hosts seasonal Halloween Nights, which feature haunted houses, spine-tingling tours, themed bars, and live entertainment.\nThe House of the Seven Gables, MassachusettsThe House of the Seven Gables, built in 1668, is among Salem's eeriest attractions. Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel of the same name mainstreamed the property.\nThe home is a must-visit for those interested in colonial architecture and Salem lore. Every October, tourists can enjoy autumnal storytelling performances that heighten the unsettling atmosphere ahead of Halloween.\nWaverly Hills Sanatorium, KentuckyGhost-hunting enthusiasts flock to Waverly Hills Sanatorium, a former tuberculosis treatment center operational from 1910 to 1961.\nMany visitors report supernatural encounters, from doors slamming on their own to sightings of a young ghost boy. Delve into the property's dark past on a guided tour, or pack a tote with essentials for a private overnight investigation.\nWaverly Hills Sanatorium also hosts a terrifying haunted house during the fall, made scarier by the sanatorium's paranormal reputation.\nStanley Hotel, ColoradoThe Stanley Hotel opened in 1909 as a getaway for guests seeking upscale accommodations in Colorado's Rocky Mountains. Its reputation faltered in the 1970s, but one visit from author Stephen King changed everything. King later wrote his horror classic The Shining, drawing inspiration from Stanley Hotel.\nGuests often claim to hear disembodied laughter, feel phantom touches, and sense ghostly presences. Amp up the scares during your overnight stay with a theatrical séance or nighttime tour.\nLincoln Park Zoo, IllinoisIn addition to the zoo animals you'd expect to see, Lincoln Park Zoo is reportedly home to several spirits. Lincoln Park was once the site of Chicago's official city cemetery, and some say thousands of bodies remain buried there today.\nThe zoo hosted its first official paranormal investigation in 2013 after reports of apparitions and disembodied voices in the Lion and Primate Houses.\nOctober visitors can join an evening Haunted History Tour to learn more about the zoo's hauntings. Wear comfortable shoes like boots to enjoy the eerie surroundings while exploring the zoo after dark.\nOhio State Reformatory, OhioThe historic Ohio State Reformatory operated from 1896 to 1990 and is the ideal destination for supernatural lovers. Visitors may recognize it from The Shawshank Redemption, filmed there in 1993.\nThere have been many documented instances of dark figures and incorporeal voices at the Ohio State Reformatory, even among inmates before its closure.\nThe reformatory boasts an impressive program for those seeking a supernatural encounter, including group ghost tours and private, hours-long investigations.\nThe Mark Twain House, Connecticut\nStep back in time at the Mark Twain House in Connecticut, where the famous writer and his family lived in the late 1800s.\nThis Victorian home is a hotspot for unexplained phenomena, including sightings of a ghostly woman in white — possibly the spirit of one of Twain's daughters who died there.\nGuests eager to explore this haunt can embark on a Graveyard Shift Ghost Tour to learn the home's most fascinating tales from beyond the grave.\nSt. Augustine Lighthouse, Florida\nThe spirits of several young children who died there in 1873 supposedly haunt Florida's St. Augustine Lighthouse.\nSome lighthouse employees and visitors claim to hear giggling and see ghostly apparitions, while others feel an otherworldly presence throughout the site.\nHear spine-chilling stories of the lighthouse's hauntings on a group tour, or bring ghost-hunting equipment to conduct a private nighttime investigation.\nWinchester Mystery House, CaliforniaThe Winchester Mystery House is among San Jose's strangest attractions. The owner, arms company heiress Sarah Winchester, began the bizarre multi-decade renovation following her family's death. She expanded the home to 24,000 square feet, installing 160 bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, and six kitchens.\n\"Doors open to nothing, stairs lead to solid walls, and there seems to be an overall feeling of chaos and unsettling vibes that bothered me when visiting,\" explains Chantelle Kincy of Flannels or Flipflops.\nOver the years, many guests have claimed to see specters and hear footsteps in the Winchester Mystery House. Visitors can see areas of the home on year-round guided tours or embark on a seasonal haunted maze through four of the mansion's floors.\nBonaventure Cemetery, GeorgiaWhile southern Georgia's Bonaventure Cemetery is among the world's most beautiful cemeteries, it's also incredibly unsettling.\n\"It was extremely quiet, and there was an overwhelming feeling of sadness as we walked around,\" Jessy Hamel of Brighter Things shares about her visit.\nVarious local legends surround the cemetery, including voodoo rituals and a child spirit that roams the grounds. In October, the cemetery allows guests to embark on a full moon tour, enhancing the creepy atmosphere.\nThe Conjuring House, Rhode IslandSee the terrifying real-life home that inspired The Conjuring movie universe. The house's haunted history stretches back centuries since its construction in the 1730s.\nIn the 1970s, the Perron family bought the home and immediately started having ghostly run-ins. At one point, famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren took an interest in the house.\nAccording to the Perron family, at least two spirits — a married couple who passed away in the 1800s — haunt the house. Interest in the property spiked following the 2013 release of The Conjuring, a hit horror movie that spawned an entire franchise.\nThe current homeowner offers a variety of spooky experiences, from guided daytime tours to overnight investigations where you can bring a blanket and settle in for a night of ghost-hunting.\nSan Fernando Cathedral, TexasSan Fernando Cathedral, established in 1731, is a beautifully haunting church. It's the oldest of its kind in Texas and is said to be among San Antonio's most haunted locations.\nNumerous bodies lie within the cathedral walls, and visitors have reported spectral sightings of dark silhouettes and mysterious orbs. Many San Antonio ghost tours visit the historic cathedral to highlight its storied past.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Stage Fright' brings dark humor to Avalon\n\n October 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 518\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — This Halloween, immerse yourself in a haunting, unforgettable journey as \"Stage Fright: Curtain Call\" returns to the Avalon Theatre from Wednesday, Oct. 23, to Sunday, Oct. 27. With shows at 6:30 p.m. each night and additional 9:30 p.m. performances on Thursday through Sunday, this locally written and directed show promises a macabre experience that blurs the lines between reality and delusion.The production is recommended for ages 16 and up; guests under 16 must be accompanied by a responsible guardian. Tickets are available through the Avalon Foundation website at avalonfoundation.org/event/stage-fright-curtain-call.\nSet in 1997, \"Stage Fright: Curtain Call\" invites audiences into the dark, twisted world of Lou Baker, a 95-year-old former showman tormented by a violent past and spectral figures. Facing release from a psychiatric institution after over three decades, Lou's story unfolds through a captivating, immersive theater experience filled with unresolved mysteries, dark humor, and a chilling confrontation between past and present.\nInspired by real ghost stories, the experience features sound and lighting effects, unique smells, special themed drinks and specially crafted Lyon Rum cocktails, making it an evening attendees won't soon forget. Mature themes and extensive walking are part of this production.\n\"Stage Fright: Curtain Call\" is the thrilling final act of a trilogy, with each installment having been set in a different era — 1927, 1964 and now, at the turn of the century in 1997. The production explores the final days of Lou Baker, who is \"95 and can barely get out of bed on his own.\" When presented with one last chance to release the spirit of Marguerite, his long, lost love and the ghost of the Avalon Theatre, he is met with a harrowing twist in his spiraling and tortured tale.\nAttendees are encouraged to dress up in their favorite '90s attire or Halloween costume. The play draws heavy inspiration from '90s MTV, and The Factory invites guests to arrive as their best Britney Spears, Madonna, Notorious B.I.G., Spice Girls, and other '90s celebrities.\nCecile Strom directs the production, with Talley Wilford as assistant director and Casey Rauch as writer and co-collaborator.\n\"A key element of The Factory's immersive productions is the integration of film,\" Director Cecile Storm said. \"It adds depth, context, and atmosphere to the live experience. This production takes this idea to new heights. I don't want to give too much away, but expect the boundary between stage and screen to blur in exciting and unexpected ways.\"\nKatie Cox stars in the leading role, supported by the Beauty Shop Quartet: Jennifer Madino as Marguerite Gardot, Grace Vorosmarti as Shirley Boudreaux, Maddie Megahan as Vivian Baker and Jeri Alexander as Minnie Valentine. Art and production are managed by Maggii Sarfaty, and Ray Nissen leads the music direction.\n\"The acting is captivating and intense. The music is well done and is such a nice touch to this already so creatively awesome haunted house-like experience,\" shared an audience member from a past production. Another remarked, \"It was great to see how the connection is made and everything is so eerily familiar, seeing as it's about the ghost that has haunted the Avalon for many years right here in Easton.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's a magical destination where readers go on rollercoasters, enjoy slides, and ride the teacups, as any great amusement park should offer.But you need a mode of transportation usually involving wheels to get to Six Flags America.\nBut to get to Rollercoaster Land, you just need imagination and Glenn's storytelling.\n\"Mommy's Adventures,\" is her first book, self-published, inspired by life with her seven-year-old son, Wyatt.\n\"It starts out with the mother trying to get her son, Wyatt, to bed. Naturally, he doesn't want to go. So mom pulls out her magical handbag,\" Glenn explains.\nInside the bag are traveling goodies like sunscreen and a map. Mom utters a special rhyme, and like \"The Wizard of Oz,\" they are whisked away, Rollercoaster Land being the first of what may be many magical locales.\nThe 30-page book is for ages 3-8, with colorful illustrations from Pakistani artist Ayshea Zaki.\nLike the mom in her story, 31-year-old Glenn is being whisked away too. At the beginning of the month she had the joy of reading her book to kindergarteners in H.H. Garnet Elementary School.\nAnd as a cafeteria worker at Rock Hall Elementary School, she has a captive audience, who, at times, are probably more insistent than traditional publishers.\n\"They're coming up to ask me, 'when's the next book coming out?',\" Glenn laughed.\nThis one took her about six months to write and she's planning on having a table at the next Rock Hall Fall Fest, an event that features various vendors.\nFor the magic seekers interested in her book, they can find it at Amazon.com under \"Mommy's Adventures.\"\nAnd where are mommy and Wyatt off to for their next mystical journey?\n\"Maybe space,\" Glenn said with a smile. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Candy corn conflict! The Halloween treat that divides us\n\n October 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Anne Jolly Food Drink LIfe | Section: Entertainment \n \n 999\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Love it or hate it, candy corn is a Halloween staple. Some people can't resist candy corn's super-sweet taste, while others think it's too artificial and sugary. Whether you're a fan or a skeptic, there's no denying that this tiny, tri-colored treat has a fascinating history that goes beyond mere snacking.There's a little in-between when it comes to this iconic Halloween candy. The great candy corn debate gets people fired up at parties and sparks social media discussion. It's like the pineapple-on-pizza argument but with candy.\nCandy corn's unique texture and flavor make it either a classic favorite or a sugary blunder. But no matter how much discussion it provokes, candy corn is a Halloween symbol that you'll find everywhere, just like pumpkins and costumes.\nThe sweet debateSo, what's the deal with candy corn's love-it-or-hate-it reputation? It all comes down to the flavor. Candy corn is just a mixture of sugar, corn syrup and honey. It's got a waxy feel and a super-sweet taste.\nFor some, this combo is a match made in heaven; they love the simple, old-school sweetness, which reminds them of trick-or-treating as kids. As Amanda from Simply Awesome Trips reflects, \"I love it — It's the perfect bite of sugar. You can't have fall without candy corn. It's like pumpkin spice or Mariah Carey at Christmas. Love it or hate it, the season hasn't truly arrived without these things.\"\nOthers think candy corn is just too much; the sugary flavor seems fake to them. The texture is another point of contention — some find it pleasantly chewy, while others say it is weirdly waxy. \"I hate candy corn. It's a sad waste of calories! They're pretty to look at, but they taste like a sugary wax candle,\" Gena Lazcano, from the blog Ginger Casa, argues.\nHow you feel about candy corn depends greatly on your childhood memories. If you grew up loving it, you're probably still a fan. But if you never liked it, you won't develop a taste for it as you get older.\nGeneration gapYour age also affects your candy corn preferences. Older generations tend to view it more favorably, probably due to nostalgia. A survey from the National Confectioners Association (NCA) found that candy corn is most popular with GenXers, with 58% of them enjoying it.\nYounger generations are divided; some see it as a retro treat, while others ignore it. The same NCA survey found that only 46% of Millennials enjoy candy corn, showing that the popularity of candy is gradually decreasing.\nCandy corn through the yearsCandy corn has been around for over a hundred years, starting in the 1880s in Philadelphia. At first, it was called chicken feed because the pieces looked like corn kernels. The candy was marketed to farmers as a special treat with a farm theme.\nCandy corn's connection to Halloween happened gradually. As trick-or-treating became popular in the 1950s, candy corn was a common choice for Halloween handouts. Its orange, yellow and white colors perfectly fit the season's theme. Plus, it was affordable and easy to distribute.\nToday, it's hard to imagine Halloween without candy corn, but its popularity has been slowly fading. While Halloween candy sales continue to grow, candy corn sales are slowing, a recent CNN report indicates. Sales of other non-chocolate candies like gummies and marshmallows are taking some of candy corn's market share.\nCultural impactCandy corn's influence goes beyond the candy bowl. It is featured in Halloween decorations, costumes and social media posts. Its distinctive three-color design has become a symbol of fall and the Halloween season.\nFood manufacturers have created candy corn-inspired products like ice cream, popcorn, coffee creamers and candy corn cookies. Craft breweries even make candy corn-flavored beers. Love it or hate it, candy corn has cemented its place in American pop culture.\nYou will also see candy corn used to decorate homes. From the blog Get On My Plate, Casey Rooney has found decorating is the solution to her dislike of candy corn, explaining, \"I used to hate candy corn, but my daughters love it. They started filling glass jars with it and putting them around the house. It looked so pretty and festive for fall. Instead of eating it, now I just use it as part of my fall decor!\"\nSeeing candy corn in Halloween decorations and at parties adds a nostalgic element that brings back all sorts of memories. It's a warm and fuzzy feeling reminiscent of happy childhood times.\nAlternatives and variationsThere are creative alternatives if you want to incorporate candy corn into your Halloween celebrations but aren't a huge fan of the taste. Combine candy corn with other ingredients, or try recipes that feature the iconic candy corn look without the overwhelmingly sweet flavor.\nMixing candy corn with peanuts is very popular. The salty flavor of the peanuts goes perfectly with the sugary taste of the candy corn, and the mix of crunchy and chewy textures makes it extra satisfying to eat.\nYou can also create treats that capture the spirit of candy corn without the flavor. A simple idea is to make a candy corn-inspired parfait. Layer some mango, mandarin oranges and yogurt in a clear glass jar for a snack that looks like candy corn but tastes fresh and fruity.\nOr make candy corn fudge. White chocolate and food coloring can create those signature yellow, orange and white stripes in a treat that tastes like chocolate, not candy corn. Add some food coloring to your favorite Rice Krispie treat recipe, and you've got a snack that looks like it came from the candy store.\nHalloween classicPeople might argue about how candy corn tastes or feels in your mouth, but one thing is certain — it's a big part of American Halloween traditions. Its one-of-a-kind look and connection to Halloween make it a favorite symbol of the season, even if you don't like eating it. It'll keep sparking smiles, starting conversations and maybe even causing a few arguments for many Halloweens to come.\nAnne Jolly is the creator of the food blog Upstate Ramblings. She loves cooking but doesn't love candy corn. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

A face painter worked past sundown as the fairy lights twinkled during a spectacular sunset. There were vendors selling essential oils, lemonade and cheeseburgers. There was a haunted house that would only take four people at a time.\nIsabel O'Brien caters at the Culinary Center and had a table at the event. She had a chef's toque and thin mustache drawn on her upper lip.\n\"This is my first time being a part of this event specifically. I am just so glad to see that there are so many opportunities for the kids to come out and get as much candy as they can,\" O'Brien said.\nDirector of Downtown Denton, Jessica Jean Willoughby, was the primary organizer of all this spooky fun. She loved seeing all the families dressed up and making memories.\nJill Pugh, president of Downtown Denton Main Street, said, \"We run several events each year and this Fall Festival is one of them.\"\nWilloughby has written roughly $50,000 worth of grants to stimulate Denton's downtown. She wants to bring businesses and community together.\n\"I bring community together with all of the festivals. If you bring kids downtown, you bring families. I want to bring lighting all the way down the street. The ones that go across the street. I want to bring people together and just have a good time,\" Willoughby said.\nAlicia Moxley, a member of Downtown Denton Main Street said, \"Downtown Denton is a beautiful space, but we still have room to grow. This is a great opportunity to bring people into our town.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "'The stars aligned for us': Tall Ships festival delights\n\n November 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LISA J. GOTTO Special to the Kent County News | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1419\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For anyone who has ever fantasized about having a sailing adventure aboard a schooner or skipjack on the high seas, the Sultana Downrigging Festival in Chestertown is the place to be. For that matter, it's also a great place to be if you're a fan of unique small craft adventures, model ship building, maritime and Kent County history, bluegrass music, and a variety of Chesapeake-themed foods—because this three-day event has it all and then some!Over the last several years, all these interests have culminated into one of the most popular waterfront festivals in the mid-Atlantic.\nA brisk, sunny morning ushered in the day's plethora of activities, which for many, began with the African American History walking tour. Chestertown's old Customs House, now known as Washington College's Starr Center, was the tour's jumping off point which then continued along the waterfront and into notable parts of Chestertown.\nThe waterfront, said community historian and tour leader, Airlee Ringgold Johnson, has changed quite a bit over the last two centuries, despite its nostalgic appearance with this past weekend's docking of tall ships in the marina.\n\"Our harbor is remarkably different from the harbor of 19th century Chestertown. There was once a seafood factory, a tomato factory, a basket factory, and a fertilizer factory,\" she said. \"And there was always traffic going up and down the river.\"\nPainting a picture of the challenges of the day, Ringgold Johnson and Paula Reeder, a volunteer for the Chestertown Heartland Group, pointed out some of the town's unique homes and architecture as the group headed to the intersection of Water and Cannon Streets.\nBy 1871, they explained, Chestertown was home to many freed slaves, or slaves who were able to purchase their freedom from their owners. There were also many rules to be followed, which included not owning a gun, a dog, or a knife, and following strict curfews imposed upon African American residents at that time. It was also well known that this particular part of Water Street was home to the wealthiest residents of Chestertown; but as you head south on Water Street where it meets Cannon Street there was a virtual dividing line between the wealthy homeowners and many of the community's African American population who worked for them and resided in the blocks just beyond Cannon and into the community known as Scott's Point.\nWhile history and education are certainly a big part of what the downrigging weekend is all about, it comes in many forms, including the activities found a few blocks closer to the center of town where the Sultana Education Foundation is located. The Holt Center was home on Saturday to a merry band of live animals at the Echoes of Nature Exhibit, which included various turtle species, a black snake, a broad-chested, red-tailed hawk, and even a cute, cuddly chinchilla. The kids also enjoyed live music and the creative adventure of making their own sailor hats.\nHolt Center also buzzed with the enthusiasm of model boat and ship builders and their admirers and like-minded enthusiasts.\nFurther down Cross Street, impressions of the sea-faring life were on exhibit at the Massoni Art Gallery where artist, Marc Castelli, was in house to talk to art lovers about the stories behind his paintings as depicted in his \"Merrier\" series of watercolors. Castelli, who also lives what he paints, is well-known for his genuine and realistic depictions of the men and women who take to their local waterways to make a living.\nCastelli's book, \"Illustrating the New Treasure Island\" was also part of a series of book talks featured over the weekend and organized by the Bookplate, which included Edward O. Murdy's, \"Field Guide to Fishes of the Chesapeake Bay.\"\nBack down at the marina, by mid-morning the sounds of the bluegrass band, Serene Green, were providing a melodic backdrop for the scores of Downrigging revelers out to tour the impressive collection of tall ships, small crafts, and collector's boats that were on display by private owners and organizations alike.\nThere were a total of nine amazing tall ships on display. Joining Chestertown's own Schooner Sultana, were several ships out of Baltimore including The Pride of Baltimore II, Lady Maryland, and the Sigsbee, and ships that came from as far away as Nantucket's Lynx and Key West's Bloodhound, a replica of one of the very first racing yachts of its era. Many of the ships took part in group sails down the Chester River that carried some 3,500 passengers over the course of the weekend.\nThe Bleinberger family of Kent Island, who said this was their second trip to Chestertown's Sultana Festival, enjoyed an on-deck tour of the vessel, Maryland Dove.\n\"You can't beat the weather, and you can't beat the beauty of the tall ships,\" said Morgan Bleinberger. The family, who are avid boaters and self-proclaimed fisherfolk, are also fans of live music, so the event seemed like the perfect afternoon out with the family.\n\"We love bluegrass, too,\" said Hans Bleinberger of the music at the event. \"The weather was perfect, so the stars aligned for us.\"\nKent County resident, Pat Jewell, who was also attending the festival on Saturday with her son, Zach, said she wanted to bring Zach's daughter, Georgia, out to see the big boats. Having roots on the Eastern Shore, Jewell said she has been to the festival many times.\n\"I grew up in Calvert County, right on the water… and I sail.\" Relaying that love of the water and these beautiful vessels is something she said she hopes to instill in her granddaughter.\nWhile Downrigging is truly a festival for kids of all ages, it also serves as a celebratory reminder of the mission the Sultana Educational Foundation (SEF) takes on every year to ensure that all of the area's public school children have the opportunity to explore and learn what an awesome and diverse resource we have in the Chesapeake Bay.\nOver the course of the weekend, Drew McMullen, president and founder of the SEF, can be found down on docks amongst the ships and many other members of the organization that help educate and instruct upwards of 12,000 public school kids per year that come in from Kent County and various parts of the Eastern Shore.\n\"Our core mission—and we're coming up on our 30th anniversary—from the beginning, we have been laser focused on environmental literacy for kids. Getting kids out on the Chesapeake Bay; that's why we build the Sultana,\" said McMullen.\nThe schooner Sultana is a historically accurate replica of a Boston-built merchant vessel that served for four years as the smallest schooner ever commissioned in the British Royal Navy. This vessel now serves as a floating classroom that conveys not just a history, but experiences in team building, and a perspective on our regional waterways that they might not otherwise have.\nThe Foundation's mission, said McMullen, is reinforced in the sense that a child will experience an average of 35 days of environmental instruction as they progress from kindergarten through eighth grade. In addition to experiencing being aboard the Sultana, the organization provides all manner of programs and field trips that immerse kids in the ecosystem of the Chesapeake Bay and its inhabitants.\n\"And while their teachers are the real heroes, our job is to do all sorts of things that teachers can't do in the classroom.\"\nThis also could not be done, he said, without the help of an extensive network of volunteers; 137 in all, (85 who participate in the festival weekend alone) and the support of a wonderfully receptive and engaged community.\n\"A lot of this works because the whole community helps out, either by donation, or by donating a good or a service,\" he said. \"For a small town like this to support an organization like ours, is not an easy thing.\"\nBeyond the educational aspects, McMullen said, Downrigging is an event unlike any other, as it is the largest annual gathering of tall ships in the nation, and it helps bring together a specific group of enthusiasts who share a passion for the beauty and prestige of tall ships and the historical maritime aesthetic that embodies them.\n\"Some participants fly in from hundreds and hundreds of miles away just to be here every year.\"\nBesides that, he added, the festival is a fitting way to close out the instructional year for them.\n\"This is a way to celebrate … we are almost to the end of the year. This is the Sultana's last sail of the year, and it's sort of a way for us to say, 'Yes, we took a lot of kids out, now let's celebrate and have some fun!'\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Falconry demonstration wows at VFW\n\n November 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 520\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Raptors can be taught behaviors with positive reinforcement, says Brian Bradley, the owner of Sky Hunters in Flight and a master falconer.Bradley drove all the way from the Hudson Valley to give a raptor demonstration at the VFW in Easton for this year's Waterfowl Festival. He has been doing falconry for 47 years and he brought 10 birds. Each bird was in a large box with its named taped to the top.\nThere was a crowd of about 50 people on bleachers. Families and bird lovers were beguiled by the raptors, which provided a thrilling display and highly educational experience. The kids' eyes followed the giant horn owl's every move.\nFalconry is over 3,000 years old, and humans have used birds to catch rabbits and foxes for centuries. Bradley said the practice traveled with trade routes. From places like Medieval Europe, to the Middle East, to China. Mongolian horsemen use eagles for hunting to this day.\n\"As far as the Middle East goes, it is very embedded in their culture. It is a huge thing for them, and it involves a lot of time and a lot of money invested. They take it extremely seriously, but it is practiced around the world,\" Bradley said. \"It was a practical way to bring home meat before firearms.\"\nBeing this into falcons is a full-time pursuit. They have to be fed every day, and Bradley weighs each bird down to the gram to know if they are hungry or not.\nThey come to him when calls out or when he uses a hand clicker.\nHe brought out a barred owl, a red tailed hawk and the fastest animal on Earth, the peregrine falcon. He described how their wing structure determines what kind of flying and killing they can do. He also explained how an owl's cone-like face helped them to pick up sound like a satellite dish picks up a radio signal.\nMany of these birds were threatened by the insecticide DDT in the 1960s and 1970s. They ingested small birds that had eaten bugs who had been poisoned with DDT. The birds' eggs were affected. With shells that were too thin, the babies died.\n\"At one point there were almost no peregrine falcons recorded east of the Mississippi River. Without passionate falconers, there probably wouldn't be falcons today. They started to breed them in captivity. They got rid of the poison and now the falcons are rebounding. It is probably the greatest conservation success story in our history,\" Bradley said.\nHe loved the birds right from the beginning.\n\"I appreciate what they do in nature and the fact that they do it so dramatically and so athletically. It is just thrilling to watch,\" he said.\nAll of his birds were bred in captivity, with the exception is his hunting bird, the red tailed hawk.\nHe caught it with a net in the wild. He used a live pigeon during the hawk's migration season. It has to be the right age to keep legally. He will train the young hawk for five years and then let it go when it is sexually mature.\n\"It feels good to let a bird go.\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

RaR (which stands for Real ale Revival) had location set up on Harrison Street. Marcy Harrison, RaR's catering director, said it was the first time the brewery has had such a location at the festival.\nAmong the menu items for sampling was venison chili. RaR chef Victoria Tanner said this is a \"traditional chili\" with black, kidney and pinto beans, using traditional spices and light tomato sauce. The venison is purchased from \"local vendors.\"\n\"It's nice and traditional,\" Tanner said. The spicy chili was augmented by a slice of cornbread.\nWhether looking to enjoy alcoholic beverages or something less spirited, fest-goers got samples of both at the tasting pavilion.\nMonika Mraz of Doehrn Tea Company in Oxford said her products are imported from mostly Asia — China, India and Sri Lanka — where popular black and green teas are grown. Teas that are caffeine-free, grown in South Africa, are also part of the inventory.\n\"I'm discovering we have a great tea-drinking community,\" said Mraz, who noted she has customers who start their day with coffee \"and then they move onto tea. It's a little less harsh on the stomach. Tea is a lot more like wine than coffee.\"\nWine lovers also had their favorite libation at the pavilion.\nCandace Donahoe of Layton's Chance Vineyard and Winery had samplings of dry and sweet wines.\n\"We grow a great variety of grapes,\" Donahoe said. \"We do lots of events.\"\nThe Layton family first planted grapes at their Dorchester County farm in 2007 and opened the winery three years later.\nSome of the other Eastern Shore farm-to-food basket items available for sampling at the festival included Pepper's Pickles of Chestertown.\n\"We sell our products at farmers markets and through online shipping,\" co-owner Nikita Bocharv said.\nAmong the first-time food vendors was Experience Smith Island. While touting excursions on the classic deadrise workboat Circuit Rider, business owner Carole Ann Landon, a Smith Island Native, sold samples of the iconic Smith Island Cake.\n\"This is our four year of business and our first year at the Waterfowl Festival,\" Landon said.\nThe cake has been popular for centuries, and in 2008 the General Assembly designated it as Maryland's State Dessert.\nThe eight-to-nine-layer treat is no piece of cake to make, either. Fortunately, Landon does provide as part of her business' programs a Smith Island layer cake demonstration, available off island at a venue of customers' choice.\nThe cake and everything else consumable provided just another slice of good eating and thirst-quenching satisfaction at the annual Waterfowl Festival. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But we do know that every parking space was full and every bus had about 45 minutes to an hour-long wait, and we had to add three buses on Saturday to accommodate the people.\"\nThe executive director said multiple vendors — many of which are already asking about next year — sold out or had record days at the festival.\nIt all began Thursday evening with the Tidewater Inn's premiere party. Easton Mayor Megan Cook formally opened the festival by bringing down the duck-shaped gavel.\nFor the next three days, attendees enjoyed clear skies and great festival weather. During Saturday's attendance peak, attendees roamed downtown, many enjoying multiple musical performances that drew large crowds.\nAccording to Kilmon, there were 38 musical performances in total, a focus of this year's festival.\n\"That made the festival have a different vibe this year, I think,\" Kilmon said. \"Just made it more of a friendly family party on every corner.\"\nOn South Harrison Street, an expanded PNC Art Pavilion was a success, Kilmon said. While many artists were stationed inside of the Waterfowl Festival's main building, others had displays across the street in the pavilion's tent, including this year's featured artist, Ronnie Wells.\n\"You feel like you're in an art museum more than you feel like you're in a tent,\" Kilmon said. \"It was just spectacular presentation.\"\nOver on Bay Street, expanding children's activities and adding a \"Beer Wetlands\" area were focal points for organizers. Kilmon says she hopes the Bay Street area can grow in future festivals, as well as the Chesapeake Bay Pavilion at Easton VFW Post 5118 on Glebe Road.\n\"We want to make sure the Chesapeake Bay Pavilion has a little bit of love, because there were incredible educational exhibits out there that I think that some people may not have been able to enjoy,\" the executive director said.\nKilmon said organizers will work on improving the bus routes for next year, as well as adjusting signage and maps so that attendees, if able, are encouraged to walk to downtown venues for quicker commutes.\nOverall, feedback has been \"incredibly positive\" and Kilmon is excited to begin work on continuing Easton's Waterfowl tradition.\n\"Fifty-three years of our community coming together just gets better every year,\" Kilmon said. \"And we're already working on next year, believe it or not.\"\nThe 54th Waterfowl Festival will be held Nov. 14 through Nov. 16, 2025. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bringing global flavors to the table this Thanksgiving\n\n November 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Kristen Wood Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1045\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Thanksgiving brings together family and friends over dishes like buttery mashed potatoes and sweet pumpkin pie. This year, add these international flavors to your Thanksgiving traditions and celebrate with diversity on your table.The popular story of the first Thanksgiving tells of Native Americans and Pilgrims coming together to share the bounty of harvest. Over a feast, people of different cultures and beliefs celebrated together.\nIn 1863, Abraham Lincoln proclaimed Thanksgiving a national holiday. According to State Representative, Wayne Rosenthal, this was the result of a campaign by Godey's Lady's Book to promote unity during the midst of the American Civil War.\nToday, Thanksgiving remains a time to come together. It is the busiest travel week of the year, notes the United States Embassy, as families travel across the world to be together. Friendsgiving, feasts on college campuses and celebrations for members of the armed forces stationed abroad bring together those who may not be able to spend time with family over the holiday.\nWith more people celebrating Thanksgiving from several diverse cultures, new traditions are becoming more common at the holiday table. Turkey, stuffing and pie remain Thanksgiving favorites, but international dishes and flavors are also more at home on a modern Thanksgiving table. This year, bring these global twists to Thanksgiving dinner and celebrate coming together through food.\nThanksgiving traditions around the worldMany countries celebrate their own Thanksgiving holiday. Initially, these holidays began as harvest celebrations, says GoAbroad, giving thanks for a bountiful harvest much as America's first Thanksgiving did. In the years since, these celebrations have taken on their own unique traditions.\nFor example, in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, people celebrate Erntedankfest on the first Sunday of October. Religious services and lantern parades accompany this holiday. \"Mohnstriezel\" — a sweet bread with poppy seeds — is a popular treat during the festivities.\nMalaysians celebrate Kadazan in May to honor the sacrifice of the goddess Huminodun, whose death provided for an abundant rice harvest. Their celebration is filled with feasting, rice wine, games and music.\nGhanaians celebrate \"Homowo\" — meaning hooting at hunger — to honor those who died in a historic famine, usher in a bountiful harvest and celebrate the arrival of the new year in Ghana. The people prepare \"kpokpoi,\" a dish made of corn meal, palm oil and seasonings. In addition to eating kpokpoi, local chiefs sprinkle it around the town as an offering.\nThese traditions and dishes, as well as those from other countries, can be a fun addition to your own Thanksgiving celebrations. Adding African, Asian and European food, and other cuisines to your menu is a great way to learn more about other cultures or welcome an international guest with a taste of home.\nGlobal twists on the main dishAt an American Thanksgiving, turkey is often the main dish of choice. Many traditional recipes call for baking, roasting, frying or even smoking the turkey, often with fresh herbs, salt, pepper and vegetables for flavor.\nBut turkey's mild taste also makes it a perfect dish for more adventurous flavors. Jamaican jerk turkey combines spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves with herbs and chili for a warm and flavorful dish. Alternatively, a turkey marinade with Chinese five-spice powder — cinnamon, cloves, star anise, fennel and Sichuan peppers — infuses your turkey with fall flavors and a bit of heat.\nThese marinades are an exciting way to introduce global flavors, but they are only the beginning. Earthy za'atar seasoning from the Middle East, a warm berbere spice blend from Ethiopia or bright herbs de Provence from France can all be inventive additions to turkey.\nTurkey mole combines mole, the national dish of Mexico, with your turkey for a rich, chili flavor. Make your own mole or purchase a high-quality sauce to add to roast turkey. You can also try pavo a la brasa, a twist on Peruvian roasted chicken, by marinating your turkey with a sauce with cumin, paprika and other aromatics.\nExotic sides and desserts to expand your Thanksgiving menuSide dishes and desserts are a great way to introduce global influences to a feast with plenty of room for experimenting. Try spicing up traditional sides with international ingredients. Adding shishito peppers to green beans gives the veggies a Japanese flair or you can switch out the sweet potatoes for a delicious yam casserole.\nInternational sides can also bring a nice contrast to common Thanksgiving foods. A Korean cucumber salad is refreshing, spicy and tangy. With a mild heat from the gochugaru pepper flakes, the salad makes a great starter or palette cleanser between courses.\nVegetable korma is a flavorful way to serve veggies at your meal, infusing Thanksgiving with Indian spices. The creamy cashew, yogurt and coconut milk sauce with the korma goes great over turkey and potatoes.\nFor dessert, bring a twist to classics with pumpkin empanadas or baklava filled with walnuts for a nutty treat. Other exotic desserts, like Chinese moon cakes or melomakarona from Cyprus, both traditional holiday desserts, are great at an American Thanksgiving as well.\nFlavorful condiments with international flairCranberry sauce and gravy are Thanksgiving staples. This year, add interest with a variety of condiments. Salsa Lizano, a sauce made with vegetables, cumin and pepper, is a Costa Rican condiment that is perfect on the table or in a rice and bean dish like gallo pinto.\nAsian flavors like sriracha or gochujang give a delightful spice to meat and vegetables. Indian mango chutney or the Georgian plum sauce tkemali are sweet alternatives to cranberry sauce.\nServe these condiments alongside the Thanksgiving meal and let your guests tailor their plates to their liking. These are also a great way to spruce up your leftovers.\nBringing it all together at the tableWhether you look forward to visiting with family or enjoying your favorite foods at Thanksgiving, mixing up your menu with international flavors will make for a memorable holiday. Begin with these ideas or explore dishes from cultures that are meaningful to your guests. You might even start some new Thanksgiving traditions to celebrate for years to come.\nKristen Wood is a photographer, food writer, recipe developer and creator of MOON and spoon and yum.

In packed churches and concert venues, thousands once sang along to the band Gungor's 2010 hit \"Beautiful Things,\" a song that became a permanent fixture on the setlists of youth group bands. But in 2014, Gungor's critiques of the Christian music industry — as well as his public musings on Genesis as a poem rather than historic fact — led to his exclusion from the Christian music business. Now, after a long process of wrestling with his inherited evangelical faith — documented on his podcast \"The Liturgists\" — Gungor says he's more interested in embracing the current lived moment than being tethered to a set of religious beliefs, though he describes Christianity as his \"native tongue.\"\nFor those like him who have \"deconstructed\" — a popular term today for the process of questioning and sometimes letting go of the teachings of one's faith tradition — Gungor still sees a desire for ritual and for communal gathering. He recognizes the power of the collective — and aims to write non-dogmatic music for corporate, if not religious, worship.\n\"We've gotten rid of some of the shame-based stuff and some of the dogmas that were oppressing and hurting a lot of us, but now we're kind of just wandering around alone … What are we missing? Is there anything we can find back here?\"\nIn the last two decades, several Contemporary Christian Music powerhouses — Audrey Assad, DC Talk's Kevin Max, Hawk Nelson's Jon Steingard, among several others — have publicly exited the CCM industry. For many of these musicians, questioning the industry's theological parameters meant becoming unwelcome in mainstream CCM spaces. Years later, after interrogating their beliefs, a handful of these onetime CCM artists are revisiting faith in some fashion, trying on elements they'd previously discarded and writing music for listeners who might be more spiritual than religious. In many ways, these artists' break from institutional Christianity and hunger for a broader form of belonging exemplifies national religious trends.\nOne of the earliest CCM artists to publicly depart the industry was Jennifer Knapp, who burst onto the Christian music scene with her debut album \"Kansas\" in 1998. But while Knapp was drawn to Christianity's teachings on human dignity and divine love, she soon realized that the Christianity promoted in the CCM world drew hard lines around who belonged, and who didn't. Her lyrics about the Christ's humanity and questions about the necessity of substitutionary atonement — the idea that Jesus died as a substitute for humanity — began to draw criticism.\n\"I was already getting critiqued at the time and being basically told you weren't a Christian anymore,\" said Knapp. \"And then I was like, oh, well, I'm wondering what you guys are going to think about my sexual orientation.\"\nIn 2002, Knapp \"pushed the eject button\" on the Christian music scene and her faith. When she returned in 2010, it was as an openly gay musician no longer publishing music under the Christian banner.\nFor longtime Bethel Music recording artist William Matthews, it was in part the rigid homogeneity of the Christian Music industry that ultimately led him to walk away. Raised in a Black Church of God context, he came to Christian music by way of spontaneous worship models promoted by Morningstar Ministries in Charlotte, North Carolina, and the International House of Prayer in Kansas City, Missouri. Though skeptical about the existence of hell, Matthews, who spent his evenings watching Bill O'Reilly on Fox News, largely felt at home in the prophetic corner of the Christian music world. In the early 2010s, he led worship at the conferences of charismatic leader Lance Wallnau, now known for his pro-Trump prophecies.\nBut by 2015, Williams found non-violent Christian theology a more compelling approach. He watched as anti-immigrant rhetoric and opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement reached a fever pitch in evangelical circles and grew frustrated with what he saw as the Christian music industry's \"conservative bias.\" After spending nearly 15 years thinking he'd been bridging cultures as one of the only Black people in white-majority evangelical spaces, he was shattered to discover that many of those he'd grown close to seemed ambivalent toward racism.\n\"That led me to really walk away from Christian music,\" said Matthews.\nHe attributes the CCM industry's apparent conservative slant to its target audience of \"white, suburban, Midwest or Southern moms.\" In catering to that demographic, Christian radio executives and Christian bookstores are known to censor songs or albums that cross conservative theological or political boundaries.\n\"What the CCM industry, or Christian music, is selling is security,\" said musician Derek Webb, founding member of the Christian rock band Caedmon's Call. \"The people who run or appear to be gatekeeping the CCM industry are not doing that as a means of holding some kind of moral plumb line.\" Webb believes the pushback usually has more to do with a company's bottom line than personal convictions.\nDespite the Christian music industry's restrictions, exiting the industry often means leaving behind record labels, the Christian music festival circuit and radio play and requires promoting music to a market that's much less defined. While some boundary-pushing Christian artists like Semler and Flamy Grant, two queer artists who've scored top spots on the Itunes Christian charts, have found success via social media and streaming platforms, many onetime Christian artists are labeled \"too Christian\" for mainstream music spaces and \"too secular\" for explicitly religious ones.\n\"It's this kind of no man's land, algorithmically,\" said Gungor. \"I still have more listeners of 'Beautiful Things,' than anything else I make.\"\nCreating music for a more nebulous spiritual audience might not guarantee commercial success, but if it means creating music that feels authentic, for many former Christian artists, it's worth the tradeoff.\nKnown for his provocative approach to songwriting, Webb says his lyrics cause him to both \"shed\" about a quarter or third of his audience every 18 months and gain new listeners. After 30 years in the music industry, he's comfortable with the ebb and flow. In 2017, three years after his divorce from fellow Christian artist Sandra McCracken, Webb released \"Fingers Crossed,\" an album documenting his departure from Christianity. But though he still considers himself an agnostic, his latest album, \"The Jesus Hypothesis,\" grapples more explicitly with Christian themes.\n\"I wanted to go back into the rubble of where all this was pulled down and burned down, and where I was in here with an ax before, I want to come back in with a scalpel,\" he said of the album.\nWebb's return to the debris of his Christian faith coincided with a return to Caedmon's Call, which recently produced a re-record of its self-titled debut album in honor of its 25th anniversary. The 2022 release is emblematic of the ways several former Christian artists have been coming back to reclaim elements of their religious heritage.\nMore than a decade since her return to the music world, in May, Knapp offered a re-release of her first album, \"Kansas 25.\" She graduated from Vanderbilt Divinity School in 2018, and now views Christianity as a source of wisdom whose teachings on liberation have fueled her own LGBTQ+ advocacy. The outpouring of support for \"Kansas 25,\" Knapp said, caused her to see her early music in a new light.\n\"If ever I had any bitterness about my role inside of evangelical Christianity, or concern that maybe I tied people down, exposed them to too much religious trauma because of the conservative evangelical space that I came from, this was a real joy to be able to witness, that our faith can teach us something, and it can expand beyond some of the harms sometimes that our smaller religious spaces offer to us,\" said Knapp.\nGungor's next project has emerged from his desire to see communal songs that trade religious lyrics for more universal themes, like love and unity. This fall, he gathered with over 20 other songwriters in Colorado for a songwriting retreat to begin writing and recording music for the project, called The Mystic Hymnal.\nAfter a long hiatus from Christian music, William Matthews, too, is releasing new, honest songs about spirituality. Earlier this year, he was invited by the evangelical authors of a recent anti-culture war statement to write and produce a corresponding album intended to call the church out of political idolatry. Titled \"Return to Love,\" the September album was recorded by artists from a range of theological and political perspectives and is designed for those who are \"full of faith or struggling to believe.\"\n\"I'm always in the middle of wrestling. Does church even matter to my life?\" said Matthews, who leads worship at a progressive LGBTQ-affirming church in Los Angeles where former evangelicals regularly attend. \"I will say, in my life, I've somehow always managed to come back. Maybe it's cyclical. You're always returning home or to a sense of home or to a better expression of home.\"\n___\nThis content is written and produced by Religion News Service and distributed by The Associated Press.

Subscription-based streaming services have changed audiences' consumption of content by \"over producing\" content and making it difficult to gauge what people actually want to see, he said.\nMoore said he wants to take a step back and go back to his roots to better understand how to give audiences quality content. And for him there's no better sounding board than the people of the Eastern Shore.\nFor Moore, the event on Thursday will be interactive, funny and most importantly informative of what he believes best represents American culture and audiences.\n\"I don't want people to think this is like going to a college lecture,\" Moore said. \"We're going to have some fun and talk about movies and talk about entertainment, talk about fun stuff and in a way that people laugh and can engage and it can be a lively night.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hollywood producer hears from local moviegoers\n\n November 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 684\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — A wave of laughter erupted at the Oxford Community Center on Thursday evening as a crowd watched video clips of a young Ben Affleck imitating an Eastern Shore accent in an effort to act as Chris Moore, a Hollywood film producer and Talbot County native.That evening, Moore led a discussion of the challenges faced by the movie industry, particularly the shift to streaming services and the decline of traditional theater attendance. Throughout the speech, he sought audience engagement and gathered information to better understand American audiences.\nIn an interview earlier in the week, Moore called the people of Talbot County \"a real slice of America\" whose input he valued greatly in examining the state of his industry.\n\"I'm going to talk about the movie business, but what I really want to talk about is how it's falling apart at the moment, and I'm trying to learn a little bit more,\" Moore said Thursday.\nMoore spoke on the concerns he has with the quality of produced films. He asked the audience what they would like to see in newly released films and what it would take to get them to watch a film in person.\nAn array of answers came from several people, but the message remained consistent: people want quality films with quality stories.\nCid Collins Walker, executive director for the Chesapeake Film Festival, said she looks at hundreds of films every year and she relies on her knowledge to pick out films that stand out against the rest.\n\"I think you have to continue to take risks and find the best writers,\" Walk said. \"I get all tons of scripts now. They're very exciting to read. Some of them, once again, are still works in progress, but I think you just need to encourage the process.\"\nAt some point in the event, Moore presented a Netflix home page filled with recommendations and shared research on why audiences get frustrated when they are offered too many choices. When audiences are presented with more than 5-6 options, consumers start to feel uncomfortable and have difficulty deciding.\n\"I think that the other problem is somehow the algorithm the menu uses is actually creating more frustration,\" Moore said. \"So most likely, you're going to watch something that was on here that you've already seen or you're going to wait for the person that is sitting next to you, who's going to say, 'I want to watch this.' You're going to decide how much you hate it.\"\nArt Murr, an attendee of the event, said he and his wife love movies and said he figured that Hollywood was confused about the vapid changes going through the industry.\n\"He's confirming (Hollywood) is confused,\" Murr said. \"They should be confused, but we're not helping. And I do totally agree that there's way too many choices that if you're given like, four things, you choose one of the four things. If you're given 65 things … you have no idea, and you walk away, and you don't watch anything.\"\nLiza Ledford, executive director of the Oxford Community Center and sister to Moore, said she worked in the film industry and with new technology it has drastically changed the communication between audiences and filmmakers.\n\"We lost a lot of our tools to vote,\" Ledford said. \"What things we like, what things we don't like, and with the new restructuring of Hollywood, it's hard not to be able to trust Sony Classics or Fox Searchlights. The branding of different things has all become mesh together. So it's harder to know where to find certain types of things.\"\nToward the end of the event, Moore took the time to thank attendees for their participation and said that though movies are not essential for living they are important and their feedback helps the way the industry moves forward.\n\"I know the choices you make for what you watch,\" Moore said. \"…But I know Hollywood and movies are less (important) than how you pay bills, your health, your kids (and) mental health. …but I do think it is nice to be surprised and happy and sort of snuck up on by a story that you're surprised by.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Events include the Festival of Trees, which is held in the Tidewater Inn, as well as Carols by Candlelight, Santa's Workshop, Santa 5K Fun Run/Walk and a jewelry raffle.Every year, there is a theme for the festival, which is put on by the Friends of Talbot Hospice. This year's theme is \"Holiday Traditions.\" The trees will be decorated based on that theme, festival chairman Karla Wieland-Cherry said.\n\"It takes a year to plan. It's a lot of work,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"It's all volunteer work, all volunteers. And this is our 39th year. The big thing is the trees, so we have the trees sponsored by various businesses, organizations and individuals. And they can either choose to decorate the tree, or we also have a list of volunteers who will come in and decorate the tree.\"\nThe festival raises funds for Talbot Hospice. Wieland-Cherry emphasized the work of volunteers in raising hospice funds, as well as the family aspect of the weekend-long event.\n\"My children are involved, my son comes and volunteers, my daughter used to sing, my husband, he's the music chairman,\" Wieland-Cherry said.\n\" ... It's just a wonderful way to kick off the holiday season,\" she continued. \"I have such a blessed team of volunteers that work so hard to make this such a success.\"\nOn Friday night, the Preview Gala will kick off the festivities. From 6 to 8 p.m., guests will have the first opportunity to view 100 exquisitely trimmed trees of varying sizes. Tickets to the gala are available in advance for $125 per person or $200 per couple.\nWhile the larger trees are sponsored in advance, gala guests get the first opportunity to purchase the smaller trees, from 12 inches to three feet and in varying price ranges.\nThe Gold Ballroom at the Tidewater Inn opens to the public Saturday morning and remains open through Tuesday.

To date, close to $4 million has been raised by the Festival of Trees to assist with Talbot Hospice's operating budget.\nAs a celebration of life for those who have received Hospice care during the past year, the continued success of Festival of Trees is made possible by the generous financial contributions from local individuals and various businesses.

The town's sixth annual Whoville Village Holiday Park opened Friday at the Greensboro Volunteer Fire Company Fair Grounds.The annual event, inspired by Dr. Seuss' fictional town, features activities for all ages, decorations, light displays and photo opportunities with the Grinch.\nWhoville continues during the next two weekends, open Dec. 6-7 and Dec. 13-14. Admission is free.\nThe town requests $5 parking donations, though donations are not required. Parking revenue is split between the Greensboro Volunteer Fire Company and next year's Whoville efforts.\nAmanda Weaver, Greensboro's community programs coordinator, said around 1,500 people attended Whoville last weekend.\n\"The first weekend was slower than (it has been) historically,\" Weaver said. She said that's partly due to the town opening the attraction in November for the first time ever.\nSunday was a special night for Greensboro residents, in which 150 town residents enjoyed Whoville without the usual \"commotion\" and packed crowd.\n\"We loved that,\" Weaver said. \"They all had a great time.\"\nTypically, there are 2,000 to 3,000 attendees per day, according to Weaver. She said the town is expecting a similar turnout looking toward this weekend.\nAround 12 student volunteers from the local schools chipped in to make opening weekend a success, Weaver said. They will continue helping throughout the upcoming weekends.\nThis Friday, Saint Paul's United Methodist Church Pastor Bonnie Shively will accept her nomination as Whoville's honorary mayor.\nWeaver said on Dec. 11, Whoville will have its sensory night. Loud music and flashing lights will be minimized to accommodate visitors with sensory sensitivities, and the trails will be designed for accessibility.\nReservations for sensory night can be made by calling Greensboro Town Hall at 410-482-6222. The Whoville attraction runs 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. on all nights. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Last year there was an estimated 1,000 people in attendance. This year, the For All Season team anticipated a bigger turnout of 1,500 people.\nSimilar to previous years, there was a line of excited children waiting for their turn to have a professional photo with the famous Frosty and friends.

Adored in his iconic black shirt with flames, the award-winning juggler and Guinness World Record holder engaged with children and parents alike to take part in his performance.

    "content": "Residents brave the cold for Denton Holiday Parade\n\n December 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 461\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Bundled up in coats, gloves, hats, scarves — and even blankets — Caroline County residents braved the cold and the wind to watch the town's annual holiday parade.At the start of the parade on Thursday, the weather was 31 degrees Fahrenheit but felt like 12 degrees.\nAs the wind put a sway to the colorful string lights above Market Street, John Bell and Linda Allen-Bell waited for the parade to begin. The two, wrapped in blankets, didn't want to miss the parade after missing it last year. Allen-Bell said they love small town parades.\nDown the street, Rachel Tull stood with her family, trying to stay warm. She said that the kids were most excited for the candy that would soon be tossed from parade floats. Tull, on the other hand, was most excited for the meatloaf she had waiting for them at home.\nAs attendees waited for floats to glide down the street, some checked out the vendors at the corner of Market and Third streets.\nIt was Ridgely resident Haley Wondrash's first year selling the cups she makes at the parade. She said she makes her cups, which have different designs on them, for different people to express themselves. There's a cup for everyone, she explained, from sports lovers to Taylor Swift fans.\n\"I make a lot of Taylor Swift cups for all the Taylor Swift girlies out there,\" she said.\nJP Morris, who attended the parade with his two sisters and his parents, was most excited for the candy that parade participants toss to the crowds. He, along with other children at the parade, cleaned up the candy from the sidewalks as floats made their way down Market Street.\nMorris said he wasn't too cold. His mom, Meagan Morris, said the family of five has spent their last couple Christmases in Maine, \"so this ain't nothing,\" she said, laughing.\nOnce the parade began, attendees heard local marching bands play Christmas music, watched bright red firetrucks and pickup trucks decorated in lights make their way down the street, and kept their eyes open for Santa and Mrs. Claus, who closed out the parade.\nA variety of creative floats were in attendance this year, from the 4-H float blasting fake snow into the air to the Caroline County GOP float toting a cardboard cutout of President-elect Donald Trump standing next to a decorated Christmas tree.\nKyra Ringgold took her son Kyro, 3, to the parade for the first time this year. Seeing Santa and getting candy and chocolate was Kryo's favorite part of the experience.\nAfter Santa and Mrs. Claus made their way down the street, people gathered in front of the courthouse for the Lighting of the Green. A drumroll slowly ushered in the turning on of green and red lights on the trees outside the courthouse. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The parade, which brought music and candy to Harrison and Washington streets, was preceded by a visit from Santa and a tree lighting at Thompson Park.\nThis year, 5-year-old Makena Dickerson lit the tree, helping to kick off the holiday season in Easton.\nMayor Megan Cook said that one of the best parts of living in a small town is events like these that bring the community together.\n\"The parade, to me, is one of the highlights of the whole year,\" she said.\nCynthia Spence has been coming to the parade for a about five years now with her daughter Sofia, 7, and now her daughter Nevaeh, 4. She said they return because her children like watching the parade.\n\"They like seeing different floats and ...\"\n\"Don't forget the candy,\" Sofia jumped in as her mother spoke.\n\"And apparently the candy they throw out,\" Spence finished.\nJosie Taylor, who sat with her family on Washington Street, said she was most excited to see her sister, Ella, who was in the parade with the Avalon Theatre.\nTheir mother Jess Taylor said that although they normally attend St. Michaels' parade every year, they came to Easton's parade to support Ella this year.\nFrom Easton school marching bands to a kazoo choir, music filled the air at Easton's Holiday Parade. Floats, vintage cars and firetrucks traveled slowly along the parade route as parade participants on foot weaved in between them, handing out candy and other small items.\nBethany Shair, a Preston resident who had not been to Easton's Holiday Parade before, said she wished that she and her family had brought chairs.\n\"Next year we'll learn,\" she said.\nThis year, Midshore Veterinary Service was named the best commercial float in the parade. Partway through the parade, Vivienne, 6, and Drew Sperandeo said it was their favorite float.\nThe Eastern Shore Hockey Association was named the best nonprofit float in the parade. Easton Middle School took home the best marching band title. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The festival was sponsored by Main Street Chestertown, Rosin Creek Collaborative, 114 High and Molly's Place to name a few.\nDuring the two-day event, couches were placed on High Street facing the music stage, in a homey atmosphere where one could meet friends and visitors of Chestertown, warming up by the fire barrels just a brisk walk away.\nThe event began Dec. 6 with the opening ceremony courtesy of Jimmy Kinstle portraying Dickens.\nKinstle introduced Queen Victoria who read off every child's name from Santa's nice list, courtesy of Santa's House next to Fountain Park.\nFollowing, the audience was entertained by the Kent County High School Jazz Band, Garnet Elementary Chorus, River Voices and finally, The Devil's Brigade, formerly known as The American Rouges ending the night in a rowdy fashion.\nBonfires were lit, oysters and beer were served and food vendors were on hand. The new executive director for Main Street Chestertown, Sonny Huntzinger described the night as magical.\nOn Dec.7, 113 racers, contested the morning chill in the 5-K, Run/Walk and Kids' Fun Run, \"Run like the Dickens\" commentated by Kinstle, never breaking character.\nRace coordinator Renee Bench and vice chair of the Board for Mainstreet Chestertown, pointed out there were not as many people as last year due to the weather, but was pleased to see the turnout all the same.\nFinishing first for men's was Joshua Dorsey, winner for female's was Jamie Hicks, and Ethan McIntire, age 15, and C. Mann, age 8 finished first in their age range.\nOver the day, the sun warmed the street and alcohol and food vendors opened up at noon. Music was performed throughout the day, traditional Irish songs to classic rock, and folk.\nFor kids, a petting zoo was situated over by Fountain Park as well as a puppet show performed by, Horns Punch and Judy Show.\nFor shoppers, the farmer's market was open, and further down was Heritage Village in the Bank, featuring a native flower farm, River Arts, WAC Women's League, Museum of Kent and Tarot readings.\nFor history buffs, the Holiday House tour afforded ticket buyers a journey to \"festively decorated homes on Queen, Maple, High, Cannon and Water Street,\" as stated on the Chestertown website.\nPeople could navigate the busy streets, seeing the homes in any order they wished.\nChestertown Police Chief Dixon, his crew in bobby hats, said over the two days there was an estimated 1,500-2,000 attendees and reported there were no incidents.\nHuntzinger was thrilled by the efficiency in the planning process, having 25 years of experience in community development and other related fields. She noted that Main Street Chestertown Assistant Director Kelly Reed and a few volunteers planned the entire thing, while partnering with the Town of Chestertown.\nShe appreciated the hard work of them all, especially the Town's Streets and Public Works Department for setting up the stage among the many other tasks.\nHuntzinger said all revenue, goes toward advancing Main Street's mission to promote and support a diverse range of educational, cultural entertainment and recreational activities.\nPlanning is a long process for such an event like this, Huntzinger acknowledged, and as much as they are looking forward to the next Dickens festival, she said they need more volunteers to sit in on committees and get involved.\nIf you have an interest in volunteering, contact the offices at 410-778-2991. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When the sun sank low, lights were plugged in, and the many decorations in the park were evident for all to enjoy throughout the holiday season. The town held their annual Christmas event, Light up the Park, sponsored by Molly's and Dixon Valve, drawing nearly 100 people this year.Through the archway made of colorful gifts with ribbons creatively put together, attendees were treated to a Santa wearing floaties, next to a boat of Christmas lights, some reindeer, a gingerbread man, multiple light displays, a fire to stave off that winter chill, and plenty of family activities.\nIn addition to lighting up a 20-foot Christmas tree, Council member Sarah Merrell noted they had Santa escorted by the Galena Volunteer Fire Department, children's coloring activities and a few vendors, all while the Galena Lions Club offered hot chocolate and cookies.\nAt 7 p.m., under the tent, they had their fourth movie night of the year, playing the 2000 family/comedy \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas,\" starring Jim Carey.\nMayor John Carroll said movie night has been growing in popularity, and the screen they purchased with American Rescue Funds money, has turned out to be a good community investment.\nAnd he was pleased with the annual Christmas event overall, growing too big to contain at their previous location.\nOver the years, they held the event at Town Hall, he noted, but after 100 kids showed up, they felt the park was the best way to expand it and allow the kids to have space enough to play.\nNext year, Carroll said, they are going to try to develop squares around the whole park for families to decorate.\n\"Hopefully we can grow each year and make this a nice tradition,\" Carroll said, thanking volunteers, the community, the fire department and their sponsors for making all this possible. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As you plan your celebrations, choosing the perfect wines to accompany your dishes can enhance the entire experience. Whether you're a wine novice or a seasoned enthusiast, these holiday wine pairing tips will make your celebrations unforgettable.With a few simple tips and secrets, you'll confidently pick winners every time. From classic turkey to creative desserts, there's a match for every course.\nTips for perfect holiday wine pairings\nHere are the top tips for choosing wines to complement your holiday dishes and delight your guests. Understanding basic pairing principles will help you confidently navigate the world of holiday wines.\nCreate balance\nOne of the most important concepts in wine pairing is to create balance in flavor and intensity. Pair delicate foods with light and subtle wines, and rich and hearty dishes with robust, full-bodied wines.\nSweetness is another area where balance is an important consideration.To avoid flavor clashes, choose a wine that's as sweet or slightly sweeter than your dish.\nAcidity is another important factor.Many holiday foods, like buttery mashed potatoes or juicy prime rib, are rich and fatty. High-acid wines can cut through these dishes, so you can taste each bite of food as if it were your first.\nFinally, select wines that go with the herbs and spices in your dish rather than overpower them. When selecting a wine, focus on your dish's most prominent spices or herbs.\nAdd variety to your holiday wines\nDon't forget sparkling wines - they're not just for toasts. They're versatile and can pair well with everything from appetizers to main courses to desserts.\nUsing regional wines is another way to add variety. Wines often pair well with foods from the same region. For example, serve Italian wines with Italian dishes.\nWhen it comes to holiday wine pairing, there are tried and true favorites that you can count on. If you are in doubt, choose crowd-pleasing wines like pinot noir or sauvignon blanc. These classic wines pair well with a variety of holiday dishes.\nMake sure you offer various non-alcoholic alternatives for your guests.Provide high-quality grape juices or non-alcoholic wines for those who don't drink alcohol.\nServing and enjoying holiday wine\nMake sure you serve your wines at the right temperature. Serve white wines chilled and serve red wines slightly below room temperature. The correct temperature can significantly affect the taste and enjoyment of your wine.\nLastly, trust yourself and don't worry too much about the rules. If you enjoy a particular wine with a certain dish, then that's the perfect pairing for you.\nPerfect wines for your holiday feast\nNow that we've covered the essential tips for holiday wine pairing, let's review some specific recommendations for your holiday table. Whether you're serving a traditional roast turkey, a succulent ham or vegetarian options, there is a wine that will make your meal even better.\nThese are suggestions meant to inspire you, not strict rules. Experiment and choose the wine pairing that seems right for you and your guests.\nTurkey or chicken\nWhen serving roast turkey, choose a versatile chardonnay. Oaked, full-bodied chardonnays offer a richness that pairs well with white meat and many side dishes.\nIf you prefer red wine, a medium-bodied pinot noir goes well with the delicate poultry flavors. The wine's light to medium body and bright acidity pair well with both white and dark meat.\nHam\nHoliday ham 's saltiness and subtle sweetness make for interesting wine pairings. A slightly sweet riesling is a fabulous choice. The wine's natural sweetness balances the ham's saltiness, while its crisp acidity cuts through the richness of the meat.\nFor red wine enthusiasts, a fruity zinfandel is a perfect match. Its bold berry flavors and hints of spice stand up well to the strong flavors of ham, especially if it's glazed or honey baked.\nBeef\nBold red wines truly shine when it comes to beef. A full-bodied cabernet sauvignon is a classic choice for a beef roast like prime rib. The tannins in the wine help cut through the beef's richness.\nAnother outstanding option is a rich malbec. Malbec has a smooth texture that goes well with a tender, well-prepared roast. The wine's moderate acidity helps balance the richness of the meat.\nLamb\nLamb's rich, slightly gamey flavors are best paired with robust wines. Medium or full-bodied reds are ideal companions for this flavorful meat. A syrah's dark fruit and smoky character pair beautifully with grilled or roasted lamb.\nBordeaux blends, typically consisting of cabernet sauvignon, merlot and cabernet franc, are another fantastic choice. These wines provide a complex flavor and go especially well with lamb cooked with herbs like rosemary or thyme.\nPork\nPork's versatility allows for a range of wine pairings. Choose a medium-bodied red like merlot, which offers plum flavors that complement pork's lean meat.\nAlternatively, a fuller-bodied white like viognier is the perfect choice for enhancing pork's subtle flavors. For pork dishes with fruity sauces or glazes, a pinot gris is an excellent choice, as its crisp acidity balances the sauce's sweetness.\nVegetarian dishes\nFocus on the meal's dominant flavors, textures and cooking methods rather than defaulting to white wines. Mushrooms, with their earthy, umami flavors, pair well with light to medium-bodied red wines like pinot noir.\nCrisp white wines work well with green vegetables and salads. A sauvignon blanc beautifully enhances the flavors of asparagus, bell peppers or zucchini dishes. Try a fuller-bodied white like a viognier or an unoaked chardonnay for roasted root vegetables.\nDessert\nPairing wines with desserts can be a delightful way to end a meal. The wine should be as sweet or sweeter as the dessert so it doesn't taste bitter or sour in comparison. Sauternes, a sweet white wine from Bordeaux, France, goes well with fruit-based desserts.\nRuby port is a classic choice for chocolate desserts. The wine's sweetness and body stand up to dark chocolate's intensity. Moscato d'Asti, a light, sweet and slightly sparkling wine, is perfect for lighter desserts. It pairs wonderfully with fresh fruit, light pastries or sorbet.\nToast to perfect pairings\nWine pairing is both an art and a science. These tips provide a foundation but trust your palate and experiment. After all, the most important part of any holiday gathering is the joy of sharing good food and drink with loved ones.\nAnne Jolly is the creator of the food blog Upstate Ramblings. She loves cooking, especially for the holidays \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

MICHAELS — On Saturday morning, the streets were filled with families in holiday getup as dozens of floats made their ways through the center of the town for the Talbot Street Parade.The Talbot Street Parade is a time-honored holiday tradition in St. Michaels that includes marching bands, antique cars and boats, horses and representatives of the town's vibrant business and nonprofit community.\nAshley Russ, a parade attendee and St. Michaels native, said as a child her family would take her to the parade every year. Now as an adult with her own family, she is happy to pass down the tradition to her son.\nRuss said her son most loved the fire trucks, which opened the parade, and the horses that decorated with festive tinsel, vines and reindeer horns.\nMaydeen Merino, an attendee of the parade, said she enjoyed the motorcycle Santas that made an appearance and the Chesapeake Bay Retrievers and their well-dressed dogs who adorned sweaters, scarves and bandanas.\n\"It's a really cute community event, and I love how enthusiastic the whole town was for this parade,\" Merino said.\nThe parade is a part of a weekend-long fundraiser event known as Christmas in St. Michaels. Beginning in 1987, Christmas in St. Michaels has raised more than $1.7 million for local nonprofit organizations including Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers, St. Michaels site, St. Michaels Community Center and the St. Michaels Fire Department. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Railroad Street and W. Belle Street, enjoying vendors, massive displays of holiday lights, and a wide array of activities for families and children.\nMany children ice skated — some for the first time — outside of the Ridgely Town Hall, while couples young and old posed for photos underneath the town's mistletoe sign. At the other end of the festival, kids enjoyed an area full of inflatable slides, bounce houses and games.\nIn between the town hall and inflatables, the historic Ridgely Train Station welcomed visitors in for pictures with Santa and a Christmas tree display from the students and parent-teacher association at Ridgely Elementary School.\nGarret and Pat Falcone, a couple from Chestertown, were enjoying their second trip to the festival. There was no doubt in their minds that they would come back for another year after last year's experience.\n\"The people. Everyone is so nice,\" Garret Falcone said of why he loves the event.\n\"I love the decorations. They're really cool,\" Pat Falcone said.\nRidgely Clerk-Treasurer and event organizer Stephanie Berkey said the town stuck to its usual strong suits this year, namely horse-drawn carriage rides and train rides for attendees. She said holiday characters, such as Elsa, Olaf and Buddy the Elf, were new additions to the event.\nPeople from as far away as New Jersey and southern Virginia made the trip to Caroline County, she said. As always, Berkey's favorite aspect of the event was the smiles it brought to children.\n\"Seeing kids try to ice skate for the very first time, it's so much fun to see,\" she said. \"And when you see all the parents that are taking the pictures of them having such a good time, that makes it all worth it. It's the happiness that it brings to everybody.\"\nAround $50,000 was raised to make the Winter Festival a go, Berkey said. Keeping it a non-ticketed venture is the town's aim.\n\"The big thing that we've always said is that if we ever get in a position where we can't cover those costs and would have to charge, we don't want to do it any longer,\" Berkey said. \"We want to be able to give the people of this area something they can bring their whole family to, where they can make a Christmas memory and they don't have to bring any money.\"\nPlanning for the town's marquee event in 2025 has already begun. Berkey said there may be some new offerings to keep things fresh for loyal festivalgoers.\n\"We are thinking that next year, we would like to try and maybe add something new, some kind of a new attraction, just to keep people interested in it,\" she said. \"We don't want it to be stale next year. We want to still have all the charm and have everything that we have, but maybe add another attraction to it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And are a tradition in every sense of the word, representing local history as well as being a fond memory to usher in the Christmas spirit for all ages, according to Worth.\nSet up for the skillfully crafted displays begins in November.\nAn interactive scavenger hunt encouraged kids to explore the venue and note intrinsic details found within the train sets.\nWith a silent auction of historic train memorabilia and train kits for sale, all proceeds went toward the society's efforts to keep the spirit of local railroads alive and preserve the Centreville Station Freight Depot.\nNew this year, the Festival of Trains was also part of the 2024 Tour the Shore, a family oriented scavenger hunt for collectible stickers presented by local railroad clubs including Delmarva Model Railroad Club, Eagle Line Railroad, Rescue Fire Company, First State Model Railroad Club and Sudlersville Train Station Museum.

    "content": "How long is too long for Christmas decorations\n\n December 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michele Brosius Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 869\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The holiday season sparks lively discussions about traditions and preferences — from pumpkin spice to candy corn and the timing of Christmas decorations. Once the tree is up and the halls are decked, the question becomes how long holiday decorations should stay — is there a perfect timeline, or is it all about personal choice and sentimental value?For some, clearing the decorations right after New Year's symbolizes a fresh start. Others follow tradition and keep the festive spirit alive until the Twelfth Night on Jan. 5. Then, some stretch the season further — leaving lights aglow months after the holiday ends — prompting the age-old question: When to take down Christmas decorations?\nChristmas decor through the ages\nOnce central to winter solstice celebrations, evergreen trees symbolized life during the darkest days. By the 16th century, candles were added to represent Christ's light, and the tradition spread through Europe and America, evolving with tinsel, glass ornaments and electric lights.\nToday, Christmas decor reflects diverse styles, from traditional red and green to minimalist or trendy themes like pink Christmas. Whether rustic, glamorous or nature inspired, modern decorations allow for a personalized festive atmosphere.\nHoliday decor: Tradition vs. personal preference\nIn some families, tradition dictates that all decorations come down on Epiphany, Jan. 6, marking the Twelfth Night when the Wise Men visited baby Jesus. Others prefer not to wait that long, taking down the tree the morning after Christmas and cleaning the house in time for New Year's Eve festivities.\nYou might be one of those people who would appreciate a year-round tree if you love Christmas, the holiday candies that come with it and the warm and cozy feeling of having a glowing tree in the corner of your room. The internet is full of year-round Christmas tree decor ideas like a sparkly heart-themed Valentine's Day tree or a pretty pastel tree to welcome spring.\nAccording to a 2023 poll on Bob Vila, 16% of respondents said they take their Christmas decor down immediately following the holiday. Just over 60% of respondents said they typically leave decorations up until the conclusion of Epiphany — and the remainder — 21% of poll participants — indicated that they enjoy keeping their decorations in place at least until the end of January.\nMultiple factors at play\nFor many, deciding when to take holiday decor down results from several factors. These include whether or not they need to get their closets or garage storage space back in order, the types of decor and if it's fragile or a family heirloom that requires greater care.\nThe availability of community recycling and environmental waste disposal can also be a factor for those opting for a real tree over an artificial one. The National Fire Protection Association reports that most Christmas tree fires occur in January, often due to dried-out trees that pose a heightened fire risk. Safety is key if you plan to keep your real tree up for an extended period.\nChristmas tree safety\nProper care and precautions can help ensure Christmas tree safety throughout the holiday season. Water your tree daily to keep it from drying out and becoming a fire hazard. Position the tree away from heat sources like radiators or fireplaces, which can accelerate drying and increase risk. Check that all lights are in good condition, avoid any frayed cords or broken bulbs and always turn off the lights before leaving the house or going to bed.\nEnergy efficiency\nAnother important consideration is the higher energy bills in keeping Christmas tree lights and outdoor holiday lighting running throughout the day. While there are energy-efficient LED lights on the market, given the additional expenses acquired during the holiday season, keeping electricity bills down during this time can be a priority for some.\nCaring for your Christmas decorations\nWhen you finally put your decorations away, making them last will require proper care and storage. Wrap fragile decorations individually in tissue paper or bubble wrap, and store them in sturdy, divided containers to prevent breakage. Wrap string lights around cardboard or a spool to avoid tangling, and check for any damaged bulbs before storage.\nArtificial trees should be disassembled and stored in their original box or a tree bag to protect against dust and moisture. Keep all decorations in a cool, dry space, away from extreme temperatures or humidity. Proper storage ensures your decorations stay in great condition for many holiday seasons to come.\nWhen to take Christmas decorations down\nDeciding when to take down Christmas decorations is a personal choice shaped by tradition, practicality and lifestyle. Whether you follow a historical timeline like Epiphany, embrace a New Year's refresh or extend the festive spirit, the key is finding what suits your home and schedule.\nYour lifestyle and preferences will dictate the best answer to how long Christmas decorations should stay up, and when it comes down to it, if someone isn't contributing to the household or paying your energy bill, then their opinion on the topic shouldn't matter. Do what makes you and your family happy and let the grinches of the world scowl from afar.\nMichele Brosius is the creator of Midlife Healthy Living where she expertly combines her love for cooking with budget-conscious nutrition strategies.

Other attractions will include a 360 photo booth, hot chocolate, popcorn and cotton candy, and face painting.\nThere will be a DJ booth all evening and multiple live bands and special groups performing throughout the night.\nBut the main event of the night is the crab drop, where an 8-foot-wide Maryland blue crab sculpture created by Rich and Suzanne Hood 19 years ago that will drop similar to New York City's ball drop at 9 p.m. and at midnight.\nWhen the crab reaches the bottom of the rig, it lights up the numbers for the new year.\nAfter the 9 p.m. crab drop, Union Baptist Church will premiere multiple choirs and soloists Lane Morgan and Quinten George. After the choirs and soloists perform, The Rev. Demetrius Price will be delivering a message. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The show starts at 7 p.m. Tickets are $30.\n\"The dynamic father-son team Ken & Brad Kolodner weave together a captivating soundscape on hammered dulcimer and clawhammer banjo blurring the lines of Old-Time, Bluegrass and American Roots music,\" the Avalon said in an announcement.\n\"Regarded as one of the most influential hammered dulcimer players in North America, Baltimore's Ken Kolodner joined forces in 2009 with his son Brad Kolodner, a renowned clawhammer banjo player. They've sculpted their own brand of driving, innovative, tasteful acoustic roots music with a \"creative curiosity that lets all listeners know that a passion for traditional music yet thrives in every generation.\"\nThe quartet won 1st place in the Neo-Traditional Band Contest at the Appalachian Stringband Festival in the summer of 2019 and they're still going strong!\nGOLDPINEGoldpine will have a performance at the Stoltz LIstening Room at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 9.\nTickets are $25\n\"From festivals like 30A Songwriting Festival and Bristol Rhythm & Roots Reunion, to listening rooms throughout the United States, Ben and Kassie have been offering their own brand of raw Americana to audiences large and small. Winner of the 2022 Rocky Mountain Songwriter Contest and Finalists in the Kerrville Folk Fest 2021 New Folk Competition, the duo's bold harmonies are clearly a channel for their highly charged songwriting,\" according to a show announcement.\nFor more: https://avalonfoundation.org/event/goldpine \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Music bingo was a success, and everyone moved their heads enjoying the music while kids played and enjoyed the night.\nEvent organizers had to pivot for the 9 p.m. crab drop with rain and lightning near the area. The crab drop was moved back until 9:15 p.m., which some longtime locals had never seen before.\nAlthough some locals voiced their dismay at the delay, everyone stayed until the new time, even when it started to rain. Due to technical difficulties, the 2025 sign did not light up until 9:16 p.m., but attendees enjoyed the event despite the hiccup.\nLocal couple Dan Helfgott and Kim Helfgott have been married for 38 years, and they just moved to Easton last year and they enjoyed all the festivities and the crab drop.\n\"We moved here a year ago,\" new local Kim said. \"Last year we were unpacking, and we missed the crab drop last year, so we really wanted to see it this year.\"\n\"It's just like Times Square, but with a crab,\" Dan said. \"I've been in Times Square. I saw the ball drop in Times Square. This is just as festive.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "'Ziggy's World': Rock Hall artist keeps wheels turning on train display\n\n January 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BOB FORD Special to the Kent County News | Section: Entertainment \n \n 712\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When Ziggy Carter immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1960 at the age of 14, he carried with him two suitcases.\"In one suitcase were my clothes,\" Carter says. \"In the other, smaller but somewhat heavier, were my electric trains.\"\nA fascination with model trains has, obviously, been a lifelong obsession for Carter, and, until recently, finding a place to create a holiday display for his treasures was stretching into what seemed like a lifelong quest as well.\n\"For the last five years, I was always looking for a store window to use, but everyone was worried about liability or insurance,\" Carter says. \"Then I asked Fresh Start and they said I could have their whole greenhouse. It's wonderful.\"\nCarter, a multi-talented artist and builder, who has become a quaint, if quirky symbol of a town sometimes described the same way, finally found a place to unpack.\n\"He came to us in October with the train show idea and it was great timing,\" said Nina Flynn, the manager of Fresh Start, a produce-centric grocery near the central crossroads of Main and Sharp Streets. \"Rich (owner Rich Seewald) and I did a little train set thing last year around the holidays and we underestimated how difficult it was. Ziggy said he could definitely do a better train show.\"\nWell, yes. Carter's huge collection of trains and assorted paraphernalia now fill the 30-foot by 40-foot greenhouse at the rear of Fresh Start, a space that was available at this time of year. As many as eight trains whir around the intricate series of tracks; over bridges, around bends, and through Henry's Mountain, a large plaster eminence built at the request of local photographer JP Henry.\n\"He said he would like to see a mountain, so I had to build a mountain,\" Carter says.\nThe trains, which began operating the weekend after Thanksgiving, ran from noon to 4 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays, through Sunday, Jan. 5. The expansive display itself can be seen during all regular store hours. More than 100 local businesses and individuals contributed funds to help Carter build the incredible show. He also invested more than $1,000 of his own money.\n\"Saturdays are a big day. We get a lot of kids and a lot of older people reminiscing about the old days and the trains they had around the Christmas tree,\" Carter says. \"The kids like to chase the trains around the table, following them as they go.\"\nCarter is best-known around Rock Hall for his artistic installations. He built the six-foot blue heron metal sculpture displayed outside Harbor Shack, and executed the whimsical storefront sign above the That Place On Main restaurant, and created the more-than-life-size depictions of Snoopy and Woodstock at the American Rock Hall Garage. Carter was also the featured artist for the 2024 Rock Hall FallFest promotional poster that was on display all over Kent County.\nRock Hall was not necessarily a destination for Carter when his sailboat broke down here 25 years ago, but he eventually made it his home.\n\"I was shipwrecked,\" he says. \"I was only planning to stay for one night. I was sailing south from Maine on a 40-foot Hinckley, having come down through the canal, and was having engine problems, and some other problems as well.\"\nAfter sorting those out, he decided to stay, and somehow the trains got here, too. Carter, who turned 78 last month, has been battling health problems as he worked to pull together the holiday display. He receives a chemotherapy treatment every two weeks, a course that will last through most of February. It is the main reason for the limited hours he is able to run the trains.\n\"It really knocks you, and I've lost 60 pounds,\" Carter says. \"The doctors just say, 'We'll see how it goes.' What can you do? I'm enjoying what I'm doing here, and I've had a wonderful life with great adventures. No regrets at all.\"\nThe only regret might have been if his holiday train display, something he imagined in his fertile mind's eye for so long, had not become a reality. But here it is, chugging along literally the same way Carter is chugging along metaphorically. The layout is loud, and colorful, and full of action, surprises, and the delights for the season. Pretty much the same as him. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It will run April 17 to 27 at the Oxford Community Center.\nAuditions will be held at the Avalon Theatre in Easton at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 14, and Wednesday, Jan. 15.\nPlay summary:After history professor John Oldman unexpectedly resigns from the University, his startled colleagues impulsively invite themselves to his home, pressing him for an explanation. But they're shocked to hear his reason for premature retirement: John claims he must move on because he is immortal, and cannot stay in one place for more than ten years without his secret being discovered. Tempers rise and emotions flow as John's fellow professors attempt to poke holes in his story, but it soon becomes clear that his tale is as impossible to disprove as it is to verify. What starts out as a friendly gathering soon builds to an unexpected and shattering climax. Acclaimed science fiction writer Jerome Bixby, writer of the original 'Star Trek' and 'The Twilight Zone', originally conceived this story back in the early 1960's. It would become his last great work.\n\"TAP will be casting 10 roles.

The more than 40 sculptures have been or are being carved by Ice Lab.\nRicky Fitzhugh, chief ice officer of Ice Lab, said the time it takes to carve each sculpture depends on the detail of the sculpture.\n\"But it could (be) anywhere from an hour to five or six hours of carving,\" he said.\nSponsored by the Hyatt Regency Chesapeake Bay Golf Resort, Spa and Marina and a variety of other Mid-Shore businesses and organizations, the event will be held in downtown Cambridge, at the Packing House and at the Hyatt. Shuttles will provide transportation between locations.\nFor the oyster part of the festival, the watermen of Dorchester County and some of the region's top oyster farms will be selling oysters. Christopher said that along with raw oysters, there will be oysters prepared in different ways, like roasted oysters.\n\"The Dorchester Seafood Heritage Association will be serving wild caught oysters,\" Christopher said. \"And then we will have five other aquaculture guys that are all local that grow the oysters local. Each of those oysters are slightly different. They've got different salinity, different taste.\"\nAccording to the news release, local oyster farms that will be at the event include Choptank Terrapin Oyster Co., Farm Creek Oyster Co., Madhouse Oysters and Madison Bay Seafood.\nWith all the ice, festival-goers will be able to warm up at fire pits and make s'mores.\nThe festival will also have beverages to keep everyone — including those who are 21 and older — warm. From coffee to hot chocolate to craft beer and cocktails, attendees will be able to take their pick.\nThe event will kick off at the Packing House on the evening of Friday, Jan. 17. That night, there will be ice skating at the Hyatt Winter Village and interactive ice sculptures in downtown Cambridge. On Saturday, Jan. 18, events will be held throughout the day in downtown Cambridge and at the Hyatt Winter Village. There is no cost for admission to the festival.\nThe Rescue Fire Company Train Garden will be open during the festival.\nMore information about the Cambridge Ice & Oyster Festival can be found on the festival's website at iceoysterfest.com.

The stigma used to be that you never told anyone you read romance, she said, now the genre is becoming more and more popular by readers of all types.\nTo have a physical bookstore and in-person book clubs that romance book lovers can flock to is nothing short of a dream come true, said Amanda Parsons, of Chestertown.\nRomance is a rapidly expanding genre, according to indie author Kristie Wolf, of Bel Air who came out to the ribbon cutting in support of local businesses and fellow authors.\nThe best part of romance novels, both writing and reading, is the guaranteed happy ending, Wolf said, which fills her days with much needed hope.\nIndie author Sarah Blue provided signings and promotions of her latest page turners last Saturday. From paranormal to contemporary, Blue writes a little bit of everything in the genre of romance,\"I can't stay in one lane,\" she said.\nThe great part of writing romance books is there aren't too many rules to follow and Blue loves the opportunity to write stories that she wants to read.\nLocal authors supporting a local woman-owned businesses in a small town, \"is a match made in heaven,\" said indie author B.R. Goodwin performing book signings.\nBeing a self-published author is similar to owning your own businesses and indie authors are always supportive of each other, according to Goodwin.\nIndie authors are always sharing, supporting and encouraging each other and readers are vicarious who love devouring anything, author Claire Cain said.\nHicks has been delighted in the new people she has met through connecting over books and as the flocks of the opening day's crowd gathered, community support has been extremely receptive and supportive of the store.\nThe best thing about romance books is sharing a sense of escapism with other readers, which in this day and age is needed more than ever, Hicks said.\nRomance-Landia has a schedule of regular indie author visits and book clubs are held Thursdays once a month\nLocated at 204 Banjo Lane, more information about Romance-Landia Bookstore, including upcoming author visits and bookclubs can be found at https://www.romance-landia.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2025-01-16",

    "content": "The secret world of fancy butter: Is the hype worth your buck?\n\n January 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jennifer Allen Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1200\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Enter the secret world of fancy butter, where class and sophistication define every dish they're added to. While high-end butters like Bordier and Kerrygold offer richer flavors and a smoother texture, the question remains: Is it worth splurging $20 or more for the indulgence?What is fancy butter?Fancy butter is a high-quality butter with unique characteristics that you just don't get in your supermarket brands. These distinct qualities can include higher butterfat content, a complex taste or a softer texture. They can also be made from the milk of grass-fed cows or select breeds that have more flavorful milk, or even from goat's milk.\nIf you're wondering why butter usually tastes better in restaurants, gourmet butters might be the reason. In 2021, The Guardian discussed the growing restaurant trend of using fancy, handmade butter, such as those flavored with herbs, spices or even smoked bone marrow, to deliver a different flavor experience.\nIs a stick of fancy butter worth it?An article in HuffPost states that fancy butters contain higher butterfat than ordinary butter, especially those from Europe which can go up to 87% versus your store brand which hovers around 80%. This higher butterfat content gives the butter a richer flavor and lower moisture content, which improves mouthfeel, taste and texture. \"What's the point of having good bread if you don't use good butter,\" is a sentiment shared by many, including Amanda Luhn from Knoxville Backyard & Beyond.\nStatista has projected the price of butter to rise even more in 2025, and with increased demand, is gourmet butter better? From French butter that could range up to $82 per pound to Irish grass-fed butter like Kerrygold, are these pricey spreads worth every buck, or are they just a modern fad?\nBordier butter: Justifying the French crazeFrench butter is revered worldwide for its rich flavor and texture, which elevates everyday dishes from soups to pastries. Ashley Wali, creator of Wanderlux, recommends visiting creameries and grocery stores in France to experience true French butter craftmanship. \"They pass airport security and will stay cold until you get home. It's the perfect edible souvenir you can't get anywhere else,\" she says.\nOne of the most famous French butter is Bordier butter, a handcrafted butter made with high-quality organic milk from small local French farms in regions like Brittany, Normandy and Pays de la Loire. Starting at $12 for a 4-ounce stick, this premium butter will give you a unique creamy, silky texture and complex flavors, which change with the seasons due to the varying cow diets.\nBordier butter is made using traditional methods, including churning, kneading and salting by hand. With meticulous attention to detail in its production, this luxurious butter is a beloved ingredient in professional kitchens and among food enthusiasts, making every penny you spend worth it.\n\"Sure, it's not always cheap — hello, sticker shock — but there's no comparison when you're spreading it on warm bread or swirling it into a sauce,\" says Bitty of Eighty Recipes who's been stashing specialty butters in their freezer. \"Flavored ones, like Bordier, are incredible and hold up perfectly for months. When you treat butter as more than just an ingredient, it can make a meal sing,\" she adds.\nGrass-fed butter: Healthy and fancyGrass-fed butter is made from the milk of cows that eat a diet of 100% grass without grain or corn supplementation. This means the color of grass-fed butter is deeper due to the carotene and chlorophyll in the grass, making it richer than grain-fed cows. Because of the diverse grasses and herbs the cows consume, grass-fed butter offers a rich, creamy taste with nutty undertones.\nAngus Dalton explains in the TastingTable that grass-fed butter contains higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids which are essential for brain and heart health and could help manage depression. It's also rich in conjugated linoleic acid which can aid in weight loss.\nGrass-fed butter is a healthier option than traditional grain-fed butter that are high in saturated fats. This premium butter can cost $5-12 per pound based on brand and whether it's organic or specialty butter.\nIs Irish butter just better?An 8-ounce slab of Irish butter for $4-7 will give you a sweeter and more flavorful alternative due to its higher butterfat content and the cows' grass-fed diet. According to Real Simple, it contains 82% butterfat, which makes it creamier, spreadable and more flavorful than American butter. Lovers of Irish butter, like Glenda from Glenda Embree Blog, reserve this pricy butter for special occasions.\nReal Simple states that the sweeter taste comes from the beta-carotene in Ireland's lush, nutrient-rich pastures the cows graze on. This also contributes to the butter's distinctive bright yellow color. Irish butter is mostly uncultured and unsalted, unlike most European butter, making it smoother and milder in taste.\nThe most famous brand of Irish butter is Kerrygold which launched in the United States in 1990 with its first product, Kerrygold cheese. The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society reports Kerrygold holds the number one position in the U.S. market for imported butter, and Wirecutter has named it one of the best butters of 2024, describing its texture as \"luxuriously creamy, dense and silky, without any mouth-coating greasiness.\"\nThe creative spreads of flavored butterIf you want to go fancy without spending a fortune, try making flavored or compound butter at home. Compound butter is butter mixed with other ingredients, like herbs, spices or even alcohol, to enhance its taste. It's another method of adding flavor to your dishes and improving your butter's flavor profile. Here are some notable examples you can whip up to make you feel like a five-star chef in your kitchen.\nHerb compound butterIf you're looking for butter that adds a luxurious aroma to your dishes, herb compound butter might be for you. This flavored butter ranges from combining shallot, rosemary asiago or lemon herb for that rich, savory flavor to your recipes.\nGarlic compound butterA popular staple in restaurants and home kitchens, garlic compound butter, such as roasted garlic, lemon garlic, garlic powder and black garlic, offers various savory, aromatic flavors for bread, meats, seafood, vegetables, pasta and even vegetarian meals. This makes this fancy butter a versatile ingredient that will help you invent that signature dish you've been planning ever since.\nSweet compound butterUse sweet compound butter, such as apple herb, cinnamon honey and maple brown sugar, to combine sweet and savory flavors in your dishes. Flavored butter of this variety works wonders in baked goods, breakfast items and meats.\nSavory compound butterTo introduce bold and rich flavors, incorporate savory compound butter into your dishes, such as blue cheese, bacon, four cheese and pesto basil. This flavored butter is ideal for meats, vegetables and baked goods.\nFinal words on fancy butterAdding fancy butter to your arsenal of ingredients should be based on your preference and budget, not primarily on social status. With several options to choose from, gourmet butter should not only be used for sophistication but to also create mouthwatering dishes that will have your guests asking for seconds.\nJennifer Allen, retired chef turned cookbook author, blogger and traveler, shares her adventures and travel tips at All The Best Spots. Living at home with her family — and the cats that rule them all — her work has been featured in The Washington Post, Seattle Times, MSN and more. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Ice & Oyster Festival brings crowd to downtown Cambridge\n\n January 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 488\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Although Friday's comparatively warmer temperatures kept the more than 40 ice sculptures off the streets of downtown Cambridge for the first day of the Cambridge Ice and Oyster Festival, they didn't stop festival-goers from having a good time.As Caleb Stine strummed his guitar at the Packing House Friday, people mingled and filled their stomachs with everything from grilled oysters with cheese, bacon and salsa to steaming hot gumbo.\nCambridge resident Kathy Ridgely said she loves the live entertainment, variety of vendors and seafood the event offers every year.\n\"It's just a great opportunity for community,\" she said.\nAlong with the Packing House, the two-day, admission-free festival was held at the Hyatt Regency Chesapeake Bay Golf Resort, Spa and Marina and in downtown Cambridge. Shuttles offered festival-goers easy transport between locations.\nDorchester Chamber of Commerce President Bill Christopher said although it was too warm to set up the ice sculptures until about 9:30 p.m. Friday night, the Packing House was \"packed.\"\n\"And the shuttle was full, running people around up to the ice skating rink at the Hyatt,\" he said. \"So people had plenty to do even though we didn't have the sculptures for them to look at downtown. The restaurants were still open, shops were still open.\"\nGayle Quillin, a Cambridge resident who arrived at the Packing House Friday evening with a group of friends and family, said they first went downtown Friday, but nothing was going on yet.\n\"So we came over here,\" she said.\nQuillin said she always looks forward to the people at the festival every year.\n\"We just love all the people down there and getting to see our neighbors,\" she said.\nSponsored by the Hyatt Regency Chesapeake Bay and a variety of other Mid-Shore businesses and organizations, the event was put on by the Dorchester Chamber of Commerce and Ice Lab with help from Cambridge Main Street and Dorchester County Tourism.\nChristopher said he wanted to thank the numerous sponsors of the event, whose sponsorship supports downtown Cambridge businesses.\n\"Because that's what this is all about,\" he said. \"Bringing people into downtown to get folks into the restaurants and the shops in the January timeframe, which is normally very slow. And I think we were successful at making that happen again.\"\nIce sculptures, once they were set up, remained up for attendees to marvel over and interact with all of Saturday.\n\"I mean, the temperature was probably better for humans than ice,\" Christopher said. \"But the fact that it was overcast helped the sculptures hold up really well for the day.\"\nLast year, weather also had an affect on the festival. The event's first day was canceled because of warm weather.\nChristopher said the Chamber has received overwhelmingly positive feedback about the fourth annual event. He said the Chamber estimates the festival brought in as many people as last year. He said Saturday was busy and he thinks the restaurants and shops got a lot of business.\n\"It's nice to see Cambridge alive and breathing,\" Ridgely said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Maryland author releases new historical mystery",

    "content": "Maryland author releases new historical mystery\n\n January 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 834\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Author Carol McCabe Booker recently released her latest book \"The Farmer's Wife\" through New Bay Books.The book details the 1877 mystery of why a woman who had just picked a basket of cabbage leaves for dinner was murdered in a field in the village of Friendship in Anne Arundel County.\nAccording to the New Bay Books website, \"The Farmer's Wife\" is the third in the Lusby resident's nonfiction series exploring historic events in 19th- and early 20th- century Southern Maryland.\nIt follows 2021's \"Cove Point on the Chesapeake\" and her 2023 best-selling \"The Waterman's Widow,\" which was one of the Top-10 nonfiction books checked out of the Calvert Library in 2024.\nThe 129-page mystery is available for $17 at www.newbaybooks.com.\nHow long have you been writing, and how did you get started?\nI started writing as a pre-teen, always focusing on nonfiction. I liked reporting on events either in school or the community. Then, one day I learned of the upcoming scrapping of a luxury cruise ship, the SS Ile de France, and it inspired me to write an essay on the great lady's history on the high seas. It was published by the New York Daily News, and it convinced me that a career as a journalist was indeed possible. A summer internship at the Voice of America while I was in college made it happen.\nWhat inspires you to write?\nI am inspired by the discovery of information that seems too fascinating or important not to share with others.\nDo you consider writing to be a career?\nIt was my first career, starting in radio with the Voice of America, covering civil rights. I reported for Westinghouse Broadcasting from the Nigerian civil warfront, and on other stories throughout Africa while freelancing for magazines such as Reader's Digest, Ebony, and Jet. It was a wonderful career, but I also had a fascination with the law. I went to Georgetown Law School with the idea of combining the two.\nWhat kind of writing process do you use?\nI think it might best be described as a journalistic approach.\nWho are some of your favorite authors and why?\nTwo of my favorites are historical nonfiction writers, Timothy Egan and Eric Larson. Egan's recent release, \"A Fever in the Heartland: The Ku Klux Klan's Plot to Take Over America, and the Woman Who Stopped Them,\" is a jaw-dropper. Larson's \"A Devil in the White City\" and \"Isaac's Storm\" are both unforgettable. And coincidentally, they are both journalists.\nWhat are you working on now?\nI'm working on another book about Southern Maryland in the 1870s. It was quite a decade.\nWhat do you want readers to know about you?\nI want readers to know that whichever of my books they pick up, they will find within it something they never knew, but which merits some thought in the context of the famous quote carved into stone in front of the National Archives: \"The Past is Prologue. Study the Past.\"\nPlease include a brief description of the book\nIn one of the wildest years in the post-Civil War period in Southern Maryland, one story in 1877 captured headlines across the country from May through December.\nThe press called it \"one of the most revolting murders in the annals of crime,\" and spared no details in their reporting on the arrest and trial of a young tenant farmer for the cold-blooded murder of his wife, the mother of his three children, in the tiny hamlet of Friendship in Anne Arundel county.\nSouthern Maryland, like much of the country at the time, was recovering not only from the Civil War, but also from the previous November's U.S. presidential election, which had resulted in no winner until a couple of days before Inauguration Day on March 4, 1877.\nPerhaps a harbinger of things to come, the year had begun with a frozen Chesapeake Bay imprisoning oyster boats, and leaving frostbitten watermen facing possible starvation until a thaw sent ice floes ripping into some of their hulls, cutting them in half. The Farmer's Wife follows the murder trial and the events that must have left many Southern Marylanders wondering \"what next?\nPlease include an excerpt from the book\n\"These were tumultuous times, from a contested presidential election to deadly weather extremes, a bloody railroad strike and the actions of national and local legislatures. Reporters in every state covered the news for avid readers, and Maryland historically had several very popular newspapers.\nYet, a single story first reported in The Baltimore Sun captured headlines throughout most of the year across the country. It was a tale of betrayal. Some called it an atrocious breach of faith; a fiendish, brutal violation of trust. Others even called it \"inhuman,\" with hints of demonic possession. It began in May with \"one of the most revolting murders in the annals of crime.\" The victim was a young mother who went to her grave never knowing why, and perhaps not even seeing her cowardly executioner.\nSteadily and in excruciating detail, nationally syndicated reports illuminated a cold-blooded crime more chilling than the past winter's paralyzing frosts on the Chesapeake Bay. No detail was spared.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Maryland stories: Filmmaker's new movie aims to scare\n\n January 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Ted Black tblack@somdnews.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 555\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the two decades since she graduated from Patuxent High School in southern Maryland, local actress, producer and writer Victoria (Fratz) Fradkin has developed a reputation among those familiar with horror films, and recently the newly christened mother unveiled her second such film in that genre.Fradkin, 37, a Maryland native who attended The Calverton School in Huntingtown as an eighth and ninth grader before transferring to Patuxent High, vaulted onto the scene nearly 10 years ago when her debut film, \"Electric Love\" (2018) won for best world premiere at the San Diego International Film Festival, followed three years later by her first horror film \"Val\" in 2021.\nLast November, Fradkin and her husband, Aaron Fradkin, a Los Angeles-based writer and director originally from Massachusetts, collaborated on yet another foray into the horror genre with \"Beezel,\" which was released last fall. Months later, only a week before Christmas, they welcomed their first child, a daughter, and the tandem has remained busy.\nHer newest film was released on streaming services nationwide last fall.\n\"When we first started to make 'Beezel' I wanted to be able to tell the story in three parts and then weave it together through one thread,\" Fradkin, who now lives on the West Coast in California, said. \"Of course, even after it's finished you never know how it's going to be received by the audience until you see it during the premiere. What I found most enjoyable was seeing and hearing the audience react in different scenes. It was pretty much the reactions that we were hoping for.\"\n\"Beezel\" covers six tumultuous decades as three unwitting guests of a cursed New England home stumble upon a sinister secret dwelling beneath its floors — an eternal witch with an insatiable thirst for the souls of the living. In actuality, the film was set inside the crawl space of the very home in which Aaron Fradkin was raised and his parents made no changes to the eery setting.\nAlthough she is trying to carve her own niche in the industry, especially among horror film makers, Fradkin admits there have been several influences along the way, including independent director Damien McCarthy known for \"Oddity\" and actress Naomi Watts, who has emerged as one of the leading ladies in the fright film set.\n\"I've tried my hand in acting, but I really feel more at home writing and producing,\" Fradkin said. \"A lot of the success from horror movies stems from the setting. We filmed much of 'Beezel' in my husband's parents' old house in the crawl space. It was really creepy, but it wasn't a set, it was just that way. His parents have since sold that house, but the new owners kept the crawl space the same way. They always wanted to live in a haunted house.\"\n\"Beezel\" follows on the heels of \"Val,\" co-written by Fradkin and her husband, produced by Victoria Fradkin, who also played the role of \"Jenny\" while Misha Reeves played the title character. Zachary Mooren, Erik Griffin, Sufe Bradshaw and Kyle Howard also play primary roles in the Patuxent graduate's first foray into the horror genre.\n\"I want people to know that movie was an escape to go back into the movies of the 2000s,\" Fradkin said. \"It doesn't take itself too seriously. We pretty much wrote the entire script with all of these actors in mind.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Travel experts share top bucket list destinations for 2025\n\n January 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Caitriona Maria Wealth of Geeks | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1235\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n 'Overtourism' is swallowing major destinations alive, with countries like Japan, Spain, Italy, and Indonesia suffering the effects. This is not surprising, considering that 80% of travelers visit just 10% of the world's tourist destinations, according to a McKinsey report.As travelers gear up for 2025, a growing emphasis is being placed on taking the road less traveled. In Expedia's Unpack '25 travel trends report, travelers are looking to take detours to less well-known and less crowded destinations, with 63% of consumers saying they are likely to visit a detour destination on their next trip.\nA Shift Toward Experiential TravelTechnavio predicts the travel market size is set to increase by $5,506.7 billion between 2023 and 2028, with experiential travel being a key driver of the market. Experiential travel allows modern travelers to connect to local cultures and traditions, and captivating content on social media sites like Instagram and TikTok fuels this trend.\n\"2025 is the year to leave your comfort zone and chase experiences that will truly take your breath away,\" says Ellen Flowers, travel editor at The Perennial Style. \"Travel is about pushing your boundaries, discovering new worlds, and connecting deeply with the places and people you encounter. For 2025, make it your goal to fill your bucket list with experiences that will shape your memories for a lifetime.\"\nHighlights of Bucket List DestinationsWe asked travel experts to discuss destinations and activities that go beyond the typical tourist trail, emphasizing adventure, cultural immersion, and sustainability. Travel experts singled out the following destinations and activities for their uniqueness and appeal:\nSvalbard, NorwayLocated in the Arctic Circle, Svalbard offers pristine wilderness and the chance to spot polar bears while experiencing some of the harshest and most stunning landscapes on Earth.\n\"Camping under the midnight sun in Svalbard, Norway,\" says Andrea Affinati, founder and travel expert at Voyaged Magazine. \"There's no dark sky to signal bedtime; you're wide awake at 2 a.m., basking in sunlight while surrounded by Arctic landscapes. It's surreal, and it forces you to disconnect from any concept of time. Add in the occasional visit from a curious reindeer, and it's something you'll talk about forever.\"\nLake Bled, SloveniaKnown for its emerald-green waters and fairy-tale setting, this European gem combines natural beauty with opportunities for hiking and local culinary indulgence.\n\"For a more serene yet equally memorable experience, head to Lake Bled, Slovenia, where you can row a traditional wooden boat across crystal-clear waters to reach the iconic Bled Castle — perfect for an Instagram-worthy moment and a peaceful escape,\" Flowers remarks.\nKanazawa, JapanKanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture's capital, might be less crowded than other parts of Japan but just as impressive, with the entire city classed as a UNESCO site for crafts and folk art.\n\"I always recommend Japan, and beyond the usual cities, Kanazawa should be on your list. This city is known for its Edo-period architecture, beautiful Kenrokuen Garden, and an up-and-coming art scene,\" says Affinati. \"It's also famous for its gold-leaf crafts — you can even try your hand at applying gold leaf to souvenirs or desserts.\"\nCultural Immersion and ConnectionCultural tourism and authentic experiences are leading to the exploitation of new paths. Destinations like Sri Lanka's Ceylon tea region and Oaxaca, Mexico, offer travelers the chance to connect deeply with local cultures and nature. Experts say these interactions can be a very rewarding aspect of travel.\n\"For a cultural experience, I suggest celebrating the Day of the Dead in Oaxaca, Mexico,\" Affinati says. \"This festival draws you in completely. Families invite you to see their altars, you can join them in the cemetery, and you [can] share traditional foods. It's a beautiful mix of joy and remembrance that really stays with you.\"\nFlowers says Sri Lanka's Resplendent Tea Trails offers the perfect cultural retreat. \"Nestled in the hills, it's the ideal place to sip tea while soaking in the serenity of tea plantations. It's a journey of both personal growth and cultural immersion, where each destination challenges you to step outside the ordinary and embrace the extraordinary.\"\nAdventure and Personal GrowthFor travelers seeking physical challenges, trekking the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal provides a unique opportunity to connect with the majestic Himalayan landscape while pushing personal limits.\n\"I would suggest trekking the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal,\" says Affinati. \"It's tough, but the views are worth it, and the connections you make with local communities along the way are deeply rewarding. Plus, you'll come back with a renewed sense of what you're capable of.\"\nSimilarly, Namibia's Sossusvlei dunes and Oman's wild camping experiences promise an exciting escapade alongside breathtaking scenery.\n\"Namibia is pure adventure. The landscapes here are epic, from the towering dunes of Sossusvlei to the shipwrecks along the Skeleton Coast, not to mention the incredible opportunities for spotting wildlife,\" Affinati says.\nAs for Oman, \"You'll feel like the last person on Earth with an incredible night sky. You might even see camels and nomads roaming around,\" Oberman says.\nOberman also puts in a good word for Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan in Iraq, for someone looking for a real adventure.\n\"I lived there for two years, and while it's in an 'orange' area, the region offers beautiful and unexpected nature: snow-capped mountains — even glaciers — waterfalls, gorges, canyons, and lush valleys,\" he says. \"One of the most stunning spots is Rawanduz, a small town built on a cliff edge. However, always go with a guide familiar with the area.\"\nWhile Oberman provides an interesting insight, the current Level Four \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for Iraq suggests that potential visitors may need to reconsider their plans or explore safer alternatives until conditions improve.\nSustainable Travel Takes Center StageTrip.com Group, a leading global travel service provider, reviewed 9,867 survey samples from 109 countries and territories for their Sustainable Travel Consumer Report 2024. They found that while an overwhelming 92% of travelers may consider sustainable travel, only 56.9% say they have actually practiced it. Travelers are on the lookout for more transparency around sustainable options, but a gap between awareness and action is still present.\nAs environmental awareness grows, travel experts we interviewed encourage travelers to plan trips responsibly. They recommend traveling off-season when there are fewer crowds, supporting sustainable, locally-owned businesses, and opting for eco-friendly accommodations.\nAffinati recommends taking it slow. \"Instead of hopping from city to city every couple of days, stay longer in one place. It reduces your transportation footprint and lets you experience a destination on a deeper level.\"\n\"Another practical tip is to choose eco-certified accommodations. These aren't just hotels with a 'save your towels' sign but places that actively work to reduce waste, conserve water, and support local ecosystems. I suggest looking for certifications like Green Key or EarthCheck when booking,\" she adds.\nAffinati also points to low-impact activities such as electric-powered boat tours, which \"allow you to explore without disturbing wildlife or polluting the water.\" In addition, you can cut down on single-use plastics, which are \"a huge problem in many popular destinations.\" Instead, opt for reusable items such as water bottles, utensils, and shopping bags.\nLooking Ahead to 2025With the lingering effects of pandemic-era restrictions, experts predict that 2025 will continue to see a surge in bucket-list trips as people make up for lost time. The McKinsey survey reports that 66% of travelers are more interested in travel now than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Travelers are highly influenced by the stories behind the destination, with 92% of young travelers taking inspiration from social media for their last trip.\nThe expectations for meaningful and experiential travel destinations are high for 2025 and beyond. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Local author asks, does a kitten belong in school?\n\n January 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 477\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Growing up in Massachusetts, in the mid-80's, second-grader Nancy Mugele, now Head of Kent School, a private day school in Chestertown, had an adorable and stubborn gray kitten that followed her to class.The affectionate feline was called Jingles. Her unique personality left a big impression because years later, the kitten would be the subject of Mugele's first children's book, \"Jingles Goes to School.\"\nLate October, Bumble Bee Books, the children's publishing department of Olympia Publishers, put out the book and can now be purchased at Bumblebee Books website, on Amazon, and locally here at the Book Plate, in downtown Chestertown.\nMugele based her book off her childhood, even mentioning her home, the house with the red shutters at 19 Bonney Lane. That was where Jingles escaped from back then, braving the New England winters to follow Mugele to school. Mugele's mother had to place her infant son in a stroller to come pick up Jingles.\n\"That's not normal behavior for a cat,\" Mugele said laughing.\nThis amusing anecdote is the plot of the book.\nIn between the colorful illustrated pages, Jingles displays to Nancy's teacher, Miss Bevivino, her class, and the principal, Mr. Willett, her love of learning. At one point, Jingles even plays the piano, \"learning to trill in all the right places,\" at the school concert.\nWill Jingles earn the affection of some of her harshest critics, like the principal?\nOne thing is for sure, Jingles loves school, and so does her creator, the Head of Kent School of nine years with a career in education over 20 years.\n\"It's really remarkable, the transformative power of books,\" Mugele expressed.\nShe witnesses this on a weekly basis, reading Jingles' adventures to her pre-k, kindergarten, and first graders, seeing their reactions.\n\"They absolutely love it. They ask a lot of questions. It's such a thrill when I show them actual pictures of Jingles, and see how their imaginations expand.\"\nFrom her enjoyment of reading aloud to her students, she pitched her story to eight publishers, and heard back from three of them — no small feat for a new author.\nOlympia Publishers appreciated that Mugele drew from her own experiences. They took care of the artwork and distribution, leaving Mugele to dream up future stories for Jingles.\nIn the meantime, \"Jingles Goes to School,\" will be coming out in hardback Jan. 30, and in the near future the author plans to do local book tours. She will also be doing one for a friend at Farley's Bookshop in Pennsylvania.\nHer passion however is to visit schools, reading to the kids.\n\"It is one of my most important meetings throughout the week,\" Mugele said.\nShe hones her writing skills on her blog site nancymugele.com, while envisioning new adventures to pen.\nAnd as she looks for more inspiration from her life, nobody is safe, especially her lovable black lab, \"River.\"\n\"He won't mind one bit if I make him the star,\" Mugele said with a smile. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Since 2022, the games are played on the second Sunday in February. The Super Bowl is the final game of every NFL Season since 1966. The Super Bowl was supposedly named after a children's toy.\nThere are many gatherings and parties held on Super Bowl Sunday, and everyone has a favorite food they serve — from finger foods to snacks, pizzas, chili, soups, sandwiches and subs to wings.\nNo matter whether you prepare them at home, pick up a carry out or order home delivery, enjoy the gathering. May the best team win.\nThe Kansas City Chiefs\nKANSAS CITY BRISKET BURNT ENDS\nBEEF: 3-4 lb Chuck Roast, 2 tbsp favorite barbecue seasoning, 1 tbsp canola oil.\nSAUCE: ¾ cup ketchup, ½ cup apple cider vinegar, 1.5 tbsp hot sauce, 1 tbsp brown sugar, ½ tbsp garlic paste, ½ tbsp Worcestershire sauce, salt to taste.\nCube your chuck roast into 1-inch cubes and place in a bowl. Lather with canola oil and then season with barbecue seasoning. Place the cubes onto a baking tray with about half an inch separation between each cube. Place in the fridge for 1 hour to set, then let come to room temperature 15 minutes before cooking. Preheat a grill or smoker using a two zone fire with Charcoal to 275 degrees. Two-zone fire: Coals spread along either side of the grill, with an empty space down the center, ideal for smoking and low-temperature cooking. Add some hickory chunks or chips for added smoke flavor. Place the beef onto the smoker to cook for about 1.5 hours until they begin to soften. As the beef smokes, heat up a medium high fire for the barbecue sauce. Add a skillet with the ingredients for the barbecue sauce and let simmer until thickened. Once warm and well incorporated, pull the barbecue sauce off the heat to cool. After 1.5 hours on the smoker, pull the beef off and place into a medium size foil bin. Top the burnt ends with the barbecue sauce and mix around. Cover the bin with aluminum foil and place back on the smoker to cook for another 2.5 hours. Add more barbecue sauce if needed so that there is a decent amount of liquid in order to break down the burnt ends. Once the burnt ends are tender and can easily break apart, pull them off and let cool for 10 minutes. Toss the cooled burnt ends in some of the foil bins sauce, season with a little more barbecue seasoning. To make the most authentic burnt ends at home, you will need a smoker but you can make them on a gas or charcoal grill.\nThe Philadelphia Eagles\nPHILLY CHEESECAKE\n1 1/2 cups Honey Maid graham cracker crumbs, ⅓ cup butter or margarine (melted), 4 (8-oz) packages Philadelphia cream cheese (softened), 1 cup and 3 tbsps sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 4 eggs.\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees. Mix crumbs, butter and 3 tbsps sugar until combined; press firmly onto the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Beat cream cheese, 1 cup sugar, and vanilla in a mixing bowl until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed until just blended. Pour over the crust. Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, about 55 minutes. Loosen cake from the pan rim; cool before removing rim. Refrigerate for 4 hours before serving.\nNew Orleans\nFor the next two recipes, we are going to have a game of our own, Gumbo vs. Jambalaya.\nJambalaya is primarily a rice dish, while gumbo is more of a stew. Both are made with chicken, sausage and/or seafood.\nGUMBO\nROUX: 1 cup all-purpose flour, 2/3 cup oil (vegetable or canola oil).\nGUMBO: 1 bunch celery (diced, leaves and all), 1 green bell pepper (diced), 1 large yellow onion (diced), 1 bunch green onions (finely chopped), 1 bunch fresh chopped parsley, 2-3 cloves garlic, 1-2 tbsps Cajun seasoning, 6-8 cups chicken broth, 12 ounce package andouille sausages (sliced into coins), meat from 1 rotisserie chicken, 2 cups shrimp (pre-cooked), hot cooked rice for serving.\nIn a large, heavy bottom stock pot combine flour and oil. Cook on medium-low heat, stirring constantly for 30-45 minutes. This part takes patience — when it's finished it should be as dark as chocolate and have a soft, \"cookie dough\" consistency. Be careful not to let it burn. Feel free to add a little more flour or oil as needed to reach this consistency.In a separate skillet on medium-high heat, place the sausage slices in one layer in the pan. Brown them well on one side (2-3 minutes) and then use a fork to flip each over onto the other side to brown. Remove to a plate. Add ½ cup of the chicken broth to the hot skillet that had the sausage to deglaze the pan. Pour the broth and drippings into your large soup pot. Add remaining 5 ½ cups of chicken broth. Add veggies, parsley, garlic and roux to the pot and stir well. Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil for 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are slightly tender. Stir in Cajun seasoning to taste. Add chicken, sausage and shrimp. Taste and serve. At this point taste it and add more seasonings to your liking —salt, pepper, chicken bouillon paste, garlic, more Joe's stuff or more chicken broth — until you reach the perfect flavor. Serve warm over rice. (Tastes even better the next day).\nJAMBALAYA\n1 tbsp oil (vegetable or canola oil), 1 lb andouille sausage (cut into ¼ inch thick slices), 1 1/2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts (cut into bite-size pieces), 2 tbsps all-purpose flour, 2 tbsps butter, 1 yellow or white onion (chopped), 4 green onions (chopped), 4 cloves garlic (finely minced), 3 ribs celery (chopped), 1 green bell pepper (chopped), 1 1/2 tsps dried basil, 1 1/2 tsps Cajun seasoning, 1 tsp kosher salt, ½ tsp fresh ground black pepper, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional add more for spice), 14.5-oz can diced tomatoes, 2 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth, 1 1/4 cup long-grain white rice.\nIn a large skillet with a fitted lid, add the oil over medium high heat. Once hot, add the chicken and cook, flipping once or twice to brown on all sides (don't cook chicken through). Remove to a bowl. Add sausage and cook until browned on both sides. Add to the bowl with the chicken. Reduce heat to medium and add butter and flour to the pan and stir well, scraping up any leftover browned bits from the pan. Add onion, garlic, celery, and bell peppers and sauté for 3 minutes. Add basil, cajun seasoning, diced tomatoes, salt and pepper and stir well to combine. Add chicken broth and rice and bring mixture to a gentle boil. Add reserved meat to the pan. Reduce heat, cover pan with fitted lid and cook for 20 minutes.Remove from heat, and rest with the lid on for 10 minutes. Then gently fluff with a fork and rest again for 5 minutes before serving. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "'Make Muskrat Great Again': Maggie’s Coleman Tavern in Rock Hall hosts annual cook-off\n\n February 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 539\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Earlier this month, Maggie's Coleman Tavern on Sharp Street in Rock Hall was once again celebrated the mighty muskrat, that is — by way of savory muskrat meat served in all kinds of unique ways. Maggie's threw their annual Muskrat Cook-Off, in its 10th year, where savory recipes featuring the web-footed critter were sampled and voted on.Around the table, muskrat meat was served alongside oysters by a man affectionately nicknamed as Capt. Jack Sparrow, next to him, Phat Daddy's served up barbecue for anyone not digging muskrat.\nIn the competition, muskrat meat, supplied by trapper Robert Smith, was sampled in quesadillas, mixed into stew, added to jalapeño and cheese, fried up on the grill with onions, or placed inside an egg roll.\n\"The meat's a little bit of an acquired taste, like beef, only if cows ate from the swamp,\" said one jovial man, sampling each station.\nOwner of Maggie's Carolyn Jones presented first place to the all-female team declaring \"Make muskrat great again!\" with their swamp rat slider. Jones provided the red-capped team with a trophy created by Greg Jetton from Dirty Cat Garage.\nVisiting friends with a bubbly, energetic spirit, Heather VanDerbeek, from Westchester, Pennsylvania, commended the women's set-up. \"This is awesome! I tried all the samples, and this is the best. The food, the presentation and the energy is all there,\" she said.\nAlso receiving awards from Dirty Cat and coming in second were George Parker and Alex Cooper, with their muskrat cheesesteak egg rolls. In third, with their Hawaiian slider, was the team of Ben Hicks, Darrold Smith and Chuck Woodfield.\nAlthough the weather was windy, with a chill in the air, camaraderie among competitors and tasters alike was warmly felt.\nFriends, family, neighbors and quite a few tourists, sampled muskrat, listened to live music courtesy of The Everafter, and thrilled to watch their neighbors and friends receive awards.\n\"We work hard to play hard,\" Rock Hall Mayor James Cook said, counting around 150 to 200 people in attendance.\nJones was pleased with the turnout, noting this year they had a few less contestants than last, but enthusiasm for the event remained.\nThe festival, Jones said, came out of a bored day with the idea this would be a fun, creative way to escape the cabin fever of winter months.\nBut why muskrat? Why not oysters, crabs, or even white tailed deer?\nBecause muskrat, spotted along Maryland's lakes, ponds, swamps, marshes rivers and streams, was once a thriving industry on the Eastern Shore. During the Great Depression era, muskrat pelts were the mainstay of the winter economy after blue crab season ended, as stated in an article in Smithsonian Magazine titled \"Muskrat Love.\"\nSmith, known as \"Trapper Bob\" follows that time-honored tradition. In winter, when he cannot work his concrete business, he enjoys the extremely challenging work of trapping muskrat, coyote, fox, otter, possum, and other animals.\nAlthough his muskrat meat has been sampled in the past cook-offs, this was his first year attending in person and he brought with him those pelts, drawing in many admirers. In only about two hours, he sold half of them, he said.\nAnd will there be an 11th muskrat cook-off?\n\"As long as we can trap 'em,\" a resident holding a beer in one hand and a muskrat quesadilla in the other remarked. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Elkton concert starts at 8 p.m. Tickets are $32.\nThe band also has another upcoming show on Sunday, Feb. 23, at the Havana in New Hope, Pennsylvania.\nThe eclectic band has its origins in Sleepy Hollow, New York.\nWe caught up with Joziah Longo and Tink Lloyd to talk about their musical journey and upcoming concerts.\nTell us a bit about the band and your musical journeys?\nJoziah: The band first formed in Sleepy Hollow, New York and have been working our way up the Hudson River ever since. You could say our neighborhood extends everywhere from NYC to Woodstock. As our fan base grew, we began touring the UK regularly since 2008, playing all the major festivals — instead of going west, we headed east to the musical 'holy land' of England. They really 'get us' there as our \"Woodstock-tinged psychedelia\" has a lot of British folk-rock influences alongside the very Americana.\nWhat should fans expect at the upcoming shows?\nTink: We're celebrating the 25th anniversary of our debut album, \"A Good Thief Tips His Hat\" which is still a fan fave. Some of those songs will be included for this show, and since the new Dylan movie, \"A Complete Unknown\" came out, we'll slip in a few choice Dylan tunes for everyone. Dylan was a big influence on Joziah growing up. He thought he was Bob Dylan when he was 12 — that was ok because Dylan thought he was Woody Guthrie.\nWhat stands out about your live performances and musical connections to fans?\nTink: As a band, we're somewhat \"musical time travelers\", tapping familiar language and textures. Audiences feel like they recognize the songs from a misty, past memory — though the songs are all distinctly 'Slambovian'.\nJoziah: The Avalon show will be in the main theatre, our first time on the big stage. This lets us bring our projections (we are ultimately an 'art-school' band, you know). But no matter the size of stage, shows keep an intimate vibe that lets the audience 'tune in' and connect for a tribal musical experience.\nWho are your musical influences, inspirations?\nJoziah: I grew up playing on Friday nights in my Dad's basement. He could play anything — country, rock and the British Invasion — I attended the ultimate 'School of Rock'.\nTink: As a flutist, I was always attracted to acoustic rock and Celtic music. Influences of Jethro Tull (Ian Anderson is a fan) definitely shine when I pick up my flute or recorder at shows. My main instrument, however, is the accordion! Fellow player, Garth Hudson of The Band was a 'mentor' to me and loved Joziah's songwriting (btw, he passed away in Woodstock just last week). That 'band' vibe is a part of our legacy, and hence, comparisons to The Band — but with Dylan/Bowie as lead singer.\nWhat else is up with the band?\nJoziah: We just started work on our 7th studio album, \"The Book of Better Things\". We'll be playing a few tracks at this weekend's shows... \"Everyone's Dumb in Their Own Special Way\" is sure to get everyone singing along. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Muskrat Leg Eating World Championship trophy stays on the Shore\n\n February 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 484\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE — Competition was fierce at the Muskrat Leg Eating World Championship Saturday.When Robert Hajir — the Delmarva Wing Eating Contest champ — was named the winner, he touted the giant trophy around stage as former leg eating world champion Mike \"Dirty Legs\" Detmer and Western Shore competitor Cody Fenzel mimicked chickens flapping their wings.\n\"I got ripped off,\" Detmer said after the competition, comparing his loss to the referee crew \"robbing\" the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl less than a week prior. Coming in third place this year, the 2024 world champ said he'll be back next year.\nAll in good fun, the three competitive contestants posed for photos at the end of the night.\nFor Hajir, who scarfed down the most muskrat meat of the eight contestants on stage at Cult Classic Brewing, the win was for his grandmother.\n\"She loved muskrat and she could never get me to try it,\" he said. \"So this was my first time eating muskrat ever.\"\nAlthough Hajir showed himself to be a natural when it comes to eating muskrat, witnessing his great grandfather eat the brains from the muskrat skulls when he was a child \"traumatized\" him \"for life.\"\n\"So I never ate them,\" Hajir said. \"Until right now.\"\nThough the Princess Anne resident with Talbot County roots wasn't the biggest fan of muskrat, he said the hot sauce on the muskrat legs made them taste \"tolerable.\"\nIzabell Wilk, Hajir's wife, had no doubts her husband would win the competition Saturday. \"Of course,\" she said about his odds before the winners were announced.\nWilk said she her favorite part of the contest was that all of the contestants had their own support teams.\nFenzel's support team, decked out in matching t-shirts, was the easiest to spot.\nFenzel, who took second place in the competition, was ready to bring the trophy across the Bay Bridge to Millersville this year. He said he had been training in the marshes of Wicomico county for nine months in preparation for the competition.\nLined up at a table on stage, the eight competitors were given two minutes to eat as many muskrat legs as they could. In its 15th year, the competition filled the brewery with people from across the Shore and beyond.\nBut the competition wasn't the only thing entertaining customers at Cult Classic Saturday. As Jimmy Cole and his band performed, attendees of the event could try muskrat prepared by Palm Beach Willies for themselves. From muskrat tacos, to muskrat chili to bacon-wrapped muskrat heads (with a mini hotdog in the muskrat's mouth), there was something for every adventurous meat eater.\nAnd for those who were only interested in watching others eat muskrat, crawfish soup was on the menu.\nFor Hajir, the competition was about more than showing off his skills.\n\"It was a big family tradition,\" he said about eating muskrat. \"So I'm really glad to be able to keep this trophy in the family and dedicate it to them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She and her husband stay active in the community by supporting the local St. Leonard Volunteer Fire Department, of which her husband Richard is the company's training officer.\nWhen she's not writing, she's reading, designing her book covers, and occasionally editing fundraising letters or offering advice and encouragement to other independent authors. She is currently working on the third book in the series, which as of now is untitled.\nThe books are available at www.amazon.com/author/judyhannigan.\nHow long have you been writing, and how did you get started?\nAlways a voracious reader, I drafted the first chapter of \"Lost in Prosperity\" while in high school, but I didn't finish the story until recently. I penned the second novel, \"Everything in Prosperity,\" last year.\nWhat inspires you to write?\nI write historical westerns because in that era you could reinvent yourself. My characters do what's right instead of what's told, exemplifying justice can triumph. I believe honor, courage, and loyalty are the principles by which to live.\nDo you consider writing to be a career?\nWriting is my third career. I started as a high school and college teacher before becoming a technical editor. Now I write full-time, and every day is an adventure.\nWhat kind of writing process do you use?\nI center my stories around a major event before I begin layering in backstories and challenges. I see scenes as if watching through a camera lens, so when the unexpected happens or characters pop up I investigate the possibilities, which means I rarely stick to an outline.\nWho are some of your favorite authors?\n\"Lonesome Dove\" author, Larry McMurtry wrote one of the most beloved westerns. I want readers of his novels and fans of television shows like \"Yellowstone,\" \"The Virginian,\" and \"The Rifleman\" to experience an era in which perseverance, loyalty, forgiveness, and the enduring power of love could redeem a wounded soul. Rosanne Bittner's \"Savage Destiny\" and \"Outlaw Hearts\" series feature flawed but courageous characters that fulfill their potential when forced into the gray zone wedged between black and white.\nPlease include a brief description of the book\nSet in the 1870s, \"Lost in Prosperity\" opens the series by blending adventure, romance, and suspenseful mystery to tell the story of Sam Hilliard Stone, a rich and beautiful heiress with a temper as fast as her quick draw, and Providence \"Jackson\" Knight, the handsome, rugged rancher determined to protect the woman he loves, as they struggle to build a dynasty in the wild, Wyoming Territory. Together, they navigate threats from an unknown enemy to uncover why events from their past are converging to destroy their future.\nIn \"Everything in Prosperity,\" Sam and Jackson risk everything to protect the town citizens from a notorious gang and survive the tangled web of deceptions threatening them.\nPlease include an excerpt from the book\n\"Jackson's face was pale. He tried to brush her hands away. Failing, he grabbed her wrists and pulled her close. \"Sonofabitch, Sam — even shot up, all I think about is how much I love you and ache for you to love me.\"\nSam's eyes filled with tears as she gently wriggled her wrists from his grasp. It wasn't difficult.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Less is more: 5 ingredient dinners are easier than you think\n\n February 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jessica Haggard Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1004\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n From TikTok trends to Jamie Oliver's newest cookbook, minimalist cooking is extremely popular. The internet agrees: five-ingredient dinners are not only easier to cook but can be just as delicious and satisfying as more elaborate meals.Whether you're short on groceries or looking to simplify your way of cooking, mastering the art of minimalist meals is surprisingly easy. Here are tips to help you create effortless, minimal-ingredient dinners without the stress.\nBuild around pantry staplesStart with versatile pantry staples like pasta, rice or canned items like beans, corn or tomatoes as your base. Canned goods are not only affordable and convenient but also have a long shelf life, making them perfect for quick and easy meals.\nThese staples pair well with a variety of ingredients and create a solid foundation for your dish. For example, combine spaghetti, olive oil and garlic, then top with red pepper flakes and parmesan for a straightforward yet delicious pasta dish, or toss canned black beans with rice, salsa, diced avocado and shredded cheese for a quick burrito bowl.\nKnoxville Backyard & Beyond 's Amanda Luhn's go-to quick meal is rice and beans. She says, \"You can add almost any kind of vegetable about to go bad and make it into a stir fry with some soy sauce. Or make it a casserole-like dish with ground beef and cheese and bake it. Add chicken and some mushroom sauce and it's something else.\"\nUtilize multi-use ingredientsOn TikTok, creators showcase a variety of quick and easy recipes that require only a few ingredients. For instance, the five-ingredient dinner with one hand trend emphasizes simplicity by using protein, vegetables and basic seasonings to craft a wholesome meal.\nThis approach is perfect for when you want to keep things simple and versatile in the kitchen. Opt for ingredients that can do double duty in your recipe. A rotisserie chicken can be shredded for tacos, tossed into a salad or mixed into a casserole. Humble potatoes can be turned into mashed potatoes, French fries and potato soups.\nThis TikTok video created by @_terriesmith shows an easy creamy ranch bowtie pasta made with chicken breasts, cream cheese, cream of chicken soup, ranch seasoning and bowtie pasta. A simple search of \"five ingredient recipes chicken\" on the platform will give you plenty of fun and easy ideas for using a multi-use ingredient like chicken.\nEmbrace prepped and packaged itemsDon't shy away from pre-cut vegetables, frozen fruits or jarred sauces to reduce prep time. For example, frozen stir-fry veggies paired with soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic and cooked shrimp can make a quick and flavorful meal. Convenience items can be a lifesaver when working with fewer ingredients.\nGena Lazcano from Ginger Casa shares, \"I always keep noodles in all varieties, jarred pasta sauce, mozzarella cheese and ground beef on hand. I have three kids who love this meal each and every time, so I know I can't go wrong. It makes a quick and easy meal.\" These simple, go-to items make meal prep much faster while allowing you to create a delicious dish without much effort.\nUse bold flavorsWith fewer ingredients, it's essential to maximize flavor. As celebrity chef Jamie Oliver shared on Good Morning America while talking about his newest cookbook, \"5 Ingredients Mediterranean: Simple Incredible Food,\" \"Keep the shopping list really low. Keep it easy. Focus on flavors and technique and really nice quick meals that you can have for breakfast, lunch or dinner.\"\nThe same philosophy applies when cooking with just a few ingredients — using fresh herbs, citrus, spices or vinegar can enhance your dishes without adding complexity. A squeeze of lemon or a sprinkle of smoked paprika can transform even the simplest meals into something memorable. Whether you're making a quick pasta or a salad, bold seasonings can improve your meal without complicating the process.\nMaster one-pan mealsOne-pan meals are perfect for keeping things simple and reducing cleanup, making them ideal for busy nights when you want a satisfying meal without the mess. The beauty of one-pan meals lies in their versatility — simply toss together ingredients that you have on hand then roast everything on a sheet pan. Pork chops with potatoes, carrots and onions roasted in olive oil make a filling five-ingredient dinner.\nNot only does this method save time, but it also allows all the flavors to meld together as they cook. You can easily swap in different proteins and vegetables based on what you have on hand, which makes cooking easier and more flexible. The result is a hearty, satisfying dish with minimal effort and just one pan to clean. This cooking style is ideal for busy families, singles or anyone looking for a no-fuss way to prepare a wholesome family meal.\nGet creative with leftoversTransforming leftovers into a fresh, new meal is a great way to reduce food waste and stretch your ingredients further. Take last night's roasted vegetables and combine them with eggs and cheese to create a quick frittata, or turn leftover rice into a delicious fried rice dish with soy sauce, scrambled eggs and frozen peas.\nThese simple swaps not only save time but also allow you to be creative in the kitchen, making the most out of what you already have. You can even use leftover two-ingredient salsa chicken to make a tasty stir-fry or repurpose it into wraps or sandwiches, offering endless possibilities for quick, flavorful dinners. By thinking creatively, you can easily breathe new life into leftovers and enjoy a fresh and exciting meal.\n5 ingredients, zero stressCooking with just five ingredients is all about simplicity and smart choices. Cap off your dinners with desserts like three-ingredient fudge and you'll wonder how you ever cooked any other way. By building around staples, using bold flavors and embracing a little creativity, you can make delicious dinners without breaking a sweat — or your budget.\nJessica Haggard is dedicated to helping people cook easy everyday recipes focusing on bioavailable and nutrient-dense foods. She helps people overcome food allergies and discover healthy recipes that make a difference in their health with gluten-free, low-carb and keto cooking at Primal Edge Health. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Vietri family's homemade pottery lines the wooden tables, each one unique in its own right.\n\"I'm looking at it like a painting...I'll open when I'm ready to walk away,\" Vietri said, adding that she plans to open in mid to late May, with potential pop ups beforehand.\nVietri initially planned to open her restaurant and market this past December, but is not rushing the process because she wants to make sure her first restaurant is everything she dreamed it to be and more.\n\"I could not imagine opening back then. Because the real, true vision, it has changed,\" Vietri said. She is now hiring an upholsterer for finely designed seating, hanging chandeliers and always adding more detail to bring her vision fully to life. \"Rome wasn't built in a day, isn't that what they say?\"\nSince the fall, Vietri has also been busy as a celebrity chef both on air and filming at Bohemia Manor Winery, all while being a mom to her nearly two-year-old son.\nVietri just finished filming as a celebrity chef on Living Abundantly with Sarah Vie, a talk show by best-selling author and expert lifestyle coach, Sarah van der Steur.\nThey even filmed one segment with Golden Bachelor contestant, Susan Knowles.\n\"She cooked with me and we had a blast,\" Vietri said.\nBut it doesn't stop there, Vietri is working with producers to get her own cooking show in the future, something to look forward to.\nBut for now, her focus is the restaurant and market.\nAs both the chef and owner, Vietri aims to offer guests a one-on-one experience with her constantly changing menu, including her chef's tasting menu offered in the Tuscany Room, which seats 11 people.\nHer menus will adapt with each region of Italy, offering endless varieties of flavors and dishes for everyone to enjoy. She will also have a beautiful gelato machine from Europe to spin up the best of the best Italian desserts. Everything in the restaurant and market will be locally sourced and made fresh daily.\nIn the back of her restaurant she will offer an authentic Italian market as well as an open space for bridal showers, weddings, and other events. In addition to various tasty treats, \"boat boxes\" — coolers with sandwiches, drinks, and snacks — will be available at the market just in time for summer boating season. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Windsor was also named the winner of the pageant's talent category.\nContestants Maggie Blake and Savannah Weber came in second and third place, respectively. Emma Robinson took home the title of Miss Congeniality.\nOn Saturday, Aubree Schaffers was named Little Miss Outdoors 2025 and Beck Weglarz was named Little Mister Outdoors 2025.\nAlthough in the past the Senior World Champion Muskrat Skinning Semi-Finals have been held on stage immediately following the pageant, this year the night ended with the crowning.\nNational Outdoor Show Chairman Buddy Oberender said the semi-finals would not be held after the pageant Friday night. He said the entire skinning competition would be held Saturday because weather conditions made it difficult to catch a lot of muskrats prior to the event.\nOn Saturday, Dakota Abbott Flowers took home the World Championship women's title and Dusty Flowers took home the men's title.\nEden Hitch, who is from Cambridge, said she's been coming to the National Outdoor Show her whole life.\n\"I don't want to say (it's) a family tradition, but I just remember being a little girl and just being here,\" she said.\nColleen Carney, a teacher at Cambridge-South Dorchester High School, said more than half of her students were competing in the Miss Outdoors Pageant this year. Although Carney didn't grow up in Dorchester County, she comes to the event every year.\n\"It was something that I got brought to my first year that I was teaching here,\" she said. \"They were like, 'You don't live in Dorchester until you've been to the Outdoor Show.'\"\nSydney Steeves, who used to teach at Cambridge-South Dorchester High School, said she was told the same thing one year.\n\"It's just kind of cool to be a part of this portion of the culture around here and get to see the involvement with other areas,\" Steeves said, mentioning the show's ties with Cameron Parish, Louisiana, which is considered Dorchester County's sister jurisdiction.\nCarney said the National Outdoor Show is a \"huge part of the community.\" She said the pageant winners represent Dorchester County.\n\"They're part of fishing festivals and the parades,\" she said. \"I was just reading (Miss Outdoors 2024 Laila Insley's) goodbye speech, and she talks about going and visiting some of the kindergarten classes in town. They do a lot to be a part of our community, and I think that's great.\"\nBefore Windsor was crowned with the 2025 title, Insley gave her farewell speech as Miss Outdoors 2024. She said she went out of her comfort zone to enter the pageant, but it has been one of her \"best experiences yet.\"\n\"May you always remember that although the crown may be a symbol of beauty and grace, the true principle of this title lies in the heart of our community,\" she advised the next Miss Outdoors. \"It's giving back, making a difference and inspiring other to take pride in where we come from.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gretchen's table: Miso-mustard salmon and asparagus is elegant and easy\n\n March 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Gretchen McKay Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | Section: Entertainment \n \n 593\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Salmon is famously heart-healthy, which makes it a popular choice for a seafood meal. The average American consumes more than three pounds a year of the fatty fish, according to the National Fisheries Institute.Who can blame us? Not only is salmon a source of complete protein, but it's also chock full of omega-3 fatty acids — \"healthy\" fats that have been shown to do the body good by reducing inflammation and lowering blood pressure.\nThe firm-fleshed fish is also pretty easy to find in most grocery stores (both fresh and flash-frozen), and can be cooked in so many different and exciting ways — you can pan-fry, roast, grill or poach the rosy-hued fillets, and also turn them into fish cakes — that it never gets boring for the adventurous cook.\nIn this recipe, we build a meal around chopped dates, the classic, ancient superfood featured in \"Hot Date! Sweet & Savory Recipes Celebrating the Date\" by Rawaan Alkhatib ( Chronicle Books, $35).\nDates — a tropical stone fruit from date palms — are known for their versatility and flavor and are naturally sweet and high in fiber and antioxidants. Here, they provide the base for a tangy-sweet marinade that offers a lovely depth of flavor.\nGarlic and Dijon mustard play supporting roles, along with white miso, a paste made from soybeans that have been fermented with a large portion of rice that adds a savory umami.\nBetween marinating and cooking time, the dish takes only about a half-hour from start to finish, and the accompanying asparagus is roasted alongside the fish on a parchment-covered baking sheet. That means dinner is both quick and relatively mess-free.\nIf you don't care for asparagus, simply substitute another vegetable, such as eggplant or zucchini. You also can swap out the fish — another sweet swimmer like trout works well with the marinade, and so would cod fillets. I didn't have any malt vinegar, so substituted apple cider vinegar.\nWhen choosing salmon, look for fillets that appear moist, with shiny skin. If you can, opt for wild-caught salmon, especially from Alaska. Atlantic salmon is typically available year-round, and has a melt-in-your-mouth texture and a mild flavor.\nMiso-Mustard Salmon and Asparagus\n4 skin-on salmon fillets, about 6 ounces eachKosher saltFreshly ground black pepper3 pitted dates, roughly chopped and soaked in 2 tablespoons warm water1 fat garlic clove, minced2 tablespoons olive oil2 tablespoons Dijon mustard1 tablespoon white miso1 tablespoon malt vinegar1 pound fresh asparagus, woody ends trimmed\nGenerously sprinkle salmon fillets all over with salt and pepper.\nIn small bowl, combine mushy dates and their soaking water with garlic, olive oil, mustard, miso and vinegar, stirring until blended.\nPour about half of this marinade on top of the salmon fillets and gently smoosh the fish around until evenly coated.\nLet fish marinate in the fridge for 15-30 minutes.\nToss the asparagus spears in the remaining marinade and set aside until ready to cook.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.\nPlace salmon fillets, skin-side down, on the prepared baking sheet and surround with the asparagus spread out in a single layer.\nBake until the salmon is just opaque and gently flakes when pressed with a fork, about 15-20 minutes. If the fish or asparagus is looking a little pale and lackluster at this point, turn the broiler on high (stay close, the marinade burns easily) until everything becomes a little more golden.\nServe with grains or greens or both to round out the meal.\nServes 4.\n— \"Hot Date! Sweet & Savory Recipes Celebrating the Date, from Party Food to Everyday Feasts\" by Rawaan Alkhatib\nGretchen McKay is food editor with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She confirmed that she would, then added that the pub is not for the public, but students are allowed two guests.\n\"They assured me they would be checking IDs and doing wristbands or stamps they can use a scanner with to make sure everyone is of the proper age,\" Pearsall said, after discussing it in a meeting with college officials.\nCommissioner John Price said Washington College currently has a license for special events and catering and can open up different areas on the campus. With that, they made a motion to approve the addition of a pub area to the existing liquor license subject to specified restrictions for students under 21.\nIt was unanimously approved.\nFithian said now the liquor license has been approved, they will keep a close eye on the establishment. But as long as the campus abides by the law, he said, it is the school's choice.\nWhen reaching out for additional information about The Golden Goose such as how long has this project been discussed and what governing bodies decided on it, a Washington College spokesperson said, \"The campus pub is NOT open to the public and is considered a student/campus life function. Chestertown residents and the members of the public will not be permitted to enter.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

What started out as a way for Talbot Interfaith Shelter to stand out in a sea of local fundraisers has turned into something more.\n\"There are so many amazing events for so many worthy causes in our community,\" shares shelter Executive Director Julie Lowe. \"When we first started the Lip Sync Battle, our goal was simply to put on an event that would capture people's attention. But over the course of nine years, it has meant so much more for our organization than we ever could have imagined. So many people from all areas of our community participate in Lip Sync every year, whether they are competing, volunteering, donating, or attending the live show. It has been the catalyst for building an incredibly strong community around our mission and around the neighbors we serve.\"\nLip Sync Battle has grown so much that last year's event raised more than $112,000 for Talbot Interfaith Shelter. This prompted an ambitious goal of $125,000 for this year's event, which is being presented by Sun Management Rising Technologies.\nFans do not have to wait until April 26 to get their Lip Sync fix. The competition is already underway, and teams from across our community are currently vying for votes to win one of two competitions. The Live Show Competition teams will be performing on stage at the main event at the Waterfowl Building, and the Video Competition teams have created musical masterpieces that will be shown online and during the live show.\nTeams can win in their respective competitions in one of two ways. Each team is duking it out to see who can raise the most in support of Talbot Interfaith Shelter. Community members can vote by donating directly to their team, or selecting their team when purchasing event tickets or signing up for an event sponsorship. In addition, a panel of impartial judges will decide the winners of the best performance award in each category.\nVisit talbotinterfaithshelter.org to meet the teams, purchase tickets and vote for your favorites. For questions about the Lip Sync Battle, or to learn more about sponsorships, contact Talbot Interfaith Shelter Director of Development and Marketing Laura Richeson at lauraricheson@talbotinterfaithshelter.org or 443-786-6962. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Virtual horse races took place at Betterton Volunteer Fire house Saturday, March 8, sponsored by Still Pond/Betterton Lion's Club.According to Betterton/Still Pond Lions member Debi Cornelius, almost 200 Kent County residents and neighbors showed up, betting on the horse races at their 47th Virtual Race Night.\nAll proceeds went to the program, Leader Dogs for the Blind. Founded in 1949, this program has stood by their motto, \"We serve,\" complements the Leader Dog mission of empowering people who are blind or visually impaired with lifelong skills for safe and independent daily travel. Millington Lions member Shelley Holland spoke in detail about the program and how people can contribute.\nFor those who have not had the joy and privilege of getting out to one of these races, put on twice a year, on a large screen, participants watches a DVD from the \"Night at the Races,\" a gaming company that records real horse races. Most races are close, with photo finishes, and the joy of the winners watching is contagious. There are 12 races, sponsored by local companies or individuals.\nDuring the action, patrons placed their bets, chatting with neighbors while they waited in line. People enjoyed beverages, adult or otherwise, munched popcorn, hotdogs and nachos, and exchanged regular money for funny money.\nWinner of the 50/50 raffle this year run by both Chesterterton and Betterton/Still Pond Lions was Greg Werner, winning $647, was congratulated by announcer, Tristan Stone.\nOther raffle winners received Easter baskets containing festive items.\nThis race is a Betterton tradition that is also a good recruiting tool for the Lions and an effective fundraiser.\n\"It was a really fun night!\" Cornelius said, thankful for members and the community for their continued support of the Bettertown/Still Pond Lions Club. She urged folks to check out their next race on Nov. 8, a great activity to ring in the holidays. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2025-03-21",
    "author": "Staff Writer",
    "content": "Megaladon, shark teeth on display in Solomons\n\n March 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 562\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n While fans of the movie and novel \"Jaws\" might envision an encounter with a 22-foot great white shark as being daunting, historians and marine biologists alike are quick to note that the extinct megatooth shark Otudus megalodon, commonly known as \"megalodon,\" once roamed the oceans spanning a far more imposing 65 feet in length.The megalodon was likely the largest shark ever to exist and is well known for its large, evenly serrated teeth, indicative of its lifestyle as a formidable apex predator. These blade-like teeth were used to prey upon marine animals, such as whales, dolphins and likely other sharks and a new paper published sheds light on the impacts of their impact on other sharks and the teeth are readily on display at the Calvert Marine Museum in Solomons.\nEvidence of predatory behavior is well represented in the fossil record, with many examples of shark-bitten fossil bone as seen in images provided by the Calvert Marine Museum. However, shark-bitten shark teeth are very rare, but perhaps proof that the megalodon would attack other sharks in the vicinity including members of their species.\nIn a paper recently published online in Acta Palaeontologica Palonica, paleontologists from the Calvert Marine Museum in Solomons and the St. Mary's College of Maryland in St. Mary's City describe four megalodon teeth that were bitten by other megalodon teeth. These bite marks are represented by shallow parallel lines marking the surface of the teeth caused by a forceful impact of another megalodon tooth.\nAlthough the authors of this recently released paper describe these rare, meg-bitten meg teeth, they do not know under what circumstances any of the megalodon teeth were bitten. One might imagine that the simplest way to account for megalodon-bitten teeth would be that two teeth in opposing jaws struck each other during occlusion, the serrated cutting edge of one marking the other.\nAnother possibility is that another megalodon tooth was knocked loose for any number of reasons but remained in the originating jaw of the shark. This shed tooth (while still in the shark's mouth) might then have been struck and marked by another occluding tooth.\nA third possibility is that megalodon teeth became marked during a predatory or scavenging event.\nSeven years ago, Calvert Marine Museum Curator of Paleontology Stephen Godfrey was the senior author on similar paper published online. It was a collaborative effort between Godfrey, Mike Ellwood, Stephen Groff and Michael Scott Verdin — avocational paleontologists who found the bitten vertebrae. The paper describes fossil dolphin tail bones that were bitten by the mega-tooth shark, Carcharocles megalodon.\nMegalodon was the largest predator that lived on Earth two million to 20 million years ago, according to a release from the museum. It was initially estimated that they attained lengths of between 50 and 60 feet, a scale that has since been upgraded to a larger specimen. From time to time, fossil whale and dolphin bones are found along Calvert Cliffs that show megalodon tooth bite marks. Some of them may have been made as megalodon scavenged an already dead whale.\nModern great white sharks are known to disable dolphins by biting their tails, the release states. Megalodon certainly could have done the same, as the fossil tail vertebrae show multiple gouges. This suggests that the tails of these dolphins were jammed forcefully and repeatedly between adjacent teeth by powerful bite forces, according to the release.\nFor more information, go to www.calvertmarinemuseum.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This time, little Wyatt struggles to fall asleep, and his mother, armed with her enchanted handbag, pulls out a surprise. With a dazzling burst of rainbow energy, the duo is transported beyond Earth's atmosphere, clad in space suits and ready to explore the cosmos.\nGlenn, who is expanding \"Mommy's Adventures\" into a series, describes the 31-page book for ages 3-8 as both fun and educational. Along the way, Mommy introduces Wyatt to the mysteries of the solar system, from the red sands of Mars to the brilliance of distant stars. They even wave to a friendly alien, igniting Wyatt's curiosity about space and science.\nAs NASA and SpaceX talk about space exploration —launching missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond — \"Mommy's Adventures to Space\" invites young readers to imagine themselves as future astronauts. The story fosters an early appreciation for science, astronomy and adventure.\nThe book's main characters are drawn from Glenn's own life. Mommy is based on the author, and fictional Wyatt is inspired by her 7-year-old son.\n\"He loves the books, though he's a little embarrassed he's in them,\" Glenn said with a smile. \"And he'll tell you that too.\"\nThe book, which took about four months to write, was published Jan. 1 and features vibrant, playful illustrations by Ayesha Zaki, the artist behind \"Mommy's Adventures\". Glenn credits Zaki's artwork with bringing her stories to life while maintaining a consistent visual theme across the series.\nAs a cafeteria worker at Rock Hall Elementary School, Glenn has a growing fan base among young readers. She hopes to introduce her books to more students across Kent County Public Schools, though she has faced some challenges in gaining traction.\nWith spring approaching, Glenn is actively seeking opportunities to promote \"Mommy's Adventures to Space\" while planning Mommy and Wyatt's next adventure. Their first journey took them to a land of roller coasters, and now they've explored the stars. Next, they'll embark on a prehistoric romp with dinosaurs.\nBoth \"Mommy's Adventures\" books are available on Amazon by searching Glenn's name — appearing as magically as when Mommy opens her handbag.\nFor school reading events, contact Glenn at eglenn_23@yahoo.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Last sailor on the pier': Hollywood couple celebrate 65th wedding anniversary\n\n April 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Reid mreid@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 518\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Roy Hart Jr. desperately wanted to dance with the pretty girl, but he was flatly rejected.But Hart refused to give up, got the girl and on March 26, he and wife Jane Hart of Hollywood celebrated their 65th wedding anniversary.\n\"We've had a great marriage,\" said 88-year-old Roy.\nThe couple celebrated the anniversary with lunch at Capt. Pat's Seafood in Drayden.\nHart worked 40 years at The Enterprise and The Calvert Recorder, while Roy served 23 years in the U.S. Navy before becoming a broker with Hart & Lyle in California.\nThey have three children — Lisa Barrios, who lives in Virginia, Roy Hart III who lives in Baltimore and Pamela Renee Johnson, who lives next door — along with four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\n\"There has to be a lot of give-and-take and a lot of patience on both sides,\" 82-year-old Jane said.\nAnd it was Roy Jr. who exhibited plenty of patience at the onset.\nIt was the early 1950s when Roy spied Jane across the hall at a USO dance in Charleston, S.C., and he was immediately smitten. He said he \"thought she was a good looking girl\" and told Jane Brewer's friend he'd like to dance with Jane.\nBut the attraction certainly wasn't mutual.\n\"Me? Dance with that old man? He's too old for me,\" said Jane, who was 15 at the time of the 21-year-old Roy Jr.'s advance. \"And he didn't know how to dance very well.\"\nBut Roy persevered. He called his mother later that night and told her he'd met the girl he was going to marry and Jane's parents adored him and invited him to dinner every Sunday. He even took dance lessons at the Arthur Murray Dance Studio.\nEven though Jane lied and told Roy Jr. she was about to turn 18, her feelings slowly started changing and they started dating.\n\"I began to like him more and more,\" Jane said.\nRoy was deployed aboard the U.S.S. Orleans Parish, a flat-bottom tank landing ship, shortly after, and when he returned he waited along with his shipmates for loved ones to pick them up.\n\"Here I am standing there waiting, waiting,\" Roy said. \"I was the last sailor on the pier.\"\n\"I was late,\" Jane admitted.\nThe couple got engaged and married in 1960 at Citadel Square Baptist Church in Charleston.\nBecause of Roy's military obligations, the couple lived in Charleston before moving to Massachusetts and then Italy, and Roy's first day at Allied Forces in 1962 was one to remember.\nHe received a call from the adjutant of a four-star admiral that Jane had parked in his space.\nThe following is the couple's version of events:\n\"I beat my feet over and Jane was two buildings over at a beauty salon. I told her, 'You have to move your car right away.'\"\n\"But my hair's not done yet. He'll just have to wait.\"\n\"He won't wait. Get out and move that car right away.\"\n\"But my hair's not done. Who does he think he is anyway?\"\n\"I'll tell you who he is. He's the admiral.\"\nJane eventually moved her car.\nThe couple eventually relocated to Hollywood after Roy was assigned to Naval Air Station Patuxent River. And that's where they reside to this day. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "'Magic in the air': Singers parade at Kent's Got Talent\n\n April 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 634\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The second annual Kent's Got Talent was a great way to spend a Saturday night at the Garfield Center for the Arts at the Prince Theatre in Chestertown.Sponsored by the United Way of Kent County, the March 29 show featured nine performers of all ages and walks of life, emceed by Jim Landskroener, a longtime theater member and a founding member of Chestertown's Actors Community Theater.\nContestants were Cece Bagshaw, Ashley Chapa, Lewisson Clarke, Carly Mourlas, Nicholas Ray, Clair Smith, Kiara Voss, Grace Walton and Jay Yerkes.\nThey performed everything from Broadway hits, soulful country, modern pop to electronica, gothic and dance music—and seemingly every other genre. There were mostly cover songs but also quite a few originals.\nFor instance, local singer-songwriter Nicholas Ray from Chestertown, who has toured several states, performed his original song, \"Ain't Today,\" and dedicated it to his friend battling cancer.\nLewisson and Clarke performed as a brother-sister duo, presenting their original song, \"Jungle Sounds,\" using looping equipment and adding comedy and crowd work.\nGrace Walton, performing under the stage name Jenna L, made one judge virtually clutch her pearls as she delivered her original scary-tale songs. All music and lyrics were written by her and can be found on iTunes and Spotify under Jenna L.\nJudges Melissa McGlynn, Terwana Brown and Chris Nieman had a tough job weighing in because there were no bad performances from the group.\nBut somebody had to win, and judges could pick their winners while audiences chose theirs throughout the night.\nJudges' choice for youth was Mourlas, who stunned the audience with her powerful Broadway vocals in Barbra Streisand's \"Don't Rain on My Parade.\"\n\"No one is ever going to rain on your parade. You connected with the audience and you are a rockstar,\" Judge Brown told her.\nJudges' choice for adult was Voss, who captured the emotion behind \"She Used to Be Mine,\" originally performed by Sara Bareilles in the musical \"Waitress.\" Judge McGlynn said from experience that Voss's song choice was very challenging and that she performed it beautifully.\nPeople's choice winner for youth was Bagshaw, who opened the night with a classic Janis Joplin song, \"Me and Bobby McGee,\" setting the bar high for later performers. Judge Nieman was impressed, saying she built the performance as she went until her voice exploded with confidence.\nPeople's choice for adults was Yerkes, who, despite having technical issues with his guitar at first, won the crowd over with his skilled performance of \"In a Dream,\" dedicated to his wife, Lisa.\nThe prize winners received a trophy, $100 in Chestertown cash and, of course, important bragging rights.\nNot only was it a chance for the audience to hear some remarkable local performers, but it also offered gourmet food prepared by an award-winning chef from the Food Network, Robbie Jester, owner of In Jest Events and Galena native. Local oysters, beef and bread were on the menu, followed by dessert—including ice cream courtesy of Jacqueline Lockwood of Lockbriar Farms.\nAt the end of the night, the United Way of Kent County raised more than $35,000, according to executive director Amy Meade.\n\"The money will go to nonprofits in Kent County that focus on education, health and financial stability,\" she said, thanking all volunteers, sponsors and participants.\n\"I think there was magic in the air at the Garfield on Saturday night. Not only was the crowd excited to see and hear the variety and excellence of Kent County talent, but the judges and emcee did an amazing job of highlighting the contestants' special talents—and we can't forget the incredible food sourced locally and prepared to perfection by our own celebrity chef,\" Meade added.\n\"I have to say I am humbled that all this was to raise money for the United Way of Kent County and our mission to serve those households in need. Thank you to everyone who made Kent's Got Talent so special!\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

From a neon green vehicle inspired by Hot Wheels toys with a small but mighty team of three, to a mattress atop four bicycle wheels — which unfortunately took a tumble — there was a spectacle for all lining the track on Rebecca Smith Way.\nTeams continued to race one versus one in a bracketed competition, with one person riding and up to three pushing the \"beds\" on wheels.\n\"Eveland Arms\" represented the hunting and sporting goods store in Earleville, and secured the first place trophy. A local family entered their second \"Bed on a Budget\" contraption — bright pink bunk beds on wheels — and took home second place and best design after winning first place with the original \"Bed on a Budget\" last year, which was made of milk crates.\nA group of young locals used their vehicle to campaign for Sue Katzmire — the organizer of the bed races — who is up for re-election to Town Council. They decorated their structure on wheels with \"vote for Katzmire\" signage and patriotic decor.\nKatzmire organizes the bed races on April Fools each year as a fundraiser for Faith In Action, a local nonprofit food pantry.\nKatzmire grew up in upstate New York, where she was first introduced to bed races in her neighborhood. When she moved to Cecilton she felt right at home, so decided to bring the bed races to the small Maryland town, and the people love it.\n\"When I was a little girl, my hometown was a lot like Cecilton and we did this every year,\" Katzmire said.\nTo offer informative resources for community members, theCecilton Judy CenterandCecil County Health Departmentwere tabling along the sidelines of the racetrack. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The event is free and open to the public.The Big Little Boat Festival, which has run every year in various forms since 1999, celebrates small wooden boats. The event also features amateurs and professionals who have built boats from Chesapeake Light Craft's celebrated boat kits and plans.\nThere are hands-on boatbuilding seminars, on-the-water demonstrations, the chance to try out dozens of boats from the Chesapeake Light Craft fleet on the water, cardboard boatbuilding and racing for youngsters, and the popular \"Best in Show\" judging of home-built wooden boats brought by festival-goers.\nThe roster of boatbuilding and watercraft experts scheduled to lead seminars and demonstrations includes Chesapeake's owner and CEO John C. Harris, boatbuilder/instructors Andrew Schroeher and Jay Hockenberry, and paddling and rowing coach Nicky Stimpson.\nExamples from Chesapeake's fleet of watercraft will be on display including kayaks, rowing and sailing craft, paddleboards, and small powerboats. Festival attendees will bring their own creations to launch and display. Chesapeake Light Craft's awards for amateur-built boats, some of which took hundreds of hours to build and look like exotic furniture, have been a key part of the annual small boat festivals for years. Participants have come from the UK, Florida, the West Coast, and Japan.\nConquest Beach is situated on the 758-acre Conquest Preserve between the Corsica and Chester Rivers.\nFestival hours are 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Saturday, May 17.

    "content": "Seniors show unbridled joy in Kentucky Derby-themed party\n\n May 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 770\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Last Friday, the horse races came a day early when the Amy Lynn Ferris Adult Activity Center was transformed into Churchill Downs for its very first Kentucky Derby Party.\"There are some amazing artwork and displays,\" said Susan Higgs the Kent County Project director for the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program of Upper Shore Aging Inc.\nAround 50, maybe more, came out to partake in the festivities, wearing giant, elaborate hats, jamming out to a variety music from DJ Pres Jacobs — sharing laughs with friends.\nFrom 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. they had finger foods, snacks, cookies and sipped non-alcoholic mint juleps. Each table was adorned with a wooden centerpiece representing the race complete with turf, jockey silks, helmet and stirrups.\nBut nobody sat at the table for long.\nThere were exciting things to do, ideas thought up by Activity Coordinator Colleen Upp. Since she has been in her role, many can attest she has breathed new life into the center with creative activities planned daily.\nThe origin of this idea, she exclaimed, stemmed from her love of horses. Thinking of a horse-themed event, she saw the costumes and pageantry behind the biggest national races as inspiring.\n\"It was a fun idea and so original,\" Higgs pointed out.\nAnd like all of Upp's ideas, her enthusiasm in the project was contagious. Soon it was all hands-on-deck to transform the center into a racing hub. In every corner there is something created that adds authenticity to the event and fun.\nStarting on the outside of the building, styrofoam containers once used for storing chemicals were airbrushed and made into a brick wall. Wildlife artist John Elburn used his creativity to fashion a unique gateway into the party, complete with plywood horse and jockeys.\nHis innovation did not stop there. In the doorway, greeting party-goers, was a five-foot, 350 lb. horse head he sculpted from a chainsaw, rotary and chisel tools. The maple sculpture took him 350 hours and was glad to do it for the center.\n\"Colleen had the idea, and we ran with it,\" Elburn said.\nPast the horse head, going into the dining area, the red rosed archway was designed with the idea of the flower blankets draped over the horses at the competition.\nInside the dining area, every inch seemed decorated...including the party goers, who donned hats of ribbons, feathers and flowers. There was a display of red roses symbolic of the Kentucky Derby, Upp's daughter's exercise saddle, horse figurines arranged in orderly fashion, and of course, the winner's circle perfect for photo ops after the competitions.\nBecause what's a party without party games, Upp said, including toilet paper horse races.\nA total of eight participants (jockeys) held a roll of slightly unrolled toilet paper. At the end of the table, setting on the toilet paper strip was a plastic horse, ready for the race. At the mark, set, go, the jockeys had to roll up the toilet paper keeping the horse on the strip while moving it towards the finish line.\nCarol Elburn and Marie Spray had a heated competition in the finals. Elburn edged her out, and both received award winning plates.\nIn the morning, they held their hat competition, many wearing their creations from the hat-making class held by Brenda Foehrkolb on April 29 with over 20 in attendance.\nDJ Pres Jacobs put on a huge Smirnoff Ice Vodka hat and went home the winner of three of the six categories: most comical, most eventful and most outrageous, Upp said laughing.\nAs they were cleaning up, they had line dancing headed by the boundless activity coordinator. Upp likes to put her own spin on the line dancing, making it adaptable for seniors. She said that dancing promotes coordination, balance, memory and it is just plain fun.\nShe's named her group of dancers the Vintage Vibes. They dance two times a week, learning different genres and styles from Mark Rice's 1965 song \"Ride Around Sally\" to hits by American rapper and singer, Pitbull.\n\"Their grandkids would be amazed to see grandma dancing to Pitbull,\" said Pam Holland, a friend of Upp.\nThe horse race parties will continue for two more big races, the Preakness and then the Belmont Stakes. With each change of race, comes new decorations added on to the centerpiece and the wreath; for Preakness, Black-eyed Susans, and for Belmont, white carnations.\nIt is these little details to add to the experience.\nFor a list of activities at the center, contact the front desk at 410-778-2564 or stop in at 200 Schauber Rd. Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\"We're having so much fun here! You never know what to expect from our members,\" Upp said with a \"winning\" smile... pun intended. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Nicholas Ray aint country? Could have fooled us!\n\n May 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 872\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BETTERTON — On a 12-day music tour, local musician/songwriter Nicholas Ray's plans to reach California were thrown off by a snowstorm. Alone, two hours from the Grand Canyon, the snow fell so heavy it froze his headlights. Driving in the dark, fighting to keep visibility, unbeknownst to him, the nearest civilization was two hours away.Ray explained it was a Sioux Indian reservation, where they told him it had not snowed there yet until that very day. \"Lucky me,\" Ray said, laughing, as he talked to the Kent County News inside his garage/band practice room.\nHe had slept in his car in the parking lot of their gas station and was awoken to coyotes rooting in the trashcans and a mountain of snow on his car. He swept it off with a broom, gave those who let him stay, a copy of his album and moved on, heading southward following the Gulf Coast to warmer weather.\nRay returned home to the farm in Still Pond, to his wife and family with even greater resolve to follow his dreams.\nOn his visit to major cities from Ohio, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, South and North Carolina, he collected 220 new subscribers to his Spotify and Apple Music accounts, while greeting friends on his journey.\nBusking, (playing in the streets for money) was a great experience for him he said, and although he was nervous to start performing original songs in a strange city, everybody was supportive of his dreams of earning a living performing on stage.\nThese dreams began when he was a soldier in the Maryland National Guard deployed to Kosovo as a mechanic on Black Hawk helicopters. Hard work but during down time, he played the guitar until his hands bled, writing and singing songs.\nNow he is ready for the next adventure. In October, Ray and his wife, Brandy Dorey, his biggest cheerleader and hype person, are Nashville-bound — moving on from the county to pursue his music goals.\n\"If you don't take chances, you never know,\" Ray said.\nKent County will certainly miss him, but live music lovers have an entire summer to hear him and band members, drummer Steve Toth, Rob McFarlane on bass, and Ray on guitar singing his original southern country style songs.\nThe 26-year-old Ray has been everywhere. He is a regular performer at Open Mic night at the Betterton Legion, the Back 50 Tavern, The Double Tap Tavern, Ram's Head Tavern, the Chancery in Wilmington Delaware, and the Kent County Fair to name a few.\nHe will be performing at Riley's Mill Ale Works May 17, and the next day at The Shanty Beach Bar, singing songs about battling depression, transcending love, venting frustrations, talking to God and drinking whiskey with friends.\nInspired by outlaw country greats, Waylon Jennings, Merle Haggard and the like and modern country star Luke Coombs, Ray described his music.\n\"It's nothing superficial. It's just the three chords of truth.\"\nHis album \"Built for Leaving,\" certainly showcases his ability to capture his vision. He writes for those who appreciate lyrics but also provides a catchy tune for audiences to have fun with.\nThe crowd favorite, \"Marlboro Man,\" is about a guy who relies on cigarettes and booze to mask his sadness. What is a somber theme becomes an excellent crowd sing-a-long with the chorus: \"Light em up boys! Smoke em if you got em! I won't stop till I reach the bottom.\"\n\"Built for Leaving,\" laments a woman who left him. The singer is calling her back to remember who she once was. \"Hold On\" is a tune encouraging the subject to maintain hope through the storms of life, when there seems to be no answer. \"Way Too Young\" increases the tempo and calls for an escape from a mundane life.\nThe transforming power of love is a residing theme in Ray's album as well.\nHe likens his wife's love to a \"Knotted Oak\" a poetic song that describes her love as tough, resilient, able to bear the wind and waves. Ray expresses his gratitude for that love when he sings, \"he is grateful,\" for her, and she is \"an angel.\"\n\"Antiquity\" is also a song dedicated to his love. Accompanied by clear and powerful chords, Ray sings about how she completes him, giving her a supernatural quality. \"You are my antiquity, the past and the present — the air I breathe.\"\nThe album ends in an ironic, comic country song in the style of Hank Williams Jr. or David Allen Coe, in \"I Ain't Country.\" With a growl to his voice, Ray sings, country isn't a location; it is a lifestyle. Ray, who when he is not performing, is hunting turkey, sport shooting, fishing, playing pool, drinking whiskey and riding horses, gives a brash answer to detractors who may think country music only resides in the typical southern states.\nAnybody visiting Kent County for a few seconds can see it's as country as they are and Ray notes that.\nIn addition to his album, Ray released two singles and June 5 is releasing \"That Ain't Today,\" a song he performed in Kent Got's Talent. That night, he dedicated it to a close friend suffering with cancer.\nRay has got big dreams, and is leaving Maryland to pursue them, but \"that ain't today\" so see him while you got a chance. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Thousands of people attended.Unofficial co-chairman for Strawberry Festival and Ridgley Lions Club member Brett Meyers credits the turnout and the overwhelming support for driving him to plan the festival each year.\n\"Every year, I say, 'this is the last one I'm gonna do,' and then every year we get done and we have such an amazing group of people that support us and that are in the Lions Club here in Ridgley, that I go, 'it wasn't that bad,' and so then we start planning not quite immediately, but almost immediately after the festival for next year,\" Meyers said.\nAccording to Meyers, the Strawberry Festival has become \"part of the fabric of the community here in Ridgley.\"\n\"Because I think people come out to see old friends, to get our wonderful strawberry and shortcake and to just be underneath the trees for a day,\" Meyers said.\nWhile the festival highlights strawberries in the name, the event has turned away from its early route. According to Meyers, now the festival is community based.\nThe festival featured 82 vendors from the Caroline County Sheriffs Office to venders who sell floral arrangements.\nVicki Marquess, who sold floral arrangement and fake bakes at the Strawberry Festival this year, has came out a total of six years because of the people.\n\"It feels good, its nice, a nice atmosphere good family thing for people to come too,\" Marquess said.\nRidgley Commissioner and Lions Club member Brad Sears commends the festival's ability to bring people into the town.\n\"It's the kind of event that we like to see here in Ridgley because we'd like to bring people into the town because there is so much we have to offer to the public,\" Sears said.\nSears' favorite part of the festival is meeting people, being of service and being able to do things for others. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The annual event honors a day in May 1774 when Maryland set forth \"Resolves\" forbidding importing, selling, or consuming British tea in Chestertown.\nAccording to legend, residents gathered at the local town center, marched down High Street to the brigantine Geddes anchored in the Chester River, and tossed her cargo overboard against British mandates.\nThe current tea-tossing festivities began Friday night with a block party with music from Chesapeake Sons, food trucks and vendors, beverages, and fun for all ages.\nSaturday morning, a festival staple, the Tea Party Distance Classic Run, a 10-mile run and 5k fun walk \"kicked\" things off. Organizer was Laura Livingston Marketing and Events coordinator from Radcliffe Creek School. She was pleased to report that 518 participants competed with 88 medals and awards handed out including 81-year old Lou Dwyer with a Young at Heart medal; he placed second in his age division.\nAll race proceeds went to the School's scholarship fund.\nThe race was followed by the Colonial Parade with Grand Marshal, Charlie Joiner. His vehicle was followed by first responders vehicles, colonial militia, costume-garbed children, marching bands and floats, greeting residents and guests on a warm, windy day.\nShortly after, along the water's edge, the reenactment started — the centerpiece of the festival. The reenactment team encouraged the crowd to join them in rebellion against the British government, harkening back to days ushering in the War for Independence.\nBarefoot, standing on a barrel, Reenactor Jacob Robert Swane cried out, \"Let us commit ourselves to liberty, freedom, without disguise, without the cloak of darkness, and dump the tea in the river!\" and received applause for his performance.\nOn Sunday, the fun moved to Wilmer Park with a raft race, live music from, children's activities and artisan craft vendors, available until 4 p.m. The raft race was a great time with creative rafts galore pointed out organizers.\nWinners for the humorous categories were as follows.\nFrank Floater —Congressional\nWaterfull Wizards of Oars —Van Gogh\nPeace Bus —DaVinci\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on a Log —Family Award\nFury Rowed —Tea Cup\nBeer Knights of the Boys —Fabulous Flotsam\nCaps Revenge —Flop\nThroughout the weekend, everyone had a great time with temperature around 70 degrees.\nChestertown Police Chief Ron Dixon said the event was safe estimating upwards to 10,000 attendees this year and having only one issue with some juveniles which was quickly handled by officers.\n\"The beautiful weather certainly helped bring people out,\" he said, thanking Kent County Sheriff's Office and Volunteer Fire Company Police for lending their support.\nChestertown Tea Party Festival President Steve Meehan was thrilled with the turnout this year.\n\"We had a record number of artisan craft vendors, Saturday and Sunday, the Heritage Village was full of families, food and music was great all three days, the weather was perfect. And we threw the tea overboard! We thank the Town of Chestertown residents, street crew, security and police for their invaluable support and look forward to 2026 and celebrating the country's 250th anniversary.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Recipes for graduation celebrations\n\n June 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1269\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n What an exciting time of the year — graduation has once again arrived. From graduates from nursery school, to grade school, to middle school, to high school, to night school, to college, to trade school, to graduate school to just any kind of school, congratulations.As I sit here and write this column and gather materials, my mind travels back in time to when my mother went to a one-room schoolhouse outside of Selbyville, Delaware. The outhouse being behind the school was no problem, as most of the homes had the same.\nThere were only 11 grades, and mom was a member of the Class of 1928. She always told me there was no celebration as she was running a farm with her stepfather and had to get back home to work in the fields. She said that her church group celebrated all school children the previous Sunday.\nThe next graduation I remember was in June 1954, when my sister graduated from Buckingham High School in Berlin. I remember going to the graduation was a formal affair. The boys wore suits, and the girls wore \"dressy' dresses with high heels. This attire included dark graduation robes for the guys and white robes for the girls.\nA big dinner was held at our house on Sunday to celebrate, and the house was full... and so was the kitchen sink with dirty dishes waiting for \"little sister.\"\nI graduated from Stephen Decatur High School in Berlin in 1963 with a \"large class\" of 72 students. As was the norm, my parents held a large family dinner, and guess who didn't do the dishes. I went to the beach with some of my classmates.\nThe years go by, and my youngest son graduated in 1996 from Colonel Richardson High School. We had a gathering of family and friends at home with \"BBQ and Picnic\" foods. Betty Lofland, my neighbor, made a garden flag with CRHS Class of 1996 in the school colors to fly on my pole. I still have the flag.\nIn 2022, my grandson, Mason Emory Williamson, is a member of the graduating class of Parkside High School in Salisbury. The ceremony was held at the Wicomico Civic Center due to such a large class — 800 kids. Times may have changed in the past 94 years of my family's graduations, but the message is and has always been the same — \"The world is at your feet. Take it and keep going. If you fall get right back up\".\nNow I am hungry so let us fix some food for graduation celebrations.\nFRUIT KABOBS\nMy only tip here is try not to use fruits that will brown, such as bananas, apples or peaches. Think about a variety of color.\nPrep the fruit by cutting it into slices, wedges or chunks. Thread fruit onto skewers and refrigerate until eating. Make fruit kabobs ahead of time so they'll be well chilled before serving. They'll keep in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours. For an extra twist, add some whipped cream with shredded coconut as a dip. Mix however many cups of whipped topping with 2 tbsps of shredded sweetened coconut per each cup.\nGARLIC BREAD PIZZA DIPPERS\n1 can biscuit, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 cup ricotta, 4 oz cream cheese (softened), 2 cups mozzarella cheese (shredded), 1 tsp Italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/3 cup marinara, 6-8 pepperoni, 3 tbsp parmesan.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut each biscuit in half and roll into a ball. Place each biscuit ball around the edge of an 8-inch skillet. In a small mixing bowl, combine olive oil and garlic powder. Mix and then brush onto biscuits. In a large mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, half of the mozzarella, Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. Mix until well combined. Pour in the middle of the skillet, spreading evenly to the edge of the biscuits. Pour marinara on top of the cheese mixture and spread it evenly across the top of it. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella on top of the marinara and place pepperoni on top. Place in oven and bake for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle parmesan on top. Serve hot. This recipe makes eight. Adjust accordingly to how ever many guests you are having.\nSLOW COOKER BBQ PULLED PORK SANDWHICHES\n1 lemon-garlic pork loin filet (about 1-1/3 pounds), 1 can (12 ounces) Dr Pepper, 1 bottle of your favorite barbecue sauce, 6 hamburger buns (split).\nPlace pork in a 3-qt slow cooker. Pour Dr Pepper over top. Cover and cook on low for 7-9 hours or until meat is tender. Remove meat; cool slightly. Discard cooking juices. Shred meat with 2 forks and return to the slow cooker. Stir in barbecue sauce; heat through. Serve on buns. You can also make this with chicken for a pulled chicken variation.\nCHEESEBURGER SLIDERS\n1/2 cup mayonnaise, 2 tbsps ketchup, 1 tbsp yellow mustard, 24 slider rolls (I use King's Hawaiian), 2 tbsps olive oil, 1 medium onion, (small diced), 2 pounds lean ground beef, 1 (1 ounce) package dry French Onion Soup Mix, 1 tbsp steak seasoning (I used Montreal), 10 slices American cheese, 24 pickle slices, 2 tbsps butter (melted), 1 tbsp sesame seeds.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line an 11-by-15-inch baking dish with foil and coat lightly with nonstick spray. Set aside. Slice the slider rolls in half, and place the bottoms evenly into the prepared pan, setting the tops aside. In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard. Set aside. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onions and cook, until soft and golden, stirring frequently. Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until no pink remains, breaking the meat while cooking. Drain any excess fat from the skillet. Add in the onion soup mix and the steak seasoning, stirring to combine. Remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the mayonnaise mixture and coat the meat evenly. Spread the meat mixture evenly on top of the slider rolls. Top with cheese slices, cutting to fit, if necessary. Top each with a pickle slice. Place the slider roll tops on top and press down slightly. Brush the melted butter on top of the sliders, and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Cover the pan tightly with foil. Place the pan on a large cookie sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is melted. Remove the pan from the oven and keep covered for 5-10 minutes before uncovering and serving. Store airtight in the refrigerator until serving, no longer than 24 hours to preserve taste and freshness of rolls.\nANTIPASTO KABOBS\n1 package (9 ounces) refrigerated cheese tortellini, 40 pimiento-stuffed olives, 40 large pitted ripe olives, 3/4 cup Italian salad dressing, 40 thin slices pepperoni, 20 thin slices hard salami (halved).\nCook tortellini according to package directions; drain and rinse in cold water. In a large bowl, combine the tortellini, olives and salad dressing. Toss to coat; cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. Drain mixture, discarding marinade. For each appetizer, thread a stuffed olive, a folded pepperoni slice, tortellini, a folded salami piece and a ripe olive on a toothpick or short skewer.\nRAINBOW SHERBET PUNCH\n1 gallon Breyers brand sherbet (rainbow flavored if you can find) 1 liter 7UP/Sprite/ginger ale, 1 liter of Hawaiian punch or a favorite juice of your choice, Whipped cream (optional).\nIn a large punch bowl scoop in your ice cream. Pour soda over the ice cream and break ice cream apart gently while pouring slowly then add in your juice and mix slightly to incorporate. Serve in tall glasses with a dollop of whipped cream. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "MusicLife spring recital and scholarship honors Sam Scalzo\n\n June 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 451\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — On May 28, at their spring musical showcase, MusicLife at 241 High Street, awarded the Sam Scalzo scholarship to young, local musician Ben Gilbert and a second scholarship to Kylie Griffith.Gilbert has been accepted to the Blackbird Academy in Nashville, Tennessee where he plans to study music production.\nGriffith, a skilled pianist, performed \"Lord I Need You\" that night; she plans to have music play an integral part of her life.\nMusicLife offers instrument rentals and sales, lessons, sheet music and more.\nThis year's recital was emotional since it is the first year Scalzo, an accomplished musician offering his time, energy and talents to area schools, has not been there personally to deliver the award to recipients. Scalzo is in hospice care and a tearful playing of \"Shall We Gather\" ended Wednesday night's program reflecting on his many contributions.\nOwner of MusicLife Bill Drazga played the piano and delivered the heartfelt vocals portraying a distant land beyond pain, suffering and death.\n\"Yes, we'll gather at the river,\" he sang. \"The beautiful, the beautiful river. Gather with the saints at the river, that flows by the throne of God.\"\nThe recital reflected Scalzo's passion for music by showcasing musicians of all ages and styles singing and performing numbers in rock, classical and everything in between.\nTo some students such as Auden Unsworth this was their first recital, encouraged by the teachers, performing in a creative and fun environment while proud instructors looked on.\nScalzo too, would have been pleased.\nBetter known as \"Sam, the Italian Music Man\" in Rock Hall, he spent his entire life in music, beginning at a young age and learning from the First Clarinet Player at the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra. When he was not performing, he was fostering young musicians in Kent County High School Jazz Band, tutoring elementary students, practicing weekly with general band students or cheering on the marching band.\nDrazga said in the 25 years of knowing Scalzo, \"I think he is the only person on earth that loves music more than I do.\"\nDrazga came up with the idea of the scholarship to honor the many contributions Scalzo has made to music education in Kent and Queen Anne's counties over the years.\n\"Mr. Scalzo has shown his dedication to cultivating young people's musical education through his countless years of work in Kent County schools and beyond.\"\nThe scholarship was established in 2019 by MusicLife, in partnership with family and friends and awarded annually to a local graduating high school senior.\nPast recipients are Sarah Parker (2019), Jane Godfrey (2020), Claire O'Brien and Isabella Williams (2021), Corrina Boyd (2022), Jade Lee (2023) and Aaron Saunders (2024).\nAnyone wishing to make a donation to future scholarship awards can find more information at musiclifedelmarva.com or by calling at 410-778-7010. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Steaks for Father's Day\n\n June 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: News \n \n 958\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Father's Day was introduced in the United States in the early 20th century to complement Mother's Day.Father's Day was founded in Spokane, Washington at the YMCA by Sonora Dodd, who was born in Arkansas. Her father was a Civil War veteran and a single parent who raised six children. After hearing a sermon about Anna Jarvis' Mother's Day in 1909, Dodd told her pastor that fathers should be celebrated as well. Beginning in 1915, Father's Day has been celebrated on the third Sunday in June.\nHats off to all fathers on this special day. My own father was a proud father of nine sons and two daughters. There were many of our friends included in our family functions that had no father figures in their lives, and \"Pop\" treated us all the same.\nHis famous saying was \"You put your feet under our table, then your hands were put on farm work like my own kids'.\" Needless to say, it did not deter anyone from coming to the table.\nToday, I am turning the column to my son John. Proud father to three boys — Mason, Colin and Braxton. Enjoy your day with some wonderful grilled steaks.\nGrilling Steak\nI prefer not to freeze my steak. It is not always convenient, but I try to get my steak the day of or day before I plan to grill it. I think steak that is not frozen and then thawed out tastes better. Could just be me.\nHowever you do it, whether from the freezer or out of the refrigerator, take that steak out and let it sit. Steak right out of the fridge will cook unevenly. Set yours out at room temperature for 30 minutes before grilling.\nHere are a few ways to grill various cuts of steak as well as the various temperatures for getting the grill you want.\nRare: 120 to 130 degrees.Medium Rare: 130 to 135 degrees.Medium: 135 to 145 degrees.Medium Well: 145 to 155 degrees.Well Done: 155+ degrees.\nSIRLOIN\nPreheat the grill over high heat. Season steak generously with salt and pepper. Grill steak over direct heat 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.\nSKIRT STEAK\nPreheat the grill over high heat. Season steak generously with salt and pepper. Grill steak over direct heat 3 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.\nRIBEYE\nPreheat the grill over high heat. Season steak generously with salt and pepper. Grill steak over direct heat 4 to 6 minutes per side for medium-rare.\nFILET MIGNON\nPreheat the grill over high heat. Season steak generously with salt and pepper. Grill steak over direct heat 5 to 6 minutes per side for medium-rare.\nT-BONE STEAK\nThere is something magic about a nice, fat T-bone. That piece of bone gives this steak so much flavor that you'll want to pick it up and eat steak right off the bone when your plate is clean. I like my T-bones to be at least 1 inch to 1 ¼ thick. This is so you can get a good crust but still have nice tender meat. Thaw your T bone out and let it sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. If your grill doesn't have a thermometer, you can try to use a meat thermometer to check the surface heat, but it is not always accurate.\nHere is what you'll need: 2 T-bone steaks at least 1 1/2 inches thick, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, 1 stick unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary (chopped), 2 cloves garlic (finely minced), ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper.\nTurn on your grill and let it warm up to medium-high heat. Clean the grill grates and oil them. Pat the steaks dry with paper towels, then generously season with salt and pepper from all sides including the edges. Make the garlic butter, in a small saucepan, melt the butter with rosemary, garlic, and pepper. When the butter starts bubbling, cook for 1 minute then remove from heat so you don't burn the garlic. Allow the herb and garlic to steep in the butter as you grill the steaks. Add the steaks to the grill and reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 minutes per side. Check the temperature. For a medium rare steak, grill the steaks for about 4 minutes on each side until the internal temperature reaches 130 degrees.When the steaks are done, remove from the grill onto a plate and pour the butter all over the steaks and cover with foil. Allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.\nNEW YORK STRIP\nNew York strip is my second favorite cut of steak that is much prepared the same way with a few adjustments. After letting steaks sit out for maybe 20 minutes, pat them dry. You want to try to get the same thickness of at least 1 inch thick. Pat dry to absorb any extra fluid or moisture.\nHere is what you'll need: 2 New York strip steaks at least 1 inch thick, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, 1 stick unsalted butter.\nI preheat the grill to high heat. Heat the butter in a microwave safe bowl and then when ready I coat each steak on all sides as well as edges. I sprinkle the Kinder's Prime Steak seasoning on both sides of the steak. When you are ready to grill the steak turn the heat down to medium then place the steaks on the grill. Let sit for about 4 minutes a side then flip. At this point I coat with butter and sprinkle more seasoning on each side after I flip. About 5 minutes a side and I check the temperature using a meat thermometer. I like my steak medium rare so I pull them off when they hit 130 to 135 degrees. I slice immediately and eat while hot off the grill. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Henry Price Betterton American Legion during their second annual American Legion Family Day.From 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. they held face painting, a moon bounce house, corn hole games, a petting zoo with goats, donkeys and cows, with popcorn, drinks and hotdogs.\nMarcellus Black Jr. organized the music and each Legion station offered smiles and camaraderie.\nFor some added excitement, kids got to experience what it's like behind the wheel of Engine 4 courtesy of the Kennedyville Volunteer Fire House.\nThis event was part of the national American Legion Family Day, which is held on the last Saturday of April to recognize and celebrate the accomplishments of Legionnaires, Sons of The American Legion members, Legion Riders and American Legion Auxiliary, and to bring awareness to the organization's \"Be the One\" initiative to reduce the rate of veteran suicide.\nBetterton held its pool tournament on that date, so the family fun event was pushed back to Saturday, said Legion Auxiliary President Patti Bone.\nSince it was also Flag Day, the Legion retired many old American Flags, holding a ceremony then burning them to dispose of them — the proper way to do it.\nPost Cmdr. Jacob Matthews said since there was a lot going on Saturday, especially in Chestertown, he was pleased with the turnout, and looks forward as the post plans more events that bring the community together.\nEvery Thursday at 7 p.m., open mic night is hosted by Gerry Werner featuring a 50-50 drawing, music, comedy and trivia. The post meal will be pulled pork barbecue with drinks served by your favorite bartender. Come out and play or sing your favorite tunes. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The Academy invited several artists, from painters to pastel artists, to set up their canvases and let the music guide them to their creative destination.\nJones said he did something similar with the art museum for his first album, \"Bohemian Beatbox.\" However, that session was not in collaboration with other artists.\n\"For this one, I was like, 'man, we should add a component where there are actual people, where there are actual artists there creating too,'\" Jones said. \"Artists inspire other artists.\"\nJones took inspiration from Richard Estes' exhibit \"Urban Landscapes,\" which is featured in the museum until Aug. 3. A photorealist painter, Estes' work showcases the reflective surfaces of the city. The exhibit's focus on reflections serves as a reminder that artists are reflections of their lived experiences and of each other, according to Jones.\nEllie Christiansen, of St. Michaels, was one of the painters at the recording session. She decided not to arrive with an idea of what she wanted to paint. Rather, she took a walk around the gallery and viewed other pieces of art to get color inspiration. Upon returning to the room, she said she let the music inform her painting decisions.\n\"I think that it's a beautiful, inspiring event that can bring together community members and artists who can be inspired by the music,\" Christiansen said. \"I don't think you get a chance to do that very often.\"\nPainting during a live music recording session was not an opportunity she's had before, she said, but she enjoyed it.\n\"If I could do this every Saturday, I think I would because it's always nice to be around fellow artists, especially listening to amazing, inspirational music,\" Christiansen said.\nThe quiet, dimly lit room created a relaxing environment. Guests could walk around freely and engage with the performers and artists.\n\"Good scenery, good visuals and good sounds,\" said Kentavius's mother, Lois McCoy, describing the ambiance of the event. McCoy said she was excited to experience her son's recording process, something she's only heard about.\nThroughout the session, Kentavius and the band switched between improvising and recording, allowing audience members to experience the raw recording process.\n\"The musicians, they were somewhat familiar with some of the songs, but some of the songs they never heard before,\" Jones said. \"I wanted people to see it unfold live.\"\nJones said the experience felt organic for him, and he was grateful for the opportunity to make his art even more collaborative. He often took breaks from performing to engage with audience members. At one point, he individually greeted and introduced himself to each person in attendance.\n\"To have folks there a part of the recording process, it just further builds that relationship, that connection between me as the creator and folks as the audience,\" Jones said. \"It was magical for me.\"\nSome of the music recorded at this session will be performed at Jones' public outdoor concert at the Academy Art Museum on Aug. 2. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The parade took just over 20 minutes, which seemed like a long time for many of the children as temperatures reached the mid-80s.\nBrian Collison and his 14-year-old daughter, Constance, stood on a downtown corner, Brian playing patriotic songs on his trumpet with Constance accompanying him on the drums. The Collisons came from Denver, Colorado, to visit relatives in St. Michaels over the holiday weekend.\nFour friends from Crofton came to St. Michaels, the third time they marched in the parade. The four — Megan Elias, Ellie Cockrell, Taylor Sundick and Ella Davis — painted their faces red, white and blue.\n\"We love being patriotic,\" Sundick said.\nFollowing the parade a traditional Fourth of July program was held on the museum lawn starting with the Scout troop raising the flag and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. The program included patriotic and folk songs.\nThe Fourth of July weekend in St. Michaels concluded Saturday with Big Band Night at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum followed by fireworks at dusk. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — More than 1,700 people from around the Eastern Shore and beyond showed up to the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum on Saturday night to celebrate the July 4 weekend, enjoy the 18-piece big band and watch St. Michaels fireworks display.The Shades of Blue Orchestra provided entertainment for the whole family, spanning genres and generations through their tunes. The father-daughter duo Tony and Gia Liberto joined the band for multiple songs, belting out ballads alongside the instrumentalists.\n\"The talent must run in the family,\" said Michael Walker, conductor of the Shades of Blue Orchestra.\nAccording to Shannon Mitchell, vice president of engagement for the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, the Shades of Blue Orchestra has been playing at Big Band Night for at least the past decade.\nBetween songs, Walker thanked and honored the veterans who attended, gushed over how honored he was to be a part of this and spoke about the importance of music education.\n\"It has real value to the human brain,\" he said.\nWalker guided the band into \"Fly Me To The Moon\" by Frank Sinatra, which Tony Liberto sang with grace and ease. The dance floor filled with couples of all ages and a sister duo wearing matching American flag dresses who maybe stopped dancing one time throughout the night.\nDelawareans Renee Goolday and Mitch Greene said they always wanted to visit St. Michaels and saw Big Band Night as the perfect opportunity.\n\"I saw the fireworks were going to happen tonight, and I thought this was perfect weather so we drove the Jeep down,\" Goolday said.\nMitchell said Big Band Night is unique compared to other festivals and events in the area with the focus being on music and fireworks, having a bring-your-own beverage model, there being few food vendors and cheaper tickets making it more accessible.\nThis year, the space next to the museum's welcome center was used for inflatables like slides and a bouncy house with a speaker playing the big band, so parents didn't miss out. According to Mitchell, in previous years this area was extra viewing space for the fireworks.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum is situated in front of where the firework display is set, making it a premier destination for the show. As the sun began setting, the museum's lighthouse and gazebo glimmered in red, white and blue.\nBy 9:30 p.m. all eyes were fixed on the show in the sky. Bursts of colors reflected on the Bay as the Star Wars theme song played in the background.\n\"Wow, Mommy!\" a little boy said emphatically after each firework went off. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cow chip toss defining moment for reporter\n\n July 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1056\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n FAIR HILL — I never gave a crap about cow chip tosses until I competed in one at the Cecil County Fair on Sunday evening.My editor assigned me the story. And it was consistent with the other George-Plimpton-style assignments he had doled out to me for our fair (the event, not the quality of work) coverage in the past.\nHe is the reason why I plunged my face into a miniature peach cobbler topped with a cumulus cloud of whipped cream during the annual pie-eating contest two years ago, as one example.\nThe contest is simple. Contestants competing by gender and in various age brackets attempt to toss a \"cow chip\" into a metal bucket, which is about 15 feet away. Those who sink the cow chip advance to Round 2, when the toss-line is moved back to approximately 20 feet away from the target, and those who miss are eliminated.\nThis process is repeated until every competitor is sidelined except for the most accurate tosser, who smiles moments later as a fair representative presents him or her with the 1st Place Ribbon.\nThen, that elated cow-chip-toss winner looks straight into the lens and gushes, \"I'm going to Disney World,\" after the off-camera reporter asks what will be the champion's next conquest . . . OK, OK, I made up that last part.\nBefore I continue with my slightly embellished account, it's important to clear up some misleading cow-chip-toss terms, the first of which is the term \"cow chip.\" For the record, I and my fellow contestants did not toss cow chips.\nInstead, we tossed clay pigeons, the kind that hunters use for target practice. Those clay pigeons are normally propelled high into the air by a machine or by a guy with a really, really strong throwing arm to simulate the flight of pheasants, geese, ducks and other winged prey and hunters shoot them down with their shotguns.\nI hate to quibble, but the clay pigeons we tossed Sunday evening looked nothing like pigeons — or any other type of bird, reptile or mammal, including humans. What we cow-chip-toss gladiators tossed were orangey, palm-sized discs.\nFurthermore, I feel compelled to be a stickler about this: clay pigeons aren't made of clay, but they actually are comprised of limestone and petroleum pitch — based on my extensive AI and Wikipedia research . . . Yeah, it's starting to dawn on me now that I don't hate to quibble after all.\nSo why is the contest called a cow chip toss?\nWell, this is where it gets repulsively interesting. It seems that, up until an estimated two decades ago, according to some unofficial Cecil County Fair historians, cow chip toss competitors tossed actual cow chips.\nWhat is a cow chip, some may ask. Sure, I'll field this one. A cow chip is manure that has been dropped in a field by — you guessed it, a cow — and then has been dried out by the sun into a hardened, disc-like shape.\nIt should not be confused with the terms \"cow patties\" or \"cow pies,\" however, if I'm comprehending my AI/Wikipedia research information correctly.\nCow patties and cow pies are fresh (Oxymoron Alert), wet cow dung, before they've been petrified by the sun. Speaking of petrified, the AI Overview included a photo of a fresh, wet cow patty and it scared me to death. Some things in life you truly cannot unsee.\nSo where was I? Oh yeah, petrified cow crap and how it was once used in the cow chip toss contests.\nI assumed, naturally, that Cecil County Fair officials overseeing the cow chip toss competition 20-some years ago pooh-pooh'ed the practice of using real dry dung discs and replaced them with clay pigeons — or discs masquerading as clay and as pigeons — because it would be more sanitary.\nBut that is not the reason, according to local farmer and fellow contestant Mark Crouse, who chatted with me Sunday evening during the competition. He explained that fair planners in the Cow Chip Toss Department opted for clay pigeons (ahem) at some point because of a supply-and-demand problem encountered when doing things the organic, old-fashioned way.\nTurns out, Crouse, who is 48, traipsed through the fields on the Miller Family dairy farm near North East when he was a teenager and gathered cow chips for the annual fair contest. Al Miller, who has served on the Cecil County Fair Board for 47 years, also served on that cow chip collection crew.\n\"It's harder to collect suitable cow chips than you would think,\" Crouse emphasized.\nThen Crouse outlined, \"The cow had to go in the pasture. You couldn't have rain the day before or even two days before, either, because it had to be completely dried out. You hope it's dry before you pick it up, but that isn't always the case.\"\nIt's noteworthy here that, according to my AI research, a fresh cow patty consists of approximately 83 percent water. Yes, it actually cited \"about\" 83 percent. I'm assuming a more precise cow-manure-moisture reading would involve a decimal point followed by lots more numbers, all of which compiled by scientists in white lab coats and buoyed by government grants.\nMiller further explained that changes in the dairy farming field (no pun intended) created the supply problem. \"The cows used to go out in the pasture, but the cows are more confined now,\" Miller said, agreeing that the change leading to the paucity of perfect cow poo occurred about 20 to 30 years ago.\nSo where was I? Oh yeah, Sunday evening's cow chip toss contest and my participation in it.\nWell, we're running out of space now because, apparently, I digressed for quite a bit back there. So I'll finally cut to the chase. I competed in the class for men who are 26 and older and sunk my first \"cow chip.\" During Round 2, I missed slightly to the right of the bucket, with my clay pigeon crashing onto the ground and exploding into tiny pieces like it had been shot by a target-practicing hunter.\nAfter Round 3, which I watched from the sidelines, it was determined that I tied for 2nd Place. And I, quite surprised, received a ribbon indicating that feat.\nBut I must say this: Knowing that I could have been tossing real cow chips if that supply-and-demand problem hadn't happened, I left the fair Sunday evening feeling like I took home a 1st Place Ribbon. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Due to inclement weather, Thursday's festivities were cancelled.Thursday was one of the strongest days for turnout at last year's event, Fire Company officials said. With cooler weather for the next two days, the Fire Company hoped attendance would be high to make up for lost revenues.\nThe annual fair brings in about 30% of the Fire Company's revenue for the year.\n\"There's always a risk of losing a day, and hopefully you only lose one day,\" said Cheryl Lewis, secretary for the Trappe Volunteer Fire Company. \"We just hope that the public shows up on Friday and Saturday to help us recoup what we potentially could have made on Thursday.\"\nThe fair will be open on Friday and Saturday from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.\nEvery year, the Fire Company offers cheap prices for games and food. This year will be no different.\n\"One of the things that we do at our fair that really does kind of set us apart is we work really hard to keep the cost extremely low, so it's family-oriented,\" Lewis said. \"So, our games are about $2, and I don't think we have anything that's more than $2. Our rides are a dollar, our food is $2 for a hot dog, $5 for a hamburger. So, we work really hard at making it possible for for families to come out and be able to participate. We just really hope that we make the money in volume and support.\"\nIn addition to the low cost of food, rides and games, the Fire Company holds a silent auction with gifts and gift baskets donated by community members and businesses.\nSome prices featured in the silent auction are a cub cadet lawn mower, Traeger smoker and an antique fishing rod.\nA parade will be held on Saturday at 6 p.m. staring on Route 50 at Main Street and coming back to the fair grounds on 4001 Powell Ave in Trappe. Shelly Abbott will perform music and will allow some karaoke.\nFor more information, Visit the Trappe Volunteer Fire Company Facebook Page. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Unfortunately, the first day of the fair was cancelled due to inclement weather.\nI have never seen a fair with as low as prices than the Old Tyme Fair. From $2 games to great prices for food, it is an affordable option for family fun this weekend.\nPlus, supporting a local volunteer fire company is always a bonus.\nFair season is the best, and if you're looking for a fair this weekend, the Old Tyme Fair is a perfect option. You can read more about it in my story below.\nAlso in today's newsletter: protests continue for an Easton pastor detained by ICE, Talbot County's proposed cannabis regulations receive mixed reviews, and more.\nThanks for reading.\n— Ahmad Garnett\n— Ahmad Garnett \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'One for the books' — Betterton Day draws families for a day of suds and fun\n\n August 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 407\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BETTERTON — The weather was gorgeous and the beach was well-attended for Betterton Appreciation Day on Friday night into Saturday afternoon.\"Betterton Day was perfect with amazing weather, the parade was awesome. The band had people dancing. The magic show had the kids and adults laughing. It was a great time,\" replied a representative for Betterton Day.\nFireworks on Friday night on the boardwalk bedazzled audiences.\nThe next morning, Ryann Marchetti sang the \"Star Spangled Banner\". The parade followed, featuring Kent's first responders, marching bands and fun floats before beachside vendors sold everything from bookmarks to baked goods.\nBetterton vendor, Nina's Baked Goods sold great tasting items including their bacon cheddar scones, said Nina and Sienna Fahrman, residents of Betterton.\nThe Union United Methodist Church in Worton offered savory trout, said volunteer George Johnson.\nJim DeCaro of Still Pond Creations sold paintings of journeys to the Outer Banks in North Carolina, a double rainbow in an azure sky, a sunset on the Sassafras and many other works.\nEveryone seemed to participate in the fun. Dave LeClair from his residence on the hill, shot off tiny plastic soldiers on parachutes down to expectant kids. Residents from Rigby Bluff II condominiums threw beachballs down to the kids simultaneously as the Willy Woo Woo Productions float operated a bubble machine spreading suds.\nToys, bubbles and candy surrounded scurrying kids, having fun while their parents froze those fond moments on their cell phones.\nNew this year was the magic show by magician of 50 years, Michael Cox and family, Jennifer, Hailey and Caidyn Cox of Willy Woo Woo Productions.\nThe show drew around 150 adults and kids near the pavilion steps such as little Layanna Johnson. Her aunt Akilah Johnson-Downes complimented the show.\n\"We definitely enjoyed this. This year's Betterton Day was one for the books.\"\nThat was followed up by the crowd favorite at the park, Cow Plop Bingo, and while Rosa the cow did not \"plop\", money went to Fred Zink, noted volunteer for the fire company, as his number was drawn at random from approximately 500 plots.\nRepresentatives for Betterton Day extended their thanks to organizers.\n\"Thank you so much to the Betterton Community Development Corporation, Betterton American Legion, Betterton Volunteer Fire Company and the Betterton Still Pond Lions Club, especially volunteers, Gerry and Linda Werner for pouring countless hours bringing this event to life.\"\nFor more information and pictures of Betterton Day, find them on Facebook and do not forget to attend next year's beach party, Gerry and Linda Werner reminded. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Cooking for The King\n\n August 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1061\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Today's column is being written from the heart. The month of August is always a busy month, but not too busy for me to reflect on the past.Those of you who know me also know this is the month I usually travel to Memphis and meet with worldwide friends to gather at Graceland and pay respects to Elvis.\nAug. 16, 1977 was the day we teenagers of the late 1950s and '60s lost one of our favorite idols. Hard to believe it's been 48 years since I heard the news that morning. As goes with all our idols, Elvis is just as popular today with fans of all ages.\nMy answer to those who ask why I liked him so much is easy to explain: My older siblings loved the late 1940s through the mid-1950s music, and when I became a preteen, my generation needed a change of dance styles and rock 'n' roll music. And we got it — to the horror of our elders. That is true for all generations.\nWhen I meet fans from Germany, some are my age, but some are 30 and 40 years old and remembering their grandparents and parents talking about Elvis serving in the Army in Germany.\nLet's explore some of the King's favorite foods. Elvis loved his mother's meatloaf, and I occasionally make this recipe.\nMEATLOAF\n2 lbs ground beef, one chopped onion, one chopped green pepper, two minced cloves garlic, 4 oz crushed saltines, 8-oz can crushed tomatoes, 8-oz can tomato sauce, 1/2 cup ketchup.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Mix together ground beef with onion, green pepper, garlic, crushed saltines and crushed tomatoes. Mix well and form into a loaf and place in a baking pan. Bake covered, for 45 minutes. In the meantime, mix tomato sauce and ketchup and set aside. After 45 minutes of baking, remove the meatloaf and pour the ketchup on top and return to the oven. Bake for another 15 minutes and serve with mashed potatoes.\nROAST BEEF\n2 tbsps black pepper, 1 1/2 tbsps salt, 2 tbsps garlic, 6 lb beef, 1 1/2 cups water.\nMix pepper, salt and garlic to form a paste and rub on this mixture on the beef. Place this roast in a baking pan, add water and place in a 350-degree oven. Bake for about 4 hours or until tender. You can steam some fresh vegetables to serve with the roast.\nSPANISH OMELETTE\n4 eggs, 1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1/2 cup shredded cheese, salt and pepper.\nBeat eggs well and mix in bell pepper and onion. Fold in 1/2 cup shredded cheese of your choice with salt and pepper to taste. Cook in a greased skillet for about 4 minutes.\nHAMBURGER STEAK ELVIS\n2 1/2 pounds ground beef, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1/2 cup chopped green pepper, 1 tbsp garlic, 1 tbsp salt, 1 tbsp black pepper, 2 cups mushroom soup, 2 eggs (beaten).\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl mix together ground beef, chopped onions, chopped green pepper, garlic, salt, black pepper, mushroom soup and eggs. Mix well Shape into mini steaks and fry in a skillet with 2 tablespoons Crisco. Cook for about 12 to 15 minutes, making sure steaks are cooked inside well. Drain on paper towels and proceed to make gravy with grease left in the pan.\nELVIS BANANA BREAD\n2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 4 medium ripe bananas (mashed), 2 large eggs (room temperature), 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter, 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/4 cup canola oil, 2 tsps vanilla extract, 2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk the first six ingredients. In another bowl, whisk bananas, eggs, peanut butter, applesauce, oil and vanilla until blended. Add to flour mixture; stir just until moistened. Fold in chocolate chips. Transfer to three loaf pans coated with cooking spray. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in pans 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool. If you make multiple loaves like Mary Jenkins Langston would make for his plane rides to Las Vegas, you can freeze them and reheat. Securely wrap the cooled loaves and freeze. To use, thaw at room temperature or, if desired, microwave each loaf on high for 60-75 seconds or until heated through.\nFRIED PEANUT BUTTER AND BANANA SANDWICHES\nSmear peanut butter on one slice of bread, and on the other slice smear the bread with mashed banana. Put the slices together, smear each outside slice with bacon grease and fry in a hot skillet.\nFRIED DILL PICKLES\n1 jar (32 oz) whole dill pickles, 1 cup buttermilk, 2 tbsps Louisiana-style hot sauce, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup cornmeal, 2 tbsps garlic salt, 2 tbsps paprika, 1 tbsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp pepper, oil for deep-fat frying, ranch salad dressing.\nDrain pickles, discarding liquid. Cut pickles into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Drain on paper towels; blot with additional paper towels until dry. In a shallow bowl, mix buttermilk and hot sauce. In another shallow bowl, mix flour, cornmeal, garlic salt, paprika, cayenne pepper and pepper. Dip pickles in buttermilk mixture, then in flour mixture. In a Dutch oven, heat one inch of oil to 375 degrees. Working in batches, fry pickles for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with ranch dressing, if desired.\nBefore I close the column today, I need to honor my late brother, Staff Sgt. (E6) Ollie L. Hitchens Jr., who would be celebrating his 78th birthday on Aug. 15. Ollie served 20 years in the U.S. Army and pulled three tours of duty in Vietnam.\nOllie and I had a lot in common — our likes, dislikes, love for Chevy cars, love of family, patriotic responsibilities, personalities and love for Elvis.\nOllie loved our mom's old-fashioned cooking and often wrote home about how he missed it. While on his many trips home Mom would make sure to have those foods ready — fried chicken, pot roast, pork chops, mashed potatoes, fried liver with gravy, chicken and dumplings, fresh lima beans with tomatoes, corn and potatoes and of course homemade biscuits. I have shared many of these recipes with you in previous columns.\nRest in peace, brother — as I always say, \"All gave some, and some gave all.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

During the ribbon cutting, multiple county officials spoke on how important 4-H Park is to the community and how important the fair is to the park.\n\"4-H and these county fairs are just such an essential part of keeping our future going,\" Dorchester County Council member Mike Detmer said.\n\"...I love coming here with my family. I love coming here and enjoying all the families and kids that are here. I just want them to know we just are cheering for them so much and we're counting on them. We're so appreciative for the the opportunity this gives to 4-H and other students here that are doing such a great job. We're so proud of you.\"\nSen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) spoke on behalf of the Eastern Shore legislative delegation.\n\"We always look forward to this wonderful tradition,\" Mautz said. \"It is Americana in person right here in Caroline County. It's an honor to be a part of it, and especially we want to salute our 4-H'ers. We always like to come out here seeing everything you guys put into those animals every year. Its a great thing, so God bless the 4-H and God bless the fair.\"\nThe fair includes family fun for all ages with different events and themes and attractions each day.\nOne particular exhibit that drew a crowd at the fair was Lumberjack Ray.\nRay Geist, a Talbot County native, is a former Timber Sports professional. He was able to put his skills on display for Caroline and Dorchester residents at the fair Wednesday.\nGeist started Timber Sports, a lumberjack-style sport, in 2011. He participated in all four years of college and then got a job at the Great Alaskan Lumberjack Show in Ketchikan, Alaska.\n\"I did that for 10 years off and on and then came back here and been back in Maryland, which is home sweet home,\" he said.\nGeist performed axe throwing, log rolling, underhand chop and more on Wednesday. He said it was amazing to perform for his hometown because people don't get a chance to see Timber Sports in person.\n\"People haven't seen it in real life, TV here and there, but to be able to have the demonstration here and to have my local family and friends here to see it, it's a lot of fun,\" Geist said.\nFor more information on the schedule for the fair, visit carolinedorchestercountyfair.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2025-08-12",
    "author": "MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking",
    "content": "Country Cooking: Treats from carnivals and fairs\n\n August 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: News \n \n 1278\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Carnivals and fairs — what a welcome treat each year for folks of all ages.Growing up on the farm, we always looked forward to traveling to those adventures. Even though we lived just a few miles from the boardwalks in Ocean City and Rehoboth Beach, we always attended the carnivals and the Delaware State Fair in Harrington.\nThe local carnivals had the usual rides — smaller Ferris wheels, small train rides on short tracks, tilt-a-wheels and swings. The state fair would have much more active rides on a larger scale.\nOf course, the boardwalks had the famous bumper cars, a giant Ferris wheel, small boat rides, a merry-go-round and that laughing lady — I was always scared of her.\nLet's check out the food at the local carnivals. Most of the carnival foods are cooked on the grounds by the local volunteer firefighters and their families, along with other local volunteers.\nSome of the best oyster fritter sandwiches and fried soft crab sandwiches on the Shore can be found here — did I mention clam strips and fries. Some other fair and carnival foods and treats include: corn dogs, deep fried onions, fried pickles, funnel cakes, caramel apples, cotton candy, popcorn balls, hot dogs, hamburgers, fried alligator and snow cones, and the list goes on.\nEnjoy all these foods, and try some of them at home.\nDEEP FRIED OREO COOKIES\n2 quarts vegetable oil for frying, 1 cup milk, 1 large egg, 2 tsps vegetable oil, 1 cup pancake mix, 1 18-oz package cream-filled chocolate sandwich cookies.\nGather all ingredients. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees. Whisk milk, egg and 2 tsps of vegetable oil in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in the pancake mix until no dry lumps remain. Dip cookies into batter, one at a time, and carefully place into hot oil. Fry in batches, 4 or 5 at a time, until cookies are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.\nSTATE FAIR CORNDOG\n1 cup yellow cornmeal, 1 cup all-purpose flour, ¼ cup white sugar, 4 tsps baking powder, ¼ tsp salt, ⅛ tsp black pepper, 1 cup milk, 1 large egg, 1 quart vegetable oil for frying, 2 16-oz packages beef hot dogs, wooden skewers.\nCombine cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; stir in milk and egg to make a batter. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees. Meanwhile, pat hot dogs dry and insert a skewer into each one. Roll hot dogs in batter until well coated. Fry 2 or 3 corn dogs at a time in preheated oil until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.\nFUNNEL CAKES\n3 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour (divided), 2 tsps baking powder, ½ tsp salt, 2 cups milk, 3 large eggs, ¼ cup white sugar, 1 quart vegetable oil for frying, 2 tbsps confectioners' sugar.\nMix together half of the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside. Beat together milk, eggs, and sugar in a large bowl. Add flour mixture and beat until smooth. Add remaining flour, using only enough to achieve a runny batter thin enough to flow through a funnel. Heat 1 inch oil in an 8-inch skillet to 375 degrees. Put your finger over the bottom opening of a funnel and fill with a generous 1/2 cup batter. Release batter close to the surface of hot oil while making a circular motion and fry until the bottom is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Use tongs and a wide spatula to carefully turn cake over and fry until the other side is golden brown, about 1 minute more. Drain cake on a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Repeat with remaining batter.\nTURKEY LEGS\n1 2-liter bottle lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage, 2 tbsps sugar, 2 tbsps hot sauce, 1 tbsp crushed red pepper flakes, 1 tbsp black pepper, 1 large sweet onion (sliced), 4 turkey legs, 2 tbsps honey, 1 tbsp steak seasoning.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. In a large pot, mix the lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage, sugar, hot sauce, red pepper, pepper and onion. Place the turkey legs in the mixture and bring to a boil. Cook 30 to 45 minutes until the turkey has reached an internal temperature of 180 degrees. Remove onion slices from the mixture, and arrange on the prepared grill. Place turkey legs over the onions. Drizzle with honey and season with steak seasoning. Cook, tuning once, 20 minutes, or until a crisp browned crust has formed on the turkey legs.\nDEEP FRIED PICKLES\n2 eggs, 1 cup buttermilk, 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, ½ tsp vinegar-based hot pepper sauce, ¾ tsp cayenne pepper, ¼ tsp seasoning salt, ¼ tsp garlic powder, 1 cup cornmeal, 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, 1 tsp salt, ¾ tsp ground black pepper, 1 32-oz jar dill pickle slices, 1 cup vegetable oil for deep frying, salt and pepper to taste.\nIn a large bowl, combine eggs, 1/4 cup of the flour, buttermilk, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, cayenne pepper, seasoning salt and garlic powder. In a separate mixing bowl, combine cornmeal, 2 cups flour, salt and 3/4 tsp black pepper. Preheat oil in a deep fryer or pot to 365 degrees. Dip drained pickles into milk mixture and then dredge them in the flour mixture. Deep fry until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Salt and pepper to taste\nSTATE FAIR SWEET TEA\n2 cups water, 6 black tea bags, 1/8 tsp baking soda, 2/3 cup sugar, 6 cups cold water.\nIn a small saucepan, bring water to a boil. Remove from the heat; add tea bags. Cover and steep for 10 minutes. Discard tea bags. Sprinkle baking soda into a 2-quart pitcher. Transfer tea to pitcher; stir in sugar. Add cold water. Refrigerate until chilled.\nCARNIVAL CHURROS\n6 tbsps unsalted butter, 2 tbsps plus 1 cup granulated sugar (divided), 1 tsp pure vanilla extract, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1/4 cup ground cinnamon, 2 large eggs, vegetable oil for frying.\nIn a large saucepan over medium heat, bring butter, 2 tbsps sugar and 1 cup water to a boil, then stir in vanilla. Remove from heat and add flour and salt. Stir with a wooden spoon until thickened, about 30 seconds. Let cool 10 minutes. Meanwhile, on a rimmed baking sheet or large plate, mix cinnamon and remaining 1 cup sugar. Using a handheld mixer on medium speed, add eggs one at a time, beating to blend after each addition. Transfer mixture to a piping bag fitted with a large open star tip. Into a large pot fitted with a deep-fry thermometer, pour oil to come halfway up sides. Heat over medium-high heat until the thermometer registers 375 degrees. Holding a piping bag a few inches above oil, carefully pipe churros into 6-inch ropes. Using kitchen scissors, cut off dough from the piping bag. Working in batches, fry churros, turning as needed, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes; make sure oil registers 375 degrees between batches. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, immediately roll churros in cinnamon sugar, then transfer to a wire rack.\nCARAMEL POPCORN\n6 quarts popped popcorn, 2 cups packed brown sugar, 1 cup butter (cubed), 1/2 cup corn syrup, 1 tsp salt, 3 tsps vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp baking soda.\nPlace popcorn in a large bowl and set aside. In a large saucepan, combine the brown sugar, butter, corn syrup and salt; bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Boil for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat. Stir in vanilla and baking soda; mix well. Pour over popcorn and stir until well coated. Pour into 2 greased 13-by-9-inch baking pans. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Rock Hall Bull Roast returns for 70th season\n\n August 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BOB FORD Special contribution to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 625\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ROCK HALL — When St. John Catholic Church parish members in Rock Hall first planned a fundraising bull roast to help build a new church for the congregation, they probably couldn't imagine the event would one day be celebrating its 70th renewal.That is the case, however, and the 2025 edition of the event that began in 1954 — missing only two years during the COVID pandemic — will return for the 70th time on Sunday, Aug. 17 from 1 to 5 p.m. at the Rock Hall Volunteer Fire Company.\n\"This event is kind of the mountaintop for the community every year,\" said Deacon John L. Davis, who has been with the Sacred Heart/St. John parish for more than 20 years. \"It's humbling to see how many people give their time and their talent to always make it a success. There have been times when you are tempted to say, 'Well, this year might not work,' but it always does and it's always great.\"\nThe first bull roast and several thereafter were held on the Eastern Neck farm property of Dr. Norbert Nitsch, and was organized by Nitsch, his wife, Ethel Nitsch, and neighbors Ernest \"Tot\" Willson and his wife, Mary Willson. The groundbreaking for the new church took place soon after and the brick church still in use today was dedicated in November, 1955.\nThe Bull Roast moved in 1960 to the open lawn between the new church and the original 1890 parish church, before moving one more time to the Rock Hall Volunteer Fire Company building in 2022.\nOne thing that hasn't changed is the quality of the food served, which starts at 6:30 a.m. behind the firehouse with a roast beef-grilling crew overseen by Ernest \"Tot\" Strong, the grandson of one of the founders. His wife, Millie Strong, is co-chair of the 2025 Bull Roast, along with Beth Dunn.\n\"It runs very smoothly. We start having meetings in April and there are probably about 25 people on the committee,\" Millie Strong said \"Last year we served 337 dinners and there were also 85 takeout dinners. This is the most important fundraiser of the year for Sacred Heart and St. John. We're able to maintain the buildings and make improvements. We recently had all the stained glass removed to clean and repair. But the Bull Roast is also a part of our history. When you think of St. John and Rock Hall, you think of the Bull Roast. It's synonymous.\"\nThe traditional menu, aside from the sliced beef, includes grilled hot dogs and sausage with peppers and onions, french fries, potato salad, sliced tomatoes, baked beans, corn on the cob, and an extensive dessert table. The food is locally sourced from Redman's Farm and Bayside Market. Included with admission are beer and soft drinks. There is also a silent auction, music, and games.\n\"We're thrilled to be able to help out a community partner like this,\" said Andy Glenn, president of the fire company. \"I grew up down the street from the church. To me, the Bull Roast is a town institution. We do a little setup to make sure they have what they need, but they do all the work and we're more than happy that we have the space for them.\"\nThe indoor event is rain or shine, and tickets can be purchased in advance for $25 for adults, $12 for youngsters 7-12 years old, by visiting sacredparish.org. On the day of the Roast, admission is $30 for adults and remains $12 for the youngsters.\nWhat started out as merely a way to build a new church has become over the years the means to build old traditions and continuing community alliances. That's worth celebrating, and on Sunday, Aug. 17, St. John will do just that for the 70th time. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pirates raid Rock Hall for annual festival\n\n August 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 826\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ROCK HALL — Avast me hearties! Buccaneers and landlubbers of all ages flooded to Rock Hall for their annual Pirates and Wenches festival over the weekend sponsored by Main Street Rock Hall.They took to Main Street, Sharp Street, Ferry Park Beach and Watermen's Crab House meshing fun with history and entertainment.\nVoted Best Tourist Attraction by local media, the festival celebrated its 18th year.\nCo-organizer, Suzanne Einstein originally dreamed up the pirates concept, happy to see it expand.\n\"We came up with the idea while at Waterman's Crab House on Halloween after seeing so many people dressed up as pirates! We thought, how fun would it be to have a Caribbean style party on our public beach, a decorated dinghy flotilla in the harbor, and a Buccaneer's Ball! It was clear to us that our little waterfront town on the Chesapeake was the perfect location to host such an event!\"\nShe was right. Eighteen years later the party is in full effect, drawing people of all ages.\nJim Rich, chairperson for Pirates and Wenches Committee noted the weather was absolutely perfect to bring people out.\nHe said that for two days restaurants, bars, shops, hotels and Airbnb's were filled. Business in the area thrived, including some new businesses that just opened: Rock Hall Brewing Company, The Green Heron and Nauti Blu Cottage to name a few.\nDown the street and avenues, joyous pirates and charming wenches peddled their wares to locals and visitors alike while music played along Sharp Street and kids' laughter and joy filled the air.\nIn typical pirate fashion, much could be experienced from deer-antler weapons, to spicy pirate blend pickles to wooden pints as big as a giant's fist to artwork and beautiful jewelry. Some vendors were local or nearby, but others came as far as Florida like author historian, Robert Jacob.\nWith four buses shuttling people to and fro, it made for a safe, relaxing weekend with no incidents, reported Brian Jones of Rock Hall Volunteer Fire Company.\nThe party kicked off Friday night with rum tasting at Haven Harbour South and sea shanty sing-alongs at American Legion Post 228 at 7 p.m.\nOn Saturday, a Lions Club sponsored kids treasure dig at the Ferry Park public beach at 10 a.m uncovered fun followed by a rolling flotilla low speed vehicle parade at 11 a.m. along with pirate poker run from noon to 2 p.m.\nAfter that, pirates and wenches took to the coast for a beach party with live music from noon to 4 p.m.; and Buccaneers Ball from 7 to 11 p.m. at Waterman's Crab House where winners of the raffle were announced.\nAlso on Saturday, mysterious mermaids waved to audiences from their watery chambers, stilted individuals stalked merrily through the crowd and planners of the pirate events had a ball showing people how to participate in the multitude of activities.\nAs of last year, cannon fire shot off at intervals throughout the weekend from the Skullduggery Crew based out of Baltimore. The group stayed two days in tents, truly roughing it.\nMusic from The Brigands and other bands got people toe-tapping and twirling.\nRich said everyone has fun at Pirates, especially kids, with even more activities for them than last year.\nThe HoCo Pirate Adventure Treasure was a hit with families, participating in a treasure hunt that encompassed the entire festival area.\nAnother activity, kids could hunt down the \"most wanted pirates\" and be rewarded with prizes as well as a chance to win a movie party at Flagship Premium Cinemas.\nFortune's Folly Pirate Show got kids laughing and watching in wonder.\nNear Gunpowder Cove, the dunk machine drew a big crowd said mom and PTA member, Laura Wirth. Her daughter Lina Wirth happily volunteered to be dunked. All proceeds went to Rock Hall Elementary School.\nA new attraction from Master Ship builders Lisa Sasser and George Barnett guided kids to make their own sailboats, testing them on the rough waters of the kiddie pool. Sasser was pleased to see so many children enjoying it.\nHistory buffs were entertained as well.\nThe author, Robert Jacob regaled the crowd, knocking down some past prejudices of Black Beard and conducted a lecture about pirates in the Chesapeake.\nThe street was open for creative swashbucklers and maidens greeting people with warmth and cheer.\nWoody McKay better known as Captain Gray Fox handed out good doubloons.\n\"I love this! Every year I meet such interesting people,\" he said.\nAs he said that, award winning actress, Smithsonian scholar Mary Ann Jung introduced herself as her character, Grace O' Malley the Pirate Queen.\nGood grub was to be had as well from pizza, burgers, barbecue to smoked meat on a stick. And if the sun was too much for people, they even had a mist tent cooling people down.\nRich lauded Pirates a success, estimating the event drew 4,000 people to the town.\nHe thanked everyone on the committee who started planning around February.\n\"From my view we pulled off what can be a complicated event with a lot of moving parts. We showed people Pirates in Rock Hall is a friendly, family-oriented weekend.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

I think that people have been really excited about coming out.\"\nAttendees visited more than 150 nonprofit organizations' tents and learned new information while enjoying food for sale, proceeds from which benefited the nonprofits.\n\"It's our biggest event of the year,\" said Victor Reynolds, a communication representative for CASA of Caroline. \"We're very lucky in particular to have our booth directly in front of our office.\"\nOutside CASA's office on Main Street, Reynolds said how important the event was for exposure for all nonprofits in Caroline County.\n\"It's a vital day for them as well, including just the overall exposure for people that, maybe the resources that are traveling through or that are in the county, that might not be aware of certain resources available to them,\" Reynolds said.\nFor entertainment, attendees rode on a fire truck courtesy of the Denton Volunteer Fire Company, enjoyed cars in the car show, listened to singing from multiple artists and groups, and ate food from multiple different vendors.\nThe \"Back to the 80's\" theme gave attendees a chance to pull out their 1980s-style outfits.\n\"It feels really good because this is what I remember in these areas when I was growing up, big festivals, carnivals and stuff like that, so it kind of like brings everybody together,\" said Alex Green, owner of Harriet Tubman Tours in Cambridge said the '80s theme.\nOrganizers said this summer's event was a success. Caroline County Recreations and Park said in a Facebook post Sunday, \"Thank you all for the love this weekend we had a blast.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Singing Captains to lead Buffett celebration at The Mainstay\n\n August 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BOB FORD Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 552\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ROCK HALL — Jimmy Buffett was a musical legend with a phenomenal career and a unique following, but on the Chesapeake Bay, he was just another boater looking for good fishing, good food and good times.Well, maybe not just another boater. When Last Mango, his 42-foot custom sportfisher, made its way north to Sag Harbor in the spring, or south in the fall to the tropical climes that inspired many of his songs, Buffett delighted in exploring the bay from the ocean to the C&D Canal. He even filmed a music video at Thomas Point Light on one of the trips.\nBoaters, beach bums and backyard pool drifters all lost a friend when Buffett died at 76 on Sept. 1, 2023, due to complications from a rare form of skin cancer.\nTo honor the Labor Day weekend anniversary of his passing, and to celebrate his musical legacy, the Singing Captains are performing a Buffett-only concert of his hits on Sunday, Aug. 31, from 4 to 6 p.m. at the outdoor amphitheater of Rock Hall's iconic music venue, The Mainstay.\nIt will be a \"family-friendly celebration of music, memories and Margaritaville vibes, with special musical guests and good company,\" according to Mark Einstein, a member of the Singing Captains and a day-job charter boat captain in his own right.\nThe event is ticketless and free to the public, with a suggested donation of $10 to help The Mainstay continue its mission of providing a wide variety of musical offerings for the community. The Mainstay cash bar will be operating, with margaritas and more. Ice cream will be available for purchase from Get the Scoop, and That Place on Main will have Cheeseburgers in Paradise on the menu at the show.\nOpening for the Singing Captains, and joining them on a number of Buffett songs that follow, will be steel pan virtuoso Trevor Stubbs. He is a native of Trinidad, where the instrument was first fashioned out of industrial steel drums. Stubbs, who is one half of the duo Island Vibes, has played at The Mainstay previously. Beginning with the song \"One Particular Harbor,\" a 1983 release from the album of the same name, Buffett often used steel pannists on his Caribbean-flavored songs.\n\"What connects Rock Hall to the Jimmy Buffett thing is that this is a premier sailing and boating town. We've all got Hawaiian shirts, and we like to emulate that laid-back lifestyle that his music captured,\" Einstein said. \"His music, when it burst on the scene, influenced the whole boating world. You would hear it walking down literally any dock.\"\nBuffett, originally from Pascagoula, Mississippi, made his way to New Orleans and Nashville before discovering that Key West was just the right latitude for his attitude, and the tropical-tinged hits followed quickly. Over the course of his career, Buffett sold more than 20 million records, and 17 of his albums were either gold or platinum in sales. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2024.\nThose attending the Buffett celebration at The Mainstay will find plenty of seating at the open-air amphitheater, but if so inclined, there is room on the lawn for beach chairs, too. Visitors can bring those, wiggle their toes in the grass and pretend it is sand.\n\"Wear your loudest shirt and come help us toast Jimmy,\" Einstein said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In just its second year, the block party has become a community favorite, organizers said.\n\"I'm overwhelmed because I'm getting a lot of good feedback,\" Holly Justice said on behalf of the committee Saturday. \"So, it feels great. As a organizer, you never know how people are going to receive your event. So, to hear that people are enjoying themselves and the kids are happy, I think it turned out better than we expected.\"\nThe Town of Ridgely, which provided hot dogs and juices for the event, said that town officials served over 250 hot dogs during the first half of the event.\nAt the end of the block party last year, the committee put out a community poll to see what could be improved. Extending the time was the biggest item the residents raised.\nThis year, the block party didn't end until 7 p.m., which allowed attendees to come in waves while doing multiple things with their Saturday.\nThe event featured performances from The Cayer Band and Monkee Paw, as well as belly dancer Caitlyn Poole and DJ Tony VIBEZ. The committee also had a raffle and handed out multiple prizes.\nThe goal for the committee is to continue to allow free fun with the event, which they hope to grow in years to come.\n\"My heart is so happy,\" Justice said. \"My only hope is that we continue to grow and people continue to share the word and talk about the block party and how it is really for the community. Money is wonderful, but it's about those faces being out there dancing and winning the prizes and bouncing on the bouncy houses. So, I'm happy.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Yes, it's almost time to don your favorite tie-dyed T-shirts, denim bellbottoms, mini-skirts, granny sunglasses and peace symbol necklaces. And if you're really feeling that Wavy Gravy vibe, it's almost time to to dab your neck with patchouli and burn some lavender incense.\nIn other words, it's time to let your freak-flag fly at Dove Valley Winery's 13th annual Winestock Festival, a rain-or-shine event set to run from 11 a.m to 7 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 27, on the vineyard grounds at 645 Harrington Road, off Joseph Biggs Highway (Route 274), a short distance south of downtown Rising Sun.\nThe annual event typically draws 800 to 1,000 people. As evidenced by the previous Winestock events, many attendees wear groovy threads and outwardly immerse themselves in the counter-culture celebration associated with Woodstock, the three-day-long rock music festival that was held in Upper State New York in August 1969.\nAnd what's a Woodstock tribute festival without music?\nOn the bill for Winestock 2025 are Max & Denise \"Acoustic with an Edge\" (11 a.m. to 1 p.m.), Old Skool & The Edge (1 p.m. to 3 p.m.), Smokin' Guns (3 p.m. to 5 p.m.) and the finale act, Olivia Reynolds (5 p.m. to 7 p.m.) Those bands will perform on the winery's pavilion stages.\nBeer will be for sale on the premises. Chesapeake-City-based Bayheads Brewing Company and Perryville-based 5th Company Brewing Company will be selling their various craft beers. And, of course, Dove Valley Winery will be selling its array of wines during the festival.\nThe list of food trucks includes Kacey's Kitchen, Rolling Grub, Dine 'N' Dash Delights, Wing Paradise and The Pit Shack BBQ and Pizza. Non-alcoholic drinks also will be available for purchase.\nIn addition, numerous local art and craft vendors will be displaying and selling their merchandise during the eight-hour-long event.\nAdmission for Winestock 2025 is $10 per person in advance and $20 per head at the gate. There is no charge for attendees under 21 years old. The admission fee for the 21 and older crowd also covers wine tasting and a complimentary keepsake wine glass.\nOutside food, beverages and coolers will not be allowed. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A clown named Crickett 'stands out' at Port Deposit festival\n\n September 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1049\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n PORT DEPOSIT — Hundreds of people attended the fourth annual Pirate Takeover in Port Deposit last weekend, but one person stood out in the crowd — quite literally.Head and shoulders above all the rest was \"Crickett,\" a professional clown who ambled throughout the Marina Park grounds on stilts that were hidden by his tuxedo-style pants and boosted his natural six-foot height to somewhere around eight feet.\n\"Crickett,\" whose real name is James McGrath, turned heads — upward, as well as sideways — wherever he roamed Saturday during the seven-hour event.\nMany people stopped in their tracks and tilted their heads skyward to confirm that there was, indeed, a face attached to the top of that human mountain in their midst. Clearly amazed, giggling kids ran up to Crickett to get a closer look. Several of the youngsters went airborne, giving it their best Jordan jump, as they high-fived with this spectacle that bent forward accommodatingly.\n\"Some people actually get startled when they see me,\" McGrath said. \"You get the usual jokes from people, too, like, 'How's the weather up there?' and, 'Hey, Shorty,'\" stuff like that.\nOf course, folks ask him how tall he is on those stilts. And they ask if he has ever fallen.\nThe answer to that last question: Only once in approximately 20 years of practicing and performing on stilts. And after that tumble, Crickett got back on his feet — unscathed — because learning how to fall safely on stilts is as important as learning how to walk on stilts.\nThe trick is to never extend your arms to break your fall because, instead, you will break your wrists, humerus and other nearby bones, he emphasized. Tucking your extremities, balling up your body and rolling when you hit the ground are the ingredients for a safe fall.\nAs it turns out, Crickett takes his clowning very seriously. A 44-year-old Washington, D.C. resident, McGrath performs as Crickett in the region about 100 times a year under his enterprises of Shows by Crickett, Block Party Bubbles and Clown Cabaret.\n\"I performed at the Pirate Takeover event in Port Deposit for the past few years, and it is easily one of my favorite gigs,\" McGrath commented.\nThose 100 or so annual gigs are the sole source of income for McGrath, who married for the first time in 2024 after spending many years on the road as a professional clown, including a long stint with the renowned Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\nThat clowning job with The Greatest Show on Earth took him to every state in the continental United States, save for Wyoming, the Dakotas and perhaps one or two others. McGrath performed as \"Crickett\" with Ringling Brothers in some major arenas, including the legendary Madison Square Garden.\n\"Back stage, there was a bunch of pictures of Billy Joel because he had performed there so many times. I think he holds the record,\" McGrath said of that famous New York City venue.\nSo how did McGrath morph into a professional clown?\nBorn in Massachusetts and raised in Virginia, McGrath went to the circus with his family as a kid and was drawn to all of its attractions, particularly juggling. While attending Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Va., where he graduated in 2005 with a psychology degree, McGrath learned to juggle.\n\"I always liked juggling as a hobby. I got a book, something like, 'The Complete Klutz Guide to Juggling' and taught myself how to juggle,\" he recalled.\nPerhaps the main lesson that McGrath learned while majoring in psychology was this: Live an adventurous life and see new places while you are still young and able.\nAfter attending a clowning camp in New York City, a few years post graduation, McGrath joined the Big Apple Circus as a concessions worker — just to get his big, goofy clown foot in the door.\nAs did many of the 150 other circus employees, McGrath lived in a renovated room in the back of a trailer while the show traveled to places in Georgia, Vermont, New Hampshire, Virginia and New York.\n\"I was a cotton candy twister,\" he said, before explaining, \"I was just hoping to meet some people, make the right connections.\"\nThat pay-your-dues gig made a huge difference, too, because McGrath then got a performance job with Ringling Brothers. He performed under the Big Top as Crickett with the Blue Unit of that outfit from 2006 through 2011, juggling and executing all manners of jokes, including sight gags.\n\"I was very lucky. I just happened to be submitting a resume at the time when one of the clowns jumped ship — so I was available and got the job,\" McGrath remembered.\nIt was common for Ringling Brothers to stay in the cities and towns on the tour and perform nine to 15 shows per week, before moving on to the next stop. It was a demanding way of life that was tempered by the fun and adventure it provided.\n\"We traveled by train and pretty much lived on that train. We each had a 6'-by-6' room. We were paid a salary that was just enough to live on, just enough to meet expenses. We got one month off every two years,\" McGrath reviewed.\nIt was a passion project. \"I'd work with the other clowns and we'd come up with our own gags. We'd also work with writers and a team of prop builders,\" McGrath said.\nThere was no need, however, for McGrath's talent on two-foot stilts at the Ringling Brothers level. \"They had Caribbean stilt-walkers who walked smoothly on 6-foot stilts,\" McGrath noted.\nThe secret to walking on stilts, according to McGrath: \"You have to get over your reptilian mindset and feel comfortable walking higher above ground than normal. And you have to know how to fall safely. It took me about 20 hours total of walking on stilts before it felt natural to me.\"\nHe added, \"Most gigs are one to two hours long. Some, though, are four to five hours long and you feel pretty achy after walking on stilts all that time.\"\nAfter he left Ringling Brothers and transitioned into a more domesticated life that still allowed him to clown and perform regionally, McGrath incorporated more stilts-walking into his act. He has been performing solo as Crickett, mostly on weekends, for approximately the past 15 years.\n\"It is an abnormal job, but I have a pretty normal life,\" he summarized. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The stew included blackened rockfish, lump crab, black-eyed peas and a tomato-based curry sauce with mirepoix and chickpeas.\nThe event also had four guest judges who picked the 2025 best of dishes in five categories: best seafood soup or stew, best crab cake, best crab specialty, best Eastern Shore fare and best dessert.\nGuest judges included radio host Jessica Dutra from Mix 106.5 Baltimore, Chef and Owner of Hamilton House Events and Catering and Executive Chef of Great Oak Manor Jordan Lloyd, Cambridge Mayor Lajan Cephas and Andrea Elgin with Coastal Style Magazine.\n\"I was invited to be on the panel of this amazing event. I'm honored to be here, and it's so fun to watch all these brilliant chefs really put their whole heart on the plate,\" Lloyd said.\n\"Some of these dishes, I can't put them down. I feel like it's not a taste of Cambridge. I feel like this is a meal of Cambridge, so I'm trying to be conservative, save some room,\" Cephas said after tasting eight of the 20 dishes.\nThe judges' picks for the 2025 awards were:\nFor best seafood soup or stew, the award went to Blue Ruin.For best crab cake, the award went to Blue Ruin.For best crab specialty, the award went to RaR Brewing.For best Eastern Shore fare, the award went to the Hyatt Regency Chesapeake Bay.For best dessert, the award went to Black Water Bakery.\n\"We could not be happier for the turnout. It's a great opportunity for literally hundreds of people to come to downtown Cambridge and support our restaurants and our shops and just kind of see the revitalization that's going on down here,\" Wingate-Spence said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This Saturday, I traversed the Eastern Shore to cover three events at three separate locations from noon to 9 p.m.I started my day of reporting with the 17th annual Taste of Cambridge, which lit up all of my senses. The aroma was salty and crisp from the rain. I didn't know where to look because there was so much excitement. I was overcome with nostalgia when the band played \"Float On\" by Modest Mouse, and my taste buds danced with joy through every bite.\nMy next stop was Old Trinity Church's 350th anniversary. By this point in the day, it was pouring. I tucked myself under the tent where the Hammer Creek bluegrass band played \"Rain Please Go Away.\"\nIt didn't. But no one seemed to mind.\nMy third and final stop was the Avalon Theatre for Bailando con las Estrellas, a local Dancing with the Stars event hosted by Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center. The local celebrities blew me away with their salsa and mambo numbers, and I can't wait to see who they choose for season three.\nCheck out these stories below, thanks for reading and have a great day. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hit fundraising competition Bailando con las Estrellas returns for season 2\n\n September 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Local News \n \n 574\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The second annual Bailando con las Estrellas took place Saturday evening at the Avalon Theatre, where local stars danced their hearts out to raise money for the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center.The event, a dance competition modeled after popular TV show Dancing with the Stars, is part of the center's Hispanic Heritage Month programming and aims to celebrate Hispanic culture while raising funds to meet yearly goals.\nThe fiscal goal of the event was to raise $80,000. Each dancer raised their own set of funds prior to the event and through the voting process during. By the end of the night, 86% of the goal was reached, coming in at just over $69,000.\n\"The first one was last year. We didn't know what we were doing, and it ended up going so well. We knew we had to go bigger and better this year. So we just went as big as we could possibly go,\" Executive Director of ChesMRC Matthew Peters said.\nThe team at ChesMRC balances uplifting success stories with difficult day-to-day challenges. The event provides a needed break to highlight the good, Peters said.\nThere were three judges: Liza Ledford with the Oxford Community Center; Jeremy Hillyard, Talbot County Public School 2024-25 teacher of the year; and Sharon Pepukayi, Talbot County Public Schools superintendent.\nHillyard and Pepukayi fully understood what each star was going through, as the two performed the previous year.\nThis year, Victoria Gomez Lozano performed with Tori Gomez, Joe Petro performed with Maya Robinson, John Marrah performed with Rebecca Wales, Brenda Fike performed with Samantha Martinez, James Redmen performed with Christine Redmen, Angel Perez performed with Maddie Megahan, and Milton Orellana performed with Berenice Orellana.\nChoreographer Erinne Lewis spent two weeks with the stars learning routines, but when the amateur dancers took the stage, it appeared as if they'd been training for months. Each set of dancers brought their own unique flair to the stage — some silly, some serious and some downright impressive.\nHillyard said there was noticeable improvement from season one to season two, saying the dancers \"stepped it up\" this year. He was impressed by the amount of money raised and compared it to a yearly salary.\nHe said being a judge this year felt like less pressure than performing and he could enjoy and appreciate the dancers' hard work more.\nOwner of the nonprofit consulting firm What's Good LLC Jayme Dingler was the evening's master of ceremonies. She attributed this year's success to multiple changes from last year's event.\n\"Matthew had the great idea of inviting star sponsors, so every team had a company that sponsored them, which is really fun,\" Dingler said.\nIn addition, they had a big opening number with all the stars, text voting, voting during the show and allowing ticket and sponsorship purchases to be allocated to a specific team.\nDingler said this led to a significant increase from the estimated $35,000 raised last year.\nThe big winners of the evening were Angel Perez and Maddie Megahan with the Dancing Stars (Estrellas de Baile) award, James and Christine Redmen with the Heart (Corazon) award, and Victoria Gomez Lozano and Tori Gozem with the Make it Rain (lluvia de Dinero) award.\n\"Thank you to everybody, all the sponsors this year, all everyone that's stepped up, and then, yeah, get ready for that phone call when I call you next year and ask you, you know, do you can you dance and do you want to, what are you doing on this Saturday night,\" Peters said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So it speaks volumes when the veteran Deadhead from Pennsylvania gave his tie-dye seal of approval to Dove Valley Winery's 13th annual Winestock, which he and approximately 1,000 other folks attended Saturday at the vineyard near Rising Sun.\n\"I am loving this. It is quite a happening,\" marveled Moore, who came to the eight-hour-long event with Sandi, whom he described as \"the love of my life,\" and their friend, Monique Pietrzyk, who proudly proclaimed that she is a \"South Philly\" resident.\nMany of the festival goers got into the spirit and let their freaks flags fly by wearing attire featuring peace signs, psychedelic colors and such. Accessories included round-rimmed granny sunglasses and flowers in the hair. There was plenty of denim clothing, too, including bell bottoms. A few pairs of colorful Go-Go boots were spotted, as well.\nIt's quite possible, though, that Moore was the most authentically-dressed hippie on the grounds that day.\n\"This is from 40 years ago,\" Moore said, gesturing to his floppy hat with a subdued Rastafarian vibe and his quilted top. \"I bought it at a Grateful Dead show in Philadelphia. They didn't have merch tents back then. This stuff was on a blanket on the pavement. That's how the person who sold it to me had all of the stuff displayed.\"\nSo, yes, if Moore says Dove Valley Winery's 13th annual Winestock was close to the genuine groovy article, then it must be true.\n(It's comically noteworthy that Moore, 62, patted the front of the Grateful Dead top that he bought sometime in the mid-1980s, smiled and remarked with obvious satisfaction in his voice, \"And it still fits me.\")\nThe event provided non-stop live music performed by Max & Denise \"Acoustic with an Edge,\" Old Skool & The Edge, Smokin' Guns and the finale act, Olivia Reynolds. Taking turns, those bands performed on the winery's two pavilion stages.\nVendors sold beer, an array of local arts and crafts and plenty of food. Workers and volunteers at Dove Valley Winery's bustling tent were busy throughout the day, selling the numerous varieties of wines created at that vineyard.\nWinestock, by the way, is Dove Valley Winery's vino-infused nod to the counter-culture celebration that was Woodstock — the three-day-long rock music festival that was held in Upper State New York in August 1969.\nFor those who are not citizens of Deadhead Nation and might be asking themselves . . . Yes, the Grateful Dead performed at Woodstock. Moore missed that show, however, because he was only about six years old back then. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "New acts, old favorites to highlight Rock Hall FallFest live music\n\n October 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BOB FORD Special to the Kent County News | Section: Music \n \n 675\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Rock Hall FallFest returns Saturday, Oct. 11, for the 28th edition of the annual one-day festival that celebrates the opening of the commercial oyster season along with the bayside town's tradition of presenting and supporting live music.The \"return\" of the oyster will be honored, as always, with thousands of hand-shucked oysters on the half shell, complemented by street-fair food and assorted drink offerings.\nAs for the music, which will play continuously on alternating Main Street stages during the 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. event, two newcomers will join the performance schedule in addition to some old favorites, including the always-popular Catonsville High School Steel Band.\nLeading off the lineup on the Mainstay Stage will be Austin, Texas, singer-songwriter Andrea Magee, making her FallFest debut. She will be followed by The Llama Dalis, an eclectic, innovative art-rock quartet that also will perform at FallFest for the first time.\nThe oysters and the music are just the start. Main Street, transformed into a pedestrian-safe thoroughfare, will be lined with craft and artisan vendors and Rock Hall's array of quaint shops. A food truck convention will set up near the base of Main Street, and a Kids Kourt will feature games, prizes and entertainment for children.\nAdmission is free, as is the plentiful parking near the festivities. The nonprofit event donates all proceeds to Rock Hall organizations and projects. The main beneficiaries over the years have been the Kent County Waterman's Association scholarship fund and The Mainstay, the iconic music venue that books acts year-round on the Tom McHugh Stage.\nThe Llama Dalis, founded more than 30 years ago by brothers Michael and Dave Biddison, are a Pennsylvania-based band that reunites for festivals. Michael Biddison, on acoustic guitar, handles most of the lead vocals, while Dave plays drums and sings on the rest of their mostly original repertoire. Bob Taylor plays bass, and Steve Wheelock is the lead guitarist.\nTaylor played FallFest last year with Philip Dutton's band, The Good Stuff, a classic country cover unit, and encouraged the Dalis to join the lineup this year.\n\"We play a high-energy show for all the dancing fools,\" Taylor said, \"but a lot of our pieces are dreamy, thoughtful stuff. My daughter calls us jam band funk.\"\nThe Llama Dalis members have all performed in other bands over the years, but they always reunite to play fresh tunes written by the Biddison brothers and to revive a catalog influenced by the full spectrum of rock music. As for the name?\n\"Well, the Dalai Lama was a good guy, and Salvador Dali was an interesting character,\" Taylor said. \"We have a song called 'Hair on Fire' that comes from a Zen teacher back in the day who said you have to seek enlightenment like a man with his hair on fire. That's us — a little Zen, a little absurdist.\"\nMagee, a multi-instrumentalist, was born and raised in Belfast before pursuing her musical dreams in the United States in 2014. Her music blends folk, rock and Celtic styles, and she has toured with legendary artists including Brian Wilson, Brian Setzer and Jeff Bridges.\nMagee is the festival director for She Rises Fest, an annual event that celebrates women in music and the arts. Her nonprofit, Music Helps, provides workshops for children at Helping Hand Home for Children in Austin, a support and housing service for children who have experienced abuse and neglect.\n\"Music is about community, connection and giving back,\" Magee said. \"It's the threads that weave us together, and I'm honored to be part of that tapestry.\"\nOther acts taking the stage at FallFest include the Catonsville High School Steel Band, returning for its 25th anniversary appearance; Pat Wictor and Bob Beach, blending acoustic guitar and blues harmonica; Kent County's own hard-rocking guitarist Blake Thompson and his Family Band; and the hometown favorites, The Singing Captains, who will close the show with classic pop songs.\nRock Hall FallFest is a feast for the ears, for good appetites and honest thirsts, and for those who enjoy a throwback day of music, oysters and small-town charm.\nFor more information, directions and a full lineup, visit www.rockhallfallfest.org \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chesapeake Film Festival showcases artists' perspectives for record-breaking crowds\n\n October 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Headlines \n \n 506\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — While the Chesapeake Film Festival's focus this year largely dealt with environment and women's empowerment, the \"rhythm, motion and meaning\" section shown at the Academy Art Museum on Saturday afternoon veered into something different.There were two screenings: a documentary feature called \"Lives Beyond Motion,\" directed by Keith Glassman, and a documentary short called \"100 Foot Photo,\" directed by Matt Kresling.\nThe festival's Executive Director Cid Collins Walker said she chose to show these films together to balance the festival's commitment to films about women's empowerment with stories about men.\nWalker said this was the best attended year in the festival's 18-year history.\n\"Every year, we see an increase in the amount of support we receive for all the programming,\" Walker said.\nCommitting life to art\nAfter the showings Saturday, there was a Q&A with the director and producer of \"Lives Beyond Motion.\"\nThe film explored Glassman's existential question of why he and other men committed their lives to dance.\nThe film began as a low-budget, long-term project around 2008 with major progress starting in 2015 after bringing producer The Angel on board. Glassman interviewed around 20 dancers who, without knowing it, shared common loves, struggles and difficulties.\nGlassman's own career as a dancer ended 30 years ago after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This prompted his quest to understand why dancers commit their lives to the artform for such a long time.\n\"I decided their answers should be heard by a wider audience, which was the impetus for the interviews,\" Glassman said. \"Their specific answers about their experiences adjusted my perspective beyond my own, bringing in topics relevant to the whole dance community over the years, like the HIV epidemic.\"\n\"Lives Beyond Motion\" is Glassman's first documentary, and he said he's been submitting it to every film festival possible.\nAudience members went around the room describing what about the film resonated with them most. Multiple people spoke of the authenticity and vulnerability of the interviewees, which they said made this film personal and emotional.\nAn Eastern Shore connection\nMatt Kreslings short film follows the journey of 20th century American artist Robert Rauschenberg's trip to China in the 1980s, his creative relationship with long-time Eastern Shore resident Donald Saff and, ultimately, his creation of a long, scroll-like photograph he named \"Chinese Summerfall.\"\nThe 10-minute film explored the painstaking process of printmaking at a time when artists were physically cutting negative images and didn't know if they were done properly until the images were processed.\n\"I want my work to make you care because I care,\" Rauschenberg said in the film.\nThe Academy Art Museum will celebrate Rauschenberg's 100th birthday with the exhibit \"Rauschenberg 100: New Connections\" opening Dec. 11 and running through May 3, 2026.\nThe exhibit will include \"Chinese Summerfall,\" which is rarely exhibited due to its size and fragility, according to the Academy Art Museums website. It will also feature showings of Kresling's short film, \"100 Foot Photo.\"\n\"Receiving the support that we do from the community, from our sponsors, our partners, our patrons, makes such a huge difference for us,\" Walker said. \"We simply couldn't do it without you.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's so fun,\" said Woohoo Productions founder Angel Perez. \"And at the end of the day, that's what really matters, is just bring the community together in some way to have a good time and Who knows? Some people may leave the building today and create some new friendships.\"\nPerez founded Woohoo Productions three months ago, and this was the company's first major event.\nFor Perez who has been doing community and family events in Caroline County as CEO of Caroline Pride, program manager at Chesapeake Culinary Center, board member of Shore Legal and more, he's excited to pivot to adult-focused events.\n\"I thought now it's time for me to try to make some money out of here and do the fun stuff, something I've been doing for free for the last 10 years,\" Perez said.\nHe was happy with the turnout of the event considering it was a Thursday evening and the first time they've hosted this event, but he hopes to grow attendance next year. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Volunteers from Baywater Animal Rescue brought a couple of puppies.\nBut the big draw was the kites.\nWings Over Washington brought a half dozen people who were flying small kites synchronized to music.\n\"We are a very active club,\" said Paul Dugard, who headed the Wings Over Washington team at Sailwinds on Sunday.\nDugard and three other kite fliers stood side-by-side and flew their four kites in tightly choreographed moves with Dugard barking commands into a headset much the way a square dance caller shouts moves to dancers.\n\"We've been fliying together for many years,\" he said, adding the group first started flying together in the 1980s.\nTheir years of experience showed as their kites crossed lines and then uncrossed. The four kites would climb into the sky together and then circle one another before reforming in a line, much like the precision flying of the Blue Angels or Thunderbirds. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
