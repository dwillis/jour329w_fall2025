# Star-Democrat Different Format Beat Book

Take your chosen beat book and create a version of it that is very different in structure and format. Forget narrative; pick something that provides a different way to help a reporter understand the beat. In some respects, this could look like some of the first drafts you produced, but I want you to think creatively about the format and experiment to see what you can do.

In your repository, create a stardem_different folder and create a `notes.md` file in it. Put any JSON or other files you need in that directory and describe your process in the `notes.md` file. Be sure to include any problems you weren't able to overcome and an evaluation of your draft beat book. At the end of your Copilot conversation, ask Copilot to create a narrative summary of your conversation in a file called `copilot.md`.

When you are finished, add, commit and push those files and submit the URL of your `notes.md` file in ELMS.

### Getting Started

Update from upstream:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

In your class repository, open a codespace and do the following:

1. In the Terminal, cd into the directory with your last name.
2. Create a directory called `stardem_nearly_final` using mkdir
3. cd into that new directory
4. Create a file called `notes.md` using touch and open it
5. Put "Star-Democrat Nearly Final Beat Book" and today's date at the top, then save it
