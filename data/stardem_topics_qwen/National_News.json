    "content": "Ethics standards are good decision for Court\n\n August 4, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 675\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Those who suspect that Justice Samuel Alito views the Supreme Court as some imperial Star Chamber that is unaccountable to Congress, the public or anyone else have recently gained a powerful new ally in that theory: Alito himself.In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal's opinion section, Alito lashes out at the growing consensus that Congress should impose mandatory ethics standards on the justices, considering they refuse to do it themselves.\"No provision in the Constitution gives them the authority to regulate the Supreme Court,\" he says. \"Period.\" Legal scholars and others have pounced on the assertion as just plain wrong, constitutionally. It's also a distressing confirmation of the anti-democratic instincts of a man who, with his fellow court conservatives, has lately wielded his unelected power in precedent-breaking, culture-transforming ways - regarding abortion rights in particular - that would never pass muster at the polling place.That comes against a backdrop of ethics concerns that have undermined the court's credibility lately, involving justices from both sides of its deep ideological divide.The details vary: Justices Clarence Thomas has accepted luxury trips and other perks from a prominent Republican donor; Justice Neil Gorsuch made a big real estate sale to a lawyer whose firm has business before the court; Justice Sonia Sotomayor's staff has prodded public institutions to buy her memoir.The justices for the most part have responded to the mini-scandals, if at all, by denying wrongdoing and/or saying they will be more careful going forward.Alito had a different approach when ProPublica was preparing to report in June that he had accepted private jet travel to a luxury fishing trip from a politically active billionaire: He preempted the story with a defiant Wall Street Journal op-ed making the tonedeaf argument that he had saved the taxpayers travel-security expenses by accepting the private ride.He insisted he technically had no legal obligation to disclose the trip, nor to recuse himself from cases before the court in which the billionaire was involved.The latter assertions are true, and that's the problem. Unlike every other judge in America, the court's nine justices aren't bound by a mandatory set of ethics standards regarding conflicts of interest and recusal.They have long asserted that they adhere to such standards voluntarily, so there is no need to officially impose them. For an answer to that assertion, re-read the preceding paragraphs.The issue has prompted movement in Congress to impose mandatory new ethics standards on the justices. Which in turn prompted Alito's claim, in the extensive Wall Street Journal interview, that the court is effectively untouchable by anybody. (One of the two writers of the coddling opinion piece, it discloses, is an attorney with a case pending before the court. You can't make this stuff up.)At first half-blush, it might make sense - surely the high court must be utterly independent from Congress to function, right? - but that ignores the entire concept of constitutional checks and balances between the three branches of government. The whole point of that concept is that no single branch holds unfettered power of the kind Alito appears to claim.As numerous legal scholars and other critics have pointed out in response to Alito's comments, Congress already requires financial disclosure of gifts and stock transactions from the justices.Congress also determines the size of the court, its budget (including the justices' pay), the dates of its sessions and other basic structural issues.Congress similarly imposes ethics standards, budgetary control and other power over the executive branch; the president, meanwhile, can veto actions of Congress. Alito hasn't questioned these and other checks and balances between the other two branches of government. It's only his own branch, apparently, that is untouchable.It's not. Congress should be cautious about overstepping its authority regarding the court, but mandatory ethics standards of the kind that govern other judges would be constitutionally defensible and could help restore public confidence in the court.If Alito is concerned that it would threaten a creeping loss of judicial independence, he should champion a move for the court to self-impose those standards.REPRINTED FROM THE ST.

    "content": "Time for DeSantis to rock and roll with Trump - COMMENTARY\n\n August 8, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A6 | Section: Opinions \n \n 564\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It's certainly about time for Ron DeSantis, who remains the main challenger to front-runner Donald Trump, to stop pulling his punches.On the campaign trail this week, responding to the latest indictment, DeSantis came closer than usual. In answer to a reporter's question, he actually acknowledged, \"All those theories that were put out did not prove to be true.\" In other words, they were false.In other words, the election was not stolen.How long will it take for him to come right out and say that?.And if the election wasn't stolen, what does that say about the effort to overturn it?.Storming the Capitol to overturn an election that wasn't stolen? What do you say about that? Based on \"theories that were put out (that) did not prove to be true.\" What is striking about DeSantis' move, however modest, is that it came on the same day as a new poll showing the race in Iowa to be closer than the nationwide contest, with DeSantis running second at 20% to Trump's 44%, still a double-digit lead but less commanding than in the national polls, where Trump enjoys majority support.This is according to the New York Times/Siena College poll of likely Iowa caucus participants. It suggests that DeSantis' efforts in Iowa are having at least some impact.Will he be willing to take on Trump's \"theories\" that did not \"prove to be true\" in the days ahead and actually hold him responsible for spreading lies?.And will that help him or hurt him with the voters, some of whom are currently leaning toward Trump, who he needs to persuade to win the Iowa caucus?.Obviously, from the care and the baby steps he has been taking, it is a difficult strategic dance for the Florida governor. He needs to win the support of Trump backers without losing his credibility entirely in the process.Of course the election was not stolen. Of course the claims of fraud were not true. The fact that we are even playing these games is a bit ridiculous in and of itself.But this is the dance for the nomination. Does it escape mention that Chris Christie, who has been the most outspoken of the Republican candidates in his criticism of Trump, does not break 1% in the Iowa poll?.One point to note from that survey: 67% of Iowa Republicans, when offered a choice, said they preferred a candidate who was focused on \"restoring law and order in our streets and at the border\" than one trained \"on defeating radical 'woke' ideology in our schools, media and culture,\" which sounds like Trump over DeSantis - or, rather, it sounds like Iowa isn't necessarily buying what DeSantis has been trying to sell.Which raises again the question of what he should be selling: likeability, for certain; electability, for certain; and maybe, as the key component to both of those, traits of character and integrity that used to be the stuff of presidential campaigns, what contests were said to be all about, the measure of the man - exactly the sort of measure that Donald Trump seeks to evade at all costs.When it comes right down to it, the question about election fraud is a question about integrity, and there is only one answer. The answer is integrity, and that is, ultimately, what DeSantis needs to demonstrate, and what he needs to sell. \n \n Caption: SUSAN ESTRICH \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

How did we every reach such an abyss?The responsibility lies primarily with Trump himself but not entirely. He would not continue to be relevant without enablers. Those enablers include the populace who continue to support him in spite of his continued flaunting of legal and democratic norms but even more so the Republican leadership - which is more and more evolving into an oxymoron.It is very unfortunate that only seven Republican senators voted for impeachment on Feb, 13, 2001. If only 10 of the other 43 Republican senators had shown an equal measure of courage as the courageous seven, Trump would no longer be relevant and wouldn't that be a relief.RONALD GRIFFINMcDaniel \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jackson Women's Health Organization overruling Roe v. Wade may be the best worst thing to happen to Democratic politics in recent years.It is moving voters, and if there was any doubt of that, look at the results in Ohio this week, where a thinly disguised referendum designed to make it more difficult to pass a constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights failed at the polls on Tuesday.Republicans had proposed an initiative to require a supermajority of 60% to amend the state Constitution - a special new requirement intended to make it more difficult to pass an abortion rights amendment come November.The biggest supporter of the initiative was the D.C. based Susan B.Anthony Pro-Life America.Voters smelled a rat - and turned out in record numbers to vote no. The amendment lost by 14 points in a state that Donald Trump carried by 8 points.We may not be as narrowly divided, not on every issue, not nearly as polarized, as the purveyors of fake news would have you believe.That bodes well for the efforts that began this week in another key state, where the effort is to place a constitutional amendment on abortion on the ballot in November 2024.The more states with abortion on the ballot in November 2024, the more the issue will drive votes to Joe Biden.This week, prochoice groups in Arizona announced that they had united and would begin a petition drive to collect enough signatures to put an amendment on the ballot in November 2024 protecting a woman's right to choose abortion prior to viability.The logic behind these efforts is simple and straightforward.Abortion drives votes. The polls are clear. Choice dominates.More than 60% of all Americans support Roe v. Wade. The Republican Party doesn't know how to deal with that without offending its base, which expects it to be proactive with a losing hand, a strategy that is doomed to failure.So it continues not only to fight losing battles against constitutional amendments proposed by pro-choice coalitions but also to engage in expensive and poorly conceived efforts like the one in Ohio, which was designed to circumvent the coming constitutional battle; Ohio is the only state with abortion on the ballot this November, and both sides have raised millions of dollars.The coalition supporting the Arizona initiative includes the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona, NARAL Arizona, Affirm Sexual and Reproductive Health, Arizona List and Healthcare Rising Arizona.Current law in Arizona bans most abortions after 15 weeks. The proposed amendment provides for a right to choose abortion prior to viability, typically 22-24 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for the life or health of the mother.The opposition is ready for a fight.In a statement, Cathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy told reporters, \"Our initial viewing of the measure reveals an extreme power grab by an industry that sees no limits to abortion.\" Maria Birnbaum, the Arizona state director for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, told reporters the proposal was \"repugnant to the values of our state,\" because \"Arizonans believe in protecting the unborn and serving their mothers.\" The point is: If the coalition can collect enough signatures, the voters will decide. And they will be the same voters who will be choosing who Arizona sends to the Electoral College.In a statement released on Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs expressed her support for the coalition's effort and said she was \"confident that Arizonans will vote for reproductive freedom next November.\" COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The ships can carry attack jets and other aircraft as well as amphibious landing craft, according to the Pentagon.The U.S. says Iranian forces have seized or attacked approximately 20 merchant vessels (including oil tankers and cargo ships since 2021. The harassments and seizures have occurred in the Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman. The former is a \"chokepoint\" between the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea, a key shipping route (including for oil.)Last month, the Iranian navy attempted to illegally seize two merchant vessels in the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman, according to the Pentagon.U.S. and Iraqi defense officials also met in Washington on Tuesday as part of discussions about more long-term American support for Iraqi Security Forces. Iraq - which was invaded by the U.S. in 2003 and occupied until 2011 after the ouster of Saddam Hussein - is a longtime rival of Iran.A spokesman for the Iranian military said the country's naval forces are being equipped with missiles and drones in response to the increased the U.S. footprint, according to reports by Al Jazeera and Iran's state media.\"What do the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean have to do with America? What is your business being hereft,\" the spokesman said.Off the Alaska coast, the U.S. is responding to the Russian and Chinese navies exercises near the Aleutians. The U.S. has tense relations with both Moscow and Beijing over the former's invasion of Ukraine and the latter's saber-rattling with Taiwan and attempts to gain more control over the South China Sea.U.S. Sen.

    "content": "Argentinian proves to be a populist liberal\n\n August 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 822\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The media would like you to know that Javier Milei, the upstart candidate who improbably won Argentina's presidential primary this week, is a \"Trump admirer,\" \"rightwing populist,\" \"far-right outsider,\" \"far-right populist,\" \"rightist,\" \"far-right libertarian,\" a \"radical\" - and did they mention he's on the \"far right\"?Anyway, I'm no expert on Argentinian politics, so this coverage sparked my curiosity. And it turns out, Milei - also known as el Peluca (\"The Wig\") because he sports the hairstyle of a man spinning jazz-flute fusion records in his velvet-draped bachelor pad circa 1972 - is far more interesting than headlines would have us believe.An economist and rhetorical pugilist, Milei's philosophical outlook could more precisely be described as \"doctrinaire ultraliberal,\" (the good kind) as Andres Malamud of the Institute of Social Sciences of the University of Lisbon recently put it.That is news because it is an exceptionally rare outlook.Milei threatens to upend the political order in a country in the middle of another economic meltdown. Once-low poverty rates have exploded - some estimates put it at 43% - while the currency continues to lose its value.Milei, a longtime television personality, has made the case that Argentines are \"hostages\" to generationally destructive economic policy. (Interest rates were hiked to 118% this week.)He argues that politicians - or, as he calls them, \"rats\" of the \"parasitic, useless and useless political caste\" - have destroyed one of the richest countries in the world \"with nefarious ideas to line their pockets.\" Many of those ideas, Milei argues, can be found in Keynesian economics, which lies at the heart of most of Western society's ills. The candidate promises to shut down the central bank, dollarize the economy, deregulate markets, open up trade, cut taxes and pare the regulatory regime. Not incidentally, his English Mastiffs are named after Milton Friedman, Murray Rothbard and Robert Lucas.(Question: \"Is economics an exact science?\" Answer: \"No, because if it were, socialism would work.\") When Milei was asked if happiness was more important than liberty, he responded, \"They go hand in hand. You cannot be happy without being free.\" I'm skeptical that's the case for everyone. But Milei's placing of personal liberty as the prerequisite for not only a prosperous society but a virtuous one is welcome in a world where politicians increasingly look to bureaucracies, the welfare state and \"industrial policy\" to save us.In the United States, big-government conservatives like to complain that \"libertarians\" like Milei aren't equipped, or are unwilling, to take on social issues. Yet the candidate not only does so, he frames his defense as both a moral and liberal imperative.\"I am openly against abortion,\" Milei says. \"As a liberal I believe in unrestricted respect for others.You can choose over your body, but not over the body of the other.\" When asked why he wants to shut down government \"sex education\" programs, Milei referred to them as \"a mechanism\" of propaganda that destroys the family and \"comes down from the state with the intention of promoting everything that the line of the left and gender ideology has.\" While Milei has a Trumpian disdain for \"elites\" and engenders loyalty from his fans, the Argentine does not share the former president's adoration for state power and believes (rightly) that free markets offer a massive positive upside for the working and middle class.Milei has promised to raffle off his presidential paycheck, and 2.4 million Argentines have already registered to win $3,200 every month.\"To me, that is dirty money,\" he explained.\"From my philosophical point of view, the state is a criminal organization that is funded through taxes taken from people by force. We are giving back the money that the political caste has stolen.\" And along with rejecting climate alarmism as a destructive attack on modernity, he proposes an armed citizenry and calls for Argentina to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. (Both the United States and Israel, he says, are his \"natural allies.\") Into my veins, as the kids say.And what might seem surprising is that Milei's popularity is driven by younger voters. It is, of course, likely that part of that support is a protest vote against the failures of the Argentinian establishment rather than any ideological statement.Most ordinary people aren't \"doctrinaire\" about anything.Still, it shows that individual liberty - mocked as antiquated and puerile rhetoric by both right and left these days - can still have some currency.All this radical liberalism talk has prompted President Alberto Fernandez to warn that Milei is \"a threat to democracy\" and invoke Adolf Hitler and totalitarianism, as one always does. As far as I can tell, with authoritarian ideas gaining ground at an alarming rate, we could use more charismatic populist liberals like Milei.David Harsanyi is a senior editor at The Federalist.Follow him on Twitter@davidharsanyi.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n \n Caption: DAVID HARSANYI\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nJavier Milei, the presidential candidate of the Liberty Advances coalition, smiles at his campaign headquarters after polling stations closed during primary elections in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Sunday, Aug. 13. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Voters want issues, not Oprah in the debates\n\n August 23, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Ann Coulter | Page: A7 | Section: News \n \n 640\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As the first Republican debate approaches, I have an urgent appeal to the candidates: Please adopt the good things Donald Trump did and skip the catastrophic parts (i.e., everything after the campaign ended on Nov. 8, 2016).Although he presided over the most wasted presidency in history, the 2016 Trump campaign was magnificent, without peer, perfect in every respect.I described the many useful innovations of that campaign in my book \"In Trump We Trust.\" Please start there, Republicans.President Trump may have been a pathetic crybaby too scared to fire his own attorney general - much less ask Speaker of the House Paul Ryan for wall funding - but in 2016, it was all image, and candidate Trump came across as strong.Quiz: Who is the greatest president of the last century? Answer: Ronald Reagan.You think he won because he had the nicest family?He wouldn't have been elected dogcatcher with that bunch. Yet somehow, Reagan won a 44-state landslide in 1980 and a 49-state landslide in 1984.His wife, Nancy, badgered him throughout his presidency to be pro-choice. Note that the crucial word in the previous sentence isn't \"pro-choice\" it's \"wife.\" Nancy hadn't been elected to anything. He ignored her - and went on to ignite an economic boom that lasted 30 years, defeat the Evil Empire and restore a nation in decline to its superpower status.But every four years, campaign consultants convince the candidates that voters are dying to hear about their families. Two for the price of one, to borrow an embarrassing slogan of the Clintons.Let's review some of the horrors from 2016: In addition to Sen. Marco Rubio's strange idea that having a bartender father was a crucial qualification for president, his typical opening statement went something like this: \"My name is Marco Rubio. I'm from Florida. My wife, Jeanette, and I are the proud - we've been married 17 years - and we're the proud parents of four children, two of whom were able to join us here this evening.\" (The other two were in bartender school.)Compare that to Trump's opening statement: \"I'm Donald Trump.I've made billions and billions of dollars dealing with people all over the world, and I want to put whatever that talent is to work for this country so we have great trade deals, we make our country rich again, we make it great again.\" Jimmy Carter's invocation of his daughter at the 1980 presidential debate was widely regarded as the reason he lost.Asked about nuclear treaties at the debate, Carter said: \"I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day before I came here to ask her what the most important issue was. She said she thought nuclear weaponry and the control of nuclear arms.\" (Her second-most important issue?Why Wendy Smith at school was so stuck up.)One week later, The New York Times began an article on Carter's sweeping defeat with this: \"Jimmy Carter almost had Leslie Fleisher's vote until she saw his debate with Ronald Reagan last Tuesday and heard Mr. Carter mention that his 13-year-old daughter, Amy, regarded nuclear weaponry as the most important issue. Then she decided to stay home.\" This humble pie crap began with Bill Clinton, who specifically requested that speakers at the 1992 Democratic National Convention tell stories of childhood deprivation (as documented by Ron Fournier, then of the Associated Press).The I-Feel-Your-Pain routine was a huge hit with urban liberals, but Clinton went on to lose the working-class vote. Not coincidentally, this was the precise moment the Democrats dumped the working class and became the party of Wall Street and welfare bums.Republican voters want issues, not Oprah.Candidates, we don't care if you were born a poor black child (Steve Martin, \"The Jerk\") or your wife is hell on wheels. Please just promise to build a wall and execute criminals.COPYRIGHT 2023 ANN COULTERDISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Chris Van Hollen and Sen. Ben Cardin announced the inclusion of over $34 million in key Senate Committee legislation for community-led projects in Maryland, including four on the Eastern Shore.These funds, included at the senators' request, support a wide array of projects to improve public transit, trail networks, roads, bridges, affordable housing, and community and economic development.These projects are part of the Senate Appropriations THUD Subcommittee's proposed funding legislation for fiscal year 2024, which was released as part of the annual Congressional Appropriations process and passed on a bipartisan basis by the full Senate Appropriations Committee.\"One of our top priorities is securing federal investments to support vital initiatives in our communities. That's why, working together, Federal Team Maryland fought for these funds that will help reconnect communities, modernize our infrastructure and link more Marylanders to public transit, affordable housing, job opportunities, and more,\" Van Hollen said in a news release. \"This federal funding makes a real impact, and we're committed to working to get these investments over the finish line.\" The bill will proceed to consideration before the full Senate - funding is not finalized until the Appropriations bills are passed by the full Senate, reconciled with the House of Representatives, and signed into law by the President.\"One of our top priorities is securing federal investments to support vital initiatives in our communities.That's why, working together, Federal Team Maryland fought for these funds that will help reconnect communities, modernize our infrastructure and link more Marylanders to public transit, affordable housing, job opportunities, and more,\" Van Hollen said. \"This federal funding makes a real impact, and we're committed to working to get these investments over the finish line.\" There are four Eastern Shore projects included in the funding legislation.The Benedictine School in Caroline County is slated to receive $1.8 million to renovate the residential facility's outdated living areas and health facilities to better suit the needs of students and their families.Habitat for Humanity Choptank is slated to receive $450,000 to prepare sites in Ward 3 in Cambridge for the construction of safe, affordable and energy-efficient homes to help low-income families achieve sustainable homeownership.Mace's Lane Community Center is slated to receive $1 million to be used for the final phase of renovation of the historic Mace's Lane School into a museum and community center that will house a Boys & Girls Club, youth sports, education and cultural programs, community meeting space and senior services.Kent Attainable Housing Inc. is slated to receive $810,000 in funding to support the construction of affordable homes for families in Chestertown and Butler town. In addition to constructing housing units for first time buyers, the program provides financial literacy and support services to help residents budget and establish good credit.\"Creating and maintaining livable and functional communities are at the heart of THUD appropriations.It's critical that we provide federal support for locally driven Maryland projects, both through Congressionally Directed Spending and through competitive grant programs that support our roads, bridges, trails, ports, and transit systems, as well as affordable housing,\" Cardin said. \"These projects advance many of our top priorities, including new funding for the Franklin-Mulberry Corridor in Baltimore and continued capital funding for WMATA. In the coming weeks I will be urging my colleagues in Congress to enact these investments in final appropriations legislation for FY2024. \n \n Caption: The former Mace's Lane High School building is being remodeled to accommodate the Boys & Girls Club at the new community center.\n \nPHOTO BY CONNIE CONNOLLY \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The interaction came as Hurricane Franklin was barreling through the Atlantic Ocean.Baluchi told the Coast Guard he was propelling his vessel to London.\"Based on the condition of the vessel - which was afloat as a result of wiring and buoys - USCG officers determined Baluchi was conducting a manifestly unsafe voyage,\" according to a criminal complaint filed with a U.S.District Court in Florida.Baluchi resisted efforts to stop his transatlantic voyage, including warnings of the hurricane, and on Aug. 26 and Aug 27 threatened to hurt or kill himself with a \"12-inch knife\" and also claimed to have a bomb on board, according to the USCG.By Aug. 28, Baluchi told the Coast Guard there was no bomb on his floating hamster wheel and the next day \"USCG officers were able to safely disembark Baluchi from the vessel,\" according to the arrest affidavit.The oceanic adventurer was brought ashore Sept. 1.The Coast Guard said the Pompano Beach man has tried to make oceanic Hydro Pod voyages in 2014, 2016 and 2021 all resulting in USCG 'interventions'.Baluchi traversed the Atlantic waters from Florida to Bermuda in 2020, according to a Vice News report.Baluchi's interest in self-propelled oceanic travels as well as long-distance running with goals of running through every country in the world are outlined on his Facebook and other social media pages and website.

    "content": "Proud Boys got the sentences they deserved\n\n September 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Susan Estrich | Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 632\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the past two weeks, four of the leaders of the Proud Boys, who planned and executed the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, received long prison sentences - ranging from 10 years to 22 years in prison. Those sentences were denounced by two of the leading Republican candidates for president.On Tuesday, Vivek Ramaswamy, responding to the sentences, tweeted: \"This is wrong & it's sad that I'm the only candidate with the spine to say it.\" In a statement on Wednesday, he also promised to pardon all \"peaceful, nonviolent\" Jan. 6 participants and said, \"America now has a two-tiered justice system: Antifa and B.L.M. rioters roam free while peaceful Jan. 6 protesters are imprisoned without bail.\" Gov. Ron DeSantis took a similar tack in an interview with Newsmax on Wednesday, speaking of some of the protestors: \"They just walked into the Capitol. If they were B.L.M., they would not have been prosecuted.\" As for the others, \"they may have been violent, but to say it's an act of terrorism when it was basically a protest that devolved into a riot, to do excessive sentences - you can look at, OK, maybe they were guilty, but 22 years if other people that did other things got six months?\" Of course, Ramaswamy didn't point to any protestors being held without bail; the sentences he was reacting to were not for peaceful, nonviolent protestors, nor did DeSantis say who it was who got six months instead of 22 years. So much for the comparisons.Still, the argument that the justice system has treated the Jan. 6 protestors more harshly than the Black Lives Matter protestors is a familiar one. The problem with it is that it fails to distinguish between the mostly peaceful BLM protests and the violent assault on the Capitol, between an effort to interrupt the functioning of the government and nonviolent demonstrations.Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, rejected a selective prosecution argument from a Jan. 6 defendant who claimed he should receive a lenient sentence because armed protestors in Portland, Oregon, who protested at a federal courthouse were treated less harshly.\"The Portland rioters' conduct, while obviously serious, did not target a proceeding prescribed by the Constitution and established to ensure a peaceful transition of power.Nor did the Portland rioters, unlike those who assailed America's Capitol in 2021, make it past the buildings' outer defenses. The defendant has failed to point to any Portland case that is similar to this one and in which the government made a substantially different prosecutorial decision.\" The simple fact is that Jan. 6 was a more serious crime that deserves more serious punishment. The Proud Boys sought nothing less than the violent overthrow of the democratic process. DeSantis and Ramaswamy refuse to recognize that. It is not a minor crime. It is not comparable to a peaceful protest. It is not even comparable to a violent protest. It was an assault on our democracy.They were charged not with the sort of minor offenses that resulted in short prison terms handed out to the majority of other Jan. 6 protestors - who, according to various studies, received an average of 120 days in prison (compared to two years, the average for BLM protestors). The Proud Boy leaders were charged with a seditious conspiracy, defined as two or more people plotting to overthrow the federal government by force. If that isn't a serious crime, what is?They got the sentences they deserved for conduct that threatened the very heart of our democracy.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nRioters, including Dominic Pezzola, center with police shield, are confronted by U.S. Capitol Police officers outside the Senate Chamber inside the Capitol, Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington.

And, while the former president technically has no role in the newly launched House impeachment inquiry against his once and probably future election opponent, that action is - make no mistake - all about fulfilling Trump's malicious vow.This kangaroo court has been convened not because there's one molecule of evidence that President Joe Biden has done anything impeachable, but because Trump's movement demands it of his most zealous followers in the U.S. House and their hostage er, speaker Kevin McCarthy.Though this is potentially the start of the third impeachment process America has seen in the past few years, it's dangerous new ground.Unlike the two impeachments during Trump's term, this inquiry is launched not in response to any actual evidence of wrongdoing, but in hopes of finding some. If that's the new standard, then every future president whose party doesn't control the House will govern under impeachment storm clouds.McCarthy on Tuesday ordered three House committees to begin inquiries based primarily on the shady international business dealings of the president's son, Hunter Biden, and the so-far baseless allegation that the elder Biden used his vice presidency to help him profit.They will also explore the claim that the administration pulled strings to get Hunter Biden his now-defunct plea deal with the Justice Department.Both issues are nonstarters. House Republicans earlier this year investigated for months seeking to tie the president to his son's sketchy business deals, yet were forced to issue a report in May acknowledging they found nothing.And the plea deal the Justice Department offered Hunter Biden (before it collapsed) was engineered by a Trump-appointed special prosecutor who Biden kept on the job at the behest of Trump's supporters. If that's a conspiracy, it's a pretty convoluted one.None of these facts will matter to Trump's hardcore partisans, whose argument is simple: Tit, meet tat.They are also immune to the irony of grasping at these ethical straws regarding Biden, while supporting an ex-president who openly profited from government business at his commercial properties throughout his term, and whose son-in-law leveraged his White House connections to raise billions in investments from the Saudis.Even the flimsy case against Bill Clinton, impeached for lying about sex, was more solid than the case at hand - because he actually did lie (about sex).Even those who claimed, straightfaced, that that merited Clinton's removal from office would have a hard time saying the same about someone guilty of being a weak parent to a wayward son. Which is ultimately all that President Biden is apparently guilty of.As the conservative commentator David French noted in The New York Times this week, the three previous presidential impeachment inquiries in modern times each began with concrete evidence of wrongdoing: Clinton's DNA on a blue dress, Trump's phone call to Ukraine's president demanding campaign help, and Trump's direction of a mob toward the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\"(A)t the risk of sounding crass,\" French asks, \"where is the blue dress\" in the current House impeachment case against Biden?There isn't one. The Republicans who are trying to pretend there is risk the same fate as Clinton's persecutors, who lost their House majority because Americans saw right through their cynical stunt.But the greater danger here is to the nation's political stability. As of now, America is in an era of impeachment inquiries launched with no more justification than is found on your average campaign bumper sticker.REPRINTED FROM THE ST.

    "content": "Challenges, opportunities in 2024 and beyond\n\n September 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: David Reel | Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 635\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As American voters start to pay greater attention to what is expected to be a very close presidential election in 2024, both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party need to read a recent posting by Ruy Teixeira on The Liberal Patriot. The headline is of his post is: \"It's Official! The Democrats Have a Nonwhite Voter Problem. The data can no longer be denied.\"What makes this post especially noteworthy is that Teixeira is the coauthor of \"The Emerging Democratic Majority\" a book that suggested that demography was destiny for the Democratic Party.It suggested that by extrapolating demographic trends, the total number of nonwhite voters in America would eventually make up nearly a quarter of the electorate.It further suggested if these voters voted solidly Democratic, they would provide a formidable advantage for Democratic candidates, especially, but not limited to Democratic presidential candidates.As a result, it predicted the Democratic Party could dominate American politics for the foreseeable future.The key words are: if these voters voted solidly Democratic.Recently polling of nonwhite voters suggests they are not likely to vote solidly Democratic in the 2024 presidential election and perhaps beyond.A recent survey conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago and the American Enterprise Institute's Survey Center on American Life reports the following: 57% of nonwhite voters say President Biden has accomplished little or nothing during his time in office.Close to 50% consider the Democratic Party too extreme, think it bases decisions more on politics than common sense and supports policies that interfere too much in people's lives.Over two-fifths do not see the Democrats as sharing their values. And over a third think Democrats look down on people like them, do not value hard work and aren't patriotic.In The Liberal Patriot's recent survey of American voters conducted by You-Gov, most nonwhite voters believe the Democratic Party has moved too far left on both economic and cultural/social issues. On economic issues, 57% of these voters say Democrats have moved too far left.On cultural and social issues, 56% say the same.All these numbers lead one to ask what is next? It all depends on if or how the Republican Party and the Democratic Party adjust their election strategies going forward.Democrats could win back support from disgruntled nonwhite and select disgruntled white voters with two strategies. The first is addressing a growing perception by nonwhite voters that their longtime and solid support of Democratic candidates has been and is taken for granted. The second is embracing more moderate positions and actions on a wide range of economic and social issues.Republicans could recruit and retain support from disgruntled nonwhite voters with two strategies. The first strategy is addressing a perception that the GOP is an exclusive club that does not understand or care about nonwhite voters. The second is working more effectively on engaging, energizing, and mobilizing nonwhite voters whose views are in sync with Republican positions and actions on public policy issues to vote Republican.For both parties, pursuing these strategies has significant risks. Democrats risk alienating younger progressives who by nature are resistant to compromise and who are a steadily growing number of voters within the Democratic Party.Republicans risk alienating older conservatives who by nature are resistant to change like expanded voter outreach and get out the vote efforts with nonwhite voters.Between now and November 2024 it will be interesting to see if or how each party (assuming no third parties are viable) may maximize their opportunities and minimize their risks to accomplish the two goals of every political party - win elections and then govern in such a way to avoid the consequences of \"buyer's remorse\" in subsequent elections. \n \n Caption: Recently polling of nonwhite voters suggests they are not likely to vote solidly Democratic in the 2024 presidential election and perhaps beyond. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Congress moves into crisis mode as shutdown looms\n\n September 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 755\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Congress is rushing headlong into crisis mode Tuesday with a government shutdown days away, as Speaker Kevin McCarthy faces an insurgency from hard-right Republicans eager to slash spending even if it means halting pay for the military and curtailing federal services for millions of Americans.There's no clear path ahead as lawmakers return with tensions high and options limited. The House is expected to launch an evening vote on a package of bills to fund parts of the government, but it's not at all clear that McCarthy has the support needed as holdouts demand steeper spending cuts.\"It's easy,\" McCarthy quipped Tuesday when asked about keeping the government open.But with just five days to go before Saturday's deadline, the Senate is trying to stave off a federal closure as the hard-right flank seizes control of the House. Senators unveiled a bipartisan stopgap measure to keep offices funded for temporarily, through Nov. 17, to buy time for Congress to finish its work.The 79-page Senate bill would fund the government at current levels and include about $6 billion supplemental funding for Ukraine and $6 billion in U.S. disaster assistance that has been in jeopardy. It also includes an extension of Federal Aviation Administration provisions expiring Saturday.Ahead of a test vote Tuesday evening, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the temporary measure from the Senate \"a bridge towards cooperation and away from extremism.\"With a supportive nod, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell appeared on board with the bipartisan Senate plan saying, \"Government shutdowns are bad news.\"A government shutdown would disrupt the U.S. economy and the lives of millions of Americans who work for the government or rely on federal services - from the military personnel and air traffic controllers who would be asked to work without pay to some 7 million people in the Women, Infants and Children program, including half the babies born in the U.S., who could lose access to nutritional benefits, according to the White House.The standoff comes against the backdrop of the 2024 elections as a core group of hard-right Republicans are being egged on by Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner to challenge President Joe Biden, who has urged McCarthy's House to stand firm in the fight or \"shut it down.\"It is setting up a splitscreen later this week as House Republicans hold their first Biden impeachment inquiry hearing probing the business dealings of his son, Hunter Biden, as Congress spirals closer to a shutdown. It also comes as former Trump officials are floating their own plans to slash government and the federal workforce if the former president retakes the White House.Against the mounting chaos, Biden warned the Republican conservatives off their hard-line tactics, saying funding the federal government is \"one of the most basic fundamental responsibilities of Congress.\"Biden implored the House Republicans not to renege on the debt deal he struck earlier this year with McCarthy, which set the federal government funding levels and was signed into law after approval by both the House and the Senate.\"We made a deal, we shook hands, and said this is what we're going to do. Now, they're reneging on the deal,\" Biden said late Monday.But Trump is pushing Republicans to dismantle the deal with Biden. \"Unless you get everything, shut it down!\" Trump wrote in all capital letters on social media. \"It's time Republicans learned how to fight!\" The Republican speaker McCarthy brushed off Trump's influence as just a negotiating tactic, even as the far-right plan keeps torpedoing his plans.McCarthy arrived at the Capitol after a tumultuous week in which a handful of hard-right Republicans torpedoed his latest plans to advance a usually popular defense funding bill. They brought the chamber to a standstill, and leaders sent lawmakers home for the weekend with no endgame in sight.McCarthy, of California, was hopeful the latest plan on a package of four bills, to fund Defense, Homeland Security, Agriculture, and State and Foreign Operations, would kickstart the process.At the same time, McCarthy was also reviving his plan for the Republicans to pass their own stopgap measure even though a handful on the hard-right said they would never vote for it, denying him a majority. That proposal would fund the government while also adding severe border security provisions that Biden, Democrats, and even some Republicans reject.\"I'm working all my time to make sure that there would not be a shutdown,\" McCarthy insisted Tuesday. \n \n Caption: Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is surrounded by reporters looking for updates on plans to fund the government and avert a shutdown, at the Capitol in Washington, Friday, Sept. 22. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The first was a Liberty ship built in the United States during World War II.\"It's an honor to maintain the naming tradition for our John Lewis-class oilers, and Harriet Tubman is more than deserving of this recognition,\" Del Toro said in a statement. \"She was born into unimaginable circumstances, but she dedicated her life to facing great danger and adversity, becoming a 'conductor of freedom', helping others escape slavery.\" He continued: \"In addition, during the Civil War, Tubman was the first African American woman to serve formally in the military. Her legacy deserves our nation's continued recognition, and our fleet benefits from having her name emblazoned on the hull of one of our great ships.\" Born into slavery in Dorchester County in 1822, Tubman was named Araminta by her enslaved parents, Ben and Rit Ross. She changed her name to Harriet after marrying freeman John Tubman in 1844.Tubman escaped slavery in 1849, when her enslaver died, and she was to be sold. Sept. 17, 1849, marks the day Harriet Tubman made the important decision to self-liberate.\"This tribute commemorates the powerful legacy of one of our country's most selfless heroes,\" Sams said. \"The Underground Railroad's most famous conductor was devoted to the cause of ensuring freedom for all despite personal sacrifice and risk. A true role model for the sailors who will serve on the USNS Harriet Tubman, her passion, courage and intelligence empowered her to overcome extreme obstacles for the benefit of others.\" Along with the ship's name, Del Toro announced that the ship's sponsor will be Tina Wyatt, the great-great-great grandniece of Harriet Tubman.The ship's sponsor represents a lifelong relationship with the ship and crew. Wyatt has spent her life helping others as a nurse and educating and sharing the legacy of Harriet Tubman.Wyatt said Tubman is a \"symbol of faith, freedom, family, democracy and love.\" \"Aunt Harriet's legacy is an inspiration to a higher calling within us all, and overall, how we are enabled by sharing love for others and self. It is her supply from God that she had been able to supply others throughout her lifetime and still, her footprint lives on and supplies us now,\" she said. \"Such a strong and dazzling example of symbolism in her honor, the naming of an oiler, a ship that supplies other ships with fuel and cargo to function at its highest level, is an example of what she gave in life and continues to give.\" The future USNS Harriet Tubman is the ninth ship of the John Lewis Class. The class and lead ship are named in honor of the late civil rights icon Rep.John Lewis from Georgia.The ships are designed to supply fuel to the Navy's operating carrier strike groups. The oilers have the ability to carry a load of 162,000 barrels of oil and maintain significant dry cargo capacity. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, D-California, were evicted Tuesday from their U.S. Capitol hideaway offices in the aftermath of the ousting of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy.The ejection of Hoyer and Pelosi from their hideaway offices was one of the first acts of the new interim speaker, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-North Carolina.Hoyer's communications team confirmed reports that he was ordered out of his hideaway but declined any further comment on the matter in a statement to Capital News Service.A veteran of the House since 1981, Hoyer twice has served as House majority leader: from 2007 until 2011 and 2019 until January of this year.Pelosi, who was speaker until January when the Republican majority took charge, was not able to move her things out of her hideaway herself because she was in California for Sen.Dianne Feinstein's funeral. Feinstein, the longest-serving female senator in U.S. history, died last week at age 90.\"Office space doesn't matter to me, but it seems to be important to them,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"Now that the new Republican Leadership has settled this important matter, let's hope they get to work on what's truly important for the American people.\" \"Sadly, because I am in California to mourn the loss of and pay tribute to my dear friend Dianne Feinstein, I am unable to retrieve my belongings at this time, \" she said.The former speaker said the \"eviction is a sharp departure from tradition,\" and noted that she gave former Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Illinois, \"a significantly larger suite of offices for as long as he wished.\" However, Pelosi deviated from custom as well when she was speaker and revoked Mike Pence's House office space while he was the vice president, instead giving it to the White House legislative affairs team.Both Pelosi and Hoyer occupied large suites of offices in the Capitol when they were in their leadership posts.Capitol hideaways became a tradition and treasured perk as Congress expanded in size and lawmakers desired more space and privacy to conduct their work. All current senior lawmakers have their own assigned hideaways, but the location of these offices are meant to be kept secret, as are who works in each one.These discreet offices - behind unmarked doors - are often used by lawmakers to meet with staff and colleagues, to find a quiet place to rest, or to speak about delicate matters without fear of being overheard.Hideaways have become less secret in recent years as some senators and House members have allowed their staffs to work and hold small meetings in the private spaces. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Never has this been more critical, as the former president faces 91 counts in four different states and the prospect that trial proceedings could interrupt his march to the nomination.He was in California last week, not only to woo voters but also to thank the party for changing the rules so that if he wins a majority in the primary, he also wins all of the state's delegates to the convention.Back in 2016, Trump's people got outflanked in key states by Ted Cruz, who managed to secure more delegates even in states where Trump beat him because of the way the rules were structured. That won't happen this time around, according to Ben Ginsberg, one of the nation's top election lawyers, because \"despite a large number of candidates, only the Trump campaign went out and did the really hard grunt work of talking to state parties to try and get them to meld their rules to Donald Trump's favor,\" and has succeeded \"in part because they knew what they were doing and in part because everyone else is asleep at the switch.\"The Supreme Court has ruled that it is the political parties, and not state legislatures, that control the rules for nominating presidential candidates. The Trumpers have been working the system since 2019, managing to convince state parties to either move to winnertake-all systems (which reward frontrunners) or to party caucuses rather than primaries, which are controlled by insiders who Trump has actively courted since then.The convention rules provide that delegates, with few exceptions, are \"bound\" by the results of the primaries and caucuses for at least one round of balloting, unless the candidate they pledged to support drops out of the race. The only exceptions are Pennsylvania's 51 district-level delegates, North Dakota's 29 delegates, Wyoming's three party leader delegates, the 18 delegates from American Samoa and Guam, and the three party leader delegates from the Virgin Islands, who by their local party rules are \"unpledged.\"All told, according to Ballotpedia, there will be an estimated 2,467 delegates at next summer's Republican convention: 2,363 pledged delegates and 104 unpledged delegates. To win the nomination, the candidate must receive the votes of a majority, some 1,234 delegates. Trump is aiming to get to that number before any prosecutors get to him.Does that mean that delegates cannot vote their conscience? What happens when intervening events change the dynamic of the race?In 2016, in what was seen as an effort to stop Trump, then Rules Committee member Curly Haugland argued that under the rules, delegates should be free to vote their consciences and not to be bound by the votes in state primaries and caucuses. He and a colleague, Sean Parnell, a public policy consultant in Virginia, published a book entitled \"Unbound: The Conscience of a Republican Delegate,\" and made the round of talk shows, arguing that Trump could still be stopped.In 1980, Democrat Ted Kennedy made the same argument in an effort to stop the nomination of Jimmy Carter. The nomination was effectively decided on the first night of the convention, when delegates rejected the effort to change Rule 11(h) - what we on the Kennedy side called the \"robot rule\" - which bound delegates, two-thirds of whom were pledged to Carter.The convention is, after all, the highest authority of both parties; it makes the rules and can change the rules. I cut my teeth on that campaign, writing speeches about why a robot rule should not control the convention. What if the prospective nominee committed a crime between the primary and the convention, we asked. What if he were convicted of one? In 1980, it was a rhetorical question. In 2024, come this summer in Milwaukee, it may not be rhetorical at all.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cardin threatens to end military sales to Egypt\n\n October 12, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Fatema Hosseini; Capital News Service | Page: 14 | Section: News \n \n 677\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, the newly appointed chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has announced plans to block future U.S. military aid and arms sales to Egypt unless that country shows \"concrete, meaningful, and sustainable steps\" to improve its human rights record.\"It is imperative that we continue to hold the government of Egypt, and all governments, accountable for their human rights violations,\" Cardin said in a statement.Cardin's decision marks a significant shift in U.S. policy towards Egypt, a long-standing ally in the Middle East.The senator plans to block $235 million in foreign military assistance that the Biden administration approved on Sept.14.The move starkly contrasts with the actions of Cardin's predecessor, Sen.Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, who was indicted Sept. 22 for allegedly accepting bribes to influence U.S. policy in favor of the Egyptian government.Cardin's action is colliding with the Biden administration's efforts to foster closer ties with Egypt.State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said in a press briefing Wednesday that the United States aims to advance a strategic partnership with Egypt that ensures regional security and fosters significant progress on human rights issues.Patel added that Secretary of State Antony Blinken believes waiving certain conditions for Egypt's foreign military financing in fiscal 2022 aligned with U.S. national security interests.A total of $1.215 billion in military aid has been allocated for Egypt and discussions with Congress and Egyptian partners are ongoing, Patel said.\"I was very open in my disappointment in the administration using the waiver on the use of funds, but I want to have a chance to meet with the administration,\" Cardin told Politico.Before assuming his current role, Cardin had criticized the Biden administration for overriding a human rights prohibition on $320 million of military aid to Egypt.He was among a group of senators, including independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Tom Carper of Delaware that urged the Biden administration to withhold the $320 million from Egypt.The senators argued that the Egyptian government had failed to make \"meaningful progress in addressing human rights concerns\" and that withholding the funds was \"required by law\" in the fiscal 2022 spending bill.In a July 28 letter to Blinken, the senators charged that the Egyptian government had \"not only failed to investigate allegations of human rights abuses, it has also continued to commit 'significant human rights' violations such as extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearance, torture and life-threatening prison conditions, and severe restrictions on freedoms of expression, assembly, and association, as documented in the State Department's latest human rights report.\" According to Amnesty International, Egyptian authorities severely restrict civil liberties, including freedom of expression and assembly.In the lead-up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in November 2022, 895 political prisoners were released but nearly triple that number were arrested, according to Amnesty International.\"Sexual and gender-based violence remained prevalent, amid the authorities' failure to adequately prevent and punish it,\" Amnesty International said. Workers' rights and religious freedoms are also suppressed, and refugees are mistreated.The decision to freeze aid could have geopolitical implications.As a result of the aid hold, \"the anti-America(n) camp will be empowered domestically,\" Haisam Hassanein, an adjunct fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Jewish Insider.He predicted that the group would publicly push for Egypt to strengthen its relations with Russia and China.\"This could force President (Abdel Fattah El-) Sisi in his current election campaign to release some (inflammatory) statements to save face in front of his constituents,\" Hassanein said.On Wednesday, Cardin also announced plans to halt security assistance to Azerbaijan due to its \"brutal campaign\" in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, effectively erasing its Armenian population.Cardin emphasized the need to document war crimes and atrocities and to support efforts to repatriate prisoners of war.He called for increased humanitarian support for ethnic Armenians who have left Nagorno-Karabakh and for the United States to continue supporting democratic reforms in Armenia. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2023-10-12",
    "author": "Susan Estrich",
    "content": "Antisemites fail to condemn terrorism of Hamas butchers\n\n October 12, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Susan Estrich | Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 761\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It should not be difficult to condemn terrorism.It has nothing to do with whether you support the current Israeli government and its policies.One can sympathize with the plight of the Palestinians, as many of us do.But that has nothing to do with the brutal murders of women and children and the elderly, with the point-blank executions of 260 young people attending a music festival, with the slaughter of children in front of their parents or of parents in front of their children, as Hamas did.For a very long time, those on the left who have been most critical of Israel's policies have insisted that they are anti-Israel and not antisemites. Not so.Those who do not condemn Hamas are antisemites. It is as simple as that.The mass murder of over 1,000 Jews - the worst day in Jewish history since the Holocaust - was driven by hatred of all Jews.To blame Israel for this mass murder is an expression of antisemitism at its worst.In New York's Times Square last Sunday, the antisemites held a rally in support of Palestine. They were joined by their allies - Nazis waving swastikas.What is wrong with these peopleftThey are haters, and they cheer the butchers.Consider the statements by the congresswomen who are part of the \"Squad,\" members of the Democratic Socialists of America, justifying the brutality of animals.Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat, was quick to blame Israel.\"The path to that future must include lifting the blockade, ending the occupation and dismantling the apartheid system that creates the suffocating, dehumanizing conditions that can lead to resistance,\" she stated.Resistance? Killing grandmothers, raping women, beheading babies. That is not resistance. That is pure evil.Rep. Cori Bush wrote on X: \"A military response will only exacerbate the suffering of Palestinians and Israelis alike. As part of achieving a just and lasting peace, we must do our part to stop this violence and trauma by ending US government support for Israeli military occupation and apartheid.\" To call for ending U.S. government support for Israel, at this point, to condemn a military response, is the position of only those who hate Jews and are willing to excuse animal savagery.Rep. Ilhan Omar went so far as to call the cutoff of supplies to Gaza a \"war crime\" and tweeted that \"the solution to this horror, as ever, is a negotiated peace\" and expressed her opposition to \"continuing unconditional weapons sales and military aid to Israel.\" A negotiated peace with terrorists and butchers? Opposition to military aid to Israel as it seeks to defend itself from murderers?What is stunning about these statements is what is missing from them.Where is the recognition that Hamas is a terrorist organization backed by Iran?Where is the condemnation of those who would murder a grandmother and post the video on her Facebook page?Where is the outrage at the mass murders of young people dancing the night away to celebrate peace, the slaughter of civilians, the kidnapping and rape of innocents?Some 30 student organizations at Harvard signed a joint letter holding \"the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence.\" Harvard's leadership, which was quick to issue statements condemning police brutality after the killing of George Floyd, took two days to respond, initially with only a tepid letter saying the students did not speak for the university.Jewish students are rightly outraged at the recognition that antisemitism is flourishing on campuses across the country.\"Black Lives Matter Grassroots\" put out a statement saying that \"we must stand unwaveringly on the side of the oppressed.\" Because Palestinians \"have been subject to decades of apartheid and unimaginable violence, their resistance must not be condemned, but understood as a desperate act of self-defense.\" Since when does mass murder of innocent civilians, decapitating babies, qualify as \"resistance,\" much less self-defense?The people of Israel, many millions of whom do not support the domestic policies of the Netanyahu administration, are united now because they are confronting an enemy who would wipe the Jewish state and the Jewish people off the face of the globe. Hamas is also our enemy, and to treat them as anything other than that is antisemitism, pure and simple.Those of us who have condemned antisemitism on the far right, as well we should, must be just as vigilant in condemning those on the left who are equally hateful. The savagery of Hamas is so easy to condemn that those who fail to do so deserve to be \"outed\" as the antisemites that they have always been.Savagery reveals their true colors.COPYR IGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Tian Tian, whose name means \"more and more\" in Mandarin Chinese, is 26. Mei Xiang, whose name means \"beautiful fragrance\" is 25.The pair were born and raised at the China Research and Conservation Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong, Sichuan Province; they arrived at the National Zoo in 2000.Mei Xiang and Tian Tian have had seven cubs, four of which, including Xiao Qi Ji, have survived to adulthood.Each successful panda birth at the National Zoo was through artificial insemination. Xiao Qi Ji's surviving elder siblings were returned to China in the 2010s under the Giant Panda Cooperative Research and Breeding Agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association. The agreement requires that all panda cubs born at the National Zoo must be sent to China by the time they turn four.Xiao Qi Ji, whose name translates to \"little miracle,\" was born in August 2020.Mei Xiang was 22 when she gave birth to him, making her the oldest giant panda to give birth in the United States.Xiao Qi Ji is the youngest panda still in the country, and he will likely be the last panda born in the United States for the foreseeable future. Upon his arrival to China, he will enter into a breeding program.The initial 10-year agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association began in December 2000 when Mei Xiang and Tian Tian arrived at the National Zoo and has been renewed three times since 2010.Conservation efforts around the globe have proved so successful that in 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature upgraded the giant panda from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable.\" When it is time for Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and Xiao Qi Ji to leave the National Zoo, the pandas will board a FedEx plane for an approximately 16-hour flight with a National Zoo veterinarian and panda keepers, according to Tahmaseb.On the flight, the pandas and staff will bring supplies for the bears that includes food and enrichment activities.Upon their arrival, Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and Xiao Qi Ji will move into giant panda bases managed by the China Wildlife Conservation Association. It is unknown if the three will stay together.\"I think it's very bittersweet,\" Tahmaseb said.\"You know, we have some staff, in particular, a panda team, who have been working with these animals for decades, in some cases. And so I think it's pretty hard, right?\" \n \n Caption: ABBY WALLACE/CAPITAL NEWS SERVICE\n \nOne of the National Zoo's three pandas, 25-year-old Mei Xiang, enjoys a sunny moment in a tree.

    "content": "Voices need to champion love over territory in the Middle East\n\n October 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Armstong Williams | Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 965\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, ruthlessly killing over 1,000 Israelis in the name of their god and in furtherance of their desire for Israel's land. These savages - as they may aptly be called - in concert with Iran and their disjointed Palestinian allies have a single-minded goal: to obliterate Israel and its people.The good news for Israel is that this might be the extent of the attackers' capabilities. However, despite Israel's overwhelming might and strength, they were caught off guard. The pressing question on everyone's mind is how this could happen given Israel's extensive spy network and technology that taps into conversations from every corner of the Middle East.How did they miss this?The ongoing regional conflict, tracing its roots at least as far back as the early 1900s, witnessed another episode when Hamas launched an attack on Israel. We must acknowledge that this isn't necessarily a failure of U.S. or Israeli intelligence. The nature of the attacks experienced by Israel suggests the work of a group more akin to a militia rather than a truly centralized, coordinated effort.Militias present a unique challenge.Their lack of centralized coordination ironically often renders their actions more unpredictable and thus harder to anticipate. This dynamic can be seen in places like Afghanistan, which has been colloquially termed as \"the graveyard of empires.\" The region's heavy reliance on militias to confront adversaries creates a treacherous environment for invading forces.The unpredictable nature of militias, with their varying degrees of sophistication, numerous units, and dispersed operations, leaves armies essentially navigating in the dark, relying solely on the immediate intelligence gathered by their frontline troops.The attacks on 9/11 serve as a reminder that even the mightiest superpowers can be caught off guard by small militia groups, no matter the intensity of their defense mechanisms. The events of that day were orchestrated by mere men armed with knives, and the fallout was arguably the most significant tragedy in American history.The U.S., in many ways like Israel, has thwarted countless plots - many more than the general public would likely want to be aware of. However, it only takes one overlooked detail, one lapse in intelligence, to lead to immense repercussions.In the current scenario, we see individuals soaring into Israel on motorized gliders, brandishing AK-47s. This is not a conventional army; it's not a group that can be sat down for negotiations. It's a stark contrast to the times of Henry Kissinger, where diplomatic shuttling could lead to treaties and conflict resolutions.In this situation, there's no room for such traditional diplomacy. The most viable course of action appears to be defense and retaliation, with the hope that lessons are learned. This way, if caught off guard again, the response can be more swift and effective.The behavior exhibited by certain pro-Palestinian activists celebrating this brutality is nothing short of appalling. These aren't advocates for peace or any noble cause; they seem to have lost all touch with humanity.Their behavior is akin to savages, taking pleasure in violence and parading their heinous actions as if collecting trophies.When groups like the New York City Democratic Socialists of America rally in support of these actions in places such as Times Square and outside the Israeli consulate, like they recently did, it's a chilling reminder of the depths of depravity some are willing to sink to. The terrifying reality is that there are backers for this kind of barbarity right on our doorstep.There's a thought-provoking sentiment I recently encountered that offers a unique perspective on this conflict situation. It asks: \"If both sides had the power to do whatever they wanted, what would they do?\" Undeniably, Israel has a formidable military. They have the means, if they so choose, to exert overwhelming force. In a day, Palestine could be wiped from the face of the Earth. Yet, they show restraint. This restraint is not merely out of fear of international condemnation but rooted in their national and humanistic values.These savages are different. If the roles were reversed, they would undoubtedly kill every Jew and Israeli; seeing dead Israeli bodies paraded around Palestine proves this point.Advocates of this indiscriminate slaughter do so on the grounds that they consider it to be morally justifiable.The moral rationale behind engaging in ransacking followed by rape, murder and subsequently parading their bodies is beyond my comprehension. Nevertheless, even assuming it was somehow justifiable, we must remember that this is wholly based on a lie.These fringe organizations frequently express their support despite the fact that the media, which is remarkably more pro-Israeli today, disseminates false information about this regional conflict regularly. The notion that Israel intentionally targets Palestinian children and adults for slaughter is an absurdity that defies the facts.Each time armaments and missiles are directed toward Israel, Israel retaliates by immobilizing these weapons.But, alas, these terrorists house these weapons in schools and residential buildings. Does Israel bear responsibility for Hamas deliberately storing those weapons in schools with the intention of using the bodies of children as a defense mechanism? Must Israel simply allow their own children to continually be bombarded by rockets?These behaviors are consistent with criminal savages, not saints, and they are certainly not deserving of adoration.However, they are given it, and in this world, we will perpetually contend with savages and those who support them. Savages are doomed to exist. They are unreceptive to rationality.I firmly believe that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians, like people everywhere, are goodhearted individuals seeking peaceful lives free from the constant shadow of conflict. The world needs more voices championing love over territory, unity over division.We should be promoting understanding and coexistence, instead of allowing narrow political agendas to dictate our future. We must rise above the strife, come together, and shape a future filled with hope and prosperity for all.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREAT ORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Court ducks chance to fix 150-year-old injustice\n\n October 19, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: George F. Will | Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 753\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Supreme Court on Oct. 2 spurned an opportunity to correct the second-worst mistake in its 233year history. If it had agreed to hear Ursula Newell-Davis's case, and had then decided it correctly, the court would have scrubbed a 150-year-old stain from its reputation.And it would have ended the injustice being done to Newell-Davis and those whom Louisiana's government is, for its convenience, preventing her from serving. Instead, the court, which is currently accused of insufficient fidelity to precedents, has preserved one that enables government-inflicted abridgments of individuals' rights.The court's worst mistake was Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), holding that Black people have no rights that White people are bound to respect. The Civil War made possible, in 1868, the 14th Amendment, which says no state shall abridge any American's \"privileges or immunities.\"The legislative history of the \"privileges or immunities\" clause shows that this phrase, written to protect newly freed Blacks from states' oppressions, affirmed various fundamental rights of national citizenship.These included those secured by the Bill of Rights, the 1866 Civil Rights Act and other unenumerated rights derived from the common law and acknowledged by the Ninth Amendment. (\"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\") In 1873, however, the \"privileges or immunities\" provision was all but nullified by a Supreme Court decision preserving a Louisiana government-created monopoly.Some Louisiana butchers contested the monopoly conferred by their state on a single slaughterhouse, saying this abridged their right to earn a living. Ohio's Rep. John Bingham, the foremost author of the 14th Amendment's first section, said it was to protect, inter alia, \"the liberty to work in an honest calling.\"This fundamental right, which is deeply rooted in this nation's history, is the antonym of the slavery to which the 14th Amendment responded.The court, however, held that \"privileges or immunities\" refers merely to a few narrow and obscure federal rights (e.g., protection on the high seas). And earlier this month, the court ratified this 1873 mistake, declining to hear a \"privileges or immunities\" challenge to another disreputable Louisiana restriction of economic liberty.Newell-Davis, a New Orleans social worker with undergraduate and master's degrees in social work and more than two decades of experience, wants to provide respite child-care services to parents who have special-needs children. But Louisiana's Health Department requires a \"Facility Need Review,\" which evaluates not a caregiver's competence but four bureaucrats' determination that the community needs the caregiver's services.By what standard does it measure need? Its own needs. Incredibly, the department says that this barrier to entry into the caregiving field \"self-evidently\" serves the public interest by giving department bureaucrats fewer caregivers to scrutinize. Never mind any shortage of Louisiana respite care. Newell-Davis is denied government's permission to practice her craft so that government can conserve its regulatory energies. She cannot work at all so that the bureaucrats can work less than they otherwise would.Because the court long ago eviscerated the straightforward \"privileges or immunities\" clause, occupational-licensing laws have been combated, awkwardly and without sufficient success, as violations of \"substantive due process.\" The theory is that the adjective \"due\" modifies the noun \"process\": Due process supposedly prevents capricious, arbitrary and irrational barriers to entry into this or that field. Courts have enforced this only intermittently and uneasily - partly because many are wary of unenumerated rights.In its unsuccessful (but unanswerable) petition urging the court to hear Newell-Davis's case, the Pacific Legal Foundation skewered Louisiana's nonsense: Under Louisiana's reasoning, government could economize election resources by having fewer polling places. It could enhance the administrative ease of education bureaucracies by educating fewer children.Louisiana's argument, the petition said, is that \"the Department can deprive people of constitutional rights because doing so allows it to oversee fewer people exercising their constitutional rights.\" The Pacific Legal Foundation unavailingly reminded today's court that 100 years ago the court said \"the right to earn a living\" is \"the very essence of the personal freedom that it is the purpose of the [14th] Amendment to secure.\"The court, deferring to its own blunders, chose to preserve a precedent that prevents robust responses to abuses such as Louisiana's abridgment ofNewell-Da-vis's rights. The court should have remembered James Madison's admonition in 1792 that it is \"not a just government. where arbitrary restrictions, exemptions and monopolies deny to part of its citizens [the] free use of their faculties, and free choice of their occupations.\"Reach George Willatgeorgewill@washpost.com. \n \n Caption: PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION\n \nSocial worker Ursula Newell-Davis in an undated photo outside her office in New Orleans. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gag order in Trump trial is wrong - COMMENTARY\n\n October 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: David Harsanyi | Page: 6 | Section: Opinions \n \n 704\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n This week, U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan overseeing United States v. Donald Trump issued a gag order prohibiting a leading presidential candidate, Donald Trump, from engaging in speech aimed at \"government staff,\" among others, during his trial.Listen, I understand the disdain some conservatives feel for the former president. I share the sentiment.But if you're cheering on a judge who's inhibiting political speech on rickety grounds, you're no friend of \"democracy\" or the Constitution.\"Mr. Trump may still vigorously seek public support as a presidential candidate, debate policies and people related to that candidacy, criticize the current administration and assert his belief that this prosecution is politically motivated,\" Chutkan explained. \"But those critical First Amendment freedoms do not allow him to launch a pre-trial smear campaign against participating government staff, their families and foreseeable witnesses.\"Who is Chutkan to dictate the contours of a presidential candidate's political speech? What if one of the \"participating government staff\" or a family member is compromised by partisanship?Moreover, preemptively suggesting that without gagging, Trump will engage in a \"smear campaign\" is as prejudicial to the case as any of the inflammatory things Trump has thrown around. It implies that any accusation now aimed at prosecutors is untrue.Trump contends that he is being railroaded by special counsel Jack Smith, the longtime federal prosecutor who works on behalf of Democrats and President Joe Biden. You might believe the special counsel is a chaste defender of Lady Justice, but there's ample evidence that partisan considerations are in play. Fears of a politicized Justice Department are real. As we speak, the head of the Democratic Party is being mollycoddled by the state in a very similar case involving classified documents.Whatever the case, the Justice Department now plays a big part in Trump's campaign for the presidency - and probably his legal case, as well.If the state's accusations can be spread throughout the media before a trial, why can't the defendant speak openly, as well?In the name of fairness, Chutkan contends that Trump does not enjoy unfettered First Amendment rights because he might intimidate witnesses.It's already illegal to intimidate witnesses.Charge him if he does it. Laws already exist to cover all the other premises Smith has used to rationalize the gag order.The notion that a jury pool is going to be impartial in a trial involving a divisive former president, who is not only a leading contender for the presidency but one of the most famous people on Earth, is absurd. And the notion a D.C. jury pool will be impartial when it comes to Trump is fantastical. There is little that can be done about it. But further gagging the defendant only feeds, at the very minimum, the perception that this is all politically motivated.Establishment media informs us that the gag order is just \"narrow\" and meant to \"protect the integrity of the trial and the jury pool.\" In her Solomonic wisdom, Chutkan cut the state's request in half. A \"narrow\" gag order limiting free speech is still a gag order limiting free speech. The fact that Smith was seeking even broader limitations only makes Trump's claims more plausible.Smith has argued that Trump should not be afforded \"special treatment\" because he's a candidate. He's right. No one's right to defend themselves or to engage in speech should be inhibited, not even during trials (though any good lawyer will tell clients, for their own good, to shut up). Still, gag orders are almost always an unconstitutional prior restraint. For years, the American Civil Liberties Union and similar groups argued the same.I'm sure many people simply believe Trump deserves it. Think, though, about the precedent: Administrations can now launch prosecutions against political rivals - calibrated to take place in favorable cities and timed to coincide with elections - and then demand gag orders be implemented on those running for office. If you think they won't do it to others, you haven't been paying attention.David Harsanyi is a senior editor at The Federalist.

    "content": "Senate candidates make case to retired fed employees - Town hall gets low turnout from crowded field\n\n October 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Darryl Kinsey Jr.; dkinsey@somdnews.com | Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 543\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On Tuesday, the race for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) got underway, albeit with a light start, at a candidate town hall.Candidates were invited to the Comfort Inn hotel in Bowie to hear what some U.S. senatorial candidates had to say at the town hall hosted by the Maryland Federation of the National Association of Retired Federal Employees.The event featured a question-and-answer period with multiple pre-prepared questions during 45-minute sessions. Only two of the current nine registered candidates showed up, though.\"There are no gotcha questions,\" Gary Roundtree, president of Maryland NARFE chapter, said before the start of the event.About 70 people attended the event to hear from independent candidate Emmanuel Osuchukwu and Democratic candidate Rep.David Trone (D-Md., 6th).The event was also scheduled for appearances by current Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks (D), who is not yet listed as filed on the state elections board website but who has announced her candidacy, and fellow Democratic candidate Brian Frydenborg, who did not attend.A fourth Democratic candidate, Juan Dominguez, missed the event due to a COVID-19 diagnosis, while the lone Republican candidate invited, Ray Bly, also did not attend due to an illness, according to organizers.The crowded field of candidates will vie in next year's election to replace Cardin, a career politician who announced he is retiring after holding one of the state's two Senate seats since 2007.Osuchukwu, a former union president and federal contractor from Baltimore, made term limits for congressional offices a focal point of his campaign.\"If we get term limits, then the citizens take back control,\" Osuchukwu said. \"Right now, most of the politicians are just serving themselves and the lobbyists and the globalists.\" He called for a maximum of two-terms for members in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, saying that many of the problems such as poor infrastructure comes from career politicians that take more money for themselves than for the people.On dealing with crime, Osuchukwu said he would fold local police forces into the Maryland State Police to give more flexibility to deal with problems.Trone, who was born in Cheverly and owns a liquor store with his brother, equated the issue of crime and gun violence with the need for improved education in the country.\"A lot of the gun violence challenge goes right back to education,\" Trone said.Trone added that he supported the creation of a teacher academy that would train teachers and pay off their student loans as long as the teachers spend at least four years teaching.The idea was a way to help bring federal dollars to assist teaching initiatives at the local level.Additional Senate candidates include Democrats Marcellus Crews of Capitol Heights, Steven Henry Seuferer of Montgomery Village and Andrew Jaye Wildman of Westminster, Republican Lorie R. Friend and Moshe Y. Landman, who is running with the Green Party, according to the Maryland Board of Elections website. \n \n Caption: LKINSEY JR./SOUTHERN MARY LAND NEWS\n \nLarry Walton, Region II vice president of the National Association of Retired Federal Employees, left, sits in on a town hall interview with Rep.

It was coming my way with shrapnel. One of the jet engines wouldn't start so that left us with three engines instead of four. So we hit the runway going full blast.\" Then, he recalled what fellow service members had asked him after the landing. \"'Crew are you OK? Anyone been hit?' My engineer was scraped, but not bleeding too bad. 'Do the tires look flat? Any fuel leaking?' No, so it looks like we are in pretty good shape,\" he said.After an inspection, Van Slambrook learned there were 200 holes in the airplane.The story is one of many the veteran gathered as he flew for nearly 30 years in the Air Force, from 1956 to 1984.He grew up in southern Michigan, and even as a young man in the Air Force, he displayed skills that put him ahead of his age or rank.He made the choice to learn to fly multi engine airplanes, which put him on track to do supply runs.In 1962, Van Slambrook found himself in Minot, North Dakota and in the middle of the Cold War. He had to get the alert and be in the air in 10 minutes.Van Slambrook would fly alongside larger planes and refuel them mid-flight without the larger plane ever needing to land. Performing jet to jet refueling in the air while flying, became routine. His crew consisted of two pilots, two engineers, a navigator and a loadmaster.\"I flew over 10,000 hours in that airplane, the Boeing 707. We had tanks in it and a boom operator who flew the boom. We gave him a good platform, and he hit the mark,\" Van Slambrook said.\"We could do it any weather, turbulence or at night.\" Before telling his stories, Van Slambrook shared his thoughts about Veteran's Day.He makes a point of going to Perry Point VA Medical Center to see the wounded soldiers, who can't get out of bed or are in wheelchairs.\"Think about the people, the veterans who have gone before me.They have given so much. Mine has been so easy in many respects compared to what other veterans have given. It is only because of what they have given that we have the life we can live today,\" said Van Slambrook.After the war, he had a 20 year long career flying chartered airplanes in the United States. He has been married for 50 years to his wife Dianne and has three boys and a daughter.\"I have been living in glory,\" he said as he held the leather case with the Distinguished Flying Cross in it. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nRichard and Dianne Van Slambrook live in Easton.

    "content": "Andy Harris pushes GOP bill to expel, block Palestinians from U.S. amid Israel-Hamas War\n\n November 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 2 | Section: News \n \n 928\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A group of conservative Republicans - including U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Maryland - have introduced a bill to expel Palestinians from the U.S. if they entered the country on or after Oct. 1.The Safeguarding Americans from Extremism (SAFE) Act also puts a hard stop on all visas, refugee and asylum requests from individuals holding Palestinian Authority passports.The bill is in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks in the Israel and the resulting Holy Land war in Gaza and cites worries about Islamic terrorists and extremists entering the U.S. It is sponsored by by U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Montana, Cosponsors include Harris and U.S. Reps. Andy Biggs, R-Arizona and Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia.\"This legislation keeps America safe. I don't trust the Biden Administration any more than I do the Palestinian Authority to screen who is allowed to come into the United States,\" Zinke said in a statement. \"This is the most anti-Hamas immigration legislation I have seen and it's well deserved. Given the circumstances, the threats to our immigration system and the history of terrorists abusing refugee, asylum and visa processes all over the world, the requirements in this bill are necessary to keep Americans safe. This bill does exactly that.\"Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks inside Israel killed 1,400 people (including civilians and close to 450 children). Israel Defense Forces have responded with a siege of Hamas-controlled Gaza, a sustained bombing campaign and ground invasion.Palestinian authorities under Hamas' control in Gaza say the death toll there exceeds 10,000 people including more than 4,100 children. U.S. and Israeli officials have cast some doubts on the Palestinian figures pointing to Hamas' control of health agencies and information flows.According to Harris and Zinke, the bill would \"render Palestinian Authority passport holders (covered inadmissible to the U.S\". revoke visas to Palestinians issued on or after Oct. 1 and prevents the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from granting current or future visa, asylum and refugees requests from Palestinians.Last month, U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, R-Montana, introduced a bill to block the Biden administration from allowing Palestinian refugees into the U.S.Conservative Republicans have also resisted some proposed U.S. humanitarian aid outlays for Gaza, especially fuel, contending it will end up being stolen and used by Hamas in its war against Israel.Zinke, Daines and other conservatives have also voiced concerns about Hamas, Hezbollah and other Islamic terrorists entering the U.S. via the Mexico border for potential terrorist attacks. Zinke cites a U.S Customs & Border Protection alert from the agency's San Diego alerting personnel to potential crossing by \"foreign fighters' related to the Hamas war with Israel.Democrats as well as Palestinian and Muslim advocates oppose Zinke's legislation.\"Today, extreme MAGA Republican Ryan Zinke introduced a bill to Palestinians from entering the U.S. and possibly even expel those already here. This is the textbook definition of racism,\" said U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California. Lee is a progressive, anti-war Democrat who has called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.Zinke served as U.S. Secretary of the Interior in the Trump administration. Former President Donald Trump also pushed for a U.S travel ban from certain Muslim and other countries with ties to terrorism during his term in office.Both Palestinian territories - the West Bank and Gaza - are overwhelmingly Muslim and are home to anti-Israeli, anti-American Islamic militant and terrorist groups (including Hamas and Islamic Jihad).But there are also between 1,000 and 1,300 Christians in Gaza and 50,000 Christians in the West Bank and Jerusalem, according to the U.S. State Department and other estimates.The Biden administration has supported Israel after the Hamas terrorist attacks dispatching two aircraft carrier groups, fighter jet squadrons and troops to the Holy Land war zone. The Democratic administration has also pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for pauses to conflict to allow for humanitarian supplies and releases fo some of the more than 220 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza after the attacks inside Israel.The Biden administration has launched new federal efforts to combat Islamophobia even as antisemitic threats and vandalism rise. The move comes as substantial numbers ofyoung voters and progressives oppose and criticize Biden's support for Israel and fault Netanyahu's war against Hamas.\"Israel's indiscriminate bombing is hitting hospitals, refugee camps, and killing thousands of innocent people. It must stop now,\" said U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont.Netanyahu and Republicans have opposed prolonged pauses and ceasefires in the war arguing they will help Hamas. The IDF has also pushed back on increasing criticism internationally and U.S. progressives over the civilian casualties in Gaza saying Hamas purposefully locates its rocket and missile launch locations and terrorists operations near schools, playgrounds, mosques, hospitals and churches.Israel has agreed to four-hour daily pauses to allow for civilian movements away from battle zones. Netanyahu said the pauses are not ceasefire.U.S. Sen Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said told CNN Nov. as much as 80% of the population in Gaza supports Hamas and its bid to destroy Israel and much of the Palestinian population there is radicalized.Harris - who represents Maryland's Eastern Shore - said in a statement the focus should be on defeating Hamas \"We have to support Israel 100%. Hamas started this war. Hamas is a group of radical Islamic terrorists. They must be defeated otherwise they are a threat to the entire world,\" Harris said. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a press conference with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz in the Kirya military base in Tel Aviv, Israel, Saturday, Oct. 28, 2023.\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nA man waves a Palestinian flag as protestors cross the Brooklyn Bridge during a demonstration demanding a cease-fire on Saturday, Oct. 28, 2023, in New York. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "White House Christmas ornament honors Gerald Ford\n\n November 16, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Destiny Herbers; Capital News Service | Page: 2A | Section: News \n \n 635\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The White House Historical Association unveiled earlier this month its Official 2023 White House Christmas Ornament honoring the 38th president of the United States, Gerald R. Ford.Each year for President's Day, the association releases a custom ornament honoring a former president. A team of up to 20 people work on planning and designing the American-made ornaments throughout the year.\"The ornaments serve as a wonderful teaching tool designed to tell the story of the White House during a specific presidency or anniversary,\" said Stewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association. \"Through these collectibles, we've been able to further our mission to protect, preserve, and provide public access to the rich history of America's Executive Mansion.\" The 2023 ornament, a three-dimensional wreath, features symbols on the front inspired by the First Lady Betty Ford's White House decorations that could be recreated on Christmas trees at home, Matthew Costello, senior historian at the White House Historical Association, said.\"One thing that Betty Ford did, and it was reflective of the times, was this old-fashioned, handcrafted Christmas,\" Costello said.\"This was a feature amongst their Christmas decorations every year that they were at the White House.\" The front of the wreath is adorned with tiny decorations including dolls, doves, stars, candles, and gingerbread men, as well as red ribbons with \"Christmas 2023\" and \"The White House.\" On the back of the ornament are a series of emblems relating to the life and presidency of Ford and a gold plaque featuring the North Portico of the White House.A member of the U.S.House of Representatives since 1949, Ford was nominated as vice president by Richard Nixon in 1973 after the resignation of the previous vice president, Spiro Agnew. Ford assumed the presidency just 10 months later when Nixon resigned over the Watergate scandal.Ford was the only president to have never been elected to the office of vice president or president.Ford is also the only president to become an Eagle Scout, the highest achievable rank in the Boy Scouts of America, an accomplishment that is referenced in the \"Troop 15\" emblem on the White House ornament.\"Gerald Ford was either one of our most, or our most, athletic presidents,\" Costello said. \"He played collegiate football at University of Michigan and was offered contracts to play professionally but he decided not to and went to law school instead, which was probably a good decision.\" A football with Ford's jersey number 48 is featured at the top of the ornament's wreath alongside a line portrait of Liberty, the Ford family's famous golden retriever, who had a litter of puppies in the White House.The ornament also features a bicentennial pin, commemorating the Ford family's celebration of the 200-year anniversary of America's founding, and an emblem for the U.S.S. Gerald R Ford, a firstin-class aircraft carrier commissioned to honor the president's service in the Navy.\"All of these different element emblems tell us a part of the story of who Gerald Ford was and you know, what he did earlier in his life, and what took place when he was president of the United States,\" Costello said.Proceeds from the ornaments fund the White House Historical Association's educational work, Costello said, including a teacher institute and resources, public programming, a web series called \"White House History Live,\" and research initiatives.The association is a private, nonprofit organization founded in 1961 by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy.The popular Christmas ornaments date to 1981. That first ornament depicted a flying angel. The next year, the ornament honored George Washington; subsequent ornaments have honored each president in order. \n \n Caption: Gerald R.

    "date": "2023-11-16",

    "content": "Election takeaway: abortion remains a potent issue for voters\n\n November 16, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bridget Byrne; Capital News Service | Page: 13 | Section: News \n \n 858\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Tuesday's elections brought multiple victories for reproductive rights advocates, a strong sign that abortion access will be a durable issue and a motivating factor for many voters in 2024.\"In case it wasn't already blindingly obvious before, the abortion issue in a post-Dobbs political environment continues to be a significant advantage for Democrats,\" Kyle Kondik and J. Miles Coleman wrote Wednesday in Sabato's Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan website at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.Ohio passed a ballot measure enshrining reproductive rights in the state constitution, and Democrats in Virginia retained control in the state Senate and flipped party control of the House of Delegates.In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear won re-election after making support of abortion rights a key message of his campaign.And in Pennsylvania, Dan McCaffery, a Democrat who campaigned on abortion rights won a seat on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.At the center of all these races was the Supreme Court's decision last year in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, in which a majority of justices ruled that the Constitution does not guarantee a right to an abortion. The ruling effectively overturned the landmark 1973 decision in Roe v.Wade in which the right to an abortion was protected.\"Abortion access is still a salient message a year and a half after the Dobbs decision, and demonstrating that while voters may be dissatisfied with the direction of the country and its Democratic leader, they're still hesitant to put Republicans in charge instead,\" said Jacob Rubashkin, an analyst with Inside Elections.Polling shows Americans largely support access to abortion.A Gallup poll in July found only 13% of Americans thought abortion should be illegal in all circumstances; 69% said abortion should be legal in the first trimester, although support dropped to 37% for the second trimester and 22% for the third.\"Abortion access isn't just a winning issue with voters; it's a fundamental right that impacts every aspect of their lives,\" Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom For All, said in a statement.\"Ohioans have now constitutionally guaranteed this right, and the nation is watching.\" Ohioans voted in favor of Issue 1, a ballot measure that would change the Ohio Constitution to include protection for abortion access.The amendment states that \"every individual has a right to make and carry out one's own reproductive decisions.\" It also states that \"the State shall not, directly or indirectly, burden, penalize, prohibit, interfere with, or discriminate\" against those seeking abortions or those performing them. Abortions may be prohibited once a fetal is viable, generally considered between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy.Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a Republican, said on X that his party needed to evaluate how its candidates will argue against reproductive rights in 2024.\"We need to understand why we lost this battle so we can win the war,\" Vance said in an X post. \"We have to recognize how much voters mistrust us on this issue.We've fallen behind on the moral argument. I'm talking about sustained, years-long efforts to show the heart of the pro life movement.\" In an appearance Wednesday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Ohio's other senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown, praised the grassroots efforts to pass Issue 1 in his state.\"People understand that a national abortion ban takes their rights away, maybe forever, and that's why people worked so hard last night,\" Brown said.Brown has held his seat since 2007 and is up for reelection next year. He said the vote on Tuesday proves that abortion will be a critical issue in the race.\"The three Republicans running in the primary next year to be the nominee against me, all three of them have called for a national abortion ban. So they are so out of step with Ohio voters,\" Brown said.Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, said before balloting Tuesday that if the GOP won the majority in both houses of the state legislature, the state would \"lead\" by enacting a 15-week ban, with exceptions. The current law bans abortion after 26 weeks.\"I think this is what Virginians expect. I think they know that in a state that is so purple, that we do debate.We do argue,\" Youngkin told reporters Wednesday. \"But they expect us to find common ground on these most important topics and to press forward.\" In Wednesday's Republican presidential debate, the candidates - all opposed to abortion - disagreed on the path forward for the GOP in handling the issue.Businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, who is from Ohio, said he was upset about the votes on Tuesday and said the Republican Party was a \"party of losers.\" Florida Gov. Ron Desantis said Tuesday's results caught the party \"flatfooted.\" Former New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie said abortion rights should be decided state by state and argued that the bigger issue is that \"we're not pro-life for the whole life,\" advocating for funding drug addiction rehabilitation.South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott was not ready to concede any ground, criticizing states that have passed legislation affirming abortion rights and calling for a nation-wide 15-week limit to stop \"reckless behavior\" in states that have affirmed abortion rights, such as Kansas, California, New York, and now Ohio.Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley said she would support any abortion ban that can get the votes to pass. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'No more deliberation, there's no more questioning' - Maryland leaders defend FBI relocation\n\n November 17, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tommy Tucker; Capital News Service | Page: 14 | Section: News \n \n 689\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n GREENBELT - Maryland leadership, in a news conference Friday, Strenuously rejected claims that the decision process for the FBI headquarters was tainted and called the matter a done deal.The U.S. General Services Administration announced Wednesday that the FBI would relocate to a new facility to be built in Greenbelt by the Metro station. In response, Virginia officials, along with FBI director Christopher Wray, called for a reversal of the decision, with Wray claiming in a letter to the agency last month that the GSA failed to address conflicts of interest in the selection process.Gov. Wes Moore, along with U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer, U.S. Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, all Democrats, as well as other Maryland leaders, celebrated the decision Friday, while criticizing the statements made by Wray.Cardin threw back some of the claims, calling out Wray for his actions.\"We saw the hand ofthe director ofthe FBI trying to change what should be a fair, competitive, open process to steer it to Virginia,\" said Cardin. \"The GSA has released all of the information on how they made the decision. Transparency, it's there. Take a look at it-it's not a close call.\"Finding the FBI a new headquarters has been an ongoing issue for more than decade. Hoyer described how former FBI Director Robert Mueller came to him in 2009, describing the need for a new building and how the current headquarters is crumbling.Van Hollen defended Nina Albert, the commissioner of GSA's Public Buildings Service, who has been named in published reports as the official who Wray claimed had a conflict of interest. Albert previously worked for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which owns the land where the new FBI headquarters will be located.\"It is absolutely wrong ofdirector Chris Wray to impugn and question the character, the integrity and the independence of the site selection administrator,\" said Van Hollen. \"She's an expert in the field ofreal estate and transit, she's a public servant and she had a distinguished career as an Army veteran. \"Virginia leadership, including U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, and Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, responded to the relocation decision, echoing some ofthe issues brought up by Wray.\"We are deeply disturbed to learn that a political appointee at the General Services Administration overruled the unanimous recommendation of a three-person panel comprised of career experts from the GSA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluding that Springfield, Virginia, is the site best suited for the new FBI headquarters. We have repeatedly condemned political interference in the independent, agency-run, site selection process for a new FBI headquarters. Any fair weighing ofthe criteria points to a selection of Virginia. It is clear that this process has been irrevocably undermined and tainted, and this decision must now be reversed.\"GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan responded to Wray, calling the claims ofinterfer-ence \"unfounded\" in a statement released Thursday.\"At every step, the GSA team has worked to incorporate the FBI's feedback and appropriately address their concerns, including conducting a legal review ofeach concern raised.\"The new facility will sit on an undeveloped 61-acre plot, directly across from the Greenbelt Metro Station. It is expected to be significantly cheaper than the Springfield site, the officials have said. Proximity to NASA, the University of Maryland, College Park and the NSA factored into the final decision.At Friday's news conference, Maryland leadership expressed repeatedly that they are confident that the decision is final.To illustrate why he is confident the process will proceed, Hoyer brought up Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz's attempt to restrict funding for the FBI's new headquarters which \"lost overwhelmingly\" in a vote on Wednesday. Van Hollen echoed this sentiment \"I am confident that we will work with our colleagues to get it done because, as you heard in the House the other day, an effort to, I think, essentially claw back a lot of the monies that have already been there, lost,\" said Van Hollen. \n \n Caption: CAPITAL NEWS SERVICE/TOMMY TUCKER\n \nU.S. Sen.

    "content": "Deepening Divides - Democrats Split Over 'Anti-Zionism Is Antisemitism' Measure; Poll Shows U.S. Racial, Generational Differences Over Israel-Hamas War\n\n December 11, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 3 | Section: News \n \n 954\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. House of Representatives approved a measure Wednesday declaring that \"anti-Zionism is antisemitism\" prompting a split among Democrats.A majority of House Democrats did not vote for the measure as a public opinion poll from Gallup shows substantial divides among Americans over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza by age, race and political persuasion.\nWhites, older voters and Republicans tend to back Israel in its war against Hamas after the Oct. 7 terror attacks while younger Americans, people of color and Democrats disapprove of Israel's air strikes and ground invasion of Gaza aimed at the Islamic militant group, according to a poll released Nov. 30 by Gallup.\nThe congressional measure condemning antisemitism passed with support from 216 Republicans and 95 Democrats. The resolution's most controversial component was plank equating anti-Zionism with antisemitism.\nZionism is a movement and belief system that supports the Jewish state of Israel in the Middle East.\n\"Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel,\" according to the Anti-Defamation League.\nThirteen Democrats voted against the measure and 105 Dems voted 'present' or did not vote neither supporting nor opposing the resolution.\nOne Republican - U.S.\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky - voted against the anti-Zionism/antisemitism measure. Another four GOP lawmakers did not vote.\n\"Anti-Zionism isn't antisemitism,\" Massie said in a social media statement pointing to congressional remarks by U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, that some Orthodox and other Jews are not in agreement with modern Zionist constructs.\nNadler, the House's most senior Jewish members, said some Orthodox Jews believe only the Messiah can establish a new state of Israel and the measure can label progressive Jews and others critical of controversial judicial reforms in Israel as antisemitic.\nNadler and U.S. House Majority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, were among those voting present on antisemitism measure.\nThe 13 Democratic no votes came from progressives who have been critical of Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas and U.S. support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the Islamic militant group's Oct. 7 attacks.\nOpponents of the measure - which referenced rises antisemitic vandalism and violence - included U.S. Reps. Jamaal Bowman and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Pramila Jayapal of Washington \"We must be steadfast and clear in condemning antisemitism. The extreme GOP resolution on the floor today had no Democratic cosponsors and inappropriately said all anti-Zionism is antisemitism. Muddying the waters about what antisemitism is, is completely wrong and unhelpful,\" said Jayapal who had to clarify recent comments about whether she condemned Hamas' rapes and violence against women and girls in the Oct. 7.\nGOP SUPPORTS MEASURE U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a Republican representing the Eastern Shore, voted for the antisemitism measure along with Maryland Democratic U.S. Reps.\nSteny Hoyer, David Trone, Dutch Ruppersberger and Kweisi Mfume. Maryland Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin and John Sarbanes voted present.\nHouse Republicans overwhelmingly backed the resolution which labels some pro-Palestinian slogans as antisemitic.\n\"More Jews were murdered on October 7th than on any other single day since the Holocaust.\nLet that sink in. We have even seen members of this very body repeat blatantly antisemitic rhetoric and spread lies about Israel and her right to exist. Let me be absolutely clear: such hate has no place in the halls of Congress nor our national discourse. It is our fundamental responsibility as leaders and Members of Congress to condemn and fight these horrific acts of hate and discrimination against the Jewish community,\" said U.S. Rep. David Kustoff, R-Tennessee, one of the main sponsors of the resolution.\nGOP backers of the measure point to a rise in antisemitic incidents and pro-Hamas and pro-Palestinian rhetoric that calls for or insinuates the destruction of Israel. They also point to the 106 no or present that did not support the measure - 105 of them from Democrat.\n\"The world has seen a drastic rise of antisemitism since October 7th that is deeply disheartening and extremely concerning,\" said U.S. Max Miller, R-Ohio. \"Elected leaders must have the courage to condemn and fight all forms of domestic and global antisemitism.\nWhile I am glad this resolution passed the House today, I am disappointed that 106 of my colleagues failed to take this opportunity to condemn antisemitism forcefully.\" AMERICA DIVIDED The Gallup poll released Nov. 30 shows significant splits over the Holy Land war by race, political party and gender.\nThe polls shows 71% of Republicans back Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza versus support from 36% of Democrats.\nFifty nine percent of men approve of Israel's war in Gaza versus 44% of women, according the Gallup Among people of color, 64% disapprove of Israel's attacks against Hamas in Gaza while 61% of whites backs Netanyahu's efforts to dismantle the militant group.\nThere is a similar split my age with 67% of younger Americans (ages 18 to 34) disapproving of Israel's war against Hamas and 63% of voters 55 and older backing the Israel Defense Forces' military effort.\nPalestinian health authorities in Hamas-controlled Gaza say more than 17,000 people have died since Holy Land war stared in October Israeli officials say Hamas fighters killed more than 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages in the Oct. 7 terror attacks. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n Noa Mittelman, 15, center, and Maya Talby, 15, right, hold up flyers of people kidnapped by Hamas during a rally and march for Israel, Sunday, Nov. 19, 2023, in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, Wash.\n\n ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n Muslim protesters burn U.S. and Israel national flags during a rally against the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, outside the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia Wednesday, Oct. 11, 2023.\n\n ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n A demonstrator waves a Palestinian flag as Kenyan police officers fire teargas canisters during a protest against Israel and in support of Palestinians, in Nairobi, Kenya Nov. 9, 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Record U.S. defense money for AI, quantum weapons, Israel, Ukraine - $886 billion military spending bill keeps FISA surveillance, approves $600M for Kyiv, R&D, weapons for IDF\n\n December 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Page: 2 | Section: News \n \n 1266\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The deep partisan divides in Washington do not extend to U.S. military spending - which is approaching $1 trillion annually.Congress approved the $886 billion National Defense Authorization Act this week with bipartisan support from both U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.\nThe record-high, U.S. military spending bill includes weapons and outlays for Israel (including joint development or artificial intelligence and quantum technology weapons) and Ukraine and extends a controversial government surveillance program.\nThe measure approves $600 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine in its war against invading Russia forces. The U.S. has already provided $44.2 billion in weapons and other aid to Ukraine since Russia 2022 invasion and President Joe Biden wants to provide $61 billion more as part of a $106 billion war package that also includes outlays for Israel, border security and Taiwan.\nThe bipartisan legislature also bolsters U.S. support for the Israel as it continues its war against Hamas in Gaza after the Oct. 7 attacks by the Islamic militant group. More than 18,000 Gazans and 1,200 Israels have died in the Holy Land war.\nThe U.S. measure has $500 million for Israel missile defense systems including the Iron Dome which is used to repeal rockets from Hamas, Islamic and Hizbollah. The package - which will soon be signed by Biden - also allocates $47.5 million for new U.S and Israeli joint military research related to artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum technologies.\nIt also extends the Pentagon's ability to ship \"precision-guided munitions\" and other weapons systems to Israel as well as a joint anti-tunneling program.\nIsrael Defense Forces are in the midst of a ground invasion of Gaza including efforts to root out and destroy Hamas tunneling system below the densely populated Palestinian area.\nThe NDAA also instructs the Pentagon and federal agencies to implement a \"national strategy\" to combat antisemitism.\nAIPAC - a pro-Israel lobbying group - and the Anti-Defamation League - leading Jewish group - both back the defense measure.\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minnesota, said the NDAA \"includes numerous provisions to expand U.S.-Israel defense cooperation and one to ensure that no military resources go to anyone participating in anti-Israel boycotts.\"\nIsrael already receives more than $3 billion U.S. defense aid annually.\nThe NDAA also includes a 5.2% pay increase for U.S. military personnel, funds National Guard deployments aimed cross-border drug trafficking in particular fentanyl and approves more than $16 billion to bolster the U.S. military's posture in the Pacific Rim and help allies such as Taiwan and the Philippines which have faced saber rattling from China.\nBIPARTISAN BACKING\nThe House approved the U.S. military spending package by a 310 to 118 vote Thursday.\nRepublicans voted for the measure by a 147 to 75 margin. Among Democrats, 163 House members supported the defending spending program while 45 opposed.\n\"I was proud to support the NDAA, which include a historic pay raise for our troops, additional tools to disrupt fentanyl trafficking and critical support for Israel,\" said U.S. Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, a freshman Republican from Oregon.\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, all backed the Pentagon measure.\nThe Senate approved the measure Wednesday by an 87-13 vote.\nSchumer hailed the bill as helping the Pentagon develop and deploy more AI systems and weapons.\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said the measure reinforces U.S. backing for Israel, Ukraine and NATO and will propel next generation weapons.\n\"By harnessing the power of America's science and technology, the NDAA will invest in disruptive technologies like hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing while continuing to modernize our ships, aircraft, and ground combat vehicles,\" Cardin said in a statement.\nINDUSTRY BACKING\nLobbying groups and associations representing the aerospace, technology and defense contracting sectors back the bill including increase U.S. Defense Department spending on AI and quantum computing.\n\"The U.S. must be the global leader in the investment, development, and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) to ensure it is implemented responsibly across the world. This year's NDAA includes provisions that will strengthen our leadership in AI and other emerging technologies, including quantum computing,\" said TechNet, a group whose members include Apple, Deloitte, Amazon, Google and Meta, in a statement supporting the NDAA.\nThe Aerospace Industries Association, whose members include Honeywell Aerospace, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, RTX (Raytheon), BAE Systems and Boeing, also supports the big defense spending and more money for AI.\nBiden is expected to sign the bill which was approved shortly after a visit to Washington and Capitol Hill by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which included meetings with lawmakers and defense contractors.\nBiden warned U.S. support for Ukraine could run out if the $106 billion war supplemental is not approved. White House officials said that could embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin and results on direct conflicts between Moscow and NATO involving U.S. troops.\nThe no votes in the Senate came from six Democrats (including Oregon Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley), six Republicans (including U.S. Sens. J.D Vance of Ohio, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah). U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, also oppose the measure\nFISA FIGHT\nSome NDAA opponents were upset with a provision in the 3,000-page bill that reauthorized Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\nAn effort to block that reauthorization failed in the U.S. Senate.\nCritics of the FISA section (including the American Civil Liberties Union), which is focused on investigating foreign terrorists, say it allows the FBI and intelligence agencies to spy on Americans without a court-approved warrant.\nU.S. Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Montana, said he's backed past defense spending measure but voted no Thursday on the latest NDAA over the FISA surveillance issue and concerns over taxpayer money being used to pay for abortions and gender reassignment surgeries and to allow drag queen shows on military bases. The final bill did not include GOP language specifically restricting Pentagon on those social issues.\n\"A vote in favor of this bill is a vote to allow the U.S. government to spy on you.\nA vote in favor of this bill is a vote to allow the U.S. military to pick you up and lock you up in Guantanamo Bay without representation. A vote in favor of this bill is a vote to inflict the radical left's social experiment on our military and is an insult to our men and women in uniform, which is why I voted no,\" Rosendale said.\nRosendale also said the FBI used FISA Section 702 to spy on \"U.S. citizens more than 278,000 times without a warrant.\"\nU.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a Republican representing the Eastern Shore, and Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Montgomery County, voted against the defense bill. The rest of Maryland's delegation - all Democrats - voted for the spending measure.\nU.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said measure will bring $886 million to Fort Meade which is home to the National Security Agency for renovations and expansion of NSA operations.\nSome of the Democratic opposition came from progressives who have been critical of U.S. and Biden administration support for Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas after the Oct. 7 attacks.\nDemocratic no votes includes ones from U.S.\nReps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Pramila Jayapal of Washington.\nWhile GOP leadership backed the measure along with former House Speakers Kevin McCarthy, R-California and Nancy Pelosi, D-California, some notable populist conservatives joined progressive \"Squad\" member in opposing the defense budget.\nGOP U.S. Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Matt Gaetz, Anna Paulina Luna and Greg Steube of Florida, and Doug LaMalfa, of California, voted against the NDAA. \n \n Caption: President Joe Biden meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2023, in Washington. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "U.S. weapons deal with Ecuador in ‘war’ with gangs would swap out, send Russian arms to Ukraine\n\n January 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG Newspapers | Section: World \n \n 609\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A planned deal would have the U.S. send $200 million in new weapons and military equipment to Ecuador to help the government in its fight against drug gangs in exchange for older Russian armaments that Washington could then potentially transfer to Ukraine.The U.S. is also sending top military and drug enforcement officials to Ecuador after criminal gangs took more than 100 prison guards hostage and gained temporary control of a television station.\nEcuador President Daniel Noboa has deployed military troops throughout the country and declared a state of emergency in response to the gangs and viral videos of prison guards being held hostage and the takeover of the TV station. There has also been social media footage of Ecuadorian troops and police officers cracking down on gang members.\nNoboa, who was born in Miami and educated in the U.S., said the South American country is in a \"state of war.\"\nU.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller condemned \"violence and terrorism at the hands of narco-criminal elements\" in Ecuador and promised to increase intelligence sharing and other resources with the government.\n\"To accelerate that cooperation, senior U.S. officials will visit Ecuador in the coming weeks to explore with Ecuadorian counterparts ways we can work together more effectively to confront the threat posed by transnational criminal organizations. These officials include Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Assistant Secretary Todd Robinson, Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs Deputy Assistant Secretary Kevin Sullivan, Commander of U.S. Southern Command General Laura Richardson,' Miller said.\n\"U.S. law enforcement officials will also travel to assist Ecuador in criminal investigations. In addition, the United States will increase intelligence sharing, cooperation to combat malicious cyber activity, and assistance with the implementation of prison reforms and will employ other available tools to hold accountable those individuals and organizations engaging in criminal activity and undermining the rule of law,\" the statement continued.\nU.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland (who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) echoed American backing for the Ecuadorian government in the strife which also included a prison escape of a top gang leader.\n\"Ecuador is a key partner of the United States. Its security and prosperity are in the mutual interest of our peoples. We are horrified by the heinous acts of violence perpetrated by armed criminal groups across the country. We reaffirm our support for President Noboa as he moves to restore order and bring justice to those undermining the country's stability,\" said Cardin in a joint statement with House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas.\nNoboa talked about the U.S. military deal on the Canela radio station.\n\"We will receive help from the United States. The swap will involve outdated Russian and Ukrainian scrap for modern equipment and technology worth $200 million,\" Noboa told the station.\nLast year, Richardson said the U.S. was asking Latin American countries to swap out older Russian and even Soviet-era weaponry for new American systems and munitions and ship that older equipment to Kyiv in the fight against Russia.\n\"We are working with the countries that have the Russian equipment to either donate it or switch it out for United States equipment,\" Richardson said during an appearance at the Atlantic Council in Washington, according to Voice of America and other outlets.\nThe U.S. has sent more than $44.9 billion weapons and other military aid to Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the Eastern European country in February 2022.\nBut a new $61 billion aid package for Ukraine that is part of a larger proposal that includes $14 billion for Israel's war in Gaza and $14 billion to bolster border security has been stalled in Congress as Republicans press for more stringent immigration reforms and some press against more spending on the European war. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Steady leadership, respect earn voters' support\n\n January 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 625\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As we proceed full speed into the 2024 presidential election, the levels of bitter, vitriolic, divisive, often misleading, bombastic and demeaning rhetoric from candidates of both parties continues to escalate.This election cycle reminds me of a bitter and contentious general election for governor in Pennsylvania.\nIn that election, the Republican candidate was William Scranton, a former one-term Republican member of Congress. The Democratic candidate was Richardson Dilworth, the incumbent mayor of Philadelphia.\nScranton's political resume was thin. His only experience as a candidate was his successful run for Congress. Despite that, the state GOP was bullish on him after losing to Democratic candidates in two previous gubernatorial elections. They believed Scranton's success as a volunteer civic leader on economic development issues in a depressed region of a rust belt state would resonate well with voters.\nDilworth on the other hand, had a long history of political success in Philadelphia. He was elected city treasurer, district attorney and twice as mayor. His success was due in part to Philadelphia being a deep blue city with huge numbers of Democratic votes cast in local and statewide elections.\nDilworth's electoral success in Philadelphia was also based in part on a simple, but effective campaign strategy. His campaign would purchase time on a local TV station to which he would invite his opponents to a debate. He did so fully expecting his opponents would not participate. They always obliged him. As a result, he had a full hour of viewers to himself, where he reminded them not only of his accomplishments, but also repeatedly mentioned that his opponent chose not to participate in the debate.\nAs the November gubernatorial election heated up, Dilworth again rented TV time and invited Scranton to join him for a debate. He smugly assumed that Scranton, like all his previous opponents, would be a no show.\nDilworth assumed wrong.\nMinutes before airtime Scranton unexpectedly strolled into the TV studio. A surprised and angry Dilworth had a meltdown. It started when Dilworth shouted at Scranton, \"What are you doing here?\"\nDuring the debate, Dilworth peppered Scranton with insults. With thinly disguised contempt he called Scranton a phony, a coward, a Little Lord Fauntleroy, and an Ivy League Dick Nixon. Unruffled, Scranton calmly but forcefully responded with \"You, sir, are a desperate man.\"\nAll of this was captured on film and was also widely reported by the print media who were there for the debate. Even those who did not see the actual television debate read all about Dilworth's meltdown.\nThe debate was an unexpected and game changing negative branding movement for Dilworth's grace under pressure, civility and steady leadership credentials.\nBy contrast, the debate was an unexpected and game changing positive branding moment for Scranton's grace under pressure, civility and leadership credentials.\nIn November, Scranton beat Dilworth with 55% of the total statewide votes. This occurred despite strong support for Dilworth from President Kennedy who had carried Pennsylvania in the preceding statewide presidential election.\nThis is a lesson for the candidates the Republican Party and the Democratic Party eventually nominate for president in 2024.\nAmerican voters have long deserved and rarely seen a presidential election where candidates are not demonizing those who disagree with them and their supporters, by questioning their motives and their intellectual capability to make informed decisions.\nRegularly showing grace under pressure, civility, steady leadership and respect for all views during a long and often grueling campaign is the best way for candidates to earn voter's support and gain their trust to govern fairly and inclusively if elected.\nNow is the time for presidential candidates from both parties to commit to disagree on issues without being extremely disagreeable. Voters deserve nothing less.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who serves as a trusted adviser on strategy, advocacy and media matters.

'the evil of two lessers'\n\n January 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 572\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In one response to my most recent previous commentary — \"Voters Deserve Better from Presidential Candidates Going Forward,\" it was suggested that because I serve at a consulting firm that provides counsel and services to Republican candidates, it \"seems that my mission is to create false equivalency between the two presidential candidates and obscure the facts.\"That response uses a rhetorical strategy (argumentum ad hominem) where one attacks the character, motive or some other attribute of the person offering an opinion, rather than attacking the substance of the opinion itself.\nIn that commentary I did not mention the names of any current or future 2024 presidential candidates.\nIn my commentary, I wrote about two candidates in a previous divisive gubernatorial election in Pennsylvania. I suggested it provides good advice for whomever the candidates will be for president in 2024.\nAt this point in the 2024 election cycle, I do not know who the candidates will be.\nI do know this.\nI am not an apologist for or zealous supporter of former President Donald Trump or any other Republican candidate.\nI am not an apologist for or zealous supporter of President Joe Biden or any other Democratic candidate.\nI am not an apologist for or zealous supporter of any third party or independent candidate.\nMy guiding principle in the political arena has always been never to support or vote for a candidate based solely on party affiliation. My support and votes are based solely on how closely a candidate's views on public policy issues align with my views on those issues.\nMy guiding principle when writing guest commentaries is acceptance of the thinking of Frank Luntz who said this about messages — \"It's not what you say or write. You can have the best message in the world, it's what people hear or read. The person on the receiving end will always understand it through the prism of their own emotions, preconceptions, prejudices and preexisting beliefs.\"\nPresently my views on the two most likely major party candidates for president in 2024 are perfectly captured in a recent commentary by syndicated columnist Cal Thomas titled The Evil of Two Lessers.\nIn it, Thomas includes the following thoughts:\n\"Some voters in recent elections have complained about being forced to choose between the lesser of two evils. In the 2024 election, it appears we are heading for a worse choice — the evil of two lessers.\"\nThomas writes, \"Donald Trump continues demeaning and defaming anyone who disagrees with him. He repeats unproven claims that the 2020 election was 'stolen.' A myriad of other inaccurate statements has apparently had a negative influence on President Biden who has joined him in the mud pit. In his recent speech near Valley Forge, America will become like Germany in the '30s. The very future of democracy is at stake, he [Biden] claimed.\"\nThomas goes on to write, \"This isn't Biden's first trip into the mud. During the 2012 presidential campaign Vice President Biden told a Black audience that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney \"would put you all back in chains.\"\nThomas ends his commentary about 2024 by asking the question: \"Where is this corrosive language getting us? Why can't we have a true debate over the best ways to fix our problems? Claiming your opponent would rule like a Nazi, or that the other is a crook, solves nothing.\"\nI agree.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who serves as a trusted adviser on strategy, advocacy and media matters.

No, I'm not talking about his victories in Iowa and New Hampshire, although of course he won them both. I say \"of course\" because he's a president running for his second term, and if you judge him like you would an incumbent — who you would expect to do better than 80% or more — the fact is that he underperformed, especially in New Hampshire.He may be on a roll to the nomination, but the roll I'm talking about has to do with showing his true colors, which will end in his defeat.\nThe man cannot control himself. Start with where he finds himself — in a courtroom, at the defense table, being chastised by a judge because he can't keep his mouth shut. It's becoming an all-too-familiar position for the former president, sure to be even more so in the months ahead. He can't stop muttering insults, notwithstanding the defense's objections that the jury could hear him. But that's not the only place he's shown his lack of control.\nLast week, at 2 a.m., he took to Truth Social to rant about his quest for absolute immunity. This was after his lawyer told a court that even if he ordered a team of Navy Seals to assassinate a political opponent, he could not be arrested or prosecuted until and unless the House impeached him and the Senate convicted him. Trump was even more blunt: The rant was that, as president, he was entitled to \"ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY\" even if he \"crossed the line.\" So much for the fundamental principle that, in a democracy, no one is above the law.\nOn Sunday night, he went off the rails in his campaign stump speech on the subject of absolute immunity, adding in references to pedophile priests and rogue cops, seeming to suggest that their existence somehow buttressed the case for him to be absolutely immune. How? Why? Slurring his words, and making no sense, he sounded like a befuddled would-be dictator with no morals at all.\nAnd then came Tuesday night. He took obvious pleasure in humiliating his former rivals, Vivek Ramaswamy and Tim Scott. He gave Ramaswamy exactly one minute to grovel (he actually took an additional 40 seconds) before mocking Scott for having announced his engagement to marry the day before, leading commentators to explain that his feigned surprise was in fact a reference to the rumors that Scott is gay.\nThat was nothing compared to the wrath he displayed for Nikki Haley, who he spent most of his speech attacking on the ground that \"I find in life you can't let people get away with bulls---.\" Scott, who was appointed to the Senate by Haley, clapped uncomfortably while Trump attacked her for everything from her clothes to her determination to stay in the race. To say that he didn't act like a winner, but a bitter old man, is an understatement. His former press secretary, appearing on Fox News, pointed out the obvious: that with seven out of 10 Haley voters saying they would not vote for Trump, it was time for the former president and presumptive nominee to reach out to unify the party rather than excoriate his opponent.\nJust before midnight on Truth Social, he reacted by calling them both names: \"I don't need any advice from RINO Kayleigh McEnany on Fox. Just had a GIANT VICTORY over a badly failing candidate, 'Birdbrain,' and she's telling me what I can do better.\"\nThen he returned to New York, bringing even more attention to the E. Jean Carroll trial, where he had already been found liable for sexual assault and defamation, and the only question was how much it would cost him. The day before, Trump had walked out of the courtroom muttering loudly, \"This is not America.\" The jury had an answer for that: $83.3 million.\nNo one is above the law. Loose lips sink ships. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

His office's analysis of transplants' voter records show 65% of those moving to Idaho are registered as Republicans and just 12% are Democrats.\nSeventy-five percent of those moving from California to Idaho are Republicans while 10% or Democrats.\nOther conservative states — including Wyoming, Montana and Florida — also are seeing the similar migration movements.\nVictoria Stultz, a residential real estate broker on Florida's Southwest coast, sees an influx of small business owners as well as remote workers born out of the coronavirus pandemic relocating to the Sunshine State where there is no state income tax. \"They're moving their businesses down here,\" she said, pointing to construction, air conditioning and other firms relocating from northern states.\nThe dynamic has led to population gains for the likes of Texas, Florida and Idaho while California, New York and Illinois have lost residents.\nReal estate agents in Montana and Wyoming also report influxes of residents from the coasts as well as Colorado — including remote workers.\nBuck Wilson, president of the Wyoming Realtors industry group, said he sees some residents moving to his state because it is friendly toward gun ownership and others from neighboring Colorado to escape the proliferation of legalized marijuana, especially in Denver.\n\"We've definitely seen an impact,\" he said.\nIn Montana, Mike DeVries, a commercial real estate broker in Bozeman, also sees politics, quality of life and post \"I would say a majority of them cite politics, over cumbersome regulation and quality of life,\" DeVries said. \"Since COVID, we have been seeing a lot more people moving here from the East Coast and bigger metro areas, as well as the West Coast.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cardin, Van Hollen back new foreign aid bill after bipartisan immigration deal dies\n\n February 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KATHARINE WILSON Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 818\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Maryland Democratic Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen have criticized Republican colleagues for blocking the bipartisan package that included border security and military aid to Ukraine.Now aid to Ukraine and Israel has new life as senators on Thursday voted 67-32 to advance consideration of the foreign aid package without an immigration component. Cardin and Van Hollen were among the \"yes\" votes.\n\"We simply cannot allow this impasse to undermine our commitments to support Ukraine, Israel, and our partners in the Indo-Pacific,\" Cardin said in a Wednesday statement.\nThe Senate failed on a procedural vote earlier Wednesday to take up the $118 billion supplemental spending bill after Republicans effectively killed the immigration reform measures aimed at addressing the massive influx of people along the U.S.-Mexico border.\nRepublicans had initially refused to consider a Ukraine aid spending bill unless it was tied to immigration reform. That included House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), who had suggested the pairing as far back as a November Fox News interview. This insistence fell away Tuesday when Republican senators declared that the package was \"dead\" after a negative review by former President Donald Trump.\n\"We can't give up, it's too important to our national security,\" Cardin insisted as Republican support for the original bipartisan bill faded.\nThe supplemental spending measure being considered by the Senate includes $60 billion to support Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel security assistance and $9 billion for humanitarian assistance in Palestinian territory and Ukraine. The package also includes sanctions against individuals involved in dealing fentanyl.\nCardin, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed frustration with Senate Republicans as GOP support for the earlier bill with immigration reforms evaporated.\n\"The failure to move this bipartisan funding package forward represents both a dereliction of American leadership on the world stage and a refusal to uphold our responsibilities to secure the integrity of our borders at home,\" Cardin said in a statement Wednesday.\nCardin added: \"I fear the consequences of deserting our allies abroad and turning our backs on critical immigration reform merely for political exploitation will have real and far-reaching implications.\"\nThe European Union announced a $54 billion aid relief package for Ukraine last week, but Cardin said that Europe's action wasn't enough.\n\"Europe has stepped up, we have to step up,\" Cardin said Tuesday. \"It affects not only our position for Ukraine, but our global influence and credibility.\"\nVan Hollen said in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that every time Republicans make new requirements to pass Ukraine funding, \"autocrats of the world celebrate\" — naming Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping.\n\"They're eager to see the US back down from the fight for democracy — and most Republicans are apparently happy to oblige,\" Van Hollen said in the post.\nThe now-failed Immigration would have given $20 billion to increase the operational needs of the U.S. Border Patrol. The bill's reform policies included barring illegal border crossings — detaining and deporting those who attempt to cross instead of processing and screening migrants — if they hit an average of 5,000 average crossings a day in a given week.\nThe bill also would have allowed officers to decide asylum cases at the border and increase requirements for asylum. The package was endorsed by the National Border Patrol Council, the union for Border Patrol agents.\nCardin called this border reform \"critical\" in a Wednesday statement.\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Florida, said in a news conference with other Republican senators Tuesday that he wouldn't vote on any bill that codified what he calls Biden's \"open border policy\" or that would give humanitarian aid money to Gaza.\nScott added that while many in his party want Ukraine to win and Russia to lose, they have different views on if and how funding should be sent.\nHe also pushed for the Republican conference to get together to make a bill that would get passed, claiming that this bipartisan deal was made behind closed doors by leadership.\n\"Why don't we start coming together as a conference to get something done?\" Scott said.\nThe package was negotiated by Sens. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Arizona. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, initially endorsed the bipartisan immigration bill but reversed himself as fellow GOP senators raised objections.\nMany Democrats in both houses said GOP lawmakers who rejected the immigration-foreign aid package were doing the bidding of Trump. Republicans, including Johnson, denied that.\nTrump called the border legislation a \"death wish\" for Republicans and called for a separate border and immigration bill Monday on Truth Social.\nBut Cardin said Wednesday that the immigration bill collapse \"makes clear that there are those in this legislative body who will prioritize fidelity to Donald Trump and his personal interests over the safety and security of our country and the global community.\"\nThe revived Senate package still faces potential procedural delays and Republican amendments. And it is unclear if the narrow Republican majority in the House will agree to the new legislation stripped of immigration reforms. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Larry Hogan will run for a seat in the U.S. Senate.Hogan, a Republican, announced his campaign on Friday via social media, releasing a video just nine hours before Maryland's candidacy deadline and surprising a lot of political observers.\n\"Fifty years ago, my father, Maryland congressman Larry Hogan Sr., made a very tough decision. He became the first Republican to come out for the impeachment of President Nixon,\" Hogan said. \"He put aside party politics and his own personal considerations, and he stepped up to do the right thing for Maryland and the nation.\"\n\"Today, Washington is completely broken, because that kind of leadership, that kind of willingness to put country over party, has become far too rare,\" Hogan added.\nHogan joins the list of 20 candidates fighting for outgoing Sen. Ben Cardin's seat. Cardin, a Democrat, announced in May his plan to retire at the end of his current term.\nNotable Senate candidates include Democrats Angela Alsobrooks, Prince George's County executive, and Rep. David Trone, as well as Republicans Robin Ficker, a former member of the Maryland House of Delegates and a perennial candidate for various offices, and John Teichert, a retired Air Force brigadier general.\n\"The beauty of living in this great republic that I fought to defend for over three decades is that we give Americans a choice about who represents us in elected public office,\" Teichert said in a statement released Friday. \"Marylanders deserve to have a choice and I welcome anyone to the race who wants to offer them one.\"\nIf elected, Hogan would become Maryland's first Republican senator since Charles Mathias, who served in the Senate from 1969 to 1987.\n\"He's the only Republican in the state who stands a chance,\" Todd Eberly, associate professor of political science and public policy at St. Mary's College of Maryland, told Capital News Service.\n\"His chances depend on a couple of factors,\" said John Dedie, political science professor at the Community College of Baltimore County. \"First, if the Trone, Alsobrooks primary gets contested with nastiness and they can't make peace after the primary… that could help Hogan because maybe one side stays home and doesn't vote.\"\nAccording to Dedie, Hogan will have to focus on his accomplishments during his two terms as governor and his work with the Democrats. He may have to criticize Republicans, but then some of those voters may stay home, Dedie said.\nTrone said in a statement that Hogan's bid is an attempt to boost the agenda of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) and former President Donald Trump.\n\"Larry Hogan's candidacy is nothing but a desperate attempt to return Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump to power and give them the deciding vote to ban abortion nationwide, suppress votes across the country, and give massive tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans,\" Trone said in a statement.\nHogan has always said that he is pro-life, according to Dedie. On this year's ballot, Maryland voters will see a \"measure of basically codified abortion rights into the state constitution,\" which will affect Hogan's campaign, Dedie said.\nCardin believes that the Republican nominee for Senate will be in a tough battle against Democratic candidates Alsobrooks and Trone for the seat.\n\"Regardless of who is the Republican nominee, I am confident that Marylanders will keep our state in the blue column this November, holding the Senate as a bulwark against a dysfunctional and chaotic House of Representatives,\" Cardin said in a statement.\nAccording to Bloomberg, McConnell recruited Hogan.\n\"This is the best one in the sense that we are now competitive in a state nobody thought we could win. He's a proven winner,\" McConnell told Bloomberg.\nMaryland's primary election is May 14, giving Hogan just three months to campaign.\nSabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics slightly changed its rating for the Maryland Senate race after Hogan's announcement from \"Safe Democratic\" to \"Likely Democratic,\" a reflection of the former governor's immediate impact on the contest.\nIn Annapolis, one Republican lawmaker said he wouldn't count Hogan out.\n\"I certainly believe that Governor Hogan feels that he has a path to victory, or else he would not get into the race,\" said State Senate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey (R-Caroline, Cecil, Kent and Queen Anne's ). \"He certainly has a chance. He's proven that he can win in Maryland, on a statewide basis … He has found a way to map that out and believes that he can be successful.\"\nBut another fellow Republican asserted that running on the ticket with Trump would be no easy task for Hogan.\nHouse Minority Leader Jason Buckel, R-Allegany, told CNS that Hogan's announcement took him by surprise.\n\"It's going to be an uphill climb,\" Buckel said. \"He'll have to navigate being on the ticket with Donald Trump … and it will be a challenge for him.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He may have to criticize Republicans, but then some of those voters may stay home, Dedie said.\nTrone said in a statement that Hogan's bid is an attempt to boost the agenda of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) and former President Donald Trump.\n\"Larry Hogan's candidacy is nothing but a desperate attempt to return Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump to power and give them the deciding vote to ban abortion nationwide, suppress votes across the country, and give massive tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans,\" Trone said in a statement.\nHogan has always said that he is pro-life, according to Dedie. On this year's ballot, Maryland voters will see a \"measure of basically codified abortion rights into the state constitution,\" which will affect Hogan's campaign, Dedie said.\nCardin believes that the Republican nominee for Senate will be in a tough battle against Democratic candidates Alsobrooks and Trone for the seat.\n\"Regardless of who is the Republican nominee, I am confident that Marylanders will keep our state in the blue column this November, holding the Senate as a bulwark against a dysfunctional and chaotic House of Representatives,\" Cardin said in a statement.\nAccording to Bloomberg, McConnell recruited Hogan.\n\"This is the best one in the sense that we are now competitive in a state nobody thought we could win. He's a proven winner,\" McConnell told Bloomberg.\nMaryland's primary election is May 14, giving Hogan just three months to campaign.\nSabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics slightly changed its rating for the Maryland Senate race after Hogan's announcement from \"Safe Democratic\" to \"Likely Democratic,\" a reflection of the former governor's immediate impact on the contest.\nIn Annapolis, one Republican lawmaker said he wouldn't count Hogan out.\n\"I certainly believe that Governor Hogan feels that he has a path to victory, or else he would not get into the race,\" said State Senate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey (R-Caroline, Cecil, Kent and Queen Anne's ). \"He certainly has a chance. He's proven that he can win in Maryland, on a statewide basis … He has found a way to map that out and believes that he can be successful.\"\nBut another fellow Republican asserted that running on the ticket with Trump would be no easy task for Hogan.\nHouse Minority Leader Jason Buckel, R-Allegany, told CNS that Hogan's announcement took him by surprise.\n\"It's going to be an uphill climb,\" Buckel said. \"He'll have to navigate being on the ticket with Donald Trump … and it will be a challenge for him.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Think about the scene if Gaza were Chicago\n\n February 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RUSSELL VANDENBROUCKE | Section: Columns \n \n 744\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Might Americans make sense of Gaza if we compared it to our own experience? What if Gaza were Chicago, my childhood home?Each is home to more than two million people in a narrow strip along a shore. The sun rises over 28 miles of Lake Michigan and sets on Gaza's 30 miles of Mediterranean coast.\nCONTRASTI used to drink from Lake Michigan by opening a tap. Gazans face a challenge beyond their salty sea: Israel consolidated water control 50 years ago and requires an army permit to build new installations or infrastructure. Gazans consume less water daily than the World Health Organization recommends; Israelis use more.\nAfter my parents explained how Lake Michigan was too wide to gaze across, they promised to take me to the opposite shore, and they did. Palestinian families cannot answer the call of open water to a wider world as we did.\nInstead of beckoning Gazans toward the horizon, their sea is a barrier: Israel's \"maritime security blockade\" prevents them from sailing where winds and currents take them, and fishing is restricted too. Unlike the Port of Chicago linking the Midwest to the Atlantic through the St. Lawrence Seaway, Gaza has no shipping infrastructure, and Israel prohibits small boats from approaching: nine pro-Palestinian activists were killed in 2011 as their flotilla tried to aid Gaza.\nWhen my father parked his precious Pontiac beside an open field near O'Hare Airport, the cyclic drama of take-offs and landings offered free entertainment on a Sunday afternoon. Years before I became the first in our family to live this drama from inside a plane, I imagined myself aloft.\nPalestinians cannot do the same: Israel permits no airports in Gaza, the West Bank, or East Jerusalem, territories it first occupied in 1967.\nAs a boy, if I pretended to camp by pitching a tent in the backyard, I could sneak back to bed as soon as the dark sky and suburban wilds frightened me. In Gaza, where more than 70 percent of the homes have been destroyed, tents provide refuge from wind, rain and cold for dispossessed families, many of whom have fractured: UNICEF reports that at least 17,000 children are now unaccompanied or separated from their parents.\nImagine the psychic toll on children whose homes are bombed into rubble. When a quarry, three blocks from my childhood home, blasted the bedrock to mine the limestone, our walls shimmied. This irritated my mother, but we were never afraid or in danger; the plaster did not crack. What is the future for Gazans who suffer trauma daily when, research shows, violence harms the cognitive development of infants even before they can speak?\nAlthough I adore Chicago enough to be an unpaid ambassador, I know gang violence and drugs made its 2022 murder rate No. 28 in the U.S. The rate dipped 11 percent the next year, but 613 remains a huge number — and only half the scale of Hamas's indefensible massacre of 1,200 Israelis.\nThis tragedy, widely considered the worst Jews have suffering since the Holocaust, leads to a hunger for vengeance and Prime Minister Netanyahu's call for \"absolute victory\" and \"annihilation\" of Hamas. His rhetoric sounds like \"the ends justify the means\" wedded to \"by any means necessary.\"\nCollective punishment, long an instrument of Israeli \"justice,\" obliterates the distinction between combatants and non-combatants. More densely populated than Chicago, Gaza also has bigger families, as usual with poor societies compared to wealthy ones. Since 47 percent of its population is under 18, it follows inexorably that nearly half the 27,000 Gazans who have died in Palestine's current catastrophe, are children. Their numbers grows daily.\nPAYING FOR SLAUGHTERI pay no taxes to my hometown, but I must to my nation, which provides $3.3 billion in annual military aid to Israel, the world's 29th largest economy and its 10th biggest exporter of armaments. Congress is now considering $14 billion of supplemental military aid even as the Pentagon is \"not putting any limits on how Israel uses weapons,\" including the most destructive ones we provide for the slaughter, 500 and 2,000-pound bombs.\nAlas, they eerily echo the bellicose jingoism of our national anthem: \"the rocket's red glare, the bomb bursting in air.\" In the dawn's early light — and throughout the rest of the day and night too — I can see my hands stained by the blood of Gazans, especially its children.\nRussell Vandenbroucke recently retired as professor of theater and was the founding director of the Peace, Justice and Conflict Transformation Program at the University of Louisville. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Van Hollen, Democrats plan push for stronger policy protecting civilians from American weapons\n\n February 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TORRENCE BANKS Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 804\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Even though the White House has taken steps aimed at protecting civilians from American weapons in war zones, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) said Tuesday that he would press for a stronger response, especially in light of Israel's continued bombardment of Gaza.\"I fully support Israel's right, indeed its duty, to defend itself,\" the senator said in a statement. \"But while a war may be just, it must be fought justly. I cannot support a blank check for the Netanyahu government's current campaign in Gaza. The disregard for innocent civilian life and the mounting humanitarian catastrophe are too great to turn a blind eye.\"\nVan Hollen praised a national security memorandum issued last Friday by President Joe Biden in which he outlined U.S. policy on safeguarding civilians in places where American weapons and military equipment are used. Israel is not specifically mentioned in the memorandum.\n\"...As a matter of policy, the United States always seeks to promote adherence to international law and encourages other states and partners to do the same,\" the memorandum states. \"United States policy…is for executive departments and agencies to engage with foreign partners to share and learn best practices for reducing the likelihood of and responding to civilian casualties…\"\nThe memorandum was similar to an amendment Van Hollen announced with his colleagues on Feb. 7. It was not included in the national security supplemental spending bill passed yesterday.\nAccording to the memorandum, before receiving United States military aid, countries must confirm in writing that they will comply with international humanitarian law.\n\"This is a very big deal, and it will give President Biden and the United States more tools and more leverage to ensure… that U.S. military assistance, complies with American values and American interests,\" Van Hollen said during a press conference last Friday.\nCountries must also promise not to hinder the United States' ability to provide humanitarian assistance to conflict areas where American weapons are being used.\nAccording to the Associated Press, the number of Palestinians killed in the Israel-Hamas war, which began after the militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, surpassed 25,000 on Jan. 21.\nThe Van Hollen amendment had 18 sponsors, including Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Virginia), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon).\n\"This extreme level of civilian harm in Gaza is a moral failure, and now it is fueling an even wider conflict in the region,\" Warren said.\nVan Hollen said that he and his colleagues will work to turn the Biden policy into law, preventing future administrations from easily reversing it.\n\"It's been rolling a rock uphill,\" Warren said regarding making changes to United States military aid policy in the past. \"When it feels like the conflict is far away and nobody knows who the parties are and what's actually happening on the ground, it's hard to get Congress to move.\"\nMerkley and Van Hollen traveled to the Rafah border crossing from Gaza into the Sinai in early January and saw first-hand how the conflict and deplorable conditions created difficulty getting aid to the hospitals and warehouses in the region.\n\"These factors together have caused the seasoned humanitarian workers who have worked in the worst conflicts in the world to tell Chris and I, when we were at the Rafah gate, that they have never seen anything as bad as Gaza,\" Merkley said.\nThe Van Hollen amendment only applied to countries receiving military aid from the United States under the national security supplemental spending bill. The Biden memorandum now applies to all countries receiving United States military assistance, including Ukraine and Israel.\nKaine said that he and his colleagues got on a call with the White House about their amendment in December expecting more resistance. While there was some pushback, Kaine said that no one ever came up with any substantive reason to oppose the principles of the amendment.\n\"Human rights should not be separate from the American defense mission,\" Kaine said. \"And when we determined that it's in our interest to assist an ally, that ally should conduct itself in the way we would.\"\nDurbin made it clear that he and his colleagues support Israel's defense. However, he acknowledged that members of Hamas hiding among civilians in the area has helped create a \"humanitarian nightmare.\"\n\"We still need to demand and require realistic effective standards to reduce civilian harm,\" Durbin said.\nCountries currently engaged in war using United States weapons have 45 days to ensure that Biden receives the written assurances that they are adhering to international law. If those countries don't meet the deadline, then the United States will suspend their assistance.\nTo ensure that countries are complying with the best practices for reducing civilian harm, the State Department and the Defense Department must submit reports to Congress discussing weapons usage in areas of armed conflict.\nReports must be submitted within 90 days and include information on weapons usage dating back to Jan. 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Larry Hogan faces obstacles in Senate run\n\n February 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 752\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Larry Hogan's recently announced U.S. Senate campaign is off to a good start.Shortly after his announcement, a survey conducted by Emerson College Polling, The Hill and DC News Now showed Hogan tied with one possible strong Democratic opponent (David Trone), with 42% supporting each in a general election matchup and 16% undecided. The survey also showed Hogan leads in a general election matchup with another possible strong Democratic candidate (Angela Alsobrooks) 44% to 37%, with 19% undecided. The Republican primary survey results showed Hogan at 43%, undecided at 43% and none of the other candidates at more than 9%. All the survey results have a 3% plus or minus margin of error.\nRecently, one conservative candidate from Anne Arundel County withdrew from the Republican primary and endorsed Hogan.\nIn Larry Sabato's widely read and influential Political Crystal Ball, J. Miles Coleman wrote \"In response to Hogan's announcement, we downgraded our rating for Maryland from Safe Democratic to Likely Democratic.\" That news will energize and mobilize donors who had previously viewed a Democratic win as a given.\nGoing forward there are still at least three obstacles facing Hogan. All are formidable but none are insurmountable.\nThe first obstacle is Robin Ficker in the Republican primary. Ficker is aggressively appealing to Republican primary voters who may still be angry over some of Hogan's actions while serving as governor. Those actions include Hogan's unwavering support for COVID-19 lockdown mandates, moderate governing style, criticisms of Donald Trump and Trump supporters, and his refusal to support Dan Cox for governor after Cox defeated Hogan's endorsed candidate to succeed him in a GOP primary.\nTo conservative Republican primary voters considering Ficker, Hogan can remind them of a guiding principle of conservative of conservative icon William F. Buckley and often repeated by conservative icon Ronald Reagan — support the most conservative candidate … who can win.\nThe second obstacle is the Democratic candidate for November ramping up a messaging blitz (already launched by Trone and Alsobrooks) that was highly effective in the last midterm elections. That message is all Republican candidates are a grave threat to abortion rights and all are aligned with Donald Trump.\nTo all voters with concerns over the future of abortion rights, Hogan can remind them he is on record saying that as a senator, he will not vote for a national abortion ban. He can also tell them he will respect the outcome of a statewide referendum in Maryland on an amendment adding the right to an abortion to the state constitution.\nThe third obstacle is all of Hogan's opponents in the primary and general elections reminding voters about all the reasons Hogan gave when he was strongly encouraged but declined to run against incumbent U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen.\nTo all voters concerned about those reasons, Hogan can remind them the public record includes the reasons why he is running now. In reviewing that record it is clear Hogan mentioned: \"I said I wasn't going to walk away from politics, I was going to try to be a voice, standing up to try to fix things, and you can't just sit back and complain about things if you're not willing to try to make a difference.\"\nHogan can say his willingness \"to try to make a difference\" reflects his acceptance of the call to action in Teddy Roosevelt's Man in the Arena speech:\nIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.\nIt will be most interesting to see what Larry Hogan's 2024 campaign strategy and messages will be.\nMore interesting will be if his messages in this election cycle will resonate with a majority of Maryland voters just as his Change Maryland message did when he was elected governor.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Maryland) isn't quite ready to say goodbye yet, despite announcing his retirement after 40 years in public office.\n\"I'm not happy and I don't want to leave, but I got five grandchildren,\" Ruppersberger, who turned 78 in January, said in an interview with Capital News Service in his memento-filled office with a view of the United States Capitol.\nRuppersberger's political career started in Baltimore, where he was elected to the Baltimore County Council in the 1980s. In 1994 and 1998 he was elected Baltimore County executive.\nHis time in Congress began in 2002 when he was elected to represent Maryland's Second District.\nOriginally he wanted to run for governor, not Congress, Ruppersberger said. But he decided that if he could get on the House Intelligence Committee he would run for the House.\nThe avuncular Ruppersberger credits much of his political success to his teamwork and his bipartisanship. A good team is necessary to take care of constituents, he said.\n\"I was very bipartisan,\" Ruppersberger said. \"And you have to be when you're county executive, local government. You have to be bipartisan, you work on all sorts, from business to people who are on welfare. There's so many issues.\"\nRuppersberger's district is made up of large parts of Baltimore and Carroll Counties and a part of Baltimore City. He is in his 11th term in the House.\n\"You have to go out and see the people,\" Ruppersberger said. \"You can't sit in an office and think you're gonna get elected. You have to have people on your team who will go out every day and represent you in the community.\nRuppersberger was motivated to get involved in politics after a major car crash he was involved in when he was 28. He was left with 15 broken bones and was in bad shape. He credits the Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland for saving his life. Dr. R. Adams Cowley, who founded the trauma center, encouraged Ruppersberger to run for office.\nRuppersberger has supported trauma centers extensively throughout his career and serves as vice chairman of Shock Trauma's Board of Visitors.\n\"I know I had brain damage or I wouldn't be in politics,\" Ruppersberger joked.\nDuring his time in Congress, Ruppersberger has worked on several successful projects.\nOne that stands out is the Hero Miles program, which donates airline tickets to members of the armed forces. Ruppersberger said he noticed that when troops overseas were flown back to the United States they were only taken to a few airports, then would have to pay for their connecting flights home. He fought for this to change and to have Hero Miles put in place in 2003.\nRuppersberger did end up serving on the House Intelligence Committee, where he spent 12 years. In 2011, he was named the ranking member of the committee. The post qualified him as a member of the so-called \"gang of eight,\" a group of House and Senate lawmakers privy to classified briefings on the country's top-secret intelligence activities.\n\"I like the action,\" Ruppersberger said. \"I like being able to make a difference, which you can in the gang of eight, and I like working with bipartisan people... It was the first time that the House and the Senate, really the gang of eight, came together and worked for the country. And I really, really liked that.\"\nWhile on the intelligence panel, Ruppersberger traveled around the world to countries including Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan and China.\nAlong with the then-committee chairman, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Alabama, he became the first dual recipient of the William Oliver Baker Award from the nonpartisan Intelligence and National Security Alliance for their bipartisanship.\n\"We told people that whether you're Democrat and Republican, whether you're the majority or minority, we're going to run this as a team,\" Ruppersberger said. \"And we're not fooling around, we're gonna get a lot done. And if you don't do that, we're going to ask that you leave the committee.\"\nSince 2015, Ruppersberger has served on the House Appropriations Committee, where he specializes in national security. The committee allocates billions of federal dollars every year and is powerful because it has the final say on spending. Ruppersberger said that the position has allowed him to allocate money for Maryland and his district while also working on national issues.\nRuppersberger refers to himself as an \"action guy,\" which is why he's going to have a hard time retiring, he said.\nHe said he plans to continue working on projects and causes he is working on now even after he leaves office.\nWhat made the decision to retire even harder was the current state of Congress, which he said was enduring \"some of the worst times\" he's ever seen.\n\"I think Congress itself is not doing what they need to do,\" he said. \"You know you're always gonna have a majority, minority, and the majority is gonna get more than the minority. But right now, what's happening with the Republicans, basically they agree on something and then they disagree…and it's just not right. I'd like people to reach out to both sides of the aisle.\"\nThree of Maryland's eight House seats are open this election cycle. In addition to Ruppersberger, Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes, who represents Maryland's Third District, also is retiring. And Democratic Rep. David Trone is leaving Maryland's Sixth District seat to run for the Senate.\nRuppersberger said that the next generation of lawmakers must work together, which he will emphasize to the candidate who will take over his spot. He has already endorsed Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski, who is running in a contested Second District Democratic primary to succeed Ruppersberger, and Trone in his bid for the Senate.\nRuppersberger believes there is a \"very good possibility\" that Democrats will gain the majority in the House in the November elections. The Republicans currently hold a thin 219-213 advantage in the House.\n\"The Republicans couldn't even elect a speaker, it took them six people,\" Ruppersberger said. \"They keep changing their minds. You need strong leadership and somebody who can stand up to your own party. You got to lead.\"\nDemocrats are doing a good job at talking about what could make a difference to help and support people, Ruppersberger said. A lot of people are hurting in this country, he added.\nPassing bills such as providing funding for Ukraine and Israel will hold the nation together and make it stronger, he said.\n\"I have 10 more months here and I plan on doing what I've always been doing,\" Ruppersberger said. \"Doing the best I can…And I'm not happy about leaving, I'm sad.\"\n\"...Life will take care of itself,\" the congressman said. \"I have a lot of experience and a lot of friends so, in the end, I'll be fine. I just need some time not to be sad about leaving this. It's been my life for a long time.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A plea for aid to Ukraine from a World War II refugee\n\n March 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RITA ZELTINS HEACOCK | Section: Columns \n \n 972\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I write this history of my family's escape from the horror of life under the Russians during the early 1940s because I feel deeply that Ukraine under the Russians would be tragic. My story begins when I was a little girl in Latvia.It must have been a traumatic experience in 1944 for my parents, Janis (John) Zeltins, 38, and Alma Asaris Zeltins, 36, to pack what they could carry and with four children, Zigrida Emilija, 12; Rita Olga, 9; Eriks, 5; and Benita Lidija, 1, in tow, to start a journey with destination unknown from their native country, Latvia. It is truly said that the fear of the unknown is really great, but in this case, the fear of the known was greater than the fear of the unknown.\nTo fully understand this what might seem like a \"foolhardy\" decision, some background is in order.\nAt that time Latvia suffered under communist dictator Stalin's ruthless domination. Our father being a Baptist minister was scrutinized as to his activities and reported to the Russian government during their occupation. Many people during this time mysteriously vanished, especially people with influence such as teachers, clergy and other community leaders. Some were killed outright but many were deported to Siberia for hard labor.\nFamilies were sometimes separated; children were taken from their parents for indoctrination into the Russian dogma. Our family had been on the list to be deported but fortunately we were able to escape this fate. As a matter of fact, knowing what occupation under the Russian regime was like, one million (half of Latvia's inhabitants) left the country. To this day, you can find Latvians in every part of the world as a result of World War II and the Russian occupation.\nMy family was very fortunate to be able to board a train heading toward Germany. Since we were not Jews, Germany was relatively safe for us, although trains were a risky form of transportation during a war. They were used to transport supplies and troops to the fighting armies, so we were in danger of being bombed by both the Russian and American air forces.\nWhen airplanes were detected, the train was stopped, all got off and laid in ditches or fields in case the train was bombed. If we happened to be near or in a potato field, we'd be assured of dinner. So we continued until we reached Germany. Germany was inundated with refugees from every country bordering Russia. It was a mass exodus.\nWe traveled, by whatever means possible, farther and farther west. At one point, we were put up at a large well-to-do farm that needed farm hands since all the able-bodied German men were serving in their army. Now our father had steady work and ample food for the family. Our mother was able to work in the garden as well. We had a small apartment on top of the animal barn. The heat generated by the animals and feather down blankets kept us warm.\nThe end of the war came suddenly. One day, the American army arrived at the edge of the village, and before entering, they discharged some tank artillery down the street to see if anyone would shoot back. None did.\nThe American troops peacefully occupied the village by slowly passing through the street in their tanks. People cautiously came out of their houses and greeted the Americans. We were happy and finally felt safe.\nThe hope was that we'd be able to go back home soon. That hope was short lived. It seemed that Germany was to be divided among the Allies and whatever else was occupied by Russians would become status quo. That meant that Latvia would remain under Russian domination and the area where we were in Germany would become part of the Russian zone. Our journey, once again, had to continue toward the unknown, as far away from the Russians as possible.\nThis turned into a trek by foot on the German autobahn, dragging our belongings in a small farm wagon, with Benita and Eriks perched atop our \"riches.\" While our parents pulled the wagon, Rita and Zigrida trailed behind. We shared the autobahn with the American troops as they moved west toward what was to be the American zone of Germany. So, if we were going in the same direction as the Americans, we should end up in the same place.\nWhen the American troops saw the sight of us walking, some of them generously threw some oranges and chocolate bars to us. I remember that sometimes we also got rides in American army trucks or jeeps. So we continued until we arrived in Hanau, a city near Frankfurt which was definitely in the American zone of Germany. So we sighed a sigh of relief that we had arrived at a safe place.\nHousing for displaced people in Germany was the next step in our lives, and from there my family was fortunate to be welcomed into a small town in Pennsylvania where my parents found work and eventually were able to send my sisters, brother and me to college.\nHow different our lives were in America than had we lived under communist rule.\nAs I think about Russia's invasion of Ukraine I am reminded of the reason my parents chose to endure a very risky journey to the unknown in order to escape Communism. Should Ukraine fall to the Russians will Latvia again in the future suffer its cruel repression? What about Poland and other neighboring countries? The Ukrainians are fighting valiantly to remain free of the evil Russian control. The United States must fund their effort.\nRita Zeltins Heacock lives in Easton. March 3 is the anniversary of her family's arrival in America. Of her flight from Latvia, Heacock says: \"It was a traumatic time, to say the least. It is a miracle that we survived. God looked after us.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

A line in the video, spoken by a behavioral therapist as I recall, was, \"If you always do what you've always done you'll always get what you've always gotten.\"\nI've never forgotten that statement because, in simple truth, it means that there must be consequences for all actions. Positive consequences to poor behavior, if repeated, need to change in order for the poor behavior to change.\nMr. Donald Trump, one of the established candidates for the office of POTUS at the age of 77, is just beginning to realize negative consequences for a lifetime of poor and self-serving behaviors. Is it too late to change this man's behavior? I think it is. Is it too late for voters to see the consequences for our country and the citizens who call the USA home if Mr. Trump is elected for another term? I think not.\nI do know that our democratic republic and all of the cultural and social gains we've made on this continent over the last 200 years, will be lost if this neurotic egotist becomes president again.\nVICKI SPARKS\nFishing Creek \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The entire continental U.S. will be able to view the event with parts of 13 states from Texas to Maine able to see the moon completely block out the sun for 3 to 4 minutes.It will be the second largest total solar eclipse in the U.S. since 1806\nAll the travel, spending and social media activity could also cause some issues.\nDestination Mansfield, an Ohio tourism group, has put together a list of eclipse tips in addition to wearing protective eclipse glasses.\nThose tips include being prepared for overloaded internet networks, traffic congestion at popular viewing spots and having some cash in case payment networks are overwhelmed or disrupted. The group recommends filling up cars with gas and stocking up on food and other staple items just in case.\nMany schools, especially in the eclipse path will also also be closed April 8.\nPolice, fire departments and hospitals could also see increased volumes.\nThere will be livestreams of the event broadcasted online by NASA (nasa.gov), the Exploratorium museum in San Francisco (www.exploratorium.edu/eclipse) and TimeandDate.com (https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2024-april-8). \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Game-time decision': Clouds, storms could dim eclipse viewing in some parts of U.S.\n\n April 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: National \n \n 633\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Cloudy skies and stormy weather could dampen viewing of Monday's total solar eclipse in some parts of the U.S.That includes regions of the country that are part of the April 8 eclipse's path of totality where the moon will completely darken the sun for as much as four minutes.\nThe totality path stretches from Texas and Arkansas through parts of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio and into upstate New York and New England.\nMore than 4 million people are expected to travel for the eclipse — which is the largest such event in the U.S. since 1806.\nMonday's eclipse will be visible to varying degrees across the U.S.\nBut some areas in the path of totality and other parts of the country may have their eclipse viewing dimmed by cloudy, overcast and stormy skies during the moon's two-hour journey across the sun.\n\"Unfortunately, the weather isn't panning out. It won't be favorable in some of these areas,\" said Brandon Buckingham, a meteorologist for AccuWeather.\nBuckingham said parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas — which are attracting scores of eclipse viewers because of their propensity for clearer skies — might see clouds and storms during the eclipse.\nAreas of northern Ohio in the eclipse path are also expecting surges of visitors. They could also see some cloudy conditions.\n\"It's kind of a blend of clouds and sun,\" said Buckingham of the Monday forecast for northern Ohio.\nStill, the eclipse could be visible through cloudy conditions depending on the types of clouds as well as their prevalence and depth.\nThe weather dynamics would send eclipse tourists and the scores of astronomers and researchers driving to destinations with clearer skies. That could add to the already expected traffic congestion dynamics expected on Monday.\nBuckingham, who is based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, plans on driving to view the eclipse. He's still figuring out the best place to view the solar eclipse in its totality.\n\"It's one of those game-time decisions,\" he said.\nBEST PLACES TO VIEW\nMarc Chenard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the eclipse forecast is still developing. There's a cold front moving eastward across the U.S. and storms and clouds being fostered in the Gulf of Mexico that will head west.\n\"Right now, it's still a bit uncertain,\" Chenard said, of where, when and how many clouds might be in the skies during the afternoon eclipse.\nHe said the most clear areas to view the eclipse in the totality path could be in northern parts of Arkansas, southeastern Missouri, southern Illinois and southern Indiana.\nHe said parts of New England and Canada could also be clear, but the eclipse viewing in places such as Ohio could depend on the amount and depth of cloud cover.\nMid-Atlantic areas could see a mix bag for viewing with partly cloudy conditions forecasted for Easton, Ocean City and other parts of the Eastern Shore for Monday — the day of the eclipse.\nChenard said areas in Texas could also be \"a game-time decision\" in terms of eclipse visibility with clear skies expected in western areas of the state and more cloudy weather and storms to the east.\n\"It really could go either way,\" said Chenard, who will be visiting Texas for the eclipse.\nIn other parts of the U.S, the moon will partially block out the sun Monday afternoon.\nBuckingham said Southern California as well as central parts of the state and the Southwest could have good viewing weather while parts of the Mountain West (including Montana and Wyoming) and upper Midwest could see overcast conditions.\nGulf coast areas of Louisiana and Mississippi could see rain and clouds while the big cities of east coast such as New York, Boston and Washington D.C. could see some clouds generally decent eclipse viewing weather\nChenard said the Central Plains, Texas and Oklahoma panhandles along with Georgia and Florida can expect clear skies for the celestial event.\n\"The Southeast looks pretty good,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'And the sun was darkened': Eclipse sparking theories on signs of the Apocalypse, 'End Times'\n\n April 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: National \n \n 857\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n More than 4 million people — including teams of astronomers and researchers — are expected to travel to parts of the U.S. that will see the moon completely block out the sun during the total solar eclipse Monday, April 8.That path of totality stretches from Texas to New England and includes parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Ohio and New York.\nMillions more will watch partial versions of eclipse across the country donning protective glasses at local events and outside their homes, schools and workplaces.\nThe celestial event will be visible across the continental U.S. It's the biggest eclipse in America since 1806 — and there won't be another one until 2044.\nBut others are looking to the heavens for other reasons.\nA quick scan of social media shows a keen and ramped up interest in the eclipse on the spiritual, astrological and metaphysical levels.\nThat also includes plenty of conjecture and postulation to whether the moon darkening of the sun will bring with it some kind of cosmic event or spiritual upheaval. The curiosities extend to clues or indicators of biblical End Times or other prophecies — including the Rapture, Tribulation and Judgment Day referenced in the Book of Revelation.\nSpiritual interests in eclipses are not new, according to theologians.\n\"Throughout human history people have tried to explain and get a degree of control over things that make us feel very small and out of control,\" said Erik Thoennes, a professor of theology at Biola University, a private Evangelical college near Los Angeles.\n\"Cataclysmic events like an eclipse are awesome and can be scary to people, so all cultures have tried to interpret events like this through religious and spiritual lenses,\" he said.\nEvents like the April 8 eclipse have spiritual significance across cultures and faiths. Chinese folklore recommends banging pots and pans or making other noises to make an eclipse — which symbolizes a dragon eating the sun — go away. \"It has never failed,\" Thoennes joked.\nThe focus on events such as a total eclipse and its potential \"End of Days\" and Armageddon scenarios are especially prevalent among some Christians.\nThoennes said there are nine references in the Bible of the darkening of the sun with ties to \"divine judgment.\" That includes when Jesus died on the cross on Good Friday. \"And the sun was darkened\" reads the Gospel of Luke's account of the crucifixion.\n\"Unlike some religions that have a cyclical view of time, the biblical view is linear and is heading to a day when God brings his kingdom once and for all and judges people for how we lived our lives, especially in relation to Him,\" Thoennes said.\n\"The end of human history on Judgment Day is described in the Bible with dramatic and apocalyptic imagery which includes awesome effects on the natural order. These events include the sun going dark which is why people think about these end time events when there is an eclipse,\" he said, stressing the importance of enjoying the eclipse as a wonder of creation.\nDave Robbins, vice president of content for End Time Ministries (a Texas-based Pentecostal group), does not expect anything spiritual will happen \"during or after the eclipse\", pointing to Old Testament scripture saying \"be not dismayed at the signs of heaven.\"\n\"The Bible does say there will be signs in the sky, but we are not to use them to predict future events,\" Robbins said.\nRAPTURE, ROCKETS & WEDDINGS\nBut that is not stopping plenty of others from trying to read the tea leaves and connect the spiritual or metaphysical dots related to the eclipse.\nThe war in the Holy Land between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is helping stoke some of that interest in the Second Coming and prophecies across the Abrahamic faiths.\nSocial media theories focus on the April 8 eclipse and previous Oct. 2023 eclipse both crossing in an area of southern Illinois named Rapture.\nThere is also plenty of interest in the restarting of the Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator operated by the European Council for Nuclear Research (CERN) on eclipse day.\nNASA is also launching three sounding rockets from Wallops Island on Virginia's Eastern Shore on April 8 \"to study how Earth's upper atmosphere is affected when sunlight momentarily dims over a portion of the planet,\" according to the U.S. space agency.\nThe three rockets will be launched in 45 minute intervals before, during and after the eclipse and follow up on similar launches during an eclipse in October 2023.\nAstrologers are also zeroing in on the eclipse along with other planetary events tying them to current and expected world events. A number of astrologers and End Times prognosticators did not respond to requests for comment about what they are expecting for the eclipse.\nOthers are taking the plunge — literally on eclipse day.\nThe Total Eclipse of the Heart Music Festival in Russellville, Arkansas is in the path of totality for the eclipse that cuts across North America.\nThe music fest is hosting a mass wedding on April 8 along with other events including a worship service on Sunday.\nEvent organizer Rodney Williams said there will be approximately 5,000 people at the three-day festival and 331 couples have signed for the free Elope at the Eclipse event.\n\"We have a lot going on,\" Williams said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Larry Hogan spent a day on the Mid-Shore Friday, as his \"Back to Work\" bus tour came through Queen Anne's, Caroline and Talbot counties.Hogan made nine stops in the three counties, appealing to local voters in what has become a closely watched race for Maryland's open U.S. Senate seat.\nDuring a stop at Easton-based engineering firm Rauch Inc.'s 40th anniversary celebration, Hogan said his campaign had made over 70 stops throughout the state since the bus tour began this month.\nHogan, a Republican, announced his candidacy for the office in early February. A rare two-term Republican governor in Maryland, where the majority of voters are registered Democrats, Hogan said he is hoping to appeal to voters who are disenfranchised with partisan politics.\n\"A lot of people are frustrated that nothing ever seems to get done in Washington, and so I think they think I got a lot done while I was governor,\" he said. \"They think that there's too much divisiveness, and dysfunction and gridlock, but people are concerned about the economy, they're concerned about crime, they're concerned about securing the border and fixing our broken immigration system… They think that a lot of the loudest, angriest voices get all the attention, and I think they'd rather send some straight-talking, common-sense leader to try to see if they can't clean up the mess.\"\nHogan is just the latest Senate candidate to make his way to the Eastern Shore. His stiffest competition for the Senate seat, Democratic frontrunners David Trone and Angela Alsobrooks, have also made visits to Mid-Shore counties in recent months.\nTrone, who has served as a U.S. representative for Maryland's 6th Congressional District since 2019, visited Easton last week. He took a walking tour of downtown businesses led by the Easton Economic Development Corporation on April 4, according to a post by his campaign on X, formerly called Twitter. The following day, Trone posted photos from a meeting with the Talbot Democratic Women's Club.\nOn Feb. 25, Alsobrooks spoke at a meet-and-greet event hosted by the Democratic Club of Kent County at Minary's Dream Alliance in Chestertown, where she appealed to voters by emphasizing her willingness to work across the aisle and her track record of \"holding (her) own\" in politics.\nAlsobrooks served two terms as state's attorney for Prince George's County.\nAs Democrats fight to maintain their slim majority in the U.S. senate, Hogan's popularity in Maryland has raised GOP hopes of winning what has long been considered a solidly blue seat, making Maryland's Senate race one of unexpected national significance.\nRecent polling shows Hogan in a dead-heat with Alsobrooks and Trone. Results from a Goucher College and Baltimore Banner poll released last week show 44% of respondents backing Hogan and 40% backing Alsobrooks in a November matchup. In a matchup between Hogan and Trone, 43% said they backed Hogan, and 42% backed Trone. About 10% were undecided in both races, according to the poll, which has a 3.5 margin of error.\nAlsobrooks and Trone, along with eight other Democratic candidates, will face off in the May 14 primary for the seat. Hogan will face six other Republicans on May 14.\nThe winners of the primaries will face off in the November general election.\nReporter Maggie Trovato contributed to this article. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland Starbucks unionizes days before a Supreme Court case on labor rights\n\n April 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MATHEW J. SCHUMER Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 752\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ELLICOTT CITY — Workers at the Shipley's Grant Starbucks cafe voted to unionize this week, just days ahead of a Supreme Court case involving the company's challenge of a federal labor injunction.\"I started working here two and a half years ago, and as soon as I got here, I knew something had to change,\" said Noah Smith, a shift supervisor at the Shipley's Grant shop, which voted 21-2 on Thursday afternoon to unionize. Smith was one of the first three workers at the store to speak with Workers United about organizing the staff.\nDwindling hours coupled with increasing traction of unionization of Starbucks workers across the nation influenced Smith and his coworkers to initiate a union petition, which they filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on March 19.\nData compiled by UnionElections.org shows that 9,270 Starbucks employees are covered by a union — accounting for a bit less than three percent of the company's total workforce.\nThe Shipley's Grant location became the ninth Starbucks cafe in Maryland to unionize. Staff at more stores in the state are expected to go public with unionization efforts in the coming months.\nWorkers at a Starbucks location in Buffalo, New York, made history as the first unionized store in the company when they voted to organize with Workers United in 2021. Over 400 Starbucks locations have unionized since then, spanning 43 states and the District of Columbia.\nIn early 2023, corporate-level decisions led to reduced hours among the workers at the Shipley's Grant cafe. While full-time employees saw only marginal schedule changes, part-timers came face-to-face with the possibility of losing health care benefits and access to free education — both offered to staff members working a minimum of 20 to 22 hours a week.\nThe team of 27 employees has a tough time ensuring every staff member works enough throughout the week to receive benefits, according to Smith. He added that workers often need to pick up shifts at other stores to meet the quota.\nSmith said that one of the primary goals of unionizing was to establish a dialogue with the corporate leaders at Starbucks, setting clear guidelines about minimum working hours and clearer expectations for employees.\nAnother focal point of the unionization effort is to create a more inclusive work environment at the cafe. Smith shared a story about a recent directive from the store's district manager to remove a Progress Pride Flag the workers had hung up in the store.\nSince the staff went public with its petition to unionize, Smith said that Starbucks management also began enforcing a dress policy prohibiting workers from wearing union t-shirts on the clock.\nStarbucks did not respond to a request for comment.\nAt other locations, the company has taken more serious action against union promotion, going as far as firing pro-union employees at several stores, NLRB judges have ruled.\nIn total, the NLRB has taken legal action in more than 700 unfair labor practice cases leveled against Starbucks by employees — the majority of which were filed in the last couple of years.\nStarbucks Corp. most recently lost an appeal in the District of Columbia Circuit Court in which the company challenged an NLRB ruling to stop interfering with workers' unionization efforts at a Seattle location.\nThe Supreme Court case involves a suit by Starbucks against the NLRB involving company actions against workers at a store in Memphis, Tennessee, in 2022, including the firing of seven employees for allegedly associating with the Workers United union.\nIn October 2023, Starbucks filed a petition for the case to be heard by the Supreme Court, which was granted in January. The question presented by the company to the court is whether NLRB injunctions should be subject to the same standards in all jurisdictions.\nAs it stands, injunctions filed by the board are evaluated by courts in some jurisdictions using a two-factor test, whereas other jurisdictions use a four-factor test to determine if they are warranted. An affirmative decision in this case would establish the four-factor test in all jurisdictions.\nBoth parties presented their arguments to the court on Tuesday.\nStarbucks and Workers United announced in February that collective bargaining negotiations would begin in the near future. Discussions are scheduled to begin towards the end of this month.\nOnce the Shipley's Grant vote is certified by the NLRB, the cafe's staff will join nationwide bargaining discussions affecting unionized Starbucks workers across the United States.\n\"I'm not going to be here forever, but the next people that come behind me, I want them to have a store that's safe and inclusive and open and with them,\" said Smith. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Marylanders have saved $8.3 million on monthly internet bills statewide, according to the White House.\nThe Biden administration is pushing Congress to support an extension of the broadband program.\nPresident Joe Biden last October requested an additional $6 billion in funding for the program.\nLast month, he made public appeals for support in tweets.\n\"During the pandemic, we saw just how essential high-speed internet really was — from telemedicine, online school, and small business e-commerce to the ability of millions to work remotely and connect with one another when it wasn't safe to gather,\" Biden said.\n\"It's past time Republicans in Congress joined their Democratic colleagues and worked to pass funding for this essential program.\"\nA bipartisan effort by 17 senators to amend the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill to include $6 billion for the internet program failed Thursday. Senate leaders resisted efforts to include the program and other non-aviation-related amendments in the FAA measure.\n\"Congress must take action to save the ACP to lower costs for American families, boost the economy, and promote job creation and economic mobility,\" Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-New Mexico, said in a statement. He was the sponsor of the amendment.\nIn the House, 122 Democrats and Republicans on Thursday wrote a letter to congressional leaders urging action to preserve the discount internet program.\n\"While certain bipartisan reforms to the program are necessary to improve efficiency and effectiveness, it is the most vulnerable families across the nation that will bear the burden of our inaction if funding lapses,\" the lawmakers warned.\nThe program offers internet discounts of up to $30 a month for qualifying households and up to $75 a month for homes on tribal lands, according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Also available is a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating internet service providers under conditions.\nA Baltimore-based Twitter/X user under the pseudonym\"Fearturnip\" tweeted in January about the program's pending expiration, saying, \"Not only is the national Affordable Connectivity Program tanking in April, the Maryland Broadband Benefit is also ending.\"\n\"I guess we're back to 'normal,' where the digital divide ravages America.\"\nOver 23 million households nationwide have benefitted from the program, according to the software company WhistleOut, with most of the program's beneficiaries being low-income, veterans, minorities, and seniors.\nMore than 77% of discount internet program users said losing their benefits would force them to change their internet plan or drop internet service entirely, according to an FCC survey last year.\nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, met with St. Mary's County leaders and county stakeholders last month to discuss his plans for keeping the internet accessible to low-income households and securing funding for the internet program.\nHoyer said he is committed to \"narrowing the digital divide\" and enabling everyone in Maryland's 5th District with internet access, according to the Lexington Park (Maryland) Leader.\n\"The Affordable Connectivity Program has transformed St. Mary's County and communities across the country,\" Hoyer said. \"Education, health care, and our economy rely on America's workers, students, seniors, and families being connected to the internet.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Emotional hearsay\n\n June 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 358\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In reading Ms. Robertson's Letter to the Editor in the May 26 edition, I initially viewed it as one person expressing an opinion which is fully within her rights to do so. However, as I reflected further on it, there were at least two major flaws in her comments.The first was accepting the media's out of context and its widespread distribution of reporting (deliberately or not) on former President Trump's response to a question on becoming a dictator if elected. The second was her assuming the accuracy of the media and others making that erroneous interpretation and then applying it to her assertion that anyone \"wanting to be a dictator for even a day (Trump's words not mine) has no place in this country as a citizen, let alone president.\" One can only challenge the extent to which any research was involved in supporting her opinion as expressed in that letter\nIn searching Politifact, (not known for its support of former President Trump), it references that interview between Sean Hannity and the former president wherein the question of his allegedly wanting to be a dictator emerged. The former president's response as reported in Politifact was \"No, No, No, other than day one we are closing the Border and we are drilling, drilling, drilling. After that I am not a dictator, OK.\"\nThat second flaw also highlights her avoiding any mention of the executive orders issued by President Biden, early in his term of office which opened the border to all and stopped the drilling. Obviously, both those actions have evidenced many negative consequences for the citizens of this country irrespective of political affiliation and presidential preference and was the basis for the former president's remarks. Therefore, I am puzzled by the illogic of some that the current president's actions had simply been accepted as a legitimate executive order despite the economic damage it has created while another candidate, if successful in the upcoming election, is being criticized as a dictator for considering that same approach in correcting it.\nI pray that the results of the upcoming election in November will be based on informed reason rather than emotional hearsay.\nTOM McLOUGHLIN\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Election 2024: It ain't over until it's over\n\n July 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Columns \n \n 793\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n We live in a VUCA world, a world characterized by increasingly high levels of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity.In such a world, I suggest a guiding principle when offering observations on campaigns and elections.\nIt is: In every election cycle anything can happen with any candidate or any campaign at any time until the votes are cast, counted and certified.\nBaseball great Yogi Berra said it more succinctly when he said this about every game of baseball: \"It ain't over till it's over.\"\nI think about that every time I read or hear political pundits and others opine with campaign and election predictions.\nAfter a debate where President Biden performed very poorly, countless pundits have said or written it is just a matter of time until Biden voluntarily withdraws from a reelection race (currently not likely), is denied his party's nomination (also currently not likely) or loses a grudge rematch with former President Trump (currently likely but certainly not a given).\nFor a perspective on all this, I suggest a review of the 1968 presidential election cycle.\nThe political environment then compared to today is strikingly familiar.\nThen as now:\nVoters were and are deeply divided along generational, income, racial and ideological lines.Crime and lawless behavior were and are at epidemic levels in urban areas, suburban areas and rural areas across America.\nProtests were and are occurring on college campuses over American foreign policy decisions.\nInflation rates were and are up due to government spending on domestic and foreign policies.Concerns were and are being raised daily on the incumbent president's health and his ability to serve another full term.\nDespite all of the above, conventional wisdom early in 1968 was incumbent Democratic President Lyndon Johnson would run for re-election.\nIn March 1968, LBJ shocked the political world, ending a nationally televised address with: \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\"\nFollowing that speech, expectations were that Robert F. Kennedy, the U.S. senator from New York and heir apparent of the Kennedy legacy in American politics would secure the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. His assassination immediately following his declaring victory in the California Democratic primary in June put a tragic end to that scenario.\nUltimately, under Democratic Party presidential nomination rules in place at the time (no longer in place) the leaders and power brokers in the Democratic Party convinced Democratic National Convention delegates to nominate Hubert Humphrey as their presidential candidate. Humphrey was Johnson's loyal (some say subservient) vice president.\nConventional wisdom was Humphrey was the best candidate to keep the historic New Deal coalition in place that since 1932, had elected Democratic presidential candidates Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson.\nConventional wisdom was also that Richard Nixon would not win the Republican nomination given the fact that Republican New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and Republican California Gov. Ronald Reagan were challenging him. Nixon had already lost to John F. Kennedy in a close presidential election in 1960 and lost in a race for California governor in 1962.\nDespite those two losses and despite being a very polarizing figure in American politics long before Watergate, Nixon won the Republican presidential nomination.\nFollowing a chaotic Democratic Party convention in Chicago, expectations were that Humphrey would lose to Nixon based in part on an assumption that George Wallace's aggressive third-party presidential bid would draw traditional Democratic party voters away from Humphrey.\nSurveys from August through late October seemed to confirm that outcome. In all those polls, Humphrey trailed Nixon. Some pollsters predicted a margin of victory for Nixon as high as 16%.\nIn October, everything changed. George Wallace's third-party campaign was faltering. LBJ suspended bombing in the Vietnam War and announced the possibility of peace talks that could end the long and increasingly unpopular war. Humphrey decided to distance himself from LBJ by branding himself as Hubert Humphrey, not as Vice President Humphrey.\nAs a result, just before Election Day, pollsters concluded the race between Humphrey and Nixon was a tossup.\nThose conclusions were validated when Nixon secured a close victory in the popular vote with just over 500,000 votes (0.7%) separating him and Humphrey.\nSome have suggested had the election been held two weeks later Humphrey could have won. What is known is that had Humphrey not narrowly lost the popular votes in California, Ohio and Illinois, he would have won both the popular vote and the vote in the Electoral College.\nJust as in the 1968 presidential election cycle, a lot can and will occur between now and November 2024.\nI suggest supporters of President Biden, supporters of former President Trump and supporters of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. do this — acknowledge and embrace the timeless wisdom of Yogi Berra — \"It ain't over till it's over.\"\nDavid Reel is a public relations and public affairs consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Larry Hogan, whom she is running against in the November general election to fill retiring Sen. Ben Cardin's (D-Md.) seat.\nAs Democrats fight to maintain their slim Senate majority, Hogan's popularity in Maryland has raised GOP hopes of winning what has long been considered a solidly blue seat. This has made Maryland's Senate race one of unexpected national significance.\n\"I like Larry Hogan,\" she said. \"I worked with him as county executive when he was governor.\"\nBut Alsobrooks said the race \"is so much bigger than Larry Hogan. It is about the 51st vote, and we know what the 51st vote really controls in our country.\"\nAlsobrooks said the political party in power in the Senate controls the agenda, and there are two \"very different views\" on what that agenda should be. She said the Senate majority vote will determine who is on the Supreme Court.\nDuring her speech, Alsobrooks mentioned a variety of issues. She talked about the importance of protecting reproductive rights, making sure there is a fair tax structure in place and preserving Social Security.\nAccording to a June poll from Public Policy Polling, Alsobrooks, who won the Democratic primary in May, was found to be leading her opponent in the race by 11%. The poll — which surveyed 635 Maryland voters on June 19 and June 20 and had a 3.9% margin of error — showed Alsobrooks leading with 45% of the vote compared to Hogan's 34%.\nAccording to the Federal Election Commission, Alsobrooks' campaign has raised $12.47 million and spent $8.91 million between May 1, 2023, and June 30. Hogan's campaign has raised $7 million and spent $4.34 million between Jan. 1 and June 30.\nPine Street Community Market and the Dorchester County Democratic Party hosted Alsobrooks at 711 Pine St. in Cambridge.\nEddie Beasley, who owns the market, said he would like to see Alsobrooks get elected because she would be Maryland's first Black U.S. senator.\n\"Everybody needs to be represented,\" he said.\nDoris Mason, a retired social worker for the state, said some of the important issues to her are Social Security, support for families and children, and housing, which she said is a top priority in Dorchester County.\nAlsobrooks — who also delivered remarks at the United Association Mid Atlantic Pipe Trades annual summer convention in Ocean City and attended a clothing donation drive at the Worcester County Library-Ocean Pines Branch in Berlin on July 17 — said in an interview with The Star Democrat that she has been to the Eastern Shore \"a number of times.\"\nHogan also has been to the Eastern Shore multiple times since announcing his candidacy. In June, Hogan visited the Simmons Center Market in Cambridge, where he received endorsements from Dorchester County Councilman Ricky Travers and County Council Vice President Mike Detmer.\nOn Wednesday, Alsobrooks said her trips to the Shore won't stop if she is elected senator.\n\"I've walked this community,\" she said about Cambridge. \"We've been here a number of times, and I will continue to come here as a senator.\"\nDuring her speech in the market, Alsobrooks talked about how her family has shaped who she is and what she fights for. She talked about her grandmother, Sarah.\nAlsobrooks said that her grandmother was a housekeeper at hotels in an around Washington, D.C., but had a desire to work in federal government. To work in federal government, you had to pass a typing test, Alsobrooks said.\n\"Sarah could not afford a typewriter,\" Alsobrooks said. \"So she went into the kitchen of the family's apartment, put a white piece of paper up on the refrigerator, drew a key board on that white piece of paper.\"\nAlsobrooks said her grandmother taught herself keystrokes on that piece of paper on the refrigerator and was able to pass the exam and get a government job.\n\"And I want you to know that I am Sarah's legacy,\" she said. \"I understand that we all want the same things for our family. And that is what I have fought to deliver. (It) is what I continue to deliver.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The next couple of weeks will either confirm that Joe is the candidate, or another Democrat will rise to the occasion and take on Trump.While the top of the ticket is of immense importance, equally important are the priorities of the party. That is, no matter who the Democratic nominee is, there are certain principles and policies that are more likely to advance and be preserved if Democrats are elected.\nBelow is one person's Top 10 list of reasons why it is imperative to support the eventual Democratic nominee, whomever that may be, as well as Democratic candidates for the Senate and House of Representatives.\nThe Democrats will ...\nDeal with the climate challenges that are impacting our world by supporting clean energy and a phased reduction in fossil fuels.Recognize women's health care as a matter for a woman's conscience, her family, her doctor and her God, not nameless, faceless legislators.Be clear eyed about the existential threats that Russia, China, North Korea and Iran present to the free world.Continue to support our allies particularly Israel and Ukraine through our actions, not blustery promises.Know how important it is to appoint ethical justices to the Supreme Court that best reflect our nation's values so as to not allow further degradations to voting rights, health care options, gun control and climate protections.Continue economic policies that have pushed unemployment to historically low levels, jobs to new heights, spurred growth and managed an economy that continues to be the envy of the world.Be vigilant about future pandemics and rely on science and not conspiracy theories as how to best deal with them. Thousands of people died unnecessarily by a failure to have competent presidential leadership during COVID.Respect the results of elections.Not constantly lie to the American people.Not have four times indicted, twice impeached, convicted felon and serial liar running for commander in chief.\nThe choices are clear for November – support the Democratic nominee for president along with the Democratic ticket. It is too important to stay home.\nVote.\nDENNIS GLACKIN\nSt. Michaels \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Vance as its nominee for vice president. The GOP also made key decisions about the party's political platform.\nThe Eastern Shore's elected delegates used their time at the convention to learn how the Republican party is prioritizing public safety, stimulating the economy and addressing immigration, according to Julie Giordano, Wicomico County executive.\nGiordano was there as a delegate from Maryland's 1st Congressional District, which encompasses the Eastern Shore as well as Harford and parts of Baltimore counties. With her were fellow 1st District delegates Danielle Hornberger, county executive for Cecil County, and Kathy Szaliga, a member of the House of Delegates representing Baltimore and Harford counties.\nAs county executive and an active part of the Wicomico community, Giordano said federal policies like those discussed at the convention play a crucial role in local communities. She said during her campaign for county executive, she ran on issues concerning public safety, education and the economy, which she says have all been affected by federal policies.\n\"The things that I'm trying to do are affected because of policies made at the federal level,\" Giordano said. \"When I see a change in those federal policies, it then trickles down. It trickles down to the state, and then trickles down to the county.\"\nAmong the many areas of policy raised at the convention, Giordano said public safety was a main topic of discussion.\nThis convention came on the heels of an assassination attempt on Trump during a campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania, which happened less than two days before the convention began.\nGiordano said in the aftermath of the assassination attempt, Trump's campaign emphasized the need for unity and policy priorities such as public safety and local economy stimulation.\n\"I do think that there is definitely more of a push for a unified America,\" Giordano said. \"We see it across both sides of the aisle, that President Biden and President Trump both have condemned political violence, and I think that that unifying message is really resonating.\"\nOn the final day of the convention, a much anticipated speech from the former president was given to close out the convention. In his over 90-minute speech Trump accepted the party's nomination, expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support following the assassination attempt and shared his concerns over the \"invasion\" at the Southern border.\nFor Giordano, the issue of immigration hit close to home. She said the schools in the Eastern Shore are overflowing and a lot of the new students are \"the ESL (English as a Second Language) population.\"\n\"It's affecting our schools,\" Giordano said. \"It's affecting our county itself. It affects a lot of different things. And we are all about bringing people here. This is the greatest country on Earth, but they have to do it legally.\"\nAt the end of the convention Giordano said it was an amazing experience and encouraged everybody to become politically involved and partake in events such as the convention.\n\"I don't care if you are a Republican or a Democrat,\" Giordano said. \"If you feel strongly about a candidate, and you get to go and be part of the convention, it is such an amazing experience, because you are around people that think the same way you do and want the same things that you do.\"\nKonner Metz contributed to this story. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Personally I think this a pay back to the Ukraine for all the money they gave to the Biden family by way of Hunter over the years.Why do the Democrats despise Israel so much (many are Jewish) and support Hamas? Biden and Harris are not speaking out against the protests, the burning of the American flag, destruction of property, disruption of classrooms, tearing down of statues that represent our American heritage, disruption of free speech by conservatives, they don't adhere to the Constitution and Bill of Rights ... and this is OK with the American people?\nGod's word says, speaking of Israel, \"I will bless those who bless you and I will curse those who curse you.\"\nThis administration has done a lot to go against Israel and a day of reckoning is coming.

John B. Mustin, chief of Navy Reserve and commander of Navy Reserve Force, kicked off the event on board the America-class amphibious assault carrier USS Tripoli with welcome remarks and certificates of appreciation to the attendees.\nNERE is a Navy familiarization day sponsored by the chief of Navy Reserve to recognize employers who provide their Reserve sailors with superior support. Selected employers are chosen from nominations submitted by their Reserve sailor employees.\n\"We honor and recognize the many employers who support our Citizen Sailors, who are often called upon to leave their families and civilian jobs on short notice,\" Mustin said. \"Your support is critical to our bi-coastal nation's ability to maintain maritime dominance — and to protect our economic vibrancy, our security, and our prosperity, which depend upon the seas.\"\nThroughout the event, Steckel and the other employers had the opportunity to experience an up-close look at some of the equipment and capabilities that exist in the Navy Reserve, including a tour of USS Tripoli and a static display of Naval Air Force Reserve's Fleet Logistics Support Squadron (VR) 57. They witnessed demonstrations by the Navy Marine Mammal Program and Undersea Rescue Command. They saw displays by SEAL Team 17, Maritime Expeditionary Security Group 1, Naval Base San Diego Military Working Dog Division and NR Naval Information Warfare Systems Command at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, Turner Field.\nMustin concluded the event with an evening reception on board USS Midway Aircraft Carrier Museum.\n\"Employers like you, who support their reserve and guard members, are an important part of our national defense structure,\" Mustin said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Statesmanship has become too rare in Congress\n\n August 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LARRY HOGAN | Section: Columns \n \n 721\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n This week marks seven years since Sen. John McCain's (R-Ariz.) historic vote to save Obamacare. I will never forget a phone call I had with him just moments before he gave the big thumbs down on the Senate floor. He was reaching out about a statement I had issued opposing the Republicans' effort to repeal Obamacare. He thanked me for putting people over party and confidentially let me know he was going to do the same.Although we shared the same concern that our health care system desperately needs commonsense reforms to lower costs, McCain and I both knew that the Republican bill to repeal Obamacare was irresponsible and would jeopardize the health care coverage for our citizens.\nAs McCain told me that day, his vote was about far more than just Obamacare. While he was courageously battling brain cancer, he wanted to send a message to his colleagues and the nation that the broken status quo in Washington could not continue. In a speech later that day, he appealed that the Senate was being weighed down by partisan dysfunction and was on the \"decline.\"\nCan anyone dispute that the problem has grown far worse since McCain spoke those words seven years ago? Our political discourse is spiraling into rabid tribalism, hatred and violence. Politicians in Washington care more about appealing to the loudest and angriest voices than actually delivering for the people they serve. They are \"trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle.\" Ultimately, the losers of all this partisan dysfunction are the American people.\nIt wasn't always this way.\nAs McCain said: \"I've known and admired men and women in the Senate who played much more than a small role in our history, true statesmen, giants of American politics. They came from both parties and from various backgrounds.\"\nLast week, I had the honor of attending a memorial service to remember one of those giants: Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.). Though they were on different sides of the aisle, Lieberman and McCain were true friends who both loved this country and worked together on countless issues for the good of the nation.\nWhen my father Larry Hogan Sr. served in Congress, he would debate about real issues with his colleagues across the aisle then sit down and actually get things done. Fifty years ago this week, he put aside partisanship and answered the demands of his conscience to do what he thought was the right thing for the state and nation that he loved, becoming the first Republican to come out for the impeachment of President Nixon.\nThis type of statesmanship has become far too rare. Increasingly, principled leaders who care more about making the Senate work for their constituents than their Twitter accounts are heading for the exits. Instead of serving as \"an important check on the powers of the Executive\" and working together to advance commonsense solutions, politicians in the Senate toe the party line and perpetuate the broken status quo to advance their careers.\nEvery election cycle, partisans on both sides of the aisle tell the American people that the only answer is just to vote straight party line regardless of the character and experience of the candidates. And every election cycle, our politics becomes even more divisive and dysfunctional as a result.\nThe only way we can fix this mess is to elect independent leaders who are not beholden to the broken system. I don't need a job or another title. I am running to be a completely different kind of senator. As a key swing vote who has never hesitated to stand up to my party, both parties will have to earn my support.\nOnly Maryland can count on my vote. That independence will give me an outsized influence to stand up for what is right, put Maryland at the center of every deal, and help make the Senate work again for the people.\nThis isn't just the typical fight between Democrats and Republicans. It's more important than that. This is a fight for America's future, and that is a fight worth fighting. McCain knew the truth: \"The success of the Senate is important to the continued success of America … That responsibility is more important than any of our personal interests or political affiliations.\"\nFormer Gov. Larry Hogan is the Republican nominee for the open U.S. Senate seat in Maryland. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Tim Walz as her running mate Tuesday won praise from Maryland Democrats, who pointed to the governor's experience and approach to politics as key assets in the fall campaign.Maryland Republicans, with one notable exception, saw little to like in the final piece of the Democratic ticket that will face off against former President Donald Trump and his vice presidential choice, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance.\nRep. Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland) said in a statement that Democrats and other voters should be excited for his friend Walz, whom he called an invaluable member of the House Democratic Caucus during his time in Congress.\n\"His plainspoken, common-sense approach to governing allowed him to deliver for veterans and Minnesotans,\" Hoyer said. \"I know he will bring that same dedication and empathy to the vice presidency.\"\nWalz served in the House from 2007 until January 2019, when he became Minnesota's governor. He was reelected in 2022.\nHarris' decision on her running mate came hours after she officially became the Democratic Party's nominee for the presidency, clinching the vote of 99% of delegates in a virtual roll call. Walz and Harris are set to start a battleground state tour together this week, debuting Tuesday evening in Philadelphia.\nBefore his political career, Walz was a high school teacher, football coach and command sergeant major in the Army National Guard.\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore, highlighted fellow Democrat and veteran Walz's experience in the Army and his \"proven track record of progress\" in a Tuesday post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\"His incredible journey of service … isn't just a source of inspiration for future generations and evidence of his deep commitment to this country; it's also proof of his effectiveness as a leader who is going to generate wins not just for the Democratic Party in November, but for the entire country,\" Moore said.\n\"To the window ... to the Walz!!!\" the Maryland Democratic Party tweeted, inviting Maryland residents to sign a card welcoming the governor to the campaign.\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D–Maryland, called Walz \"a rock star to veterans, teachers, football players and common-sense Americans.\"\nPrince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, who is the Democratic candidate for the Senate, said in a statement that the Harris-Walz ticket presents a vision that stands \"in diametric opposition\" to the Trump-Vance ticket and is instead focused on protecting freedoms.\n\"I couldn't be more excited for Vice President Harris, for Maryland, and for our country in her decision of Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate,\" Alsobrooks said.\nWalz signed numerous pieces of LGBTQ+ protection legislation throughout his governorship including bills that protected gender-affirming care, banned book bans due to LGBTQ+ content and banned conversion therapy. The governor also signed bills protecting abortion in Minnesota and people who travel to Minnesota for the procedure.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, who served with the governor in Congress, said there was no better person to serve alongside Harris.\n\"Tim has always put our country first,\" Van Hollen said in a statement. \"I'm excited and ready to do everything I can to turn out the vote and elect President Harris and Vice President Walz — a brighter future for all Americans and our democracy depends on it.\"\nSen. Ben Cardin (D-Maryland) kept his endorsement succinct, posting on X: \"Harris-Walz. Strong. Experienced. Authentic. Unifying. Exciting! Can't wait to cast my ballot.\"\nRep. Andy Harris, the sole Republican in the Maryland congressional delegation, joined other party members in accusing Walz on X of being \"pro-open border\" and repeating the false claim that Harris is the \"border czar.\"\n\"It is no surprise failed Border Czar Kamala Harris picked a running mate who is more pro-open border than she is,\" Andy Harris tweeted. \"The same person who said he would invest in a ladder factory to defeat Trump's border wall is now vying to be VP.\"\nWalz was critical of Trump's border wall proposal, supported a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and signed a law that allows undocumented immigrants to get driver's licenses.\n\"The selection of Tim Walz as the Democrat candidate for vice president just confirms what we already knew: this is the most extreme, far-left ticket in modern American history,\" the Maryland Republican Party said in a statement.\nHowever, Republican Senate candidate and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan struck a different tone than his GOP counterparts. Hogan congratulated Walz on X and said the country needs more governors on the national level because \"governors have to actually get stuff done.\"\n\"While we come from different parties, I have always appreciated his dedication to public service,\" Hogan said, acknowledging their past working together as governors.\nHogan is in an awkward place in his own party, whose national convention in Milwaukee he skipped last month. He has said he will not support Trump, even though the former president has endorsed him. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gov. Larry Hogan: A pragmatic difference maker\n\n August 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DARIN THACKER | Section: Columns \n \n 557\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last year's Christmas break was memorable for me, and not just because of the special time with family.As someone who was raised in Lusby and currently works for a U.S. senator, I was motivated to encourage former Gov. Larry Hogan to seek Maryland's open seat in the U.S. Senate. I believe he's a generational leader whose service in the Senate would greatly benefit Maryland and the country, so I used my time off to write him a personal letter to make my appeal.\nGov. Hogan kindly responded by inviting me to meet with him a week later where I continued my pitch. It was ultimately the chronic dysfunction of the Senate, and specifically its failure in early February to strengthen our nation's border security and immigration laws, that drove him to run. But I'm grateful that a heartfelt letter helped trigger his consideration.\nMy Senate experience gives me confidence that Gov. Hogan would be very effective for Maryland and stand against the extremes of both parties, regardless of who holds the majority in the Senate or wins the White House.\nSenators tend to fall into two camps: Partisan ideologues and pragmatic difference makers. Ideologues push their unrealistic, and oftentimes extreme, policy agendas. They take actions that cause constituents with diverse viewpoints to run to their corners, not solve problems. They almost always vote the party line and perpetuate division and gridlock. Their record of legislative achievements is thin.\nSenators who are difference makers are the exact opposite. They are principled but practical. They seek bipartisan solutions and recognize that meaningful progress often comes in incremental steps. They acknowledge that members from both parties have good ideas. And they embrace the counsel of former President Barack Obama who said, \"No one is exempt from the call to find common ground.\"\nLarry Hogan is a proven difference maker. As governor Marylanders saw him work across the aisle to strengthen our economy and make our communities safer. He went to every corner of the state, worked with folks of every ethnicity and economic status and locked arms with local leaders from every party to get things done.\nAs a result he left office with a 77% approval rating — including a remarkable 81% approval rating among Democrats.\nFurther, Gov. Hogan would have an outsized influence among his Senate colleagues. Senate rules require 60 votes to pass most bills, which means Hogan would be at the center of finding bipartisan solutions on every major issue. He would also help defeat fringe legislation and judges from both parties. Contrary to the claims of Gov. Hogan's partisan opponents, Marylanders would be well served to have a senator who works from the political center to forge consensus and protect mainstream values.\nIn short, I believe Gov. Hogan's independent leadership is exactly what the Senate needs as it confronts the enormous challenges facing our country. He has a proven record of bipartisan achievement in Annapolis, and I have no doubt Gov. Hogan would continue to put country above party while representing Maryland across Route 50 in our nation's capital.\nAnd if Marylanders do elect him in November, this year's Christmas break will end with something even more memorable for me than last's — Gov. Hogan taking the oath of office as U.S. senator.\nDarin Thacker is chief of staff for U.S. Senator Steve Daines of Montana. He resides with his family in Accokeek, Maryland. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The Democratic party also made key decisions about the party's political platform.\nJared Schablein, an Eastern Shore delegate and chair of Shore Progress, said he was more than happy to have Walz as the vice presidential candidate.\n\"The Eastern Shore delegation is excited to see rural representation on the Harris-Walz ticket with Coach Tim Walz,\" he said. \"You know, people are excited for a new generation of leadership that is committed to protecting our freedoms and really investing in middle-class families.\"\nSchablein was there as a delegate from Maryland's 1st Congressional District, which encompasses the Eastern Shore, as well as Harford and parts of Baltimore counties. He said it was important to support a candidate that focused on issues affecting the Eastern Shore, such as affordable housing, expanding healthcare access and raising the minimum wage.\n\"This ticket is focused on letting people make their own choices in life, whether that's their own healthcare choices, whether that is their own choice in who they love, their own choice on when and how to start a family,\" Schablein said. \"This ticket is about freedom, and I'm excited to go back to the Eastern Shore.\"\nSchablein said he was happy to represent the Eastern Shore and even brought a plush muskrat named Earl to help bring attention to the area.\nLillia Rose, a delegate from Maryland's 6th Congressional District, which encompasses Allegany, Garrett and Washington counties and parts of Frederick and Montgomery counties, also hoped to draw attention to rural communities during the convention.\nRose said she loved the chance to participate in the rural caucuses that were offered at the DNC. She said it was great to learn how similar communities are motivating voters in areas that typically lean red.\nRose said listening to climate change activists representing Appalachia was one of her favorite parts of the convention.\n\"I was also really excited to hear about climate justice,\" Rose said. \"That's an issue we've always had and proportionately affected by natural resource extraction, and it can kind of feel hopeless at times. And being a young person, you know, it sounds crazy, but I'm not thinking about myself. I'm thinking about my little cousins and saying 'what can I do now?'\"\nAlongside climate justice, a key issue for Rose was rural women's healthcare accessibility.\n\"These rural issues, where healthcare accessibility can be a huge challenge, whether that's because of lack of transportation, or just distances,\" Rose said. \"… It gives me a lot of hope that people are going to be able to live in the areas they live in, and receive the care they deserve, especially women's health care.\"\nAt the end of the convention, Schablein said it was a great experience and he is excited to bring what he learned back home.\n\"The big slogan from this convention has been that we respect our neighbors, to make their own decisions and we disagree with them, even if we wouldn't make those decisions ourselves,\" Schablein said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Lemuel Dent Jr. will be interred on Sept. 5 at Cheltenham Veterans Cemetery in Prince George's County. Johnson Funeral Services of White Plains will perform graveside services preceding the interment.\nA native of Ironsides, an area on Route 6 in Charles County, Dent was assigned to Company L, 3rd Battalion, 366th Infantry Regiment, 92nd Infantry Division, known as the \"Buffalo Soldiers\" in the European Theater. The U.S. Army combat unit was made up for Black soldiers.\nDent was killed Feb. 8, 1945, at age 30, near the Cinquale Canal, north of Viareggio, Italy, when the tank he was aboard was struck by enemy fire while crossing the canal.\nThe tank was struck by enemy mortar, machine gun and artillery fire. His body was not recovered at the time, and the Germans never reported him a prisoner of war, the Defense POW/MIA Account Agency said in a release.\nOn May 5, 1945, the American Graves Registration Command, Army Quartermaster Corps, was the organization tasked with recovering missing American personnel in the European Theater. Investigators recovered a set of remains, designated as X-124 Castelfiorentino, from a gravesite approximately 2 miles west of Pietrasanta and 500 yards north of the Cinquale Canal, the accounting agency's release said.\nThe investigators initially associated the remains as possibly belonging to a soldier of the 92nd Infantry Division but did not have enough identifying data to make a positive identification. The remains were permanently interred at what is now Florence American Cemetery, the release said.\nDent was accounted for by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency earlier this year on Feb. 2, after X-124's remains were exhumed in June 2022 from the Florence American Cemetery in Impruneta, Italy, for laboratory analysis and identification, U. S. Army Human Resources Command Public Affairs Office said in a release.\nTo identify Dent's remains, scientists used anthropological analysis. Additionally, scientists from the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used mitochondrial DNA analysis, the accounting agency's release said.\nThe Past Conflict Repatriations Branch, under the Army Casualty and Mortuary Affairs Operations Division at the U.S. Army Human Resources Command in Fort Knox, Ky., plays a key role in the process of locating family members of missing soldiers from WWII and the Korean and Vietnam Wars.\nThe process begins with locating the family member most closely related to the missing soldier — known as the primary next of kin — followed by a request for family reference samples or DNA, which are used as a main source in identifying remains.\nOnce a soldier has been identified by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner, the Past Conflict Repatriations Branch notifies and briefs the family about the results of historical, forensic and DNA reports, benefits and the mortuary process including burial with full military honors.\nTerrence Johnson of Johnson Funeral Services said that this is the first time that he has dealt with a WWII soldier who was killed in action.\nJohnson was unsure if this was the first time a WWII soldier was reinterred in Charles County.\nHe said it was \"hard to say\" how attended the public funeral may be as Dent was survived by four sisters and five brothers, but the family members are \"spread out.\"\nDent's name is recorded on the Tablets of the Missing at Florence American Cemetery, along with others still missing from WWII. A rosette will be placed next to his name to indicate he has been accounted for. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Who is better for Talbot County, Harris or Trump?\n\n September 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JIM BRUCE | Section: Columns \n \n 1253\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Tuesday's presidential debate provides new information about how a Trump or Harris presidency would affect Talbot County. Buried among the barbs and points well-taken in the 90-minute debate are clues about what Talbot can expect, although the debate certainly did not address every way that the next White House will affect our county.Talbot County's economic future depends on who wins the presidency. In the debate Trump doubled down on his plan to impose large tariffs, 20% and more on imported products, particularly Chinese items (about 80% of Walmart's inventory comes from China). He ignores what economists say — foreign firms will raise their prices on their exports to us to offset these import tariffs, leaving American consumers, not the exporter, paying higher prices and prompting inflation.\nFurther, these tariffs will provoke retaliatory tariffs as happened in Trump's first presidency when our national soybean exports to China plummeted 75%. Talbot County has about 40,000 acres of soybean crops, more than any other cash crop. Note that Goldman Sachs just predicted that Trump's policies on tariffs and immigration would lead to an economic downturn, while the U.S. economy would grow if Harris is elected.\nAlthough Maryland law strongly protects reproductive rights, which a state constitutional amendment on the ballot (Question 4) this fall would further strengthen, if Congress were to pass and the president sign a federal ban on abortions, it would preempt Maryland's protections. Trump said in the debate he does not support a federal law banning abortions, but when asked if he would pledge to veto such a ban, Trump dodged the question. The moderator asked Trump again, noting that J.D. Vance has said that Trump would veto a federal abortion ban. Trump dodged again explaining that Congress would never pass such a bill.\nTrump took credit for the Supreme Court reversing Roe v. Wade and shifting the issue to the states. He explained that he acted because some states were allowing abortion in the ninth month and even beyond. \"In other words, we'll execute the baby.\" This was too much even for the moderator who jumped in to say, \"There is no state in this country, where it is legal to kill a baby after it is born.\"\nIn contrast, Harris was clear, \"I absolutely support reinstating the protections of Roe v. Wade,\" and pledging that when Congress passes a bill codifying Roe v. Wade, \"I will proudly sign it into law.\"\nIn 2022, 2,810 people in Talbot were listed as foreign-born, but we don't know how many \"undocumented immigrants\" live here. Trump distracted much of the immigration debate repeating unproven allegations that immigrants are eating our pet cats and dogs. Talbot's real risk is that Trump pledges to deport substantially more than 11 million \"undocumented immigrants\" using the national guard, local police, federal immigration officials, and if necessary, our military, going door to door.\nThis largest mass deportation in our history would cause bedlam in our county and certainly in our workplaces with many businesses having to close. Trump continues to demonize immigrants, insulting Talbot's growing Hispanic and other foreign-born populations and creating fear in our communities. The moderator asked Trump why he killed Congress' tough, bipartisan immigration bill that would have put thousands of additional agents on the border. Trump never answered the question. Harris supports this bill, accusing Trump of preferring to run on the immigration issue, but not solve it.\nHealth care is crucial for Talbot because our population is aging, and our largest employer is health care and social services. The debate focused on what will happen to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which is popular because of its coverage for pre-existing conditions. Harris stated her absolute support for maintaining and growing the program and private health care options as well.\nWhen the moderator asked Trump why he initially opposed the program but now supports it, Trump responded that he decided to save the program and improve it. Pressed about whether he has a plan now to do that, Trump said, \"I have concepts of a plan,\" about which we would be hearing more in the future. Kamala pointed out that for nine years the Republicans tried 60 times to kill the program, which survived by one vote from a Republican, the late Sen. John McCain. Republicans never presented an alternative plan.\nNearly 21,000 Marylanders are of Ukrainian extraction and far more of us, including in Talbot, sympathize with Ukraine. In the debate, Harris described her continuing efforts to help Ukraine defend itself, beginning before the Russian invasion. When the moderator asked Trump not once, but twice, if he believes that it is in the U.S. best interests for Ukraine to win this war, Trump said instead it is in our best interests to end the war by a settlement that he claims he could negotiate between Zelensky and Putin, even before Trump's inauguration.\nFurther, Trump claimed the war should never have started, suggesting falsely that Harris caused it because she was such a weak emissary sent to negotiate with Putin that he invaded Ukraine three days later. In fact, Harris had never met with Putin. Stoking fear and providing insight into his motivations, Trump pointed to Putin's nuclear weapons, adding, \"And eventually, maybe he will use them.\" For 300 years, people of Talbot have learned we must stand up to tyrants like Putin.\nWith 600 miles of shoreline, Talbot County is especially vulnerable to the rising waters from climate change. In the debate, Harris reiterated her belief that climate change is real, we can and must address it. When Harris said that Trump had called it a hoax, Trump only responded with a disjointed reply on other subjects. (Note that the Republican platform unveiled in their convention has not a word on climate change.)\nThe difference in the two candidates' specific policy proposals presented in the debate is striking. Kamala Harris calls for a $50,000 tax deduction to help start up businesses. She wants a $6,000 tax credit for young families for the first year of a child's life. To help address affordable housing she seeks a $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, and to build 3 million new homes over four years. She pledges more negotiation with pharmaceuticals to drive down drug costs, such as the $35 cap on insulin prices.\nScouring the debate transcript, all I saw of Trump's policy proposals, other than generalizations (I will make American great again), were his pledge to reduce taxes, and to impose large tariffs on most foreign products. In her closing statement, Kamala lays out her policy vision in broad strokes. Trump spent his closing time attacking Harris' plans, labeling her the worst vice president in history, and darkly predicting we will wind up in a third world war.\nTo me the most telling clue to what our county and the rest of our country can expect from the next White House regards its character. History is replete with tragic figures whose regimes failed because they could not honestly self-appraise, accept criticism, learn from it, and alter course accordingly.\nThroughout the debate we all heard Trump proclaim every aspect of his first presidency the best in history and that of Biden/Harris the worst. In a postscript to the debate, Trump declared, \"We won the debate according to every poll — every single poll, I think.\"\nHis supporters tried to cover up this obvious falsehood by explaining that the moderators were biased, and even that Harris cheated using earbuds for outside coaching disguised as pearl earrings. Trump now refuses to debate Harris again.\nIf you care about Talbot County, vote for Kamala Harris. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Rep. Harris, local Republicans speak at Denton rally supporting Trump\n\n September 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 590\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Republican leaders and supporters gathered for a Caroline County rally Saturday in support of presidential candidate Donald Trump and Maryland Republicans running for office this November.The event, which took place at Caroline County 4-H Park, was organized by Caroline County Republican Women. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st) was the featured speaker Saturday afternoon.\nAs he runs for his eighth consecutive term in the House of Representatives, Maryland's only Republican in Congress asked voters to support him as well as the entire Republican ticket. He emphasized a tight race in Congressional District 6, where Republican candidate Neil Parrott is vying to potentially join Harris as conservative representation in the House.\n\"We got a job to do. Because if President Trump is going to succeed, we need to have a House majority, so I'm going to ask for your vote,\" Harris said.\n\"Those of you who know people who live out in western Maryland, call them up and tell them to vote for Neil Parrott, because I'm tired of being the only Republican in the House delegation from Maryland, and we got a shot,\" he said.\nCaroline County Republican Women member Joanne Smith helped organize Saturday's event. She said the group held a gathering back in 2020 as well. In her eyes, Trump is a fit for Caroline County voters.\n\"I think Trump represents our values,\" Smith said. \"We're a very red area. Everybody in Caroline County that's elected is Republican.\"\n\"We desperately want to see a change in our government and Trump's our man,\" she added.\nMuch of Saturday's discussion centered on ensuring Republicans secure a Senate majority. Harris encouraged attendees to vote for former Gov. Larry Hogan as he runs for Maryland's open Senate seat against Democratic opponent Angela Alsobrooks.\nHarris emphasized that without a Republican majority in the Senate and a Trump victory, conservative judges cannot be placed on the Supreme Court bench.\nAdorned in a \"Make America Great Again\" baseball cap, Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) also asked voters to toe the party line..\n\"Vote straight down the ticket, Donald Trump, Larry Hogan, Andy Harris,\" Mautz said. \"Whatever it is, whatever the qualm is, it doesn't matter. We need to get out, and we need to vote.\"\n\"This is war,\" he continued. \"We're at a national crossroads right now, and we need to put all of our cards on the table.\"\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) and Del. Jeff Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) attended Saturday's rally, as well as Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker.\nSpeaking to eventgoers, Hutchinson predicted that November's general election will play out similar to the 2016 vote, with Trump claiming swing states and the presidency. \"We can't wait to see it happen again,\" he said.\nThe state delegate said in an interview with the Star Democrat that the economy is the number one reason for residents on the Shore to support Trump.\n\"We see with our rising food prices, gas prices, housing prices, it's affecting everybody here on the Shore,\" Hutchinson said. \" … I see it within my district, how it's really affecting the middle-income and low-income families.\"\nSmith and Harris both noted an increase in enthusiasm among local Republicans to win back the White House. \"We want to get back to the Trump years,\" Harris said in an interview.\nDenton resident Thomas Conneely Jr. attended Saturday's gathering and echoed that sentiment.\n\"I see that there's more energy,\" Conneely Jr. said. \"But I also see an urgency that it's an emergency. That's what I see. I see people looking at it as, 'We have to.' If we don't, we're in deep trouble.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was lauded in March 2022 in no less than the Washington Post for the selections he made and the process he used in assuring diverse and highly qualified candidates for both lower and appellate state courts. As head of the National Governor's Association during the pandemic, he was a very effective leader and spokesperson for the nation's governors, both Republican and Democratic. He worked effectively with leaders of all stripes, including two presidents.\nHe governed with the money he had, left the state with a surplus, and kept his pledges to Marylanders on taxes and abortion. He improved Maryland business climate rankings. He reacted to the disastrous defunding the police movement by refunding local police. He implemented a school choice program for lower income, underserved students. He left the state far better than he found it.\nBy contrast, it's hard to discern much about his opponent as Prince George's County executive that compares to Hogan's credentials unless you embrace identity politics. Her school system dwells near the bottom of most rankings. Hers was the last school system to reopen for in-person instruction in the pandemic. She reallocated funding for a proposed police training facility. Violent crime has increased. The current Prince George's state's attorney and Maryland attorney general both endorsed her opponent in the Democratic primary.\nWe know Mr. Hogan will be a fiercely independent and a reasoned voice in the Senate regardless of who is elected president and will bring people together to find common ground to benefit Maryland. On the other hand, Ms. Alsobrooks, given her continual fawning over the vice president as her mentor, will probably be a mere rubber stamp for Vice President Harris if elected.\nEUGENE T.

    "content": "Sept. 10 debate is history, but the hype goes on\n\n September 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 747\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The first and perhaps only debate for the 2024 presidential general election that was held on September 10th is history.Throughout their long history these debates have always experienced pre-debate and post-debate disagreements.\nAfter one of the first of three televised presidential debates in 1960, there was disagreement on the winner. A majority of voters who watched that debate on television responded in a post-debate survey that John F. Kennedy won. A majority of voters who listened to that debate on the radio responded in a post-debate survey that Nixon won.\nPrior to the most recent debate, the Harris campaign adamantly refused to consider an offer from Fox News to host a debate, an offer strongly favored by the Trump campaign.\nThis year's on-again, off-again debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris sponsored by ABC did have a happy ending for many voters. They were happy when the pre-debate hype and the actual debate ended.\nWhile the pre-debate hype and actual debate are over, there have been and will continue to be intense discussions about the Sept. 10 debate between the candidates and their most steadfast supporters.\nTopics for the post-debate debates include, but are not limited to: who won, why they won, who lost, why they lost, the fairness of the moderators, the questions posed to each candidate by the moderators, incomplete candidate answers to certain questions from the moderators, the body language of the moderators, one moderator's recent acknowledgement that he chose to aggressively pursue fact-checking a number of Trump's answers during the debate, the validity of his fact-checking observations during the debate, the need for at least one more debate, and even the earrings worn by Kamala Harris during the debate.\nNot surprisingly, in many cases, the varied answers to those post-debate debate questions are the result of the thinking on political messaging by communications guru Frank Luntz and two published works in the Washington Post on trust in the media. These observations have appeared in previous commentaries of mine, but all bear repeating here.\nLuntz has observed: \"It's not what you say or write, it is what people hear or read. You can have the best message in the world, but the person on the receiving end will always understand it through the prism of their own emotions, preconceptions, prejudices and preexisting beliefs.\"\nNo doubt the Trump campaign is fully aware of and will work hard to widely distribute the following recent and scathing observations by the Washington Post Editorial Board, and Washington Post columnist Philip Bloom that I referenced in a previous commentary.\nThe Post's editorial board cited a recent Post and Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University survey reporting only three in 10 residents of six of the most important states in this year's presidential election trust the media will fairly and accurately report political news. Bump recently wrote in the Post: \"Americans simply don't trust the media, particularly when it comes to politics.\"\nIf and how those Washington Post observations may be viewed by voters remains to be seen.\nThe same is true on the news on a second assassination attempt on Donald Trump.\nWe know every political campaign will have unexpected opportunities and unexpected challenges. The question is always when and how will they play out.\nFor Donald Trump, an unexpected opportunity (now moot) was having President Joe Biden as his opponent when it was increasingly clear Biden was past his political prime.\nFor Donald Trump, an unexpected challenge was a debate where Kamala Harris exceeded expectations.\nFor Kamala Harris, an unexpected challenge was launching a presidential campaign on short notice.\nFor Kamala Harris, an unexpected opportunity was a debate where she branded herself as a viable presidential candidate.\nBefore the debate, some polls showed Trump leading Harris in all key battleground states.\nAfter the debate, some polls polling in some of those battleground states showed Harris leading Trump in some of the key battleground states.\nNeither of the polls projected enough state wins to clinch victory in the Electoral College.\nThe bottom line is the outcome of their Sept. 10 debate alone is not predictive of the November election outcome.\nThe voters who decide who prevails in November will not be significantly impacted by who won or who lost a 90-minute debate held in mid-September.\nI expect most independent and undecided voters will vote based on their perceptions on which candidate cares most about their deepest concerns and who best articulates a positive and achievable vision for the future.\nAs always, one and only one candidate will ultimately enjoy a happy ending in the upcoming presidential election. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That long and terrible war would involve many members of my family.My father served in the U.S. Navy in the Pacific on an antiaircraft gunboat protecting larger ships from air attack. My father-in-law served in the U.S. Army infantry in Germany fighting in the Hürtgen forest and eventually being seriously wounded. My Uncle Ben was part of the 82nd Airborne Division jumping into France on D-Day. (He was also a great football coach, see Syracuse University 1960). I am very proud of all these people; they were all heroes.\nDonald Trump, a former president of the United States, does not agree with me. In his own words he sees these people as \"losers and suckers\" not worthy of his respect or recognition.\nRecently this same attitude was on full display when Donald Trump, invited by grieving families, organized a trip with cameras to Arlington Cemetery to visit Section 60 of that cemetery. Section 60 is reserved for fallen heroes from Iraq and Afghanistan. Arlington Cemetery specifically prohibits using the cemetery for political purposes.\nAn employee of the cemetery tried to prevent Trump and his staff from filming his political campaign video but was pushed aside. The U.S. Army has subsequently condemned Trump's actions and firmly defended the employee's actions. The employee has declined to press charges citing fear of harassment from Trump's supporters.\nMr. Trump recently denigrated those in our military who were awarded the Medal of Honor, our nation's highest military decoration. He described the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which he recently conferred on a wealthy campaign donor, as better because Medal of Honor winners are \"in very bad shape because they've been hit so many times by bullets or they're dead.\" Our military says that a Medal of Honor winner may be saluted by any member of the military, regardless of rank. That is the respect due to those who wear this medal.\nThen there is the issue of bone spurs. Mr Trump, at age 24, sought to avoid the Vietnam War. He was granted a draft classification that allowed him to avoid service because a doctor friend of his family certified that he suffered from disqualifying bone spurs. His family members have stated that no bone spurs were ever previously mentioned. Yet, he feels free to denigrate those who have served.\nAny one of these actions makes you ask the question? Why does anyone want to support this man to be commander in chief of our armed forces?

    "content": "How “blue” is Maryland? A closer look at the state’s voting history\n\n October 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DYLAN SHULMAN Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 663\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The 2024 election is Donald Trump's third bid for the U.S. presidency, having won in 2016 and lost in 2020. Maryland voted for the Democratic candidate in both cases, and its 10 electoral votes have been considered a given for the Democratic candidate in past general elections.As the 2024 general election nears, Capital News Service examined how Maryland has voted in presidential elections over the past 50 years.\n\"Maryland as a whole has high levels of education, which is one of the things—but only one of the things—that helps to account for its commitment to the Democrats,\" said Matthew Crenson, professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins University's political science department.\nOther factors Crenson mentioned were that Black voters make up around 30% of Maryland's electorate, as well as large numbers of the Latino community, although the political leanings of the latter demographic are currently in flux.\nCurrent Maryland opinion polls for the 2024 election have Harris ahead of Trump by a significant margin, par for the course in a state that has voted consistently blue for eight presidential elections. According to data from the Maryland State Board of Elections, Maryland voters have chosen only three Republican candidates since the 1960s: Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush.\nIn 1972, Nixon was an incumbent president who won re-election in a landslide victory, the largest popular vote margin in United States history. Reagan's 1984 victory was another case where the incumbent was an extremely popular candidate. In the following election, Bush narrowly won 51% of the Maryland popular vote.\nIt's generally agreed that the 2024 election's swing states are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin; some include North Carolina in the list as well.\nAre there \"swing\" counties in Maryland?Three counties switched sides between the last two elections: Frederick, Kent and Talbot voted for Trump in 2016, but Biden won in those three counties in 2020.\nKent could qualify as a swing county. Voters there chose the Democratic candidate three times out of the last nine elections, and the voting margins were typically small: in four elections, merely a fraction of a percentage point decided the county's popular vote. Kent is also the state's least populous county, with about 19,000 residents, according to 2020 U.S. census data.\n\"The balance of politics within a small population can change radically with relatively small changes in the population itself,\" Crenson explained.\nBiden won Frederick County by about 10 percentage points in 2020. The three previous general elections in the county were close, with the Republican candidate winning in each case by less than four percentage points. Crenson said that Frederick County is becoming more politically divided as it becomes \"a suburb of Washington.\"\n\"The result is that federal employees, most of whom vote Democratic, are beginning to populate Frederick County and taking over its electorate,\" Crenson said.\nIn fact, the voting habits along the entire I-95 corridor are subject to influence from the nation's capital, Crenson said.\n\"Government employees tend to have rather high levels of education and recently—that is, within the last 10 or 15 years—people with college degrees have been gravitating toward the Democratic Party,\" he said.\nMaryland voter turnout—the percentage of registered voters who cast a ballot—also took a dip from 74% in 2012 to about 72% in 2016. A change in voter turnout under five percentage points is typical, but 2016 was the lowest voter turnout since 1996, the general election between Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican Bob Dole.\n\"Neither of the two candidates electrified Maryland,\" Crenson said.\nThe 2024 election will be the first general election after the COVID-19 pandemic. For the last election, which took place at the onset of the pandemic, the Maryland State Board of Elections restricted poll voting and encouraged voters to request and complete mail-in ballots, which accounted for a majority of all Maryland ballots.\nThe results of the 2024 election will establish whether many Marylanders continue to vote by mail or return to the polls. Crenson predicts that mail-in ballots will likely continue to be the avenue for many voters. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In that regard, it was impressive.She opens the letter asking if anyone other than her thinks the White House is devoid of leadership. Clearly this a joke. She should have put \"LOL\" after the question. Tens of millions of Trump supporters agree with her. Fortunately for America, more tens of millions don't agree. Trump has never won the popular vote and won't in the election.\nMs. Wieland then goes on to cite a series of alternative facts that are mostly not true. Kamala never said defund the police, never said she wants to give \"illegals\" all they want, never said she does not like Israel, never said she's going to take away Ms. Wieland's sacred guns. Here's a joke. How do you label someone who writes untruths? A Republican. (LOL)\nHer closing wish is most ironic. She says she hopes Putin does not read her letter, so he does not learn what a mess America is in. Duh? This is like me saying, \"I hope no one reads this, but Trump has romantic feelings for Putin.\" LOL. That's a joke because he only wrote love letters to the dictator of North Korea.\nFinally, she calls for \"strong leadership.\" Trump only thinks dictators are strong. Recently he said Putin is \"at the top of his game.\" China is strong under a dictator Trump said he envies. The weak, according to Trump, are the United States military that are \"suckers and losers\" for defending America. All women are weak and liars, and they need him as a \"protector\" to make them happy. Jews are weak and may cost him the election. Immigrants are weak. People of color are weak and only work in \"Black jobs.\" Christians who promote the love of Christ are weak. (In contrast to Christian Nationalists who promote hate and power.)\n\"Hey, Putin, listen up,\" Trump also says America is weak.\nTrump is a coward. He is a bully, and bullies are cowards. His daddy got him out of service during Vietnam. All the sane military flag officers that served under him have written books about how stupid, reckless and cowardly he is.\nDon't vote for Trump for strong leadership. Vote for Trump if you want a stupid coward as our dictator.\nMICHAEL DAVIS\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The other is dominated by those inside mostly non-profit entities whose funding is essentially unearned. These include university academics and their students, social cause activists, information technology groups and media providers. This party believes there are grand ideas for addressing real or imaginary problems.\nIn view of these distinctions, the two parties are motivated toward different ends. One party seeks a government that promotes free enterprise with only necessary regulations. The other is motivated to gain control of the government in order to implement grand ideas.\nIt seems that one party supports classical Constitutional freedom while the other seeks to impose a new system that circumvents Constitutional strictures. The 2024 Democratic Party platform states that \"America is an idea.\"\n\"We must right the wrongs in our democracy, redress the systemic injustices that have long plagued our society, throw open the doors of opportunity for all Americans, and reinvent our institutions at home and our leadership abroad. We do not simply aspire to return our country to where we were four years ago. We know we must be bolder and more ambitious.\"\nThe 2024 Republican Party platform states \"We will be a Nation based on Truth, Justice, and Common Sense.\"\nTo enter military service I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Voting for the Democratic Party platform would violate that oath.\nPAYNE KILBOURN\nNeavitt \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Big surprise'?: Anti-war vote could be a wild card in razor-thin Trump-Harris race\n\n October 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Belgrade News | Section: News \n \n 1590\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Could anti-war voters (including Muslims and Arab-American Christians) upset with U.S. support for Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas potentially tip the 2024 election away from Vice President Kamala Harris in favor of former President Donald Trump?In 2020, President Joe Biden won 69% of the Muslim vote, compared to Trump's 17%, according to Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). Exit polls by the Associated Press in 2020 gave Biden 64% of the Muslim vote versus 35% for Trump.\nTimes have changed.\nThe Biden-Harris administration's military and diplomatic support for Israel's war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks and ongoing conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon have eroded Arab-American and Muslim support for Harris' White House bid.\nMore than 43,000 people have died in Gaza since the start of the war more than a year ago, when Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis and took more than 250 hostages. More than 100 of those Israeli hostages (including a handful with dual American citizenship) are still being held by Hamas and other Islamic militants.\nIsrael's continued siege and bombings inside Gaza have killed more than 20,000 women and children, according to the United Nations, citing Palestinian estimates.\nA worst-case scenario for Harris is that Muslim voters, Arab American Christians and other anti-war voters (including younger voters) back the Green Party's Jill Stein (who opposes the war and U.S. backing of Israel), Trump or sit out the election, which could potentially tilt the razor-thin election in battlegrounds including Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina.\nSEISMIC SHIFT?A national poll released last month by the Arab American Institute found Arab Americans shifting away from Democrats and Harris.\nThe group said in the past Arab Americans voted for Democrats by a roughly 2-to-1 margin.\nThe October poll found Trump leading Harris among Arab Americans 42% to 41%, with 12% backing a third-party candidate such as Stein or Cornel West, who also opposes the Gaza war.\nHarris is polling 18 percentage points below Biden's 2020 standing with Arab Americans, according to the poll.\n\"In our 30 years of polling Arab American voters, we have not witnessed anything like the role that the war on Gaza is having on voter behavior,\" said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, in a statement, pointing out 81% of Arab Americans view the Israel-Hamas war as a top issue.\nThere are more than 3.7 million Arab Americans in the U.S., according to AAI.\nClose to 393,000 Arab Americans live in Michigan (which Biden won by just over 154,100 votes in 2020). Another 126,500 live in Pennsylvania (which Biden won by more than 78,500 votes).\nAAI estimates two-thirds or more of Arab Americans are Christians, while one-quarter are Muslim.\nWhile Evangelical Christians are among the staunchest supporters of Israel, Orthodox, the Roman Catholic Church and more liberal Protestant denominations — which also have churches in the Holy Land — have pressed for an end to the war and criticized Israel's Gaza bombings and invasion as it seeks to eradicate Hamas.\nAnother poll released earlier this month by the Arab News and polling firm YouGov gives Trump a 45% to 43% lead over Harris among Arab American voters. Stein gets 4%.\n'BITTER PILL'\nLate August polls by the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) showed Harris getting 28% of the Muslim vote in six key Electoral College swing states, compared to 30% for Stein and 15% for Trump.\nThe CAIR poll gave Harris 12% of the Muslim vote in Michigan (a key swing state with a significant Arab-American population) versus 40% for Stein and 18% for Trump.\nRobert McCaw, government affairs director for CAIR, said Harris hurt her standing with Muslim voters with recent pronouncements that she wouldn't change anything about the Biden administration policies.\n\"She stands by the policy of providing Israel with U.S manufactured weapons,\" McCaw said.\n\"It's a bitter pill for Muslim voters to swallow,\" he continued.\nMcCaw said if margins are tight in the presidential race or key Senate contests, anti-war voters could tip the balance. He also said like any group, Muslim voters can look to other issues, including the economy and social matters. He warns candidates not to take them for granted with Gaza in the backdrop.\n\"They could be in for a big surprise,\" he said.\n'VITAL VOTES'\nOne leading anti-war group, Abandon Harris, has endorsed Stein.\nHudhayfah Ahmad, spokesman for the group, said the U.S. administration's \"disregard for Palestinian lives has deeply damaged Harris's credibility with a large bloc of voters, including Muslims, progressives and human rights advocates.\"\n\"Their votes are vital in this election, and with each bomb dropped in Gaza, Harris's candidacy suffers more,\" he said.\nHarris — who has been heckled by anti-war protesters at some campaign rallies and TV appearances — has tried to walk a political balance beam of supporting Israel's right to defend itself after the Hamas attacks and continued rockets from Hezbollah while calling for a ceasefire. She also snubbed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress in August, and did meet with him at the White House voicing concerns about war deaths.\nHarris told CBS News Saturday the U.S. would help defend Israel if Iran strikes back after Israel Defense Forces bombed installations in Iran on Friday.\nAhmad is frustrated with the year-long cycle of top U.S. administration officials, including Harris, calling for and talking up a ceasefire and occasionally criticizing Netanyahu, only to see truce talks falter, coupled with White House and Pentagon pronouncements of \"ironclad support for Israel\" and continued military support.\n\"This cycle of empty calls for a ceasefire, followed by a new round of munitions shipments, has become insulting to Muslim voters and others who care about ending the massacres. It's a hollow strategy that tries to pacify the public, while enabling the very acts they claim to denounce. People are tired of the hypocrisy,\" Ahmad said.\nNO FANS OF TRUMPHarris does enjoy backing from Emgage Action, a Muslim group advocacy group that backed Biden in 2020.\nEmgage CEO Wa'el Alzayat said \"Gaza has been completely destroyed, tens of thousands of civilians have been killed, including many children, and a population of two million has been destitute.\"\nBut Alzayat said voting for a third-party candidate will help Trump win the White House.\n\"Muslims do not need to be reminded of who Donald Trump is,\" Alzayat said, pointing to the travel bans he proposed from several Muslim countries, moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and backing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights.\nAlzayat said Trump also \"blessed Netanyahu's expansionism by recognizing Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights\" and has promised support for Netanyahu on the campaign trail. He sees more hope in Harris, despite her standing by Biden's war stance.\nAhmad is also no fan of Trump.\n\"Trump's record on Palestine is disastrous — he's championed Israeli expansion and disregarded Palestinian rights altogether. Muslim voters have every reason to distrust him on this issue,\" he said.\nA national poll by The Economist and YouGov shows 36% of Americans sympathize with Israel in the war, 17% back the Palestinians, 25% have equal allegiances and 22% aren't sure. More than two-thirds of conservatives and 45% of wealthy voters back Israel, according to the survey.\nThe same poll shows 32% of Americans believe Israel is committing genocide in in Gaza, while 35% say they aren't and 32% aren't sure.\n'PEACE, NOT WAR'Trump has promised strong support for Israel and is backed by pro-Israeli mega-donor Miriam Adelson and other pro-Israel advocates including billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. Eighty two percent of white Evangelical Christians — who are among the strongest backers of Israel — support Trump.\nBut he has also vowed to end the Holy Land war, as well as the war between Russia and Ukraine.\nTrump had a group of Muslim leaders and imams — including Dearborn Heights, Michigan Mayor Bill Bazzi — on stage with him during a rally in Michigan on Saturday, welcoming their support.\n\"We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace, not war,\" said Imam Belal Alzuhairi. \"We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end war in the Middle East and Ukraine. The bloodshed has to stop all over the world, and I think this man can make that happen. I personally believe that God saved his life twice for a reason.\"\nTrump has also promised global protections for Christians, promising support for Coptic Christians in the Middle East and pointing to the sectarian dispute between Orthodox Armenians and Muslim Azerbaijanis.\nThe U.S. provides $3.8 billion in military aid to Israel annually. The Biden-Harris administration backed a $14 billion war aid package and approved a $20 billion long-term weapons sale to Israel earlier this year, and has sent troops, weapons, fighter jets and naval assets during the war with Hamas and Hezbollah and skirmishes with Iran.\nThose efforts enjoy bipartisan support. Still, Republicans, including U.S. Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, as well as Trump, argue Biden and Harris have not been supportive enough of Israel.\nTrump is also courting Jewish voters, another traditional Democratic voting bloc, and has touted his communications with Netanyahu. Jewish voters backed Biden over Trump by a 68% to 30% margin in 2020, according to the Jewish Virtual Library.\nA poll this month by academic research group CHIP50 found some slippage, with Harris holding a 54% to 36% lead over Trump among Jewish voters. A new poll by Channel 12 TV in Israel shows 66% of Israelis back Trump in the U.S. election versus 17% for Harris. More than 90% of Netanyahu backers prefer Trump over Harris, according to the Israeli poll.\nThis comes as Harris and Democrats press the case that Trump is a fascist who admires Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.\n\"I'm not a Nazi. I'm the opposite of a Nazi,\" Trump told a campaign rally Monday in Atlanta. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Election Day looms: How will the counts go and will voters trust the process - and the results?\n\n October 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Belgrade News | Section: News \n \n 1220\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Tuesday's election — which has already seen significant early voting across the country and could see record turnout spurred by the neck-and-neck White House race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris — will also be a serious test of how much trust the public has in the election system and the government agencies who run it.Right now, those trust levels skew along partisan lines.\nA Pew Research Center Poll released Oct. 24 found 42% of Trump voters are not confident the election will run smoothly compared to 90% of Harris voters who trust the system.\nAccording to a Pew survey, 38% of Trump voters have confidence in the counting of mail-in and absentee votes compared to 85% of Harris voters who trust government agencies and poll workers counting the votes.\nClose to three-quarters of Harris voters (72%) versus less than one-third of Trump backers (32%) are confident the election system is secure against being hacked.\nThere is also plenty of curiosity — and some concerns — over how and when ballots will be counted and when winners might be determined not only in the presidential race but also key congressional contests and state ballot measures.\nTrump has disputed his 2020 loss to President Joe Biden. Trump led in key battleground states on election night, but Biden overcame those deficits via ensuring counts of mail-in and absentee ballots in the election which occurred in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA number of state and local election agencies have increased security protocols and added more transparency to how ballots are tabulated and secured.\nOthers are counting absentee, mail-in and other early ballots early this cycle to help get results quicker and avoid delays that could fuel worries about how votes are being counted and results. .\nStill, barring some unforeseen turnout trends and definitive exit polls, a winner in the presidential race and other key races are not expected on election night or early Wednesday morning.\nIn Maryland, polls will be open Tuesday from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Key races include the U.S. Senate race between former Republican governor Larry Hogan and Democratic Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks. GOP U.S. Rep. Andy Harris is being challenged for his Eastern Shore congressional by Democrat Blane Miller.\n'COUNTING DOESN'T STOP'In Pitt County, North Carolina near the Atlantic coast, County Elections Director Dave Davis said approved absentee ballot envelopes are fed into voting machines weekly in the run-up to the election.\nHe said the county has sent out more than 4,100 absentee ballots this year. Close to 87,600 people voted in the 2020 presidential race.\nDavis wouldn't talk about election security measures but said \"counting doesn't stop\" until all ballots are tallied.\nNorth Carolina is one of the key Electoral College battlegrounds between Trump and Harris, and there is some consternation about how long it will take for all votes to be counted in places such as Maricopa County in Arizona. That county, which includes Phoenix and Scottsdale, has a two-page ballot which could add to its already cumbersome counting of early ballots.\nThe Wisconsin State Board of Elections says all ballots — including in-person and absentee votes — are counted on Election Day and matched to voter registration details in poll books.\n\"All ballots are counted on Election Day,\" the state agency says in an explainer on vote counts.\nPennsylvania also does not count absentee ballots until Election Day.\nAnother key battleground, Michigan, has expanded early voting efforts with early voting centers open and is allowing local clerks to count them ahead of time — though results will not be posted until election night.\nSTORED IN A VAULTIn Montana (where there is a key U.S. Senate race and ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution), Gallatin County — which includes Bozeman, Big Sky and Belgrade — will count some absentee votes on Monday as allowed by state law, according to Eric Semerad, who serves as county clerk and elections administrator.\n\"We will start counting ballots on Monday, Nov. 4. State law allows counties of our size to start counting the day before Election Day, but only until 5 p.m.,\" Semerad said. \"We will then start counting again the morning of Election Day and won't stop until we are finished. Likely this will be sometime late Wednesday.\"\nHe said 63,500 absentee ballots have been sent out for this election. Close to 71,000 people voted in Gallatin County in 2020.\nSemerad did outline some of the procedures and security measures for counting and securing ballots.\n\"We will begin opening the secrecy envelopes and removing the ballots on Thursday, October 31st,\" he said. \"All ballots that are opened are kept in large security bags by ballot style which are sealed every night with numbered seals that are logged every time they are sealed or unsealed. Ballots are stored in our office vault that is monitored by a security camera.\"\nState law requires localities to keep counting voting ballots election night.\nSemerad said the first set of unofficial results won't be posted online until all voters have finished voting. Voting could continue after polls close if there are long lines.\n'CHAIN OF CUSTODY'In Florida, there are ballot measures to legalize marijuana for recreational use and to codify abortion rights into the state constitution superseding state restrictions passed after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\nUnder state law, those measures have to get more than 60% of the vote.\nLeah Valenti, supervisor of elections in Charlotte County in southwest Florida, also ran through some of the processes and protocols for counting early mail-in ballots.\nCharlotte County — which includes Punta Gorda and Port Charlotte — has sent out more than 45,000 mall-in ballots, Valenti said. More than 116,500 voters cast ballots in the county in 2020.\nShe said mail-in ballots are date-stamped, voters' identities are confirmed and ballot envelopes are batched and counts are reconciled daily.\nThey are stored in a secured room.\n\"Unlike the other office doors which have key card access (RFID), the mail ballots are stored in a dual authenticated secure room, which is under video surveillance. The ballots are stored there until they are opened and counted during a public meeting of the Canvassing Board,\" Valenti said.\nShe said voting equipment goes through accuracy testing before ballots are tallied, a new auditing system is being deployed this year and there other \"election integrity protocols.\"\n\"For instance, any time election materials are transported, two election workers from opposing political parties are required to sign off on chain of custody forms. This ensures transparency and accountability from all sides,\" Valenti said.\nNOT CONNECTEDIn Oregon (where all ballots are submitted by mail), Rochelle Long, Klamath County Clerk in the southern part of the state, said counts are done daily leading up to the election with results posted starting election night.\nKlamath County has sent out more than 51,500 ballots for the general election. Just over 36,700 voters cast ballots in the 2020 presidential race in the more rural and conservative county, where Trump carried close to 69% of the vote.\nLong said the voting counting process is public and can be seen on livestream in a number of Oregon jurisdictions. There are also safeguards, including multi-party presence during vote counts and transparency for the machine that tallies votes.\n\"The tally machine is not connected to any outside network,\" she said. \"The vote tally machine is in a locked room on camera and can be viewed publicly via live stream.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester Republicans, eager for change, rally behind Trump as results come in\n\n November 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 660\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — As Sen. Johnny Mautz said his goodbyes just before 9 p.m. at a Tuesday night Dorchester Republican Central Committee watch party, he left saying the three words that became a rallying cry this election cycle for Donald Trump's presidential campaign — \"fight, fight, fight.\"Attendees cheered and carried on that optimism before calling it a night, just hours before the former president claimed victory over Democratic opponent Kamala Harris. While some sighed in disappointment when Democrat Angela Alsobrooks clinched the U.S. Senate seat over Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan, the hopes for a Donald Trump victory remained high.\nEarlier Tuesday evening, Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) implored around 30 Republicans gathered for the watch party in a Bay Country Security garage to carry on the values and messages of the Republican Party — no matter the eventual results.\n\"That message has got to carry on, whether it's one house, two houses, all three, or God forbid, none,\" Mautz said. \"We've got to be prepared for whatever is coming to us, because there is no walking away. There's no ignoring the reality of the division that's in our country right now.\"\n\"Make sure we just keep pounding home the priorities and the principles of what our country is founded on, and we're going to succeed,\" he continued. \"And we'll do it because of you guys.\"\nBill Travers, from East New Market, voted for Trump and felt optimistic while watching the race. He paid close attention to the swing states as numbers came in, standing up to celebrate when he saw Trump hold leads in Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, three states the Republican candidate later won.\nTravers said his support for the former president was never in doubt. He wants to see change in office, disappointed with the country's trajectory under President Joe Biden.\n\"It's a no-brainer,\" Travers said. \"We need new leadership.\"\nWhile Travers thinks Trump \"needs to be a little more humble,\" he said the president-elect aligns with his stance against abortion as well as alleviating his concerns regarding gas prices and interest rates.\nTyler Sears, a 17-year-old from Dorchester County, watched closely, with future college endeavors and worries about paying bills among the practical issues on his mind. When asked if he felt the national election would impact his immediate future, Sears said \"without a doubt.\"\nThe high school senior saw Trump as the candidate who would most benefit him moving forward, saying he likely would've voted Trump if he was 18.\n\"I'm praying it's Trump,\" Sears said.\nMany hoped Tuesday's election would bring not just a second Trump presidency, but a calming in political division.\nCambridge resident Sandra Potter, 79, was rooting for Trump. She said she's \"never seen an election like this,\" noting the divisiveness it's created and the relationships with friends and family it's splintered.\nTwo of her children, one a Democrat and one a Republican, disagreed with one another this cycle but still remained on friendly terms. That's something Potter wants to see on a larger scale.\n\"It's time we pick ourselves up by the bootstraps and move forward,\" Potter said. \" … I hope we never see this discord again. I hope we learn from this election.\"\nThough the watch party's focus was largely directed at the presidential battle, Mautz said in an interview that he noticed a \"super high level of attention\" on local and national races on Election Day.\n\"I think the intensity of the national election has intensified all of the candidacies,\" Mautz said.\nAs the night grew older, members of the Dorchester County Republican Central Committee and local Republicans celebrated Trump's win in Texas, with one attendee shouting, \"God bless Texas.\" It gave Trump a 178-113 lead in the electoral college, an advantage he never relinquished.\nAdorned in a camo 'Ultra MAGA' cap, Potter vowed that despite what she views as tiring political rhetoric from both sides of the aisle, Trump was her preferred choice to assume the role as the country's next commander-in-chief.\n\"I think he does absolutely take care of our country,\" Potter said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Many election results known by Wednesday, some races still awaiting final counts\n\n November 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WENDY WEITZEL wweitzel@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 652\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Election night produced some decisive victories on the Mid-Shore, in Maryland and throughout the nation. Despite predictions that it may take several days before results were known, by Wednesday morning, many races had been called, though some ballots remained to be counted.Donald Trump secured his presidential victory when Wisconsin was called in the early hours of Wednesday, culminating the former president's comeback campaign that outperformed expectations.\nGoing into election night, many predicted it might take days for the results of the presidential election to be tallied. Trump performed better than he did during the 2020 election against President Joe Biden. His Democratic opponent for the seat, Kamala Harris, was unable to carry the necessary votes in swing states to secure her victory.\n\"I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president,\" Trump told cheering supporters in Mar a Lago, Florida, Tuesday night before his victory was confirmed.\nIn the closely watched race to replace outgoing U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Democrat Angela Alsobrooks faced Republican Larry Hogan, a former Maryland governor. The race was expected to be close going into election night, but the Associated Press called the race for Alsobrooks just hours after polls closed in the state.\nAlsobrooks, the current Prince George's County executive, took the lead as precincts began reporting results Tuesday night. With nearly all precincts reporting, as of Wednesday she had collected about 52% of votes to Hogan's 45%, a wide enough margin that the remaining mail-in and provisional ballots to be tallied will not change the outcome.\nAlsobrooks' victory marked a historic moment for the state — the election of its first Black female senator. She, along with Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, will join only a handful of Black women who have served in the office when she takes her oath of office in January.\n\"Now, it's remarkable to think that in two years, America will celebrate its 250th birthday, and in all those years, there have been more than 2,000 people who have served in the United States Senate, and only three have looked like me,\" Alsobrooks said on stage at her watch party in College Park Tuesday night.\nU.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) secured his reelection to Maryland's 1st District Congressional seat, a position he has held since 2010.\nHarris, who represents the Eastern Shore, had secured 62.8% of the vote in his race as of Wednesday morning, defeating Democratic challenger Blane Miller. About 82% of ballots in the district had been counted at that time.\nBut while some victories were able to be called, others need to wait until more ballots have been canvassed. In Maryland, election judges will tally remaining mail-in and provisional ballots over the next few weeks.\nAmong the races still too close to definitively call are all three Talbot County Board of Education races. Cynthia Marrah Jurrius led the District 6 race by just 46 votes as of Wednesday morning. The county's other Board of Education races had only a few hundred votes separating the candidates.\nAfter polls closed at 8 p.m. Tuesday, unofficial votes from the day were made available on the state board of elections website. Those results included early voting totals, mail-in ballots canvassed prior to Election Day and vote tallies from Tuesday.\nProvisional ballots will be canvassed on Wednesday, Nov. 13. Counting of mail-in ballots ends on Friday, Nov. 15.\nThere were more than 6,000 mail-in ballots requested in Talbot County, of which 3,273 had been accepted as of Tuesday. In Caroline County, more than 2,400 mail-in ballots were requested and 880 had been accepted. More than 3,300 mail-in ballots were sent to Dorchester County voters. Dorchester County will not begin canvassing mail-in votes until Thursday.\nOfficial verification of the vote count and certification of Maryland's election is scheduled for Nov. 15. Statewide certification is expected by Dec. 5, within 30 days of the election, as required by law.\nJesse Yeatman contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'I learned to not judge': Veterans Day's origins and contemporary commemorations across the country\n\n November 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff reports | Section: National \n \n 1571\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The origins of Veterans Day in the U.S. date back to 1921 with the burial of an unknown World War I American soldier on a hillside overlooking the Potomac River in Arlington National Cemetery.Britain and France had already memorialized the end of WWI with burials of unknown soldiers and ceremonies on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, the day the war came to an official close.\nWorld War I — or the Great War — saw more 17 million people killed across Europe.\nIt was violent sea change for Europe and the world.\nIt sparked the Russian Revolution, the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Ottoman Empire and the downfall of monarchies across Europe including those countries and Germany. The age of kings, queens and emperors ruling Europe had come to an end.\nThe U.S. entered the war in 1917.\nThe Spanish Flu pandemic, which killed as many as 50 million people.\nThe war was the development of new and deadlier warfare and its aftermath set the stage for the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazis in Germany and horrors of World War II.\nThe war saw the development of tanks, military aircraft, chemical weapons and flamethrowers and the advent of zippers, sanitary pads and napkins, blood banks and trench coats.\nAn annual commemoration of the formal cease fire was first known as Armistice Day.\nA Congressional resolution in 1926 officially named Armistice Day, and it became a national holiday 12 years later.\nBut according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, in 1947 in Birmingham, Alabama, the first celebration under the name Veterans Day was held with parades and other festivities to honor all veterans.\nCommunities throughout the nation, continue the tradition of holding Veterans Day ceremonies.\nThat includes some events at schools and colleges.\nIn Washington state, Big Lake Elementary School's Veterans Day celebration Thursday included a flag retirement ceremony by members of the Naval Air Station Whidbey Island Search and Rescue unit.\nSHARING EXPERIENCESVeterans enrolled in colleges in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, shared their experiences Thursday at a Veterans Day observance event.\nDuring the event, veterans attending the College of The Albrmarle, Mid-Atlantic Christian University, and Elizabeth City State University talked about their military experiences and how their decision to serve their country had affected their lives and career choices.\nBobby Martin, a student at MACU, joined the U.S. Navy after high school in 1977. His dad, a Vietnam era veteran and minister, was his role model, he said. When his dad's colleagues visited their home to enjoy meals and football games, Martin said he heard first-hand accounts about what it meant to serve in the military.\n\"These men were inspirations to me,\" Martin said. \"I have been to the North Pole, Europe, Middle East and East Africa while in the Navy. I'm 66 years old, put my wife and child through school, and now I'm working on my ministry degree at Mid-Atlantic Christian University. \"\nWendra Costly, a U.S. Army veteran now enrolled at COA, recalled how she left the U.S. Army in 2018 wondering what she would do. While her job in the military was in information technology, and there are promising job opportunities in that field, Costly wasn't persuaded IT would provide her with the long-term career she was seeking.\nAnd as a wife and mother of four, Costly said she knew it was important to have a rewarding career with good pay.\n\"I called the aviation department (at COA) and got some information about their program. I finally decided that aviation was the way to go for (me in) our area,\" she said.\nCostly also talked about some of the challenges veterans face when they go back to school.\n\"We are older, and we have had some experiences that a good amount of college adults will not be able to relate to,\" she said.\nBut overcoming challenges is something you learn to do in the military, Costly said.\n\"Just like all the hard things you accomplished in the military like training, running in the rain, heat and cold — we can do them,\" she said.\nMichelle Barnes, who is enrolled at ECSU, spent eight years working as an aviation electronics technician in the U.S. Navy. Barnes said the fear of traveling to unfamiliar places and the potential of having to face danger nearly delayed her decision to enlist.\nBut she's glad she did enlist. Barnes said her job in the Navy was challenging and provided steady pay.\nToday, she's glad she accepted the challenges the military offered. She met her husband, who is currently enlisted, while she was in service. Serving in the military also has helped her pay for her college expenses.\n\"Joining the military was the best decision that I could have ever made at the age of 25,\" Barnes said. \"I decided to embrace all that the Navy had to offer me in honor of those who fought and died for this country's freedom. \"\nBarnes said she will graduate in 2026 with a bachelor of science degree in aviation science with a concentration in professional aeronautics and a minor in unmanned aerial systems.\nCatherine Edmonds, ECSU's interim chancellor, applauded her colleagues at MACU and COA for helping area veterans return to school to learn new skills. She also thanked the veterans who attended the event.\n\"Although we work every day to assist and honor our veterans, today is set aside specifically to recognize all of our veterans for their service and sacrifices,\" she said. \"We are a military-friendly university, proud to continue a tradition of excellence serving military members, veterans, and their families.\"\nBane Angles, vice president of student services at MACU and also a veteran, said he was impressed by the student veterans' stories. He also was glad, he said, that the city's three institutions of higher education could come together and offer an event like Thursday's.\n\"There are many important lessons I learned from serving in the military,\" Angles said. \"Not least of these is the importance of unity. No matter where a person is from, what accent they have, what race they are, or creed they follow, all are part of something bigger.\n\"In a society that is too divided for many reasons, we can learn from our armed forces that a higher purpose brings us together in unity. I pray for the day when our country is not divided but is united,\" Angles said.\nCOA President Jack Bagwell said the community college was proud to host Thursday's event. He also applauded the veterans in the audience for their service and urged them to help the college serve them better.\n\"We believe we can get better everyday,\" he said. \"With you helping us there are things we have not thought of yet that will serve you better. Please share those. We are always open to your feedback. We're certainly open to how we can be more military friendly.\"\nBAND OF BROTHERSIn Ohio, Athens High School held a special assembly for its students to talk and hear from local veterans.\nMelissa Myers, student council advisor and a French teacher at Athens High, said the event is important.\nMyers recounted when she volunteered at an assisted living home while in high school and formed a bond with a Belgian woman who'd lived through the World Wars and how it changed her perspective.\n\"You can study history and read books and watch movies, but you never truly get an understanding of what people have gone through,\" Myers said. \"It's (about) making those stories come to life and having a better appreciation.\"\nMyers' perspective is also shaped by her father, who served in the Army National Guard.\n\"Hopefully for our high school students it helps our young people understand, no matter what your positions are on various things, everyone who serves, they're serving their country. It's one single vision,\" she said.\nThe main event at the Veterans Day assembly was a speech from Chad Springer, associate superintendent at the local school district and a former U.S. Army sergeant.\nSpringer felt it was important to share his experience with the students, even if he personally prefers to celebrate Veterans Day quietly.\n\"Some veterans like to go to the public events and things like that,\" Springer said. \"Generally, I don't, because service is very personal to me, because all of us had our own reasons for serving.\"\nSpringer told the story of his uncles, Bob and Howard. Howard was a United States Army Ranger during the Second World War, while Bob served in the Army during the Korean War. Bob was able to rise to the rank of sergeant first class in three years, an impressive feat that would've taken years to achieve during peacetime, but he carried the scars of Korea with him for the rest of his life.\n\"Most of the family saw him as a larger than life man with a short fuse, a quick temper and a love of the drink,\" Springer explained.\nSpringer said that serving in the military and experiencing the challenges of military service gave him a different perspective on his Uncle Bob than the rest of his family had and that had he not served, he would've remembered his uncles very differently.\n\"I learned to not judge lest ye be judged, because when it came down to it, we were all needed by each other. I became a brother to those around me,\" Springer said, recounting his time in the Army. \"When someone needed me, their needs were met. When I needed something, others were always there for me. It instilled in myself a sense of community and belonging that I have never felt before nor since.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The celebrity endorsements might have fed into that narrative.\nTrump carried majorities of Hispanic men and white women and made gains with first-time voters and Hispanic women.\nTrump ended up carrying Electoral College battlegrounds and won the popular votes. Harris' also lost some voters on either side of the war in the Middle East between Israel and Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah.\nSupporters of Israel don't trust Harris after she snubbed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress in August.\nArab American, Muslim and antiwar voters are upset with Harris and Biden over U.S. military support for Israel and the number of deaths in Gaza in the war that sparked after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attacks.\nTrump did enjoy some celebrity backers including Danica Patrick, Brett Favre, Hulk Hogan, Kid Rock, James Woods, Joe Rogan, Dana White and 'Dr. Phil' McGraw. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Voter turnout: 13M more nonvoters than Trump backers; Harris got 10% fewer votes than Biden\n\n November 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: News \n \n 1205\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n More than 89 million voting eligible Americans didn't vote in the 2024 elections, according to the latest tallies collected by the University of Florida's Election Lab.That accounts for more than 36.4% of the U.S. total electorate of 244.7 million people (voters and nonvoters).\nThere are still some votes being counted in California and Arizona.\nBut as it stands as of Thursday, Nov. 14, there were 13.2 million more nonvoters than supporters of now President-elect Donald Trump in the 2024 White House race.\nTrump — who defeated Vice President Kamala Harris — has received close to 75.9 million votes, according to tallies Thursday from The Associated Press.\nThat accounts for just over 50% of the popular vote. But if nonvoters are included Trump got 31% of the electorate (voting and nonvoting).\nHarris, the sitting U.S. vice president, has received close to 72.9 million votes, as of Thursday's counts.\nThat is more than 16.2 million fewer votes than the number of non-voters. As it stands, Harris got 29.7% of the total U.S. electorate.\nHarris was installed at the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden was pressured by Democratic Party leaders and donors to quit the race in late July over concerns about his advanced age. There were some polls showing U.S. voters viewing that installation as 'undemocratic.'\nBiden got close to 81.3 million in 2020 when he defeated Trump. That is more than 8.3 million more votes than Harris got in 2024. There were also more than 4.1 million fewer voters overall in 2024 compared to 2020.\nAni Ruhil, associate dean for research and planning and professor at Ohio University's Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Service, said ongoing vote counts could impact final turnout figures.\nBut Ruhil sees lower turnout as a key trend line in the 2024 race that saw Trump return to the White House.\n\"Only seven states exceeded their 2020 turnout rate — Georgia, Michigan, North Dakota, Vermont and Wisconsin,\" Ruhil said. \"Washington, D.C., had an especially poor showing compared to 2020. So did Oregon, New Jersey, Maryland, Alaska, Illinois, and Utah.\"\nThe number of voters casting ballots in 2024 was down 11.6% in New Jersey, 11.2% in Illinois, 8.9% in Oregon and 4.6% in Washington state compared to 2020.\nNationally, turnout stands at 63.6%, according to the University of Florida. Ruhil said turnout in 2020 — which totaled 66.6% nationally — was a political aberration.\nThe Biden-Trump 2020 race occurred in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw more than 1.1 million deaths in the U.S., millions of workers facing job cuts and reduced hours, mask mandates and closures of schools, business and social events.\n\"Turnout was fanned by fear and anger,\" he said.\n\"In comes President Biden, with the singular charge of steering the country through the pandemic, and of making sure the economy did not fall to pieces. But by 2023, as we came out of the pandemic, inflation had taken its toll. Now was not the fear of a virus, but rather of gaping holes in the pocketbook. But there was no comforting plan being put forth by the White House,\" Ruhil continued.\nHe sees some voter fatigue with continued efforts by federal and state prosecutors to go after Trump.\nSeventy percent of voters said the U.S. is headed in the wrong direction, with two-thirds stressed about inflation and the economy. Prices are up more than 20% since the pandemic and from when Biden and Harris took office in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nVoters worried about the economy and high prices favored Trump in the 2024 race, according to exit polls.\nThe war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks also challenged Harris.\nAnti-war voters (including Muslims and Arab Americans) are upset with U.S. military support for Israel. In the other corner, supporters of Israel (including more conservative Jewish voters) didn't trust Harris to continue U.S. support for Israel . The U.S. has allocated $17.9 billion war aid to Israel since Hamas's 2023 attacks, according to Brown University.\nHarris got just over 80,000 fewer votes in Michigan, where the Israel-Hamas war is an issue for Arab-American and Muslim voters, than Biden 2020.\nShe lost to Trump by just over 80,600 votes in Michigan.\nRuhil said the enthusiasm was let out of the turnout balloon for many Democratic voters.\n\"The late switch, fevered fundraising, and a hastily assembled campaign did nothing to instill confidence,\" he said, stressing the lack of a convincing economic message from Harris.\nHarris' campaign raised more than $1 billion and had another $649 million in backing from outside groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Trump raised $381.5 million and was aided by $711 million in outside spending, according to CRP.\nHarris' campaign focused heavily on support for abortion rights, casting Trump as a fascist threat to democracy and procuring celebrity endorsements including Oprah Winfrey, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce, Willie Nelson and Bruce Springsteen.\nThe effort fell short with Harris underperforming Biden by 8.4 million votes (or 10.3%) nationally. She saw lower turnout or flat support levels in key Electoral College battlegrounds that Trump won.\nHarris got 6.6% fewer votes than Biden in Arizona.\nThere was also the dynamic of Trump carrying states such as Montana, Missouri, Arizona and Florida, where there were abortion rights measures also on the ballot.\nThose measures all passed and in Florida an abortion rights measure got 57% of the vote (failing to meet the state's 60% threshold). Trump got 56% of the vote.\nIn Montana, Trump carried the state with 58%. An abortion rights measure got the same percentage.\nTrump favors allowing states to decide the abortion issue versus Harris, who backs nationally enshrining abortion rights.\nAbortion rights groups were among the top backers of Harris.\n\"This result is devastating. There has been no greater champion for reproductive freedom than Vice President Kamala Harris,\" said Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, a leading abortion rights advocacy group.\n\"We know the American people are with us, and they showed us that when they passed ballot measures and elected candidates in key states to protect their rights, said Timmaraju, who worries about Trump and the GOP in charge of the White House and Congress.\nHarris and Democrats had hoped for a wave of women voters supporting abortion rights in the race against Trump.\nBut exit polls showed Trump carrying a majority of white women who voted, and voters were more evenly split on which presidential candidate they trusted on the abortion issue than in pre-election polls.\nAbortion rights opponents argue Harris' focus on expansive abortion rights turned off some voters.\n\"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz support abortion anytime, anywhere, and under any circumstances. Supported by the abortion industry and its allies, Harris and Walz campaigned with fanatical fervor on abortion — and the voters rejected them,\" said Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life.\nTrump carried 58% of the Catholic vote versus 40% for Harris, according to NBC News exit polls. In 2020, Biden and Trump were evenly split with Catholics (49% to 50%), according to the Associated Press.\nTrump won 63% of the votes from white working class women, made inroads with Hispanics (especially Hispanic men) and edged Harris with working class households, according to NBC News exit polls.\nAccording to the University of Florida, there were 15.5 million fewer early votes in 2024 compared to 2020 (85.9 million versus 101.45 million).\nThat's a 15% drop. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lessons learned in the presidential election\n\n November 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 775\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Even before he is sworn into office in January, Donald Trump has firmly secured a prominent place in American history books.He is only the second president in U.S. history elected to two nonconsecutive terms.\nThe road to that Outcome was a long and winding one.\nIt was a road where Trump repeatedly challenged conventional wisdom and proved it to be wrong at every step of the way.\nBelow is a recap of conventional wisdom from the 2024 presidential election with conventional wisdom being defined as a widely accepted assumption and prediction.\nBelow each conventional wisdom is a recap of actual Outcomes relative to conventional wisdom.\nConvential Wisdom: Donald Trump was finished in politics due to being impeached twice in the U.S. House of Representatives during his first presidential term, federal criminal indictments (still pending), and state felony convictions (still being appealed).\nOutcome: With a combination of resilience, determination and perseverance, Trump triumphed over 15 Republicans for the Republican Party's 2024 presidential nomination.\nConvential Wisdom: In a June debate between Biden and Trump, both would deliver solid performances.\nOutcome: Biden's debate performance was arguably the worst in history.\nConvential Wisdom: Despite his debate performance, Biden would stay in a reelection grudge match with Trump.\nOutcome: In July, Biden abruptly withdrew his bid for reelection and immediately endorsed Kamala Harris, a move that led to her being the Democratic Party's standard bearer.\nConvential Wisdom: Harris would not do well in her only debate with Trump.\nOutcome: Harris exceeded expectations which gave her campaign a much-needed boost.\nConvential Wisdom: There would be at least one \"October surprise\" from the Biden administration.\nOutcome: An \"October surprise\" came early but not from the Biden administration. It came in July when Trump narrowly escaped death from an assassination attempt.\nConvential Wisdom: Harris could mobilize support from women voters with two campaign messages. One was a message used very effectively by Democratic candidates in the 2022 midterm elections — vote against Republicans as they are not pro-choice on abortion. The second message was now women voters had another opportunity to elect a woman as president of the United States.\nOutcome: More women than the Harris campaign expected concluded that the state of the economy and high levels of inflation were their top concerns. Concurrently, they also concluded that despite electing a woman for president of the United States was a long-awaited opportunity, Kamala Harris was not that woman.\nConvential Wisdom: Trump would experience the same lack of support from working class voters, urban voters, Black voters, young voters, Asian voters and Jewish voters that Republican presidential candidates have historically experienced.\nOutcome: Trump's support from all these groups exceeded all expectations. He won the \"blue wall\" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin as well as four other \"swing states.\"\nConvential Wisdom: Despite being fiercely loyal to President Biden and all of his progressive policies for almost four years, Kamala Harris could tell voters she would be a very different president than Biden.\nOutcome: Voters rejected that messaging after Harris answered a question on what she would do differently from President Biden with: \"Nothing that I can think of.\" U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders also cast aspersions on her integrity when he said publicly Harris was a progressive who would say whatever she needed to say to get elected.\nConvential Wisdom: Kamala Harris' running mate, Tim Walz, could help offset Trump campaign messages that Harris has been and is a radical San Francisco California progressive. Walz could be branded as a quintessential American \"everyman\" — a former high school teacher, former high school football coach, military veteran, former member of Congress and now governor of Minnesota.\nOutcome: Walz was quickly and negatively viewed by voters as not ready for prime time due to frequent verbal gaffes and his answers (misleading at best) to questions about his background, especially his military service record.\nConvential Wisdom: The November election popular vote outcome was expected to be a tossup that could result in a narrow popular vote win for either candidate.\nOutcome: Trump won with 50.38% of the popular vote compared to 47.96% of the popular vote for Harris.\nConvential Wisdom: The November election Electoral College vote outcome was expected to be a tossup that could result in a narrow Electoral College win for either candidate.\nOutcome: With 270 Electoral College votes needed to win, Trump received 312 Electoral College votes compared to Harris' 226 Electoral College votes. Trump was the first Republican president elected since 2004 to win both the popular vote and the Electoral College vote.\nGoing forward, the 2024 presidential election confirmed two absolute truths about conventional wisdom for political candidates, campaigns, pundits, voters and others.\nNever assume anything will happen at any until the polls close on Election Day.\nAnything may happen at any time until the polls close on Election Day. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "What lessons did we learn from the election?\n\n November 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Columns \n \n 669\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n What did we learn from the majority of America's voters on Nov. 5?We learned that the majority of America's voters want border security. Americans are tired of millions of undocumented people from any place in the world flooding into America. We want them to come legally. The reports of gangs growing in our cities, apartment buildings taken over, murders and rampant stabbings have been an emotional weight from which Americans want relief.\nAmericans are tired of spending more money at the grocery store and coming home with fewer products. Every week brings price increases, and Americans pay checks are not keeping up. Employers have been suffering to keep employees who are desperate for higher wages.\nEmployers can no longer get by with $10 or $12 an hour as the new expected minimum wage has become at least $15. To keep a good employee though will take $20 an hour if you want them to stay. This has put a strain on small businesses in America who are struggling to produce enough income to pay workers and keep the lights on. The cost of goods must decrease and wages have to stabilize.\nAmericans want lower interest rates. A 6% house loan is still making in tough on America's homebuyers. A 30-year mortgage on a $450,000 house is $2,158.38 if you have $90,000 to put down. A six-year car payment on a $45,000 car is $596.62 if you put $9,000 down. Most Americans need a house and car. So you see the reason why people are desperate to make more money. Add on to this a $1,200 a month grocery bill for a family of four.\nAmericans have grown weary hearing about male athletes in women's sports. We are also tired of hearing about men in women's bathrooms.\nAmericans also displayed their disdain for legacy media. I personally thought it would be tough for Trump to overcome all the major networks. I didn't see how anyone could beat NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN and MSNBC, the New York Times, The Washington Post and almost every other major media entity in the nation, but he did. He beat them good.\nOne network supported Trump throughout the entire election, and it was Fox News. On election night they had the highest ratings of all the networks. The majority of America's voters no longer believe much of what they hear on America's major media networks, which is sad since we all pay so much in subscriptions to access these stations.\nTrump spent three hours with Joe Rogan on a podcast that reached millions of Rogan's viewers. Harris didn't have time for Rogan. Look for many more podcasters to grow in influence in the days ahead.\nWe learned that women did go to polls to vote, and many of them voted for Trump.\nKamala Harris had over $1 billion to spend on her election The networks were flooded with political ads, and it still wasn't enough. Sadly, it's reported that her campaign is $20 million in debt with no way in sight to cover outstanding costs. The big parties and celebrity gatherings were massively expensive. No cost was curbed. A billion dollars was spent without concern or limitation. Can you imagine how she would have handled the nation's finances and run our country?\nWe also learned that national celebrities don't impress America's voters all that much. They will pay thousands to hear Taylor Swift sing, but her support of Kamala Harris was overall ignored. Many of Swift's followers aren't old enough to vote. Oprah Winfrey, Beyonce, George Clooney, Bruce Springsteen, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Julia Roberts, etc., etc. are all-star entertainers, but the average person in America just wasn't swayed by them when it came time to vote.\nThe election is over. Let's pray that Congress will work together to end the wars in the world, lower inflation, make medical care available for all people on all levels of their need. Let's pray for a safe and peaceful America where people are entering our country legally and safely and for four years of prosperity and peace. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Voter turnout: 13M more nonvoters than Trump backers; Harris got 10% fewer votes than Biden;\n\n November 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: News \n \n 1204\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n More than 89 million voting eligible Americans didn't vote in the 2024 elections, according to the latest tallies collected by the University of Florida's Election Lab.That accounts for more than 36.4% of the U.S. total electorate of 244.7 million people (voters and nonvoters).\nThere are still some votes being counted in California and Arizona.\nBut as it stands as of Thursday, Nov. 14, there were 13.2 million more nonvoters than supporters of now President-elect Donald Trump in the 2024 White House race.\nTrump — who defeated Vice President Kamala Harris — has received close to 75.9 million votes, according to tallies Thursday from The Associated Press.\nThat accounts for just over 50% of the popular vote. But if nonvoters are included Trump got 31% of the electorate (voting and nonvoting).\nHarris, the sitting U.S. vice president, has received close to 72.9 million votes, as of Thursday's counts.\nThat is more than 16.2 million fewer votes than the number of non-voters. As it stands, Harris got 29.7% of the total U.S. electorate.\nHarris was installed at the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden was pressured by Democratic Party leaders and donors to quit the race in late July over concerns about his advanced age. There were some polls showing U.S. voters viewing that installation as 'undemocratic.'\nBiden got close to 81.3 million in 2020 when he defeated Trump. That is more than 8.3 million more votes than Harris got in 2024. There were also more than 4.1 million fewer voters overall in 2024 compared to 2020.\nAni Ruhil, associate dean for research and planning and professor at Ohio University's Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Service, said ongoing vote counts could impact final turnout figures.\nBut Ruhil sees lower turnout as a key trend line in the 2024 race that saw Trump return to the White House.\n\"Only seven states exceeded their 2020 turnout rate – Georgia, Michigan, North Dakota, Vermont and Wisconsin,\" Ruhil said. \"Washington, D.C., had an especially poor showing compared to 2020. So did Oregon, New Jersey, Maryland, Alaska, Illinois, and Utah.\"\nThe number of voters casting ballots in 2024 was down 11.6% in New Jersey, 11.2% in Illinois, 8.9% in Oregon and 4.6% in Washington state compared to 2020.\nNationally, turnout stands at 63.6%, according to the University of Florida. Ruhil said turnout in 2020 — which totaled 66.6% nationally — was a political aberration.\nThe Biden-Trump 2020 race occurred in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw more than 1.1 million deaths in the U.S., millions of workers facing job cuts and reduced hours, mask mandates and closures of schools, business and social events.\n\"Turnout was fanned by fear and anger,\" he said.\n\"In comes President Biden, with the singular charge of steering the country through the pandemic, and of making sure the economy did not fall to pieces. But by 2023, as we came out of the pandemic, inflation had taken its toll. Now was not the fear of a virus, but rather of gaping holes in the pocketbook. But there was no comforting plan being put forth by the White House,\" Ruhil continued.\nHe sees some voter fatigue with continued efforts by federal and state prosecutors to go after Trump.\nSeventy percent of voters said the U.S. is headed in the wrong direction, with two-thirds stressed about inflation and the economy. Prices are up more than 20% since the pandemic and from when Biden and Harris took office in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nVoters worried about the economy and high prices favored Trump in the 2024 race, according to exit polls.\nThe war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks also challenged Harris.\nAnti-war voters (including Muslims and Arab Americans) are upset with U.S. military support for Israel. In the other corner, supporters of Israel (including more conservative Jewish voters) didn't trust Harris to continue U.S. support for Israel. The U.S. has allocated $17.9 billion war aid to Israel since Hamas' 2023 attacks, according to Brown University.\nHarris got just over 80,000 fewer votes in Michigan, where the Israel-Hamas war is an issue for Arab-American and Muslim voters, than Biden 2020.\nShe lost to Trump by just over 80,600 votes in Michigan.\nRuhil said the enthusiasm was let out of the turnout balloon for many Democratic voters.\n\"The late switch, fevered fundraising, and a hastily assembled campaign did nothing to instill confidence,\" he said, stressing the lack of a convincing economic message from Harris.\nHarris' campaign raised more than $1 billion and had another $649 million in backing from outside groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Trump raised $381.5 million and was aided by $711 million in outside spending, according to CRP.\nHarris' campaign focused heavily on support for abortion rights, casting Trump as a fascist threat to democracy and procuring celebrity endorsements including Oprah Winfrey, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce, Willie Nelson and Bruce Springsteen.\nThe effort fell short with Harris underperforming Biden by 8.4 million votes (or 10.3%) nationally. She saw lower turnout or flat support levels in key Electoral College battlegrounds that Trump won.\nHarris got 6.6% fewer votes than Biden in Arizona.\nThere was also the dynamic of Trump carrying states such as Montana, Missouri, Arizona and Florida, where there were abortion rights measures also on the ballot.\nThose measures all passed and in Florida an abortion rights measure got 57% of the vote (failing to meet the state's 60% threshold). Trump got 56% of the vote.\nIn Montana, Trump carried the state with 58%. An abortion rights measure got the same percentage.\nTrump favors allowing states to decide the abortion issue versus Harris, who backs nationally enshrining abortion rights.\nAbortion rights groups were among the top backers of Harris.\n\"This result is devastating. There has been no greater champion for reproductive freedom than Vice President Kamala Harris,\" said Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, a leading abortion rights advocacy group.\n\"We know the American people are with us, and they showed us that when they passed ballot measures and elected candidates in key states to protect their rights, said Timmaraju, who worries about Trump and the GOP in charge of the White House and Congress.\nHarris and Democrats had hoped for a wave of women voters supporting abortion rights in the race against Trump.\nBut exit polls showed Trump carrying a majority of white women who voted, and voters were more evenly split on which presidential candidate they trusted on the abortion issue than in pre-election polls.\nAbortion rights opponents argue Harris' focus on expansive abortion rights turned off some voters.\n\"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz support abortion anytime, anywhere, and under any circumstances. Supported by the abortion industry and its allies, Harris and Walz campaigned with fanatical fervor on abortion — and the voters rejected them,\" said Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life.\nTrump carried 58% of the Catholic vote versus 40% for Harris, according to NBC News exit polls. In 2020, Biden and Trump were evenly split with Catholics (49% to 50%), according to the Associated Press.\nTrump won 63% of the votes from white working class women, made inroads with Hispanics (especially Hispanic men) and edged Harris with working class households, according to NBC News exit polls.\nAccording to the University of Florida, there were 15.5 million fewer early votes in 2024 compared to 2020 (85.9 million versus 101.45 million).\nThat's a 15% drop. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Protecting kids online or social media censorship?: The year-end push for and against the Kids Online Safety Act\n\n November 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: News \n \n 934\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Attorneys general from 30 states (and from both political parties) are pressing Congress to pass a measure aimed at protecting kids from harmful content online.But free speech advocates worry the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) will lead to censorship, including restricting controversial and unpopular speech that should enjoy First Amendment protections.\nOn Nov. 18, the 30 attorneys general — including Republicans Austin Knudsen of Montana, Ashley Moody of Florida, Sean Reyes of Utah and Bridget Hill of Wyoming, and Democrats Letitia James of New York, Anthony Brown of Maryland, Kathleen Jennings of Delaware and Keith Ellison of Minnesota — wrote congressional leaders advocating for KOSA's full passage before the end of the year.\nThe bill passed the U.S. Senate in July but has faced some roadblocks in the U.S. House of Representatives. Congress is currently in a lame-duck period after the Nov. 5 election but before President-elect Donald Trump and a new GOP-controlled Congress take office.\nThe latest version of the bill requires social media and online companies to install \"mandatory default safety settings\" related to minors under the age of 16, and requires social media and online platforms to restrict sexual content aimed at minors, online bullying, and content that promotes self harm, illegal drug use or substance abuse.\nThe measure also looks to further restrict sexual predators and sex traffickers online.\n\"Many social media platforms target minors, resulting in a national youth mental health catastrophe. These platforms make their products addictive to minor users, and then profit from selling minor user data to advertisers. These platforms fail to disclose the addicting nature of their products, nor the harms associated with increased social media use. Instead, minor users receive endless tailored and toxic content,\" the attorneys general wrote in their letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and other congressional leaders.\nThey want KOSA passed and approved by President Joe Biden before the end of the year and before a new Congress and Trump take office in January and the legislative process starts over.\nAn amended bill before the House better partners with state-level social media pushes, the attorneys general contend, allows users to disable or block some social media content and looks to restrict online content that is detrimental to kids' mental health.\nBut the latter aim and some of KOSA's other provisions worry free speech advocates. They say the bill — with its laudable title — could be used to censor content that should be protected by First Amendment free speech guarantees.\nGreg Gonzalez, legislative counsel for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), said the federal bill \"presents some very serious free speech and First Amendment concerns.\"\nFIRE and other free speech groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, oppose the bill and argue it will step on kids' First Amendment rights.\n\"Even if it is speech people don't like, it's speech that deserves First Amendment protections,\" Gonzalez said.\nGonzalez sees scenarios where social media platforms will use KOSA to restrict content that is unpopular or controversial under the guise of protecting children and teens and their mental health.\n\"At some point, platforms are going to be overly inclusive,\" he said of the content that could be restricted.\nLarge social media and online companies restricted, blocked and prohibited some users and content that challenged the results of the 2020 U.S. elections and questioned COVID-19 vaccines. Other groups and users with controversial or extreme political or social views have also been banned by social media sites and de-platformed by online companies.\nSome technology companies, including Microsoft, as well as the American Federation of Teachers and parents' groups such as Common Sense Media, back KOSA.\nOther tech groups oppose the federal measure. The Electronic Freedom Foundation said the House version of KOSA \"is still a dangerous online censorship bill\" that \"will coerce the largest social media platforms into blocking or filtering a variety of entirely legal content, and subject a large portion of users to privacy-invasive age verification.\"\nGonzalez also sees age verification efforts — which several states, including Montana, have imposed on pornography sites — raising privacy concerns for minors and adults.\nFIRE also does not like the Federal Trade Commission's potential role in KOSA's implementation.\nGonzalez said he hopes the clock runs out on the measure at the end of the year, and free speech groups promise to challenge KOSA in court if it becomes law.\nThe measure passed the Senate by a 91-3 margin, with support from both sides of the partisan aisle.\n\"Children and teens have been subjected to online harassment, bullying, and other harms for far too long. The Kids Online Safety Act will require social media companies to design their products with the safety of kids and teens in mind, provide parents tools to protect their kids, and give families more options for managing and disconnecting from these platforms,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who backed the bill along with conservative Republicans such as Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee (a top sponsor of the bill along with U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.), Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Steve Daines of Montana.\nU.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., voted against the bill, along with conservative Republican U.S. Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky.\nWyden said earlier this year he worries about KOSA eroding online privacy for kids and teens, and an incoming Trump administration using the law to censor political and social voices it does not like.\n\"I fear KOSA could be used to sue services that offer privacy technologies like encryption or anonymity features that kids rely on to communicate securely and privately without being spied on by predators online,\" said Wyden, explaining his opposition in a social media statement earlier this year. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trump’s return has these conservative Latinos excited\n\n November 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ROBERT STEWART Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 817\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ROCKVILLE — Juan Leo Salazar is on a mission to awaken a dormant political power in Maryland — the state's conservative-leaning Latinos.He has compiled a list of 28,000 names he believes he can galvanize for conservative causes. He says his organization of Maryland Latino Republicans has roughly 300 paying members.\nHe and many of his conservative friends had been working and keeping their heads down, he said. Now they're not afraid of sharing their views, he said, despite possible criticism and even retaliation.\n\"Now that Trump is in,\" Salazar said, \"nobody's afraid.\"\nExit poll data on Latino voters had some analysts' heads spinning. Nationwide, 46% of this group voted for Donald Trump in the general election.\nBut that turnout for Trump was not surprising for some Latino Republicans like Salazar. He and others had watched the ways people in their networks were responding to the Biden-Harris administration and saw the writing on the wall.\nSalazar, who came to the area in the late 60s, has many thoughts on how Trump will benefit folks in Maryland.\nTo start, he praised Trump's promise to cut taxes on tips and overtime as a win for the working-class Latino community.\n\"Now with the tips, no tax on tips. That is wonderful,\" he said, \"you should see how the Latino community, Hispanics, are so happy about (that).\"\nHe also thinks the Republican victory can help improve cultural issues conservatives care about at the state level.\nConnected with Latino Republicans across six counties in Maryland through his organization, Salazar has a good sense of how politically transformative the issue of parental input into school curricula is. He believes it unifies many minority immigrant groups in the state. This, he said, could change the state's political map.\n\"If those (other) minority groups can get organized … with chapters in different counties,\" he said, \"I'm sure we can turn this state at least orange.\"\nBut to strengthen the Republican hand in a state overwhelmingly run by Democrats, you need friends.\nAlirio Martinez is one of Salazar's friends in that mission.\nMartinez, 50, lives in Easton with his wife Ann and their six cats. Outside of his entrepreneurial work — the two have an online business — Martinez enjoys connecting with fellow partisans.\nThe two men met this October outside of an early-voting polling precinct in eastern Montgomery County. Martinez was in the area and wanted to see if his buddy was canvassing. Salazar happened to have a table set up there, where he was doing outreach to the Latino community.\nMartinez said there are a number of reasons why he's hopeful that Trump's return to Washington could help Latinos in the state.\n\"I tell people it's about what's going on, they're hurting people's pockets big time,\" Martinez said. \"They're seeing the price of the eggs, the milk … the gas.\"\nMartinez, who went as a Republican delegate to the Republican National Convention in 2016, said he can remember the time under Trump when his favorite sandwich cost him $5 and when gas prices were more affordable. Things changed under Biden, he believes. \"Everything,\" he said, \"started going up.\"\nInternational politics also plays a role. The two presidential candidates took different stances on the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. Where Trump embraced the so-called \"world's coolest dictator,\" Harris expressed concerns about a decline in the country's democratic institutions.\nMartinez said that many Salvadorans, who comprise the largest foreign-born population in Maryland, were disgruntled with what they perceived as Harris attacking a national hero. He said Bukele has done an amazing job of fighting crime in El Salvador.\nThen, there's the elephant in the room.\nPrior to the elections, immigrant rights groups warned that Trump's return to power would spell devastation for immigrant communities. But both Martinez and Salazar pointed to a greater number of deportations under President Obama than under Trump, in Trump's defense.\n\"When he won in 2016, they were saying the same thing, exactly,\" Martinez said.\nHe also said people should remember that Trump extended Temporary Protected Status to Salvadorans in 2019. Martinez, who perceives Democrats as more lenient towards illegal immigration, believes Harris was worse for immigrants in the state. Trump extended Temporary Protected Status after revoking it in 2018.\n\"There are bad and good people,\" Martinez said.\nHe added that many Latinos in the state support tougher immigration. The vast majority who come to the U.S., he believes, are good and hardworking people. It's the small percentage of undocumented individuals doing bad things in the country, he said, that makes Americans perceive all Latinos as criminals.\nSalazar believes Trump would not undergo mass indiscriminate deportations.\n\"He's not going to do this,\" said Salazar, \"because if that happens, we will be here to say, 'Hey, that's not right.'\"\nBoth men plan on attending Trump's upcoming inauguration on Jan. 20. They both hope to meet the administration and lobby for what they believe is important for Latinos in the state, and they are embracing optimism.\n\"For the Latino community,\" said Salazar, \"there are a lot of good things that are happening.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Race was model for civil discourse in politics\n\n November 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 741\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I, along with countless others, closely followed a recent U.S. Senate election in Pennsylvania.The stakes in this election were extremely high. The outcome was expected to help decide if Republican senators or Democratic senators would have a majority in and control of the Senate for at least the next two years.\nIn this election, voters had a clear choice between two candidates with sharply differing views on President Biden's performance record over the past four years.\nBoth candidates raised and spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising to share their differing views with voters. As a result, voters had numerous opportunities to reach informed decisions on which candidate's views resonated best with their own views.\nPrior to the election, conventional wisdom was incumbent Democratic Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. would win reelection.\nSenator Casey's father, Robert P. Casey Sr., was a popular and still widely revered former governor of Pennsylvania. Casey Jr. was elected to the U.S. Senate three times after being elected once for state treasurer and twice for state auditor general.\nConsistent with many other expected election outcomes this year, conventional wisdom proved to be wrong.\nIt was wrong, in part because Donald Trump's better than expected support in Pennsylvania generated votes (aka coattails) that helped Dave McCormick, Casey's Republican opponent. At the same time, Kamala Harris' lower than expected support in Pennsylvania did not generate enough votes (aka coattails) to help Casey.\nIn any event, the outcome of the election was incredibly close.\nBefore the results were certified, McCormick had 48.8 % of the vote and Casey had 48.6% of the vote. The close results triggered a state law mandating an automatic government-funded recount since the margin of difference was less than 0.5%. The law allows the projected \"losing\" candidate to decline a recount. Not surprisingly, Casey chose not to do so.\nWhile the recount was underway lawyers for both campaigns engaged in aggressive attempts to seek a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling to determine if state law allowed incorrectly dated, undated, incorrectly signed, or unsigned provisional ballots to be counted.\nA majority of the seven-member court ruled in a 4-3 vote that state law was clear that these provisional ballots could not be counted. This majority opinion included two Democratic justices voting no and two Republican justices voting no.\nFollowing the Supreme Court ruling but before a recount was finished, Casey conceded.\nIn his concession speech, Casey thanked the people of Pennsylvania for the privilege of serving them and for placing their trust in him. He said it has been the honor of his lifetime.\nIn his speech, Casey never expressed bitterness or anger over the election outcome, nor did he assign blame for his loss. He did not complain about an aggressive and ultimately successful effort by attorneys with the McCormick campaign to secure the court ruling prohibiting the counting of certain provisional ballots. Casey noted that he followed a long-standing protocol in politics by calling McCormick to congratulate him on his win.\nIn response to Casey's concession call, McCormick released a statement that included the following — \"Senator Bob Casey dedicated his career to bettering our Commonwealth. Dina and I want to extend our sincere gratitude to Senator Casey, Teresa, and their family for their decades of service, hard work, and sacrifice.\"\nIn McCormick's statement, there was no gloating or disparaging remarks about his opponent. He did not complain about an aggressive, extended and ultimately unsuccessful effort by attorneys with the Casey campaign to secure a court ruling allowing the counting of certain provisional ballots.\nSome may say both candidates' post-election remarks were carefully scripted by campaign staff and were insincere at best and at worse masked the candidate's true feelings.\nMaybe so, but I disagree. I believe both candidates' remarks were sincere and from the heart.\nTheir remarks reflected the character of two opposing candidates who ran issue-based campaigns, focused on telling voters about significant differences of their positions on critical issues of the day.\nWhen the election results were finally confirmed almost two weeks after Election Day, both candidates accepted a court ruling (the rule of law), accepted the election results and displayed respect for each other.\nI suggest their actions reflect a small, but long overdue missing commitment to civil discourse in today's contentious and increasingly polarized world.\nThe actions of soon-to-be former Sen. Casey and now Sen.-elect McCormick are a model for civil discourse in the political arena.\nGoing forward, that model should be embraced by every candidate and the supporters of every candidate in every election at every level in America. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "It's too early to call election a realignment\n\n December 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 764\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Following the 2024 presidential election, some political observers have suggested this election was a realignment election that bodes well for Republican presidential candidates and other Republican candidates going forward.Not so fast.\nAny meaningful discussion on that suggestion must include a review of research done by political scientist V.O. Key, a preeminent scholar on American elections and voting behavior.\nKey's criteria for a realignment election includes shifts in party attachment that extends over several presidential elections and appear to be independent of the peculiar factors that influenced the vote at individual elections.\nUsing Key's criteria, a determination if the 2024 presidential election marks the start of a political realignment cannot be made yet. It may be eventually but only if the results of future consecutive elections replicate the results of the 2024 presidential cycle elections.\nFor now, we know the 2024 presidential election was a performance evaluation decision on President Joe Biden's policies and priorities. After Vice President Kamala Harris replaced Biden on the ballot, the election became an opportunity to gauge voter approval on their expectations on policies and priorities in a Harris administration.\nWe also now know the Harris campaign failed to convince a majority of voters that her administration would be different from the Biden administration. Nothing more, nothing less.\n2024 also provided voters with performance evaluation decisions for three long-term incumbent Democratic U.S. senators from Ohio, Pennsylvania and Montana. All three lost in their reelection bids. In West Virginia, a Republican candidate was elected to replace a Democratic incumbent senator who retired in anticipation of losing reelection.\nEventually, the 2024 presidential and U.S. Senate elections may become viewed as the first in a series of elections that taken together, are true realignment elections. The next election cycles that will help answer the realignment question will be the 2026 Congressional mid-term elections and the 2028 presidential election (one unlikely to have an incumbent candidate).\nWhich party will do well going forward will be determined in large part to who responds best to key unanswered questions as well as to lessons learned from the 2024 presidential election.\nFor the Republican Party, key unanswered questions from 2024 include:\nCan they maintain support from the influential and demanding MAGA wing of the party? Some MAGA Republicans are already angry over reports that four Republican senators opposed Matt Gaetz's nomination for attorney general (now withdrawn at Gaetz's request). More importantly, can the Republican Party retain blocs of historically Democratic voters who gave higher levels of support to Trump in 2024 than he received from them in 2016 and 2020. That largely unexpected outcome included to varying degrees, more support for Donald Trump and other down ballot Republican candidates from young Black male voters, Hispanic/Latino voters, young male voters, working class voters and urban voters.\nFor the Democratic Party, key unanswered questions from 2024 include:\nCan they maintain support from the influential and demanding progressive wing of the party? Already, some progressive Democrats are resisting any effort to pivot to more centrist positions on issues such as immigration restrictions, immigration deportations, deficit spending and aid to Israel. More importantly, can the Democratic Party regain blocs of historically Democratic voters who gave lower than anticipated support for Kamala Harris?\nAll things considered, I suggest the most important avenues to future election success for both parties, are candidates who do the best job of executing the following campaign strategies.\nListen intently to the voters. Remember that listening is more than waiting for your turn to talk. Remember to seek first to understand, then seek to be understood.\nRespect what voters are saying, whether or not you agree with them. Meet them where they are, not where you think they should be.\nAccept voter message development counsel from media guru Frank Lunz. \"It's not what you say or write, it is what people hear or read. You can have the best message in the world, but the person on the receiving end will always understand it through the prism of their own emotions, preconceptions, prejudices and preexisting beliefs. Get your audience to visualize … imagine. Only when people can see a better future will they consider a change.\"\nHave confidence your party can deliver measurable results on campaign promises. There is always another election cycle when voters can exercise their right to vote against candidates they perceive to be unresponsive to their views on what matters most to them.\nWith regard to the question of whether the 2024 presidential election was the first in a series of elections that will result in a political realignment that bodes well for Republican presidential candidates as well as other Republican candidates long term, the answers are:\nTo be determined.\nTime will tell. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "NASA says ‘High risk’ Goddard project had unrealistic launch schedule\n\n December 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Shaun Chornobroff and James Matheson Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 610\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — NASA described a plan to launch a multi-billion dollar spacecraft in 2026 as \"overly optimistic and not credible\" in a September letter to Maryland lawmakers that Capital News Service obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.On Sept. 4, NASA informed Congress it was ending the $2 billion OSAM-1 project, which was expected to service existing satellites and expand their lifespans in space, among other capabilities.\nTwelve days after the announcement, nine Maryland lawmakers demanded that NASA explain why it cancelled the project, which was based at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt.\nIn its response, dated Sept. 25, NASA cited numerous risks, an overly ambitious plan and a low return on investment as rationales for ending the project.\n\"The majority of NASA technology demonstrations are less complex and have orders of magnitude lower project lifecycle costs (in the $10 million-$100 million range) than OSAM-1,\" said the letter signed by Alicia Brown, NASA's associate administrator for the office of legislative and intergovernmental affairs. \"Therefore, NASA is willing to take more risk in managing these technology demonstration projects. … OSAM-1 is considered by NASA to be a high cost and highly complex project.\"\nMultiple parts of NASA's response were redacted in the copy of the letter CNS obtained.\nSince its start in 2015, the OSAM-1 project has been subjected to sizable cost increases and delays, leading to NASA first announcing the mission's shutdown on March 1. The agency has stood firm on its decision despite urging from the Congress, especially members of the Maryland delegation.\nThe NASA website for the project says the OSAM-1 mission \"is developing an unprecedented capability for a robust, cost-effective space infrastructure.\"\nDespite NASA's insistence on cancelling the mission, Maryland lawmakers continually have advocated for OSAM-1 to proceed, citing the importance of the project and the efforts of the workers at Goddard. As of Aug. 31, OSAM-1 had 249 contractors and 76 civil servants associated with the project, the letter said.\nIn a statement, Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, as well as Maryland Reps. Steny Hoyer and Glenn Ivey, maintained their criticism of NASA for ending the mission. Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger separately told CNS he concurred with the sentiments of his fellow Democrats.\n\"This critical program provided NASA a distinct solution to a difficult challenge: maintaining our satellites in space,\" the lawmakers said.\n\"With the capabilities being developed by OSAM-1, NASA had the opportunity to both service satellites while still in orbit and extend the useful lives of these valuable assets,\" they said. \"In its shortsighted decision to cancel this mission, NASA has put these important long-term benefits aside, while also undermining the tireless efforts of our Goddard workforce.\"\nAn OSAM-1 independent review estimated development of the mission would cost $1.6 billion, a 200 percent increase since its inception. Originally targeted to launch in 2020, OSAM-1 was years behind schedule.\nCongress provided $227 million for OSAM-1 in the 2024 fiscal year budget and had a 2026 target launch for the spacecraft.\nIn the letter, NASA said any plan for a 2026 launch would involve risks not normally taken for a project this expensive. To execute the mission, NASA would have had to treat OSAM-1 as a Class D mission according to the letter, which normally represents a \"lower priority mission with medium to low complexity.\"\nThe cost to launch the proposed mission would be $353 million as of Oct. 1, while the shut down costs are $29 million, according to the letter.\nOne of the major dangers of the 2026 plan, according to the letter, was a reduction in testing. With the new plan, there would be less testing on the overall system, on the launch site and on some of the systems within the spacecraft. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "World of Warcraft: There is a new arms race driven by AI, surveillance, drones & robots\n\n December 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: News \n \n 1188\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Pentagon recently issued the first draft of a sweeping $15 billion artificial intelligence contract.The military contract would be the largest U.S. government AI contract ever.\nAnd it's just the tip of the spear.\nThe U.S. military and intelligence agencies — which have a combined budget approaching $1 trillion — are charging into the new and uncertain world of AI, robotics and drones.\nIrina Tsukerman, an attorney specializing in national security and president of consulting firm Scarab Rising Inc., said the U.S. Defense Department is integrating AI into command and operational systems. The agency's innovation units like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) are developing autonomous and AI-driven weaponry, she said.\n\"There are a whole range of weapons that use AI technology,\" she said.\nOn Dec. 11, the Pentagon announced the formation of the AI Rapid Capabilities Cell \"focused on accelerating DoD adoption of next-generation artificial intelligence,\" according to a statement.\n\"We need an all-hands-on-deck approach to accelerate development and deployment of these tools for the Department of Defense to responsibly harness the tremendous promise of AI in everything from financial management to logistics to operations planning to autonomous systems,\" said Radha Plumb, DoD chief digital and AI officer.\nThe Pentagon has already been undertaking a large $11 billion AI infrastructure build-out, according to Yashin Manraj, CEO of Oregon-based Pvotal Technologies.\n\"They have their own data centers,\" he said of U.S. military and intelligence agencies' technical infrastructure to help process and secure all the data and AI they are and will be using.\nThe Pentagon also is building, testing and implementing large language models and hiring its own internal technology staff rather than contracting out some of those functions, Manraj said.\n\"They are recruiting heavily,\" he said.\nStill, Manraj says the Defense Department has increased its AI-related contracts as it embarks on a new age of warfare.\nDeputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen H. Hicks told attendees of an industry conference in August that the U.S. military was forging ahead with autonomous systems including robotic, un-crewed vehicles, naval vessels and drones via the Replicator program that aims to fast-track and take to scale battlefield and logistical innovations.\nThe U.S. isn't alone, with militaries in countries such as Israel and China coupling AI with surveillance. And the Ukraine-Russia war is seeing both sides use drones on the battlefield.\nDRONESDrones are fast becoming the new infantry, the new preferred frontline weapons with varying degrees of automation, cost and technological sophistication.\nManraj said drones and AI are getting real-time experiences and use in the war between Russia and Ukraine and in other conflict zones.\nThey have been used by Iranian proxy groups fighting Israel and looking to disrupt cargo ships in the Red Sea. Israel Defense Forces have used drones for surveillance, intelligence and reconnaissance in the current Middle East war. Israel also pulled off a high-tech feat of sabotaging and simultaneously blowing up pagers and walk-talkies used by Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria.\nConcern also is high in East Coast states such as New Jersey, New York and Maryland over unidentified objects, assumed to be drones, flying in the night skies.\nUnmanned systems are also increasingly linked to AI and automation.\n\"Drones are a primary way in which AI is being used in modern warfare today. Drones are becoming significantly more popular and useful, because they allow for military surveillance and action with minimized risk of danger for military personnel since they allow those controlling the drones to be in a separate location,\" said Edward Tian, CEO of GPTZero, a New York-based AI detection software company.\n\"AI technology is now helping to improve the effectiveness of drones, solving a lot of the common problems of manually controlled drones, like avoiding obstacles and allowing for better, more accurate monitoring,\" Tian said.\nROBOTICSAnders Indset, a technology author who focuses on its ethical intersections, said the next big steps with AI and automation are with \"groundbreaking advancements in autonomous humanoid robots.\"\n\"In 2024, the development of robots surged, with innovations that once seemed far-off now becoming imminent. The long-anticipated release of fully autonomous humanoids — previously confined to industrial settings — is approaching,\" said Indset, who has penned best-selling books on technology and business.\nHe points to robotic advancements from Boston Dynamics, Hanson Robotics, BMW and Tesla and a projected $250 billion in investment money in the segment.\nTsukerman sees uses for AI and autonomous systems with military logistics and supply chains.\n\"It can be used to manage inventory,\" she said.\nStill, military and intelligence agencies' aggressive moves into AI and autonomous realms bring up images and worst-case scenarios from dystopian science fiction movies such as \"The Terminator\" and \"2001 Space Odyssey.\"\nWhen will the robots and machines turn against us?\nKristian Humble, an international law professor and AI expert at the University of Greenwich in London, compares the AI military race to the nuclear arms race during the Cold War.\n\"The escalating weaponization of AI parallels the nuclear arms race of the Cold War, with nuclear weapons being replaced with automated weapons systems,\" he wrote in an analysis for Georgetown University earlier this year. \"However, the international community, the United Nations and international law have been struggling to adapt to and regulate the use of automated weapons, which are rapidly changing the landscape of modern warfare.\"\nTsukerman cautioned against overreliance on AI and automated systems, pointing to the potential high-tech security lapses that resulted in the slow Israeli response to the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that ignited the current Middle East war.\n\"There was no human element to detect the threat. I think there has to be some level of human support,\" she said, noting that some kind of hacking or cyber attack could have delayed Israeli detection or response.\nSURVEILLANCEAI has already been transforming the world of surveillance.\nChina's Skynet system (which shares the name of the mythical high-tech military system in The Terminator movies) has a network of 600 million security surveillance cameras that is tied to a social credit system that rewards behaviors deemed \"good\" and sanctions those with undesirable behaviors, including government opposition.\nSkynet and its Orwellian social credit system have increasingly been linked to AI.\nIn the U.S., surveillance — including facial recognition technology — is being rolled out at airports by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and is used by police agencies.\nThat creates privacy and \"Big Brother\" worries.\nA cadre of U.S. senators — including Democrats Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republicans such as Steve Daines of Montana and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming — have voiced concerns about the use of facial recognition technology at airports.\nA U.S. Transportation Security Administration spokesperson said the security checkpoint face scans are voluntary and images are not retained except for quality control checks.\nArunkumar Thirunagalingam, senior manager for data and technology operations at McKesson Corp., expects to see more surveillance technology deployed worldwide for various purposes, including \"to monitor and control populations.\"\nHe sees growth avenues in the U.S.\n\"Concerns about national security and crime prevention could lead to expanded use, especially in critical areas like border control, public spaces, and cybersecurity,\" Thirunagalingam said.\nManraj said governmental and military players along with private companies are all part of ever-growing data collection and global sales of that information for various purposes.\n\"We have access to so much data. They are just a credit card away,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The people have spoken and a much needed change is coming on Jan. 20. The past four years have devastated our country, and the sad part is that it is not over yet as Biden continues his onslaught of the American taxpayers as he sends our tax dollars to Africa to build a railroad and to the Ukraine.However, there is no money for our citizens who lost everything due to a hurricane. Our tax dollars paid for a wall to be built in order to keep illegals from entering our country, and now the Biden administration wants to sell it off at 5 cents on the dollar. Maryland conservatives have not had representation in the Senate since the 1960s and why, because the state is run and controlled by Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Prince George's and Montgomery county voters who have continually voted the Democrat ticket.\nThe only time they have voted for a Republican governor is when their Democrat governor messed up so bad that they needed someone to clean up the mess. Consider these cities, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Seattle and Baltimore as well as some parts of Michigan run by Democrats and look at the crime, the homeless, the filth.

The funeral included previously written eulogies by former President Gerald Ford and Carter's former Vice President Walter Mondale, read by their sons, Steven Ford and Ted Mondale.\nPresident Biden, who was the first Democratic senator to endorse Carter's bid for presidency in 1976, also gave a speech in honor of Carter.\n\"Throughout his life, he showed us what it means to be a practitioner of good works, a good and faithful servant of God and people today,\" he said. \"Many think he was from a bygone era, but in reality, he saw well into the future.\"\nGrandsons Joshua, Jason and James Carter spoke at the service. In an emotional tribute, Jason emphasized the love his grandfather brought to the world.\n\"He waged peace with love and respect,\" he said. \"He led this nation with love and respect. For me, this life was a love story from the moment that he woke up until he laid his head.\"\nCarter, the longest-lived president in U.S. history, died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100. His work of making global public health and humanitarian rights central to his agenda drew praise and admiration from people of all political angles. His death marked the end of an era.\nOutside of the cathedral, through the sound of church bells, the beat of drums and brisk winds, onlookers remembered Carter for his love of the people.\nThi Le, a Washington resident, stepped out onto his porch to watch the funeral procession despite the biting cold.\n\"I was impressed by his relatively young age in the presidency and then his accomplishments after his presidency,\" Le said.\n\"I just turned 42, so I'm kind of comparing, what have I done with myself to this point?\" Le said. \"He was president in his 50s and obviously accomplished quite a bit. That was just the halfway point for him through his life.\"\nHsin-Fu Wu traveled from Tucson, Arizona, for the funeral. He recounted how Carter had stopped to speak with him on the submarine named after the president in the early 2000s. Carter's legacy is grounded in \"his persistence in bringing peace and to live in integrity despite the opposition of the politics,\" Wu said.\nHe proudly wore a navy blue baseball cap with \"USS Jimmy Carter\" embroidered across the front.\nNancy Edson shared her admiration for Carter's dedication, praising his post-presidency efforts to combat diseases and his work with Habitat for Humanity.\nStanding in the cold to witness the funeral procession, Edson told Capital News Service it was \"the least she could do for everything that he and his family did in the world.\"\n\"[I] hope that some of it can rub off on me, and I can do more to help the world in my own way,\" Edson said. \"I don't think I can do as much as he did, but you gotta start somewhere.\"\nMembers of the Maryland General Assembly also paid tribute to the late president.\n\"His presidency may have been marked by significant challenges, rising energy costs, inflation and international crises, but Carter consistently approached these issues with honesty, humility … and a deep commitment to doing what was right, not just what was politically convenient,\" said Sen. Benjamin Brooks Sr., a Democrat representing Baltimore County, speaking to the Maryland Senate on Thursday.\nHouse Speaker Adrienne Jones, a Democrat from Baltimore County, reflected on how Carter's policies shaped her life on the House floor in advance of the funeral.\n\"During his administration, he greatly expanded a federal program called the Comprehensive Employee and Training Act,\" Jones said. \"Thanks to him, I got my first job in public service. I had just graduated from UMBC and didn't know what my next step would be, but CETA was the answer.\"\nJones also praised Carter for demonstrating how government programs can empower individuals and communities.\n\"When I think about public service, I think of the late President Jimmy Carter,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2025-01-18",
    "author": "DAVID REEL",
    "content": "Crack forms in 'blue wall' of resistance to Trump\n\n January 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 754\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n One of the many surprises in the last presidential election was Donald Trump winning in three \"blue wall\" battleground states — Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.Now that the reality of a second Trump term is sinking in, some Democratic members of Congress, Democratic governors, Democratic state attorney generals, and a large group of issue advocacy groups are working diligently to put up a new \"blue wall\" in Congress to delay or derail President-elect Trump's congressional agenda.\nThat proposed \"blue wall\" currently has an unexpected crack in an unexpected place — the United States Senate with John Fetterman, the Democratic U.S. senator from Pennsylvania.\nElected to the Senate in in 2022, Fetterman is the most unpredictable and unconventional member of the Senate since Arlen Specter, a former senator who was also from Pennsylvania.\nOnce elected, Fetterman was widely expected to be a conventional partisan progressive and a reliable supporter for progressive public policy positions.\nSince his election, he has demonstrated a level of independence that has surprised and disappointed progressives, and surprised and pleased conservatives.\nFetterman has regularly and forcefully expressed staunch support for Israel in their ongoing war with Hamas.\nOn immigration, Fetterman has said, \"I support a secure border.\" He also supports the deportation of undocumented immigrants arrested for crimes committed in America. He has said he doesn't know why anyone finds it controversial, that people illegally in the U.S. who commit crimes \"need to go.\"\nNow Fetterman is publicly challenging Democratic members of Congress who are developing strategies to resist and derail Trump's agenda in Congress.\nIn a recent interview with Jonathan Carl on ABC News \"This Week\", Fetterman said he hopes Trump is successful in his second term and he's not \"rooting against him.\" This follows Fetterman's pre-election endorsement of Kamala Harris for president and endorsing former long-term fellow Democratic U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania Bob Casey.\nHe also said, \"If you're rooting against the president, you are rooting against the nation. So, country first. I know that's become maybe like a cliche, but it happens to be true.\"\nThat observation is consistent with Fetterman's thought that in moving forward, Democrats can't get wrapped up in \"freaking out\" over every move that Trump makes.\nMost recently Fetterman further affirmed his independent nature by accepting an invitation to meet with President-elect Trump in Florida.\nFetterman announced his acceptance decision with his usual candor and bluntness, \"President Trump invited me to meet, and I accepted. I'm the senator for all Pennsylvanians — not just Democrats in Pennsylvania, I've been clear that no one is my gatekeeper. I will meet with and have conversations with anyone if it helps me deliver for Pennsylvania and the nation.\"\nFetterman has walked his talk with regard to his role as a senator, in voting to confirm or reject confirmation of some of Donald Trump's cabinet nominees.\nFetterman was one of the first Democratic senators to meet with Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice to serve as secretary of Defense.\nHe has said he will vote to confirm Elise Stefanik as ambassador to the United Nations and Marco Rubio as secretary of State.\nHe is still considering if he will vote to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of Health and Human Services, and Tulsi Gabbard as director of National Security.\nWhile Fetterman's approach to working with the Trump administration is not yet widely accepted by Democratic members of Congress, it is not unique.\nAt least one Democratic member of Congress has already embraced Fetterman's approach to the Trump administration.\nIn a New Year's Day New York Times guest essay, Congressman Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.) urged fellow Democratic lawmakers to drop the resistance movement and work with Trump in his second term.\nSuozzi wrote, \"As a Democratic member of Congress, I know my party will be tempted to hold fast against Mr. Trump at every turn, uniting against his bills, blocking his nominees and grinding the machinery of the House and the Senate to a halt. That would be a mistake. But as a common sense Democrat who won in a district that Mr. Trump also won, I am certain our closely divided electorate would rather have bipartisan solutions than political gridlock.\"\nGoing forward it will be most interesting to see if cracks in any congressional \"blue wall\" of resistance get bigger and deeper.\nWhile to date such cracks may be relatively small, they could expand to a point where a \"blue wall\" of resistance strategy is futile on stopping Trump's ambitious second-term agenda.\nWith slim Republican majorities in Congress, especially in the House, any support by Democratic members of Congress for Trump's congressional agenda significantly increases the odds for approval of that agenda. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trump resumes power and promises a 'golden age'\n\n January 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: CAPITAL NEWS SERVICE | Section: National \n \n 647\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON, D.C.–Republican Donald Trump took office as the 47th President of the United States Monday, saying that he was \"saved by God to make America great again.\"\"In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success,\" Trump said in his inaugural address. \"We will not forget our country, we will not forget our constitution and we will not forget our God.\"\nTrump's speech mirrored many he made on the campaign trail, complete with a reference to the assassination attempt on his life in July. He focused on the southern border and promised to declare a national emergency, begin the process of \"returning\" people to their countries and send troops to \"repel the disastrous invasion of our country.\"\nThe circumstances surrounding Trump's second inauguration made it different from most; for the first time since 1985, the ceremony took place indoors, away from bitter cold temperatures in D.C. Members of Trump's party included billionaires Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, as well as internet personality Joe Rogan, seated in premium seats.\nHis speech was unique, too. While former President Joe Biden's 2021 speech focused on unity and democracy, Trump spent his opening moments as president decrying what he views as a decaying America. He promised to usher in a new isolationist \"golden era\" for the nation.\n\"From this moment on,\" Trump said, \"America's decline is over.\"\nAs Trump spoke, and Republicans in the Capitol Rotunda cheered, Democrats at the ceremony were mostly quiet. Biden sat to Trump's left with eyes cast downward for much of the speech, while former Vice President Kamala Harris looked away from the podium during ovations. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who ran against Trump in 2016, appeared to laugh aloud as Trump announced his plans to rename the Gulf of Mexico.\nIn his speech, Trump took direct shots at the outgoing administration. With Biden and Harris seated behind him, the incoming president criticized Biden's handling of issues both domestic and abroad.\n\"We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad,\" Trump said. \"It fails to protect our magnificent law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.\"\nTrump rattled off a litany of other priorities such as raising tariffs and creating an External Revenue Service to collect them, recommitting to oil drilling, recognizing only two genders and dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and policies. Trump also said he would rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, rename Denali (a mountain in Alaska) to Mount McKinley after a former Republican president, retake the Panama Canal, make America \"color blind\" and plant the American flag on Mars.\nAs Trump spoke in the Capitol, some pro-Trump supporters, gathered in D.C., reflected Trump's combative attitude.\nOthers gathered in the nation's capital were less strident, though not any less enthused by the incoming administration; in fact, many traveled far from home to express their support.\nLona Franczak, who traveled from Dallas, Texas, said that the trip was worthwhile even with the ceremony being moved indoors.\n\"I'm excited for so much,\" Franczak said. \"I'm ready to see the (people imprisoned for their involvement in the Jan. 6 Capitol storming) get put out of prison. And I'm ready to see Joe Biden be put out of office, and I am ready to see the border walls restored. I could go on forever.\"\nOne Trump supporter traveled all the way from Ontario, Canada to witness the inauguration.\nDana Ogilvie, who hails from Kingston, Ontario, said that he would welcome the annexation of Canada by the United States, something that Trump has mentioned several times.\n\"I'd rather have God-given rights than government privileges,\" he said.\nJack Bowman, Emma Tufo and Paul Kiefer contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Planned Parenthood receives federal money for Medicaid reimbursements for other health services as well federal grants for health centers and non-abortion programs.\n'ELIMINATE'Public money for Planned Parenthood has long been targeted by conservative groups opposed to abortion rights. Such an effort with Musk would draw his DOGE efforts into the long divisive abortion rights debate.\n\"Planned Parenthood's total revenue for 2023 (the latest year numbers are available) was over $2 billion. Yet, Planned Parenthood received over $699.3 million in taxpayer funds from various government 'reimbursements and grants.' Taxpayers should not be supplementing an industry that takes the lives of pre-born children and brings in over $2 billion in revenue. We are hopeful that the Trump administration will look into the taxpayer money used to supplement the nation's largest abortion provider and eliminate the funding scheme,\" said Laura Echevarria, National Right to Life's director of communications and press secretary.\nA contingent of anti-abortion and socially conservative advocates have written to Musk as well as the Office of Management and Budget asking them to examine Planned Parenthood's federal funding.\n\"According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Planned Parenthood Health Centers received about $22 billion in Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grants and $53 billion in payments from public health coverage programs from 2019 to 2021. Planned Parenthood Federation of America affiliates received $148 million in HHS grants and $1.5 billion in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP payments, with an additional $108 million or so for Planned Parenthood's regional organizations,\" reads the Feb. 13 letter.\nIt was spearheaded by former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's Advancing American Freedom group. Signators include AAF President Tim Chapman, Faith & Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed and Jennie Bradley Lichter, president of March for Life Action.\nThe Southern Baptist Convention, CatholicVote, Oregon Right to Life and other groups are also asking abortion rights opponents to contact Trump and Congress asking them to restrict Planned Parenthood funding.\nORTL Executive Director Lois Anderson said in an email to supporters that Planned Parenthood provides 40% of the abortions in the U.S.\nA NEW 'DEFUND FIGHT'In a Feb. 3 memo, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America outlined the impact yanked government funding could have on its operations and patients.\n\"If patients are prevented from getting quality, affordable Planned Parenthood health services like birth control, cancer screenings, and STI (sexually transmitted infections) testing and treatment, and more, the grave consequences would bring lasting harm to communities nationwide. Many patients who come to Planned Parenthood health centers get their insurance through Medicaid, and have few care options — as many Planned Parenthood health centers are located in health provider deserts, making it hard to access any health care,\" PPFA said in the memo.\nPlanned Parenthood said it had more than 2 million patients nationwide in 2022, conducted close to 213,000 breast exams, approximately 198,000 pap tests and 2.3 million birth control services.\nMore than half of Planned Parenthood 's patients are lower income and on Medicaid. Close to half of Planned Parenthood's patients are people of color, according to the group.\nMusk and Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy brought up potential Planned Parenthood defunding after Trump's election win. Musk has since taken control of DOGE efforts with job cuts across the U.S. government. Musk said last year he does not support abortion rights after viability.\nAlexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said after that pronouncement such an action would deny people health care and wreak \"havoc on our public health system.\"\n\"We've been here before — we are not new to shutdown and 'defund' fights. We fended off a number of these attacks during Trump's first term — and Planned Parenthood health centers are still there serving millions of patients across the nation.\" McGill Johnson said.\nAfter the 2022 Dobbs' decision overturning Roe v. Wade, abortion rights were sent back to the states.\nSome conservative states, such as Utah, Alabama and Florida, have sought to restrict abortion rights post-Roe.\nVoters in other states, such as Montana, Missouri, Maryland, New York, Nevada and Arizona — approved ballot measures in November enshrining abortion rights into their state constitutions.\nAll of those states, except New York, went for Trump in the November presidential race over Vice President Kamala Harris, who made expansive abortion rights a centerpiece of her White House bid.\nTrump favors a state-by-state approach to abortion and does not appear interested in a federal abortion ban or restriction on abortion-inducing medications.\nMedication abortions make up 63% of all pregnancy terminations in the U.S., according to the Guttmacher Institute.\nTrump has restricted U.S. funding internationally for groups providing abortions.\nThere are also GOP bills in Congress to defund Planned Parenthood.\nPROTESTS OR DIVIDENDSProgressives and other left-wing activists held protests on President's Day, Feb. 17. to rally against Trump's early days in office, his ties to wealthy interests including billionaires and oil and gas companies as well as Musk's DOGE austerity efforts.\n\"While Trump appoints 13 billionaires to his cabinet and Musk, Bezos and Zuckerberg see their wealth increase by $217 billion since the election, 60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, 25% of seniors live on $15,000 or less and millions cannot afford rent,\" said U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, referring to Meta/Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Musk, who heads Tesla, X and Starlink.\n\"Say no to oligarchy,\" Sanders said.\nMusk and Trump have pressed forward with their DOGE efforts highlighting U.S. tax dollars going to foreign aid projects and Social Security databases showing people with age well into their 100s and even 200s and 300s.\nOn Wednesday, Trump read aloud U.S. spending projects in countries such as Uganda, Moldova, Peru and Serbia and the number of people with lofty ages in the Social Security system database.\n\"200 to 209 years old: 879 people. 210 to 219 years old: 866 people. 220 to 229 years old: 1,039 people. 240 to 249 years old: 2 people. 1 person that is 360 years old,\" said Trump, adding that DOGE efforts will see if any benefits are being paid out to those accounts.\nTrump and Musk also talked up sending $5,000 'DOGE dividends' to Americans from the savings he is finding in government spending. The checks could also entail sending 20% of DOGE austerity savings to Americans. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Sometimes red, sometimes blue, sometimes neither: State and local police and Trump's ICE raids\n\n February 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: National \n \n 1547\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n President Donald Trump's increased immigration raids and promised mass deportations of undocumented migrants are spotlighting the roles local police are — or are not — playing with the crackdowns.Some conservative states and sheriffs are touting new and existing agreements with the U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hold undocumented immigrants accused of other crimes and promised more cooperation with Trump to deal with international gangs, trafficking rings and drug cartels.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Feb. 19 that state police agencies were entering into agreements with ICE \"to execute functions of immigration enforcement within the state.\"\n\"Florida is setting the example for states in combating illegal immigration and working with the Trump Administration to restore the rule of law,\" DeSantis said. \"By allowing our state agents and law enforcement officers to be trained and approved by ICE, Florida will now have more enforcement personnel deputized to assist federal partners. That means deportations can be carried out more efficiently, making our communities safer as illegal aliens are removed.\"\nThe Florida Highway Patrol, Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE), Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), and the Florida State Guard have entered into 287(g) agreements with ICE.\nThose deals allow state and local police to administer federal immigration laws.\nGANG INFLUXAs of December 2024, ICE had 287(g) agreements with approximately 135 state and local law enforcement agencies nationally, according to the American Immigration Council.\nSome of those agreements have been in place for years.\n\"Nothing has changed in our approach. If someone is being held on local charges and ICE wants to place a 'hold' on them they do. We do participate in the 287(g) program and this has been active for years,\" said Dan Springer, sheriff in Gallatin County, Montana (which includes Bozeman and Belgrade).\n\"We have one person designated as a warrant service officer. This allows that detention Officer to serve warrants generated by ICE.\"\nSpringer said his deputies will notify ICE of arrestees potentially being in the country illegally if those persons don't have a U.S. Social Security number or valid immigration visa when they are booked for an alleged crime.\n\"During the booking process, we also ask everyone their place of birth and if it is a foreign country, that also alerts us to notify ICE,\" Springer said. \"ICE is contacted, they review fingerprints, demographics, etc. and they determine citizenship. If determined to be illegal by the ICE agent and they meet certain criteria set forth by ICE, they place an immigration detainer.\"\nThose holds can also apply to immigrants who overstay their visa or have been convicted of serious crimes and face deportation orders.\nICE also has 48 hours to show up at local jails to pick up those with holds after charges are adjudicated or the defendants are bonded out, Springer said.\nTrump has designated Mexican cartels and Latin American gangs as terrorist organizations allowing for more U.S. law enforcement, intelligence and military assets to be deployed against those syndicates with a focus on curtailing fentanyl (a potent and dangerous synthetic opioid) and other smuggling in the U.S.\nHe's also promised to crack down human trafficking rings and has criticized the prior administration for allowing post-pandemic migration waves into the U.S.\nSpringer said he's seen an influx of gang members in Montana.\n\"We have been able to classify some as being illegal aliens and some are not,\" the sheriff said.\nEarlier this month, ICE and U.S. Homeland Security agents arrests six alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n'SANCTUARY PROMISE'Immigration advocates and Democrats worry about Trump's raids sweeping up undocumented migrant workers who are in the U.S. to work and have not committed crimes.\nThose migrants often take jobs native-born Americans eschew and are key to sectors such as construction, agriculture and restaurants.\nCritics of Trump's promised mass deportations also worry about ICE agents going into churches or schools to make arrests.\nThirteen states — including Oregon, California, Illinois, New York and Colorado as well Utah — have sanctuary laws restricting state and local police from cooperating with ICE.\nAnother 220 cities and counties also have sanctuary laws protecting undocumented migrants and forbidding local police from cooperating with federal immigration agencies, according for the Center for Immigration Studies.\nThose include big cities such as Atlanta, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New Orleans as well as college areas such as Dane County, Wisconsin (Madison); Las Cruces, New Mexico; Athens-Clarke County, Georgia; and Franklin County, Ohio (Columbus).\nIllegal immigration was center stage in Athens, Georgia after a Venezuelan man, who had been arrested but not detained in New York and Georgia on other charges, killed nursing student Laken Riley in 2022.\nThe man, José Antonio Ibarra, was convicted of murder and Congress passed and Trump signed a new law last month requiring federal detention of undocumented immigrants accused of burglary and theft.\nTrump has spotlighted other high-profile violent crimes committed by migrants illegally in the U.S. That includes the 2024 killing and sexual assault of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray in Houston; two Venezuelan men illegally in the U.S. were charged with the crime.\nPublic opinion polls show U.S. voters supporting Trump's deportation push with 59% backing the effort in a CBS News/YouGov poll and 63% in a Napolitan News Service survey this month.\nDemocrats in sanctuary cities and states have promised to stick by their policies of not working with ICE.\n\"Our immigrant communities are Oregon communities,\" said Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, in a video statement last month. \"I will uphold Oregon's sanctuary promise laws.\"\nPortland (Oregon) Police Chief Bob Day said in a statement that a department directive also eschews immigration enforcements.\n\"I want everyone to feel safe and protected, which is why it is important to understand that the Portland Police Bureau does not engage in immigration enforcement as outlined … Simply put, we have no legal authority to do so,\" Day said.\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Trump's immigration czar Tom Homan have promised to go after states and local jurisdictions who push back or refuse to help enforce immigration laws. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has promised NYPD cooperation with ICE's removal efforts. That move coincided with the Trump administration dropping corruption charges against the mayor brought by the Biden administration.\n'OUR MISSION'Some municipal police departments say immigration enforcements are not within their operations especially with county sheriffs frequently handling jails.\nIn Omaha, Nebraska, Mayor Jean Stothert, a Republican, and Police Chief Todd Schmaderer, posted a social media video last month saying local police will not inquire about immigration status.\n\"We don't want anyone to be afraid. If you are the victim of a crime or a witness of crime... the Omaha police will not check your legal status,\" Stothert said.\nDustin Lensing, police chief in Belgrade, Montana, said his small town department does not have a 287(g) agreement but will provide logistical support to ICE and other federal agencies when requested.\n\"From a local law enforcement perspective, not a lot has changed in our mission. Our mission at the municipal level is to maintain and ensure the safety of all of our residents and visitors, regardless of immigration status. When a crime or incident occurs, we respond and mitigate the situation,\" Lensing said.\n\"At this time, we are not directly contacting ICE whenever we have contact with a potential migrant, as a lot of times, we do not truly know their immigration status (resident, non-resident, visa, green card holder) and we have to be careful to follow laws and restrictions as they apply to profiling persons due to their ethnicity,\" he continued.\nThe Belgrade chief has also seen \"some increase in gang, drug and labor trafficking issues\" and an uptick in federal immigration holds.\n\"What we are seeing is that some of our arrestees are being held on ICE detainers after we book them into jail on local charges. We do not have involvement in the process since this occurs after our officers have left the facility, but this is not something we have seen much of from ICE in several years,\" Lensing said.\n'WE DON'T ASK FOR IMMIGRATION STATUS'On Maryland's Eastern Shore, Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said a unique setup limits his deputies' involvement with immigration cases.\nGamble said in a number of Maryland counties jails are not administered by local sheriffs. They are run by a separate local corrections department. He said his deputies don't delve into legal status.\n\"We don't ask for immigration status,\" Gamble said.\nHe said when defendants are booked into jail, their fingerprints and information get shared with the FBI and in turn other agencies, including ICE.\n\"They will see that,\" Gamble said of whether ICE can tell criminal defendants are potentially undocumented or illegally in the U.S.\nWhile Maryland is one of the most Democratic and progressive states in the union, it does not have sanctuary laws.\nMaryland Attorney Anthony Brown, a Democrat, issued fresh immigration guidance in January telling state and local police they \"are prohibited from asking about a person's immigration status during regular police functions unless it is relevant to a crime being investigated by that officer.\" He said \"state and local law enforcement officers cannot be prohibited from sharing information about a detainee's citizenship or immigration status with federal immigration officials, but they are not required to do so either.\"\nBrown said more detailed information about a defendant requires a warrant.\nGamble said his agency is often at arms length from those interactions because he doesn't operate the jail.\n\"We don't know about any of this stuff,\" Gamble said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Federal layoffs come home to Oxford\n\n March 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 926\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — Marine scientist Sierra Hildebrandt had about 30 minutes on Feb. 27 before her government computer and access to her email were revoked at the Cooperative Oxford Laboratory.Hildebrandt had just learned that she'd been terminated from her dream job with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\"I cried,\" she said about learning the news.\nHildebrandt was one of two NOAA scientists fired from the Oxford lab that day. The two represented a 15% reduction of the lab's total workforce, both state and federal.\n\"We're already a small lab,\" Hildebrandt said. She said with the two terminations, there are only two remaining federal employees and one federal government contractor at the Oxford lab who do field work.\nHildebrandt and environmental scientist Jake Shaner, who also was fired from his position at the Oxford lab, were not alone. At least 800 employees across NOAA have lost their jobs since Feb. 27, part of the Trump administration's move to reduce the size of the government. According to the Associated Press, President Donald Trump has called the size of the federal government \"bloated.\"\nIn an email to The Star Democrat, NOAA public affairs specialist Jasmine Blackwell said she could not discuss \"internal personnel and management matters.\" She said NOAA remains dedicated to its mission of \"providing timely information, research and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation's environmental and economic resilience.\"\nTHE IMPACT ON OXFORDAlthough NOAA is known for gathering weather data, the agency does more than that.\nAt the Cooperative Oxford Laboratory, scientists monitor water quality, tides and the presence of vibrio, which can cause fatal food poisonings, in oyster populations. The lab — which is Oxford's largest employer — works on an array of projects, from oyster restoration to evaluating nature-based solutions like living shorelines.\nAt the time that Hildebrandt and Shaner were let go, they were implementing a water quality monitoring station in Oxford with another scientist. Shaner said the monitoring station gathers tide data, helping Oxford determine when flooding is likely.\n\"So that falls off immediately,\" Shaner said, explaining that leaving one scientist to maintain the station alone would be difficult.\nHildebrandt and Shaner were the only two scientists at the lab working with the Town of Oxford to evaluate the Strand Beach project, a project to create a living shoreline on Oxford's waterfront. Hildebrandt said their job was to understand how the already implemented shoreline was providing coastal protection and additional ecosystem benefits.\nOxford Town Manager Holly Wahl said the loss of Shaner and Hildebrandt from the lab is having an impact on the completion of that project. She said the lab is engrained in the town and surrounding areas.\n\"When we have the largest employer in town facing terminations, I think that directly will absolutely impact the town from an economic standpoint,\" Wahl said. \"As well as just the economic standpoint of having that innovation and research directly accessible to the town to continue to make improvements to protect property, to protect vital critical resources that we're providing to citizens.\"\nOxford Commission President Norm Bell said this situation shows Oxford and the Eastern Shore are not isolated from the rest of the country.\n\"We're really starting to grapple with what do we do longer term so that we can survive as sea levels rise (and) storm water levels rise,\" he said.\nBell said the work Hildebrandt and Shaner were doing in Oxford was helping the town address those water-related concerns.\nTHE BIG PICTUREShaner had been working at the Cooperative Oxford Laboratory — which is utilized by NOAA, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Coast Guard — since 2016. Although Shaner had about nine years under his belt at the lab, eight of them were spent as a state employee. At the time of his termination, Shaner was considered a probationary federal employee.\nSt. Michaels resident and deep-sea ecologist Andrew Thaler works with NOAA scientists and uses the agency's data. He said that when employees are hired, they are put on a period of probation before they can receive tenure. He said the probation period repeats when someone switches jobs within the federal government.\n\"So if you get promoted to a management level position, your probation block starts over,\" he said. \"So many people were fired who were senior in the administration.\"\nAt the U.S. Department of Agriculture, more than 5,000 probationary employees were temporarily reinstated to their positions via a federal board ruling Wednesday after the employees had been terminated in February. The ruling was determined based on \"reasonable grounds\" to believe the agency \"committed a prohibited personnel practice.\"\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, factors that should be taken into account with reductions in force include tenure of employment, military preference, length of service and efficiency or performance ratings. The service states agencies are \"generally required\" to provide written notice to affected employees 60 days in advance of the date of release.\nHildebrandt said she understands layoffs occur, but she said her and Shaner were well-performing employees.\n\"I think I wouldn't be as heartbroken if this was done the correct way,\" she said. \"And if both of us were not performing very well in our jobs.\"\nWHAT'S NEXT?\"A NOAA job is a dream job for a lot of marine scientists,\" Thaler said.\nBoth Hildebrandt and Shaner have filled out forms to volunteer at the lab so they can continue to work on the projects they had been working on in a volunteer capacity.\nShaner said the terminations at the Oxford lab are a resource lost for the community.\n\"You're losing skilled people that live here, care about the Eastern Shore and the Chesapeake Bay and want to fix problems,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "We have abdicated fairness, defending those in need\n\n March 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LARRY PIFER | Section: Columns \n \n 598\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Everything in our heritage, culture, and founding documents celebrates democracy. Article I of the Maryland Constitution proclaims, \"That all Government of right originates from the People.\" The motto of our neighboring state of Virginia is more pointed, \"Death to tyrants.\" However, under Trump our nation seems to have abandoned our position of leadership of democracies in the world, a position we spilled our blood and treasure to win and maintain. With no explanation, discussion, hearings or debate.We now side with Russia, our enemy for decades, a country that threatened to defeat and erase us from the earth. Russia has the largest arsenal of nuclear weapons because they stole the plans for the atomic bomb from us after World War II. They are not hesitant to rattle that saber. On Feb. 24, we voted twice in the United Nations to side with Russia to block a vote to condemn Russia for their unprovoked attack on Ukraine.\nRussia was the aggressor, we all saw it happen.\nWhy have we done this? The only possible explanation is that the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump wants to endear himself to the dictator of Russia Vladimir Putin and now sees himself and our country as beginning a friendship with our sworn enemy Russia. What is this all about? Putin wants to gain Ukrainian territory, then he may march into Europe and attempt to dominate some portion of Europe, probably Poland. Certainly, our NATO allies and I fear the United States will not resist because Donald Trump is now Putin's friend. Putin certainly does not see himself as Donald Trump's friend, but rather Trump is his patsy who will enable Russia to continue their aggression.\nI had hoped that President Trump would allay these fears and explain away this foreboding shift in all that we hold dear, but while Trump's speech to Congress was the longest in history there was no effort to explain. There was only more pressure on Ukraine to meet Russia's demands.\nWhat a terrible turn of events, we have abdicated all the principles of fairness and defending those who need our help, trying to make the world a better place and for what? Allowing a self-absorbed, deeply troubled man in the White House to lead us into a relationship with our enemy that will cause great harm to us and to the rest of the world. What are the next steps in this saga? Are we going to side with the Russians in some conflict in Europe? I hope not, but Donald Trump shows no resistance to Putin.\nThis was reemphasized on Feb. 28 in the White House when Donald Trump and JD Vance told our ally Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky that they are on their own, we the United States will not help them. While Russia continues to advance on Ukraine, President Trump has once again impounded the military aid to Ukraine that Congress appropriated, halted our intelligence assistance to Ukraine, ceased our offensive cyberattacks in response to Russian cyberattacks, cut off any hope of Ukrainian membership in NATO, and called Zelensky a dictator.\nTrump even asked us to doubt that Zelensky wants to stop the slaughter of his people in this conflict, that he doesn't want peace badly enough. This is code to Zelensky to agree to Russian demands for territory at the negotiating table. What price has Trump demanded of Putin? Nothing. Trump wants us to reward Russia with membership in the G7.\nWe all need to strongly resist this course of action and direction for the sake of our country, our democratic heritage, our children and ourselves. Please. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "DOGE is not first attempt to reduce government\n\n March 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 948\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Hardly a day goes by without continuous updates from Washington, D.C., on plans of and actions by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, commonly referred to as DOGE.President Trump created DOGE with an executive order on the first day of his second term, affirming it is a key element of his second term agenda. Elon Musk is heading DOGE as a special government employee.\nStrong resistance to DOGE started immediately and has not slowed since then. A lawsuit challenging the legality and authority of was filed the same day DOGE was created. Since then, numerous lawsuits have been filed, including those charging DOGE's efforts to access federal agency data violate federal privacy laws.\nAs of now, questions on how many and exactly how the U.S. Supreme Court will address these lawsuits is anyone's guess.\nOne question not receiving much attention is the history of and possible lessons learned from past efforts on improving government efficiency and reducing government spending.\nThe first such effort occurred in 1947 when Congress created the Commission on the Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, commonly referred to as the Hoover Commission, as former President Herbert Hoover chaired it.\nIn 1953, Congress approved the Second Commission on the Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government also commonly referred to as a Hoover Commission, as former President Hoover chaired it.\nIn 1982, former President Reagan created The President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control, commonly referred to as the Grace Commission, as it was chaired by corporate executive J. Peter Grace, who was an industrialist and CEO of W.R. Grace and Company, a diversified chemical company.\nIn 1993, former President Clinton launched the National Performance Review (NPR), also commonly referred to as Reinventing Government. Leading it was former Vice President Gore.\nFormer President Obama established three groups. They were the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform whose co-chairs were former U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles; the Domenici-Rivlin Debt Reduction Task Force, chaired by former U.S. Sen. Pete Domenici and Alice Rivlin, former director of the Office of management and Budget and former Federal Reserve Board Vice Chair. The third group, Campaign to Cut Waste, was a large group of Obama administration officials with the stated goal of \"hunting down and eliminating misspent tax dollars in every agency and department across the Federal Government.\"\nIn a recent article on President Trump's DOGE initiative, John Kamensky, emeritus senior fellow at the IBM Center for The Business of Government, and Mark Abramson, president at Leadership Inc., suggest the following key elements are important for success in federal government spending change efforts:\n\"Making government work better can gain significant support in Congress as was seen in the first Hoover Commission and the Reinventing Government initiatives. When recommendations need congressional approval, being fast can make a difference. When a reform initiative spans the life of more than one Congress — and there is a chance that either house may flip to the opposing party — then bolder recommendations can be jeopardized. Moving fast also allows more time to focus on implementation. This was a strength of the Reinventing Government initiative.\nReform efforts that try to make government cheaper, such as by eliminating programs or reducing headcount, necessarily involve Congress. Such an emphasis was a stumbling block for the second Hoover Commission and the Grace Commission. Including career civil servants in the work of a reform initiative can increase the success of the \"improving program\" initiatives since they can gain \"buy-in\" from the civil service. In contrast, the \"eliminating programs\" approach has been predominately staffed by individuals outside of government, and civil service \"buy-in\" was not sought.\nKamensky and Mark Abramson conclude with writing, \"At the time of this writing, DOGE has not been operating like any of these past reform efforts, where the need for change is assessed, and recommendations are made for the president and Congress to act upon.\"\nI suggest there is a crucial omission from their observations on the underlying rationale on President Trump's decisions to move quickly and aggressively on the DOGE agenda. Those decisions include bypassing Congress for input on and approval of DOGE goals and operations.\nI suggest Trump's thinking reflects a sense of urgency on addressing the steadily increasing national debt. In 2000, that debt was $5.659 trillion, approximately 56% of the country's gross domestic product. By 2010, the national debt was $13.562 trillion, approximately 93% of GDP. It is projected to reach $37 trillion in June of this year.\nDespite current and yet to be filed court challenges to DOGE, it remains to be seen what the final decisions will be on those court challenges, especially any rulings handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nI suggest any mandates on congressional involvement on DOGE plans and actions may not be relevant going forward, even if the courts rule that a president cannot implement DOGE activities without some levels of congressional input and approval.\nThe current Republican majorities in Congress have been relatively uninvolved in any efforts to slow down or stop DOGE plans and actions.\nIf court rulings do limit the scope and authority of DOGE, I suggest Congressional Republicans will move to approve whatever is deemed legally necessary to allow DOGE plans and actions to continue.\nAs always that could change based on the results of the 2026 midterm election cycle which is already underway.\nI further suggest, if Republicans retain control of Congress in the 2026 mid-term elections, they will be even more inclined to approve future DOGE plans and actions at least through the end of Trump's second term.\nIf the Democrats regain control of the House, the Senate or both, DOGE will be no more than a footnote in the history of Trump's second term. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "'Really tense time': Senior centers, Meals on Wheels facing lost funding from Trump's DOGE, potential shutdown",

    "author": "MIKE SUNNUCKS Belgrade News",
    "content": "'Really tense time': Senior centers, Meals on Wheels facing lost funding from Trump's DOGE, potential shutdown\n\n March 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Belgrade News | Section: News \n \n 1295\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Lisa Beedy and Jim Marks are feeling the brunt of the Trump administration's DOGE austerity pushes, a possible federal shutdown and the cancellation of a long-standing federal law that has long funded programs for seniors.And they are bracing for more.\n\"We have definitely been affected,\" said Beedy, director of the Belgrade Senior Center. in Montana \"It looks like we are not probably going to receive our March contract payment.\"\nBeedy said she was notified by the Rocky Mountain Development Council earlier this month that the Belgrade and other senior centers in Montana might not be receiving monthly installments for meals and other programs for seniors.\nThe money in question originates with the federal government and filters through the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services.\nIn a March 4 letter to senior centers and other providers, Marks, who serves as RMCD program director, said Montana's Aging Services Bureau notified his group \"that the state is not able to meet the full March payment to\" local agencies.\n\"This means you should expect no or partial payment from Rocky Aging in March,\" Marks told the senior centers and other providers.\nMarks said the Montana state agency said it might provide state money and other available funds. Officials with the Montana agency have not yet responded to a request for comment.\nBeedy said the Belgrade Senior Center has an annual budget of approximately $400,000 with approximately $100,000 coming from federal sources.\n\"That will definitely leave a hole for us,\" said Beedy. \"That leaves us wondering what the future looks like for us.\nThe Belgrade center provides Meals on Wheels and congregate meals for local seniors. It also hosts holiday events as well as wellness and other classes. The center is part of the local municipal government and received some of its funding via the city of Belgrade.\nBeedy said her center is on track to provide as many as 18,000 meals to local seniors this fiscal year.\nShe noted that demand has grown with the impacts of inflation and the local area's population growth.\nBeedy said community support, via tax-deductible donations, has increased and the center has enough funds to make it through the fiscal year, which ends June 30.\n\"After that, we're not sure,\" she said.\nHer husband Dave Beedy, who runs the center's kitchen operations is already looking at the best and most economical ways forward.\n'A REALLY TENSE TIME'\nThe future for senior centers and Meals on Wheels food programs across the country could be impacted by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's DOGE austerity measures, a potential government shutdown and the uncertain reauthorization of the Older Americans Act.\nThe GOP-majority U.S. House of Representatives passed a temporary spending bill Tuesday, but the U.S. Senate must also pass the stop-gap plan by the end of day Friday to avoid a government shutdown.\nTrump and Republicans need some Democratic senators to help avoid a shutdown.\nThe administration and Congress will also need to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. The bill was enacted in 1965 and funds federal spending and programs for seniors. The GOP stalled a reauthorization effort in December before Trump took office.\nMarks said the federal money stoppage reference in his letter impacts 13 Montana senior centers and meals providers.\nHe said federal money through the state and his group can make up as much 50% of some Montana senior centers' budgets.\n\"We are kind of waiting to see what is happening with the shutdown,\" Marks said.\nBut even if the shutdown is avoided he is worried about Trump and Musk's DOGE cuts and Congress not reauthorizing the Older Americans Act.\n\"It's really a tense time cause we don't know what's going to happen,\" Marks said.\nThe nonprofit group's regional budget for Montana areas that include Gallatin and Park counties totals $2.8 million with 56% of that coming from the federal government.\nMarks said the monthly regional allotments total $120,000 and go to senior centers and other providers. He said those groups are often smaller community and nonprofit groups who have little financial leeway.\n\"If we lose (funding), we run the risk of our network collapsing,\" Marks said. The meals programs are aimed at home bound and lower income seniors.\nThat frustrates Marks.\n\"Taking food away from older Americans, it's beyond cruelty,\" he said.\nHe also worried about larger employment cuts at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services related to aging and Trump and Musk targeting Social Security, Medicaid (which offers public health service to poorer Americans).\nTrump and Musk argue their DOGE efforts aim to reduce government waste, bloated government bureaucracies and unnecessary spending.\nDOGE efforts have mirrored program cuts in the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 conservative policy blueprints. Project 2025 included some major overhauls of HHS, which oversees senior programs and funding.\nThey've pointed to the need to clean up Social Security databases, which include persons with very high ages .\nMartin O'Malley, who served as Social Security administrator in the Biden administration, said those database entries do not translate into benefits payments and worries DOGE cuts to staffing and offices could potentially jeopardize Social Security customer service and payments.\nWATCHING WITH CONCERN\nAcross the country in southwest Florida, Erin McLeod, CEO of Senior Friendship Centers Inc., is also worried about the fate of the Older Americans Act (OAA) and funding for meals deliveries to seniors and disabled persons.\n\"It funds our Meals on Wheels and nutrition programs,\" McLeod said, of the federal law.\nThe Florida nonprofit, which also operates senior centers and has educational programs for seniors, has a $20 million annual budget. McLeod said approximately $6.5 million of that comes from the federal government and is key to its meals programs.\n\"We are delivering 30,000 meals per month,\" McLeod said of the nonprofit's operations across Charlotte, Lee, Sarasota and DeSoto counties.\nLike other senior providers, McLeod is concerned about the potential length and impacts of a federal shutdown as well as DOGE efforts.\nFunding cuts or disruptions would result in SFC halting new enrollments in affected programs as higher prices continue to challenge seniors and other Floridians, McLeod said. Like other meals providers and food banks, SFC sees community needs for services still well above pre-pandemic levels\nMcLeod said private donations can help but they are not likely to be a long-term solution to lost government funding.\nShe said seniors are also watching, with some trepidation, the fate of Social Security under Trump and Musk's DOGE austerity pushes with concerns about potential staffing cuts and restructuring hurting claims and benefits processing.\n\"We are really watching Security,\" she said.\n'IMPOSSIBLE CHOICES'\nNationally, Meals on Wheels programs serve more than 250 million meals annually to an estimated 2 million seniors.\nFor some seniors, delivered meals or meals and events at senior centers are their only social interactions.\nSenior centers and meal providers have also reported increased demand with high post-pandemic inflation, including for food prices and items such as eggs.\nBreyana Franklin, external relations manager for Meals on Wheels America, worries about a government shutdown now or the next time the Trump administration and Congress face budgetary crossroads.\n\"We're coming up on the March 14 expiration of the current FY 2025 appropriations continuing resolution. If that expires without action, the government will shut down, and a shutdown for any considerable length of time could lead to a delay in federal funding reimbursements for meals and services delivered,\" said\n\"This would force Meals on Wheels providers to make near impossible choices such as suspending meal services, initiating or expanding waiting lists for meals, reducing the number of meals or delivery days or even closing their doors altogether.\"\nShe's also worried about the future of the OAA.\n\"We are deeply disappointed that the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act (OAA) has not yet happened despite it lapsing several months ago,\" Franklin said.\n\"This serves as a stark reminder that the needs of our nation's older adults do not receive the attention they deserve. It is crucial to not only reauthorize the OAA but also to increase funding for this vital legislation,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This illegal, terrorizing behavior would be expected from a dictatorship but not from our government.Any doubt as to the in terrorem role ICE would serve for the Trump regime is quickly vanishing. ICE is for Trump what the Gestapo was for Hitler, a force to stifle opposition with threats, force and torture.\nKhalil has no criminal record. All he did was to exercise his Constitutional rights by organizing peaceful protests at Columbia that opposed continued funding for Netanyahu as Netanyahu committed well-documented war crimes against Palestinians.\nWhen confronted, ICE first claimed Khalil's visa was being revoked but, when informed that he has a green card, changed its story to state his green card was being revoked. However, the decision to revoke a green card can only be made by an immigration judge after the government procures a warrant, makes a legal arrest, files charges, tries the person, convicts the person and allows that person to exhaust all appeals.\nInstead of allowing the due process our Constitution affords every person – citizen or not – the Trump regime executed an autocratic move to stifle dissent and disappear a dissenter that resembles the manner in which Putin deals with dissenters in Russia. This amounts to government terrorism and follows the Trump regime's open repression of student activism and political speech, in this instance criticism of Israel and Netanyahu. Thus, the Trump regime has shown it will use immigration to suppress free speech.\nIf Columbia secretly colluded with the Trump regime in the arrest, it may be a result of the regime's recent cancellation of $400 million in grants and contracts. Trump proved that he is willing to use extortion to achieve personal goals when threatened to withhold funding to force Ukraine to announce an investigation of Biden, so it is not surprising that Trump would use extortion to force colleges to kowtow to his wishes to silence dissent by wrongfully withholding the funds they are entitled to receive, but it is chilling.\nAmericans must speak out against this brutal and illegal conduct.\nJACK L.

Jamie Raskin comes to Cambridge for town hall\n\n March 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 571\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Energy was high as Eastern Shore residents packed the gymnasium at Mace's Lane Middle School Saturday for Cambridge Indivisible and Eastern Shore Indivisible's town hall event with Maryland U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.).\"I know I was not your first choice,\" Raskin said over cheers from the crowd. \"I heard your congressman couldn't quite squeeze you in today.\"\nRaskin represents most of Montgomery County and part of Prince George's County. Cambridge Indivisible Co-Founder and Co-Chair Michelle Fowle said the organization invited Maryland U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) — who represents the Eastern Shore and lives in Cambridge — but Harris didn't respond.\n\"We made it super easy for him to be here, and he didn't even have the decency to formally decline,\" Fowle said. \"He just completely ignores us and just tells everybody that we're paid $40 an hour and bused in.\"\nAlthough Harris wasn't at the Cambridge Indivisible event Saturday, he is holding a telephone hall for residents on Tuesday, March 25. Those who would like to attend the event, which will be from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m., can listen in by calling 833-380-0671 or can stream the event at harris.house.gov/live.\nDuring the town hall Saturday, Raskin expressed concerns with the Republican Party's priorities.\nHe brought up recent actions taken by President Donald Trump and the the Department of Government Efficiency. He said he is trying to \"stop this savage assault on American democracy.\"\n\"They're not opponents of corruption,\" Raskin said. \"They're agents of corruption.\"\nWhen it came to the question and answer portion of the town hall, residents asked what could be done in response to the Trump administration's actions.\nMany made a point to mention they were not paid to be there, referencing Harris' words following a rally Cambridge Indivisible organized in opposition to the congressman March 13. Harris told members of the media he didn't believe many of the people at the rally were his constituents, adding that he believed they were paid protesters \"brought in by buses.\"\nCommenting on the Saturday town hall, Harris said in a statement Monday that it's \"ironic\" that \"ultra-radical leftist\" Raskin is \"suddenly pretending to care about our farmers, watermen and people on the Eastern Shore after four years of voting for reckless Biden administration policies and radical environmental regulations — which almost crushed our Eastern Shore economy.\"\n\"If these protests weren't being paid for and influenced by radical Democrat activists, Jaime Raskin would have stayed on the western shore — right where he and his radical policies belong,\" Harris said.\nThroughout the event Saturday, volunteers were available with smart phones to capture residents' stories.\n\"Andy Harris can ignore our emails, he can dodge our phone calls and he can refuse to hold a town hall,\" Cambridge Indivisible Co-Founder and Co-Chair Andy Fowle said. \"But he cannot erase our stories.\"\nRetired East New Market resident Roscoe Handy, who attended the event, said he has concerns about the fate of Social Security, Medicare and the U.S. Department of Education. He said Harris needs to hear from his constituents and put a face to their name.\n\"I didn't necessarily vote for him. However, I'm in his district,\" said Handy, a Democrat.\nAt the end of the event, Raskin was asked if he has plans to run for president in the next U.S. presidential election.\n\"I will do whatever is necessary for us to save our democracy,\" he said in response as applause and cheers filled the room.\nThis report has been updated to include comment from Andy Harris. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2025-04-01",
    "author": "PAUL KIEFER Capital News Service",
    "content": "Loss of federal funds could leave migrant children in the lurch\n\n April 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: PAUL KIEFER Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 803\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Trump administration is moving ahead with plans to end a contract that pays for the legal representation of children navigating immigration court cases after entering the country without parents or guardians.That decision could have outsize impacts in Maryland, where a disproportionate share of unaccompanied immigrant children have landed in recent years, often fleeing violence, sexual abuse, and neglect.\nThe state's nonprofit legal aid groups are now grappling with the prospect of young clients facing the courts alone, raising the risk that children miss hearings, lose connections to service providers, and receive deportation orders.\nEstefani Flores Portillo, a social services coordinator with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, says the loss of funding could also leave more than a thousand clients across Maryland — most in their teens — to balance fending for themselves in immigration court with the day-to-day challenges of acclimating to a new country.\n\"Outside of their legal case, they also have other priorities,\" she said. Most of her clients are enrolled in school, some hold down jobs to cover basic living expenses, and many require therapy to process traumas inflicted both in their home countries and during their journeys to the U.S.\nBurdened with those competing pressures, she added, \"it would be hard for them to focus on the legal case\" without the assistance of an attorney.\nOn March 21, the administration notified nonprofit legal aid groups providing representation for unaccompanied immigrant children that it would terminate the contract that funds their work. Those legal aid groups collectively represent more than 26,000 children with cases before immigration courts across the country, and they provide consultations and referrals to thousands more each year.\nThe withdrawal of federal support for legal representation of immigrant children comes as immigration courts struggle to manage a staggering backlog of cases, including more than 50,000 in Maryland alone as of February 2025.\nMaryland has received among the largest numbers of unaccompanied immigrant children in the past decade relative to other states.\nData from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) indicates that nearly 40,000 unaccompanied immigrant children have been released to sponsors — either family members or volunteers — in Maryland since 2014. A majority of those children arrived after 2020, primarily from Central America.\nOnly Texas, California, Florida and New York received more unaccompanied immigrant children in the same period.\nRoughly 13,000 of those children landed in Prince George's County alone, though even some corners of rural Maryland have seen hundreds of new arrivals in the past five years.\nEven with legal representation, unaccompanied children often spend years awaiting the resolution of their case, both because of the burden on immigration courts and asylum offices and because of the limited number of visas available each year.\n\"Kids don't want to think about these things longer than they have to,\" said Caroline Hodge, a supervising attorney with the Amica Center. The immigration court system is difficult enough for attorneys to navigate, she added, and children hardly stand a chance on their own.\nThough the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act requires HHS to provide legal counsel to all children in its care \"to the greatest extent possible,\" thousands of children with open immigration cases already lack representation.\nThat shortfall is driven in part by a nationwide shortage of immigration attorneys prepared to work with juvenile clients. Until this month, federal dollars also helped nonprofits like the Amica Center train attorneys willing to volunteer their time to represent children in immigration court. The end of the federal contract supporting her organization's work, Hodge said, also means her team will no longer be able to provide that training.\nImmigration court data collected by the U.S. Department of Justice between 2004 and 2016 suggests that roughly 60 percent of children with cases in a Maryland immigration court had legal representation during that period. The same data indicates that while nearly all children with attorneys appeared in court for a final decision in their case, only a third of those without attorneys did so.\n\"The idea of going to court is so terrifying for a child,\" Hodge said, \"and people without information, without representation, will definitely feel more fearful to engage.\"\nThe Trump administration has already signaled its interest in following through on deportation orders issued for children who fail to appear for immigration court hearings.\nMaryland's Department of Human Services, which houses the state's Office for Refugees and Asylees, has so far avoided commenting on the end of federal funding for immigrant children's legal representation. A department spokesperson referred CNS to its federal counterpart, HHS, for comment, though that agency likewise did not immediately respond to inquiries about the expected outcomes of the decision.\nMeanwhile, legal aid groups told Capital News Service that some attorneys fear that continuing to offer pro bono legal assistance to immigrants will make them targets, citing the White House's recent efforts to punish law firms deemed hostile to the administration. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Auctioneers assured bidders that their identities are not revealed.\n\"We tried to sell it last auction with a big reserve, and I called it … radioactive,\" Panagopulos said about Epstein's notebook moments before the auction started Wednesday morning. \"There are people who won't even touch it, right?\"\nThe book went on quite a journey before the Elkton-based auctioneer acquired the black plastic Gestetner-bound contact log. Denise Ondayko, a musician from the East Village, claims she found the book on a Manhattan sidewalk in the 1990s, according to Business Insider. After Epstein's death in 2019, she put it up for sale on eBay.\nChristopher Helali — the International Secretary for the American Communist Party, who was working as an independent reporter — purchased it for a mere $425, according to the New York Post.\n\"Nobody believes it's real. He buys it for nothing, and he is more interested in the story than in the value of the piece,\" Panagopulos said, adding that Helali had Business Insider bring in a forensic expert to authenticate the book.\nThe 4.5-inch-by-5.25 inch book contains 386 printed entries varying in length from one or two lines to 10 or 15 lines each. It has two additional entries written in what looks like Epstein's handwriting, but is too small to tell, according to the auction item description. There are five highlighted names who are all well recognized financial and industrial professionals, including current president Donald Trump.\nThe FBI discovered a different \"little black book\" of Epstein's circa 2004, and used it in legal proceedings throughout his various for soliciting prostitution from minors and federal sex trafficking. FBI investigations started in 2005, with a pause for several years in between, and ended in 2019 when the criminal was found dead in his jail cell, which investigators declared a suicide, according to the Associated Press.\nThe earlier book — which was just sold at auction — was not considered important to the investigation when it was discovered. The two volumes combined hold 1,731 names, 221 of which are in the earlier book, but not the 2004 version, according to Business Insider. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Changes in Washington may start affecting many\n\n April 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JANE C. MURPHY | Section: Columns \n \n 938\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Each day brings more bad news. I am a retired law professor living in Oxford. I am used to viewing the daily news from a distance. I care deeply about the state of the world, my country and my state but fluctuations in foreign and domestic policy have rarely touched me directly.All that changed on Jan. 20. Despite the privileges and protections, I am granted as a white, financially comfortable, United States citizen, the relentless blows from the White House over the last few months have struck close to home. So, even if the existential threats to our democracy or the daily cruelty to our most vulnerable have not moved you, you might need to start paying attention.\nI'll start closest to home — my four adult children. Two of them are lawyers — one in Big Law and one a public defender. I worry about the attacks on my son's law firm and how it will affect him in both the short and long term. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that allows my daughter to work at a high-need, low-paying job while managing law school loans is on the chopping block. Another daughter, traveling in the Middle East as part of a Ph.D. program, is at risk due to the escalating violence in that part of the world because of Trump's threats against Palestine, Yemen and Iran. My youngest child works for a foundation supporting critical cancer research by \"filling in the gaps\" when National Institutes of Health grants fall short. Instead of celebrating the amazing leaps in cancer treatment, they are struggling to help keep labs open while rethinking their mission.\nI have lots of worries about my grandchildren growing up in a world where protecting the environment, demonstrating compassion for others and maintaining ethics in government have all but disappeared in Washington. But my more immediate concern is how a baby and a toddler, just beginning their vaccination schedules, will fare with a confirmed measles case in Maryland near their home and anti-vaxxers running our major health agencies.\nOne step removed from my children and grandchildren is my broad network of former students and other mentees in the legal profession. I have heard from some, among the best and the brightest, who had offers to work in the Honors Programs in various federal agencies rescinded. Others in probationary positions doing outstanding work have been fired.\nStill others, more long-term employees, have found themselves moved to distant buildings without parking, computers and, in one case, running water. I worry for these smart, hardworking young people and the future of the Rule of Law.\nMy husband and I are among the least vulnerable but these relentless reversals in policy have touched our lives in tangible ways.\nOur town, Oxford, has been, like many other places, adversely affected by climate change. A local lab, the Oxford Cooperative Laboratory, is funded in large part by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has a variety of important responsibilities including tracking rising temperatures and creating early warning systems for natural disasters.\nScientists at the Oxford lab have been working on a project to prevent the recurring flooding and shoreline erosion in areas I travel along daily. Consistent with this Administration's rejection of climate science and research, NOAA has recently had its funding slashed. As a result, two of the marine scientists involved in the anti-flooding work were abruptly let go. This left Oxford's shoreline project in limbo and potentially wasting the time and money already invested. Those scientists were also two more neighbors who have lost jobs.\nI am on the Board of Directors of the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, an Easton nonprofit whose mission is to \"empower people from different cultures to become successful and engaged members of our community\" As part of its mission, the center serves immigrant families from all over Talbot, Caroline and Dorchester counties. These families are valued members of our community, contributing to the culture and economy of our region.\nOur staff and board, always hard working, have been stretched thin trying to meet the needs of the families whose legal status in this country is threatened by near daily changes in immigration policy and enforcement. Even my \"happy place,\" the Talbot County public libraries, have been hit with federal budget cuts which will impact the purchase of equipment and collections, particularly for young children.\nFinally, the plunging stock market has, of course, led to declining retirement savings. Like many others, we worry about the unpredictable and damaging swings in the market that are wreaking havoc on our decadeslong savings. And a recent call to the Social Security Office in Cambridge to check on my Medicare payments included a much longer than usual hold time, leaving me with concerns about the future of that income stream as well. And, as income drops, we can all expect food and other prices to rise as farmers and others deal with ever-changing tariffs.\nTo be clear, this is not a plea for sympathy for millennial professionals or their comfortable parents. Nothing I have described comes close to the harms that have been inflicted on millions of people who are more seriously and directly being hurt every day — immigrants deported or living in fear of it, federal workers who have lost jobs in mid- or late-career, patients who have lost access to life-saving drugs, and so many more. But if you're thinking of sitting this one out because of the invulnerability you normally feel, think again.\nOur fates are interconnected. And even the many and deep protections that your race, wealth and citizenship have always afforded you may not be enough to protect you this time around. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Today you need news from different sources\n\n April 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 731\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When Walter Cronkite anchored the CBS Evening News from 1962 until 1981, he closed with \"And that's the way it is.\"His substantial number of viewers readily accepted that conclusion as he was widely considered to be \"the most trusted man in America.\"\nFast forward to today. The media world has changed dramatically and changes constantly.\nThe three legacy national news providers who once had a monopoly on electronic news delivery, now have intense competition from other providers for viewers and for relevance.\nThese providers include, but are not limited to, Fox News, CNN, CNBC, AL Jazeera English, The CW, MSNBC and Blaze Media. They include 24x7 podcasts, radio talk shows, blogs, X (formerly known as Twitter), Facebook and countless other social media platforms.\nToday almost every American has access to electronic news outlets whose perspectives on the news range from far left, left of center, far right and right of center. Some of their perspectives (read biases) are subtle, some are thinly disguised, and some are unapologetically obvious.\nSome suggest more media is better.\nThey suggest in an increasingly diverse society, every American is now in a position to follow and support those electronic national news providers whose perspectives on the news most closely matches their own perspectives.\nI agree, but only to a point.\nI suggest too many electronic national news providers are not committed to providing balanced news, especially balanced political news.\nInstead they provide news in a targeted way that affirms what certain viewers already think.\nThat strategy generates a durable collection of viewers for that news provider, which in turn helps recruit and retain advertisers.\nIt does not generate trust.\nTwo months ago, the Gallup Organization released the results of polling Americans trust in the media. This polling exercise has been done regularly by Gallup for over half a century.\nIn this most recent report, Gallup noted that over the past three decades, public confidence in the mass media has collapsed.\nThey also noted Americans' trust in the mass media is at its lowest point in more than five decades.\nTrust levels are down with Republican voters, Democratic voters and unaffiliated voters. These trust levels are even lower than for Congress, the presidency and the U.S. Supreme Court.\nToday, not one national media individual is widely considered as the most trusted news provider in America as was Cronkite.\nWe are dealing with the consequences of William F. Buckley's observation that some people claim to want to give a hearing to other views, but then are shocked and offended to discover there actually are other views.\nAs a result, these people will not even consider following news from media outlets other than those who present news with a perspective that most closely aligns with their own.\nNow more than ever, we owe it to ourselves and to our society, to explore and thoughtfully consider other points of view.\nAt the very least, I suggest if we follow the news from a right of center national media outlet, we take time to follow the news from a comparable left of center national media outlet.\nConversely, I suggest if we follow the news from a national left of center left media outlet, we take time to follow get news from a comparable national right of center media outlet.\nWhen we do that, we must give due consideration to other views and then make thoughtful and informed decisions on our current views.\nUnderstanding and respecting other views is different from accepting them fully or in part.\nIn every case, we can choose to keep our current views, revise them or replace them.\nI further suggest we reject the notion that changing one's mind is a character flaw and accept the notion that changing one's mind is actually a character strength.\nIf or when you do revise or fully reverse your views, expect to be told you are inconsistent.\nIn any event, be true to yourself and stand firm.\nRemember Winston Churchill's guiding principle when he was told he was inconsistent (a regular occurrence in his long and successful life).\nHe said, \"When I consider facts that challenge my current views, I will change my mind and be inconsistent and right, rather than be consistent and wrong.\"\nExcellent advice for all of us especially when we live in a VUCA world, a world with high levels of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity.\nIn such a world, regularly evaluating views with an open mind that may result in a changed mind, is always better than holding on to views with a closed mind. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When a reporter called on Monday, the Caroline County Sheriff's Office was not aware of the incident.\nValezquez and Ramirez worked for multiple farms in the Preston and Hurlock area. When farm owners learned they were taken by immigration agents, they were devastated.\n\"We were devastated,\" said Bret Colbourne, owner of Triangle Acres Farm. \"Very good, hard-working people, honest, never in trouble.\"\n\"It was devastating to all of us. We cannot believe it, for our whole community around it,\" Bret's wife, Myra Colbourne, said.\nRamirez, who also worked part time for TJ Farms in Preston, was described as \"a nice fellow\" by the farm's owner Timmy Jester.\n\"Well, he's a real nice guy, and he worked several different farms around here,\" Jester said. \"But when we needed him, he would help us, and he certainly didn't cause any trouble or anything. He was a nice fellow.\"\nThe Colbourne family had developed a relationship with the couple and described their relationship as really good friends. They even described Lili Ramirez as their granddaughter.\n\"They're very good friends of ours, and their daughter, she's going to school to be a nurse,\" Bret said. \"Been helping me for 10 or 12 years probably, longer.\"\nWhile the $10,000 goal was surpassed on the GoFundMe, the $10,000 was just enough to retain a lawyer. According to the Colbourne family, the price of a bond is unknown.\n\"We don't know yet, and that's the disturbing part,\" Bret Colbourne said.\nThough immigration enforcement has seen increased attention since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, Matthew Peters, director at Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, said immigration enforcement on the Eastern Shore has been at a steady rate since 2012.\n\"So since we've been working in this role with the immigrant community since 2012, we've always seen immigration enforcement, it's always been here,\" Peters said. \"Now the degree and the number varies from month to month, season to season, year to year.\"\nWhile farmers in Caroline County hope for the couple's return, they expect heavy declines in production due to the couple's absence.\n\"I'm getting older, and he's been helping me out part time all along. There's no help around anymore. You can't hardly find anyone working on a farm anymore,\" Jester said. \"We're probably just going to close the produce, and we're just going to buy from wholesalers and resell it instead of growing it ourselves because it's just too much hard work. Nobody wants to do any hard work, and he would always come.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Lincoln offers thoughts to ponder on Memorial Day\n\n May 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 700\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Monday May 26 is Memorial Day in America.The first version of an American Memorial Day occurred in May 1868, three years after the end of the American Civil War.\nThen named Decoration Day, it only honored Union soldiers who died in that war.\nIt was followed with many local observances of remembrance where volunteers placed flowers on the graves of all Civil War veterans.\nOnly after World War I and World War II did these observances evolve into honoring the sacrifices all members of all the U.S. military who died during wartime service.\nIn 1968, Congress and then President Nixon approved permanently scheduling the national observance to the last Monday in May, and in 1971 Congress and then President Nixon approved the official name of the national holiday as Memorial Day.\nMemorial Day remains as the only one of three military related holidays that honors individuals who died as a result of serving in the U.S. military during a time of war.\nSadly, in today's world, Memorial Day no longer receives the attention and respect it deserves.\nFor many Americans, Memorial Day is just another three-day holiday weekend.\nIt is a time for family gatherings, picnics, trips \"downy ocean\", catching up on household chores, and watching sporting events, most notably the Indianapolis 500 car race.\nMemorial Day is also almost universally considered to mark the beginning of the summer season.\nIt is not that way everywhere, especially in The Netherlands, also referred to as Holland.\nThe Netherlands has a Remembrance Day every two years where they commemorate three major events in their history.\nThe events are the anniversary of end of World War II in Europe, the end of a five-year occupation by Germany during that war and remembering those in military service who died during World War II.\nA major element of their remembrance occurs at the American Cemetery Margraten, a village in the most southern part of The Netherlands.\nMargraten has a memorable place in European military history.\nThe village is close to a highway built originally by the Roman Empire that was used by Caesar, Charlemagne, Charles V, Napoleon and Kaiser Wilhelm II.\nIn May 1940, Nazi soldiers used the highway on a successful campaign to occupy the Low Countries of Europe — The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.\nIn September 1944, Nazi troops used it again to retreat from the Low Countries they had occupied for four years.\nIn November 1944, the American Cemetery Margraten was developed as the final resting place for 8,288 Americans who died in World War II. It includes a Wall of the Missing with the names of 1,722 individuals classified as missing in action.\nBurials include five recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor, America's highest recognition for gallantry in combat beyond the call of duty. The burial includes soldiers whose rank ranges from private first class to two-star general.\nUnique to the cemetery is the deep and lasting connection it has with residents of the Margraten community.\nSince 1945, they have \"adopted\" grave sites in the Netherlands American Cemetery.\nOne weekend every two years, they bring flowers to the graves and post pictures of the fallen.\nMore than 3,000 photos are on display that weekend next to headstones and on the Walls of the Missing.\nThis tradition is so revered that there is a long waiting list to serve as volunteers for this solemn undertaking.\nIt is very unlikely Americans will ever come close to replicating the Margraten way of celebrating a Memorial Day tradition.\nAt the very least, we all can take time sometime during the Memorial Day weekend to pause and reflect on the words Abraham Lincoln included in his Gettysburg Address.\nHe said in part:\n\"It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain —that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people , shall not perish from the earth.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trump rebrands 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy\n\n June 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TONY WOODS | Section: Columns \n \n 730\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In 2008, I was kicked out of the military because of my sexual orientation under \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" More than a decade after the military overturned that policy, the Trump administration is playing politics and bringing discrimination back to our armed forces. But this time, instead of purging troops for who they love, it punishes them for who they are.Today, brave transgender service members serve in uniform, many of whom have deployed, commanded troops, and put their lives on the line for this country. They serve at twice the rate of the general population, choosing military service at an extraordinary level of commitment.\nThe new order banning transgender personnel is written in broad strokes, just as the original Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy was. That meant nearly anyone could get caught in the dragnet — service members who had never spoken a word about their identity, those outed by others, even those falsely accused. The effects of this policy are even more sweeping as it mandates proactively kicking out any trans service member who has sought basic evidence-based, medically-necessary care just like any other service member.\nThe justifications for this policy echo the baseless justifications once used to discriminate against Black Americans, women, and gay people. While opposing the integration of Black troops into the military, then-Army Chief of Staff General Dwight D. Eisenhower warned that \"the army is not a sociological laboratory\" and that such \"experiments\" would harm morale and discipline.\nIn 1941, Sen. David Walsh argued that allowing women in the Navy \"would tend to break up American homes and would be a step backward in the progress of civilization.\"\nMore than half a century later, in defense of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Sen. Chuck Hagel insisted that \"the U.S. armed forces aren't some social experiment.\" And as recently as 2015, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee used nearly identical rhetoric to oppose women in combat roles, saying, \"The military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military is to kill people and break things.\"\nThis kind of thinking was wrong then, and it's wrong now.\nThe reason my grandfather, a Black man, was able to serve in an integrated military was because we retired those old, backward ideas. The reason my mother was able to serve in the armed forces was because people rejected the notion that women didn't belong in uniform. And the reason I am able to serve today is because \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" was finally tossed onto the ash heap of history.\nBut sometimes, bad ideas don't die. They get repackaged and rebranded. That's what we're seeing now.\nUnder this new policy, even service members who have fully transitioned and are operationally fit will be discharged. Military academies will be forced to expel trans cadets and midshipmen. Recruiters will turn away talented individuals who want nothing more than to serve their country. It is a deliberate purge, one that echoes the discrimination that kept LGBTQ+ Americans out of the military for decades.\nThe U.S. military is already struggling to meet its recruitment goals, missing its target for the Army by 11,000 in 2023 and barely reaching its recruiting goals for 2024 after dramatically lowering them. Why would we turn away trained, capable warfighters — people in whom American taxpayers have already invested millions in training — at a time when we need them most?\nHistory will look back on this decision as a shameful moment, just as it now does on previous efforts to bar women, Black Americans and LGBTQ+ individuals from serving openly. And as before, this policy will not last. It will be challenged, it will be overturned, and one day, we will wonder how it was ever considered acceptable to turn away Americans willing to serve.\nBut the cost in the meantime will be real. Careers will be destroyed. Lives will be upended. Our national security weakened. And America's promise — that anyone who steps forward to serve will be judged by their ability, not their identity — will be broken.\nTo those who have worn the uniform, this moment is not just about policy. It is about principle. Service members swear an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. That oath does not ask for gender identity. It does not make exceptions. It simply demands the courage to stand up when the nation calls.\nThe question now is whether our leaders will do the same. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Easton resident said he's gravely worried for the future of his family.\n\"This world is coming to a crumble,\" Stanford said. He added that the landscape of the current federal administration is the \"worst I've ever seen it.\"\nHundreds of local residents like Stanford lined Dover Street on Saturday morning as part of Easton's \"No Kings\" protest, one of thousands of demonstrations across the nation to object President Donald Trump and his actions since taking office in January.\nThe protests, promoted as peaceful, were coordinated by an extensive network of progressive organizations to coincide with a military parade hosted by Trump in honor of the Army's 250th birthday.\nIn Easton, protesters staged from the corner of Dover Road and Route 50 down the Dover Street sidewalk to the corner of South Harrison Street. They received frequent honks of support from vehicles passing by. A handful of drivers and passengers contested the protesters verbally, though no major incidents occurred and there was largely no police presence.\nTalbot County Democratic Central Committee members Justin Butler and Jair Devereaux led parts of the protests and engaged crowded sidewalks of protesters in chants.\nPhil Jackson, chair of the Democratic committee, said in a written statement that the \"No Kings\" theme rejects authoritarianism and defends democracy.\n\"Talbot County knows its history — we've seen what happens when silence replaces action,\" Jackson wrote. \"Today, we chose action. With over 500 people lining E. Dover Street, peacefully protesting, it's a clear and emphatic rejection of strongman politics, dynastic privilege, and the erosion of our democracy.\"\nMany protestors cited concerns about cuts to Medicaid and Trump's continued immigration crackdown efforts as their motivation for attending.\nOne Easton resident named Steve, who declined to provide his last name, said he's particularly upset about the administration's actions against immigrants and diversity, equity and inclusion policies.\n\"They're still chasing the American Dream, whether it exists or not,\" he said of the nation's immigrants.\nRoseann Newell, an Easton resident of more than 40 years, said she had every reason to come out and protest the Trump administration.\n\"What didn't bring me out today?\" Newell asked.\nSt. Michaels resident Paulette Florio said there's a \"government of tragedy happening.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

U.S. District Judge John McConnell Jr. barred federal transportation officials from carrying out that threat before the lawsuit is fully resolved.\n\"The Court finds that the States have demonstrated they will face irreparable and continuing harm if forced to agree to Defendants' unlawful and unconstitutional immigration conditions imposed in order to receive federal transportation grant funds,\" wrote McConnell, the chief judge for the federal district of Rhode island. \"The States face losing billions of dollars in federal funding, are being put in a position of relinquishing their sovereign right to decide how to use their own police officers, are at risk of losing the trust built between local law enforcement and immigrant communities, and will have to scale back, reconsider, or cancel ongoing transportation projects.\"\nThe Talbot County Council voted this month to remove the diversity, equity and inclusion statement from the county's employee handbook, reversing course from March, when the council upheld the diversity statement.\nThe local decision came amid concerns for millions of dollars in federal funding for an ongoing Easton Airport project. Those worries stem from an April directive from Duffy outlining the Trump administration's view that DEI programs violate federal law.\nMassachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell, in a statement posted on Bluesky, welcomed the ruling.\n\"The court granted a temporary order halting the Trump administration's attempt to hold critical funding for states if they don't comply with their cruel immigration policies,\" Campbell said. This would have put critical funding for transportation in MA at risk. It's not just wrong — it's illegal.\"\nIn statement posted on X, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said the ruling wasn't surprising.\n\"I directed states who want federal DOT money to comply with federal immigration laws,\" Duffy said. \"But, no surprise, an Obama-appointed judge has ruled that states can openly defy our federal immigration laws. This is judicial activism pure and simple and I will continue to fight in the courts.\"\nOn April 24, states received letters from the Department of Transportation stating that they must cooperate on immigration efforts or risk losing the congressionally appropriated funds. No funding was immediately withheld, but some of the states feared the move was imminent.\nAttorneys general from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont filed the lawsuit in May, saying the new so-called \"Duffy Directive\" put them in an impossible position.\n\"The States can either attempt to comply with an unlawful and unconstitutional condition that would surrender their sovereign control over their own law enforcement officers and reduce immigrants' willingness to report crimes and participate in public health programs — or they can forfeit tens of billions of dollars of funds they rely on regularly to support the roads, highways, railways, airways, ferries, and bridges that connect their communities and homes,\" the attorneys general wrote in court documents.\nBut acting Rhode Island U.S. Attorney Sara Miron Bloom told the judge that Congress has given the Department of Transportation the legal right to set conditions for the grant money it administers to states, and that requiring compliance and cooperation with federal law enforcement is a reasonable exercise of that discretion. Allowing the federal government to withhold the funds while the lawsuit moves forward doesn't cause any lasting harm, Bloom wrote in court documents, because that money can always be disbursed later if needed.\nBut requiring the federal government to release the money to uncooperative states will likely make it impossible to recoup later, if the Department of Transportation wins the case, Bloom said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Immigration is winning issue for Republicans\n\n June 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 736\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In an increasingly polarized America, one public policy issue with decades of unresolved and widely divergent opinions has been southern border immigration into America.On one side are those who feel strongly that deportations of every immigrant who has not followed long established, but not enforced immigration laws, are long overdue, necessary and proper.\nOn the other side are those who feel strongly that mass deportations of southern border immigrants who have not earned legal immigration status is not feasible, needed or proper.\nOne thing is irrefutable.\nSouthern border immigration was a huge issue, if not the issue in the 2024 presidential and congressional elections, when Donald Trump won the presidency for a second nonconsecutive term and Republicans secured majorities in both houses of Congress.\nRecently, Harry Enten, chief data analyst at left of center CNN, did a deep dive on the current state of this issue during the height of the protests in Los Angeles.\nThe Columbia Journalism Review calls Enten \"a new generation of political journalists focusing on data-driven journalism instead of reporting from the campaign trail.\"\nEnten has reported that no group has moved more sharply to the right on immigration than southern border immigrants who went through the long and arduous process to become an American citizen.\nThey followed the rules and waited patiently for the process to be done. They filled out forms, took citizenship tests, paid fees and often spent years separated from family while following U.S. immigration law to the letter.\nAccording to Enten, since 2020 this group of immigrants has shifted its partisan allegiance toward Republicans by a large margin.\nIn 2020, Democrats held a 32-point lead among these voters on the issue of who best to address southern border immigration issues.\nToday, Republicans are up by a 40-point lead resulting in Enten concluding bluntly, \"This group of voters in the American electorate believes that \"the Democrats don't have a clue on the issue of immigration.\"\nEnten also suggests, \"Trump is begging for a fight on this because he knows what he's doing so far is working with the American electorate. There is no issue on which Trump is doing so much better than he was in his first term, more than the issue of immigration.\"\nEnten maintained other polls affirm his conclusions. He cites comparable results from CBS and from Ipsos, a multinational research firm headquartered in Paris.\nEnten says, \"No matter what poll you look at, no matter which way you cut it, the American public is with the Republicans. The American public is with Trump.\"\nNot necessarily and certainly not guaranteed for the long term.\nIn reviewing survey results, one must remember they are a snapshot at a given point in time.\nAmerican voters are often inconsistent and are always unpredictable. Their views on any and all public policy issues are subject to change dramatically.\nAfter relatively peaceful nationwide \"No King\" protests, right of center Fox News engaged Daron Shaw, a Republican pollster, and Chris Anderson, a Democratic pollster, for a survey.\nTheir survey results included an unexpected shift by unaffiliated (independent) voters on the issue of widely publicized ongoing searches for illegal immigrants led by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.\nThose unaffiliated voters are now expressing concern that ICE efforts are \"heavy-handed and cast the deportment net too broadly\".\nAs I write this, there is breaking news on American military action in Iran.\nThat will have a profound impact on the results of any future current events polling results, regardless of who conducts the surveys.\nFor now, the range of issues and their current interest intensity by respondents to the Shaw and Anderson polling are:\n85% of the survey respondents were extremely or very concerned about the future of America.\n84% of the survey respondents were extremely or very concerned about inflation.\n80% of the survey respondents were extremely or very concerned about government spending.\n78% of the survey respondents were extremely or very concerned about Iran.\n69% of the survey respondents were extremely or very concerned about antisemitism.\n67% of the survey respondents were extremely or very concerned about immigration.\nThe mid-term general elections are less than 18 months from now.\nIt will be interesting to see which issues, if any of the above or new ones yet to emerge, will have the greatest impact on voter views, turnout and choices in the midterm elections.\nDonald Trump will not be on the ballot, but midterm voters will decide party control of the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate during the last two years of the Trump administration. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Here's the difference between a king and a president\n\n July 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JIM BRUCE | Section: Columns \n \n 724\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On June 10, Talbot County learned firsthand the difference between a president and a would-be king. The county sought to improve our airport with the federal government providing 90% of the cost, typical for smaller airports. All was set until U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy wrote on April 24 to the effect that Talbot County and every other county would not receive airport or other federal funding, unless they removed from their policies anything labeled \"diversity, equity, and inclusion,\" because they are discriminatory and \"presumptively violate(s) federal law.\" In short, our county council could choose between policies labeled DEI or expanding our airport.In 2020, the County Council unanimously approved a diversity, equity, and inclusion statement that was noncontroversial and merely aspirational. They also adopted unanimously a resolution on diversity, saying county employees should understand the diversity of county residents to serve the public better. In two council sessions in early 2025, many residents testified to defend these policies against two Republicans' (Dave Stepp and Chuck Callahan) call for repeal, which the council rejected, an embarrassing Republican defeat.\nYet this month, June 10, the council, under the threat of losing federal funding for the airport, repealed the diversity resolution and DEI statement, which were adopted unanimously in 2020.\nEvery Talbot resident should understand what happened here. It shows the difference between a president and a would-be king, between a Constitutional democracy under the rule of law and an autocracy.\nOn Jan. 20, President Trump issued his Executive Order 14151, \"Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferences.\" He declared programs labeled DEI presumptively discriminatory, therefore illegal and directed all federal agencies to ferret out these programs and dismantle them. With no statute behind it, no due process (notice and comment) to determine if a DEI program is in fact discriminatory, no rule-making and no hearings, President Trump made illegal anything labeled DEI.\nFirst, no president before Trump has so broadly asserted that his 161 executive orders signed in 2025 are the equivalent of laws. Our Constitution says only the Congress makes laws. In contrast, absolute kings are not limited by legislatures, nor by due process, notice and comment procedures with which presidents must comply.\nSecond, the president unilaterally decreed, like a king, that his executive order would apply not just to federal agencies but to states and counties having DEI policies. A king's rule extends to all his realm including every county and village. In contrast, the 10th Amendment of the Constitution limits the reach of the federal government over states and local government. No president before Trump tried to dictate, without clear Congressional backing and due process, the policies adopted by state and local government.\nThird, Trump, like a monarch, would enforce his executive order by denying federal grants to any state or local government having DEI-labeled policies. Absolute kings, not the legislature, control their nation's purse. Under our Constitution, Congress controls the spending power. No president before has so broadly used federal funding to local government as a cudgel to enforce his views on federally funded projects.\nPredictably, several counties and other entities, including in Maryland, promptly sued the president for denying federal grants to entities with DEI policies. The cases cite the lack of a statutory basis, absence of notice and rule-making, violation of free speech and unconstitutional vagueness. Federal judges, one in Maryland, issued temporary restraining orders, but the litigation is ongoing.\nThe actions of Stepp and Callahan deserve attention here.\nThe county attorney stated he thought the county's DEI policies are in fact nondiscriminatory, and Duffy's letter deficient in legal reasoning. Ignoring this, the two Republicans pressed Trump's royal edict on the council on June 10, insisting that the council repeal what the council had earlier adopted unanimously and defended twice.\nLike envoys from the royal court, Stepp and Callahan played their trump card, the Duffy letter, proclaiming the very specific threat of loss of the airport funding if the Council did not repeal the DEI and diversity measures. The rest of the council, except for Councilwoman Keisha Haythe (D), buckled in the face of this likely illegal and draconian threat.\nThe tide is turning though. On June 14, more than 500 people in Talbot County protested for \"No Kings,\" joined by 5 million others nationwide.\nWhen the courts finally overrule Trump's unconstitutional overreach, the County Council should reinstate what they repealed on June 10. Long live Constitutional democracy. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Program for veterans facing foreclosure clears last hurdle in COngress\n\n July 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LINDA F. HERSHEY Stars and Stripes | Section: Real Estate \n \n 691\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Legislation that creates a safety net for thousands of veterans facing foreclosure with delinquent home mortgages now moves to the president's desk for his signature after passing the Senate.The VA Home Loan Program Reform Act, which was adopted by the Senate with a voice vote late Tuesday, establishes a partial claim program that allows veterans who are behind on home loan payments to receive federal assistance.\nA companion bill in the House was adopted by voice vote in May.\nThe bill authorizes the VA to purchase a portion of the debt on veterans loans in default or at imminent risk of default, according to the legislation.\nThe mortgage industry estimates more than 20,000 current borrowers are considered seriously delinquent and a partial claim program at the VA could help them retain their homes, lawmakers said. The goal is to help veterans catch up on payments and prevent foreclosure, they said.\n\"First, the bill authorizes the VA to pay the holder of a loan guaranteed by the VA an amount necessary to avoid the foreclosure of the loan, provided that the holder of the loan and the veteran obligated on the loan execute documents to ensure the VA obtains a secured interest in the property covered by the loan,\" according to the bill.\nLeaders from the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs committees released a joint statement after the Senate passed the bill.\n\"This bipartisan and bicameral legislation will assist veterans who are facing financial hardships and provide VA with a tool to better help veterans stay in their homes and avoid foreclosure. The VA Home Loan Program provides one of the best benefits VA has to offer and has helped veterans and their families build home equity since its inception in 1944,\" according to the joint statement.\nThe VA home loan program was created under The Servicemen's Readjustment Act, which became known as the GI Bill. More than 3.7 million veterans hold active home loans guaranteed by the VA, according to the agency.\nSen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., the committee's top Democrat, offered the formal remarks after Senate adoption.\nOn the House side, Rep. Mike Bost, R-Ill., chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and Rep. Mark Takano of California, the top Democrat on the committee, included their names on the statement.\n\"This legislation will ensure these veterans have a viable solution to avoid defaulting on their loans, bring their mortgages current, and avoid foreclosure by establishing a replacement partial claims program,\" the lawmakers said.\nThe partial claims program replaces the Veterans Affairs Servicing Program, which was described as a \"last-resort option\" for delinquent borrowers to lower their mortgage rate and make their monthly payments more affordable.\nUnder that program, the VA bought the mortgage from the servicer.\nBut the program permanently closed May 1, after Republican lawmakers complained the VA should not be in the business of buying home mortgages. They argued some veterans might intentionally fall behind on their payments to get a lower mortgage rate from the VA.\n\"My focus is to ensure that veterans remain in their homes whenever possible,\" said Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis. \"But I am concerned that this program could evolve into a financial burden of billions of dollars in bailouts that fall on the shoulders of taxpayers.\"\nVan Orden introduced the VA Home Loan Program Reform Act in the House for a partial claim program to allow veterans to catch up with their overdue mortgage payments while keeping the original loan.\nUnder the partial claim program, veterans facing financial hardship can defer missed payments without immediately facing foreclosure, Van Orden said.\nThe VA Home Loan Program Reform Act received support from lenders and other stakeholders, including the Mortgage Bankers Association, the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion.\n\"We encourage the VA and mortgage servicers to continue their collaboration as this program is implemented, ensuring that they help mitigate any impact on veterans facing financial hardship while VA takes the necessary steps to establish the new partial claims program properly,\" lawmakers said in the joint statement.\n© 2025 the Stars and Stripes.

In those days, our scientists typically swept Nobel and other international prizes. Not anymore; the Trump administration's drastic cuts in scientific personnel and budgets will \"essentially end America's longstanding role as the world leader in science and innovation,\" said Toby Smith, senior vice president for government relations and public policy at the Association of American Universities.The results are clear: As two economists recently wrote, in cutting-edge scientific research, whereas in 2017 the US led China in eight categories, by 2023, it led in only one, quantum computing.\nWe sometimes forget how important government-supported scientific research at university and other laboratories is in ordinary life. One study mentions as examples, \"lifesaving medicine, commercial agriculture and virtual communication. ... Of the 356 new drugs approved over the past decade, 354 received funding from the National Institutes of Health, the world's largest supporter of biomedical research.\"\nThe smartphone, computers and highways are other examples. The U.S. economy greatly benefits. As Karin Fischer writes in the Chronicle of Higher Education, \"A paper published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found that government spending on research and development has spurred at least a fifth of U.S. productivity growth since World War II.\" Yes, government-supported classified research underpins the military-industrial complex. Such spending contrasts with open, scientist-determined research in the public interest, with the government's role that of a distant funder.\nPOLITICALLY DRIVEN CUTS\nThe Trump administration has fundamentally changed independent research. It has become the \"minder\" of research programs in and outside government, much like a ministry in an authoritarian country. It is now impossible to get federal funding that supports research related to DEI, LGBTQ+ rights and climate change. Mere mention of those topics in National Science Foundation grant applications, over which DOGE presides, has ruled them out.\nThe Guardian has found that \"at least 1,653 active NSF research grants authorized on their merits have so far been abruptly cancelled.\" Scientists who don't agree with Trump's political agenda are being forced out — at Health and Human Services, for instance, where RFK Jr. has fired immunization scientists who disagree with his vaccination stance. The science program at the Environmental Protection Agency has just been dismantled.\nLeadership of key public health agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Food and Drug Administration, is in the hands of medical quacks. Karin Fischer, an educational researcher, reports further: \"The administration said it would stop underwriting scientific collaboration with overseas partners, and stepped up scrutiny of research contracts and other funds to colleges from foreign sources.\"\nMaking these determinations is a one-way street: Trump isn't negotiating new terms of collaboration; he's ordering them. For instance: Trump has ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to remove references to the climate crisis from its website; blocked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from publishing scientific information on the threat of bird flu to humans; fired senior leaders at the Federal Emergency Management Agency and cut about 1,000 jobs, with the Texas flood disaster one consequence; fired around 800 people at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, putting critical weather forecasting in a bind; and greatly reduced funds for investment in low-carbon technologies, despite the fact that those funds go overwhelmingly to Republican districts.\nANTI-SCIENCE, ANTI-EARTH\nThe Guardian offers an example of what happens to politically unacceptable research under Trump: Although Congress mandates that climate assessments be prepared every four years, the Trump administration has eliminated the online portal for the reports, according to The Guardian, which notes that researchers who were working on the next report, due around 2027, have been dismissed.\nThe Guardian was able to provide a copy of the latest assessment, conducted in 2023. It warns that the \"effects of human-caused climate change are already far-reaching and worsening across every region of the United States.\" \"Without rapid and deep reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions from human activities,\" the assessment continues, \"the risks of accelerating sea level rise, intensifying extreme weather and other harmful climate impacts will continue to grow.\" Such a conclusion is an anathema to a regime that is dedicated to the interests of the fossil fuel industry.\nThanks largely to Trump, America's scientific talent is now for sale. France, Japan, Australia, and the Netherlands are among the countries that are hiring away U.S. scientists. China has succeeded in luring back many scientists in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) who had hoped for careers in the U.S. Those students and researchers still in the U.S. are now regarded, not as assets but as political suspects.\nWhat we are witnessing, in short, is an anti-science, anti-intellectual cleansing that will cause immense harm to public health, the economy, education and America's reputation. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This is the third rally held for Espinal since his arrest.Around 100 people showed up on the corner of Route 50 and Dover Street to support Espinal, including Talbot County Council Vice President Pete Lesher and Dan Schwartz, one of three Democratic candidates running for Maryland's first congressional district, which includes Easton.\nEspinal was arrested on Monday, July 21, when ICE agents followed him from Lowe's to McDonald's, ultimately being arrested on Route 322 near the Easton pool.\nHe was initially taken to holding facility in Salisbury, then transferred to a temporary ICE facility in Baltimore, where he remained until July 24. He is now in Louisiana, where he is awaiting his hearing.\nEspinal has been in the country since 2001 and has been pastor of Iglesia del Nazareno Jesús Te Ama since 2015. He has no criminal record, paid his taxes and was in the process of seeking legal status, according to his daughter Clarissa Fuentes Diaz.\nICE said in a statement to The Star Democrat that Espinal overstayed a six-month visa by 24 years. Espinal's arrest comes amid a push by the President Donald Trump and his administration to step up immigration enforcement.\nCommunity members expressed \"outrage\" not only about Espinal's arrest, but by what they say is a lack of due process following.\nJim Bruce, a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum communications committee, said the Trump administration's actions violate fundamental legal principles established as far back as the Magna Carta.\n\"How Pastor Espinal could wind up in Louisiana without any kind of hearing is it strikes me that there should have been due process afforded him,\" Bruce said.\nEspinal has not had a hearing, and there is not currently one scheduled, according to Diaz.\nA June poll from Pew Research Center found approval of the Trump administration's approach to immigration was largely split along party lines, with 78% of Republicans approving of the approach and 81% of Democrats disapproving.\nBut multiple Easton community members, like Espinal's close friend Len Foxwell, suggested his arrest by ICE has become a bipartisan issue.\n\"People from both parties can share their dissatisfaction with what's happening in the case of Pastor Fuentes Espinal and with the immigration system that is fundamentally broken in this country,\" said Foxwell, former chief of staff for Democratic Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot.\nThese sentiments were echoed by Lesher, a Democrat, who said he believes that both parties are supporting Espinal because people have a sense of fairness.\n\"For somebody who was trying to work with the system, who is trying to do the right thing, who is paying taxes, who is raising a family, who was working and contributing to our community in so many ways. It just leads me to ask, why?\" Lesher said.\nMember of the Talbot County Democrat Forum Board of Directors Rick Hughes said it crosses party lines because it feels deeply personal to the community.\n\"The six degrees of separation make it so that it doesn't feels personal, and once you can make it personal, or it becomes personal, people are really motivated to take action,\" Hughes said.\nEspinal's arrest has spurred protest outside of Easton.\nA rally was held on Monday in Baltimore, where over 300 protesters marched from McKeldin Square to the Fallon Courthouse, the site of the temporary ICE detention center where Espinal was held before being transferred to Louisiana.\nDemocratic elected officials spoke once they reached the ICE facility, raising concerns about the transparency of the facility.\nEarlier in the day, Maryland public officials, including U.S. Sens. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), were denied a tour of the temporary detention center in Baltimore and held a sit in.\n\"These are elected members of the U.S. Congress and they are entitled to have full unrestrained access to any government facility that they wish,\" Foxwell said. \"But this is an administration that doesn't respect due process of the rule of law. And frankly, it is a terrible substandard subhuman facility,\" he said.\nFoxwell said that while Espinal was in the Baltimore facility, he had no bed, shower or place to brush his teeth, and he did not receive his medication, including a heart medication.\nThe Talbot County Democratic Forum said it will continue to hold rallies on Friday's from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. on Route 50 and Dover Street. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "This is not who we are ... a cruel people\n\n August 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LARRY PIFER | Section: Columns \n \n 670\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n There is an inscription on the Statue of Liberty's base proudly proclaiming:\"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\" That is what all of us believe and love about our country. My great-grandparents came from France and Germany, my wife's grandparents came from Ireland. I know when my great-grandmother was given a passport to come to New York and land at Ellis Island passing by the Statue of Liberty.\nUnfortunately, that is not who we are today.\nTrump has vilified illegal immigrants, and his administration is in such a frenzy to deport a million this year that lawful immigrants are caught up and deported as well. Their only crime is that they are immigrants.\nThe Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency claims that they are removing only people who have criminal records, \"the worst of the worst,\" Trump claims, but this is clearly untrue. Lawful immigrants and unlawful immigrants with no criminal record have been arrested by ICE in California in the Dodger stadium parking lot, in Home Depot parking lots, while they work in fields gathering crops.\nLuis Leon is an 82-year-old grandfather who was arrested by ICE at an immigration office in Pennsylvania at an appointment he had scheduled when he was trying to replace his green card because he lost his wallet. Mr Leon was given political asylum in 1987 after escaping Chile and torture by the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.\nA green card holder is a lawful permanent resident of the United States. Mr Leon has no criminal record. Mr Leon was deported to Guatemala. with no notification to his family. He has since been found in a hospital in Guatemala.\nMahmoud Kahlil is a graduate student at Columbia University who was arrested in March 2025 and held in a Louisiana detention center until June. There are no criminal charges against him. He is a legal permanent resident. He is still under the threat of deportation.\nThe Constitution guarantees both citizens and non-citizens certain rights to due process, including challenging the lawfulness of their detention by the government. These are crucial safeguards against arbitrary detention and tyranny. The government cannot hold someone without a legal basis. None of the people described above and many others were afforded these rights.\nIs this who we the United States citizens have become? Do we condone the cruelty exhibited by these acts?\nThere is another way in which we have become something different than who we thought we were. The Gross Domestic Product of the United States is around $28 trillion, about a quarter of all the world's wealth. We used to try to use that wealth to help those who were less fortunate in the world by providing food and aid through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Our president has recently defunded USAID, stopping us from using our enormous wealth to help others.\nHere is just one example. As reported by CNN on July 17:\n\"The US plans to destroy nearly 500 metric tons of taxpayer-funded emergency food, the State Department confirmed. The nutrient-dense biscuits, which have been sitting in a Dubai warehouse for months, were supposed to help feed starving people around the world. The destruction of the critically needed food would not have happened prior to the Trump administration's destruction of the US Agency for International Development, a former USAID official said. Two rations of biscuits a day are enough to stop people from dying, they added. Now that the food is about to expire, it must be destroyed; that will cost American taxpayers another $100,000. \"This is the definition of waste,\" the former official said.\"\nThis makes no sense and is not who we thought we were. How does it serve the president and the Republicans to withhold the money to feed people?? It is not like we cannot afford it. Again, the cruelty seems to be the reason.\nI appeal to my fellow Americans let us try our best to not do these things, let us object strongly to doing these things and hold those who are doing them accountable. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

NICHOLS Denton Church of Free Seventh-day Adventists | Section: News \n \n 241\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In our nation and in the world, we are living in uncertain, turbulent times.God has richly blessed the United States of America. Our country has enjoyed not uncontested, but world-wide recognition for its leadership in governance by and for the people that other nations envy and aspire to practice.\nWe developed a system of laws over time that projected and protected a belief in God without heavy-handed government interference. Prescriptions for the rights of people to enjoy the practice of individual religious values and beliefs, as dictated by their conscience, was a founding attraction and driving force for braving the hazards of cross-continental search and relocation of peoples of oppression and discrimination.\nA driving force in the development of early colonial, regional and states rights for economic opportunities and welcome to diverse groups of people greatly benefited our growing national wealth and character. Equality and opportunity were precious cornerstones.\nRespect for developing a government where power was not to be centered in an individual or faction, but in a three-branch form of government whose functions were to serve as a check on the powers of each other branch was and has been a hallmark of the USA. Government was developed to be a help to its citizenry and immigrants and not a terror.\nAs Christians in the USA and in other parts of the world, we must ever remember and never forget to lift our hands in recognition to God, our Creator and King. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Chris Van Hollen with thunderous applause Thursday evening as the Maryland Democrat delivered a blistering critique of the Trump administration's early actions.The group gave Van Hollen a standing ovation as he entered for the Aug. 14 town hall, though a small contingent of apparent Trump supporters remained mostly silent throughout the evening. One disgruntled person appeared to walk out midway through the senator's remarks.\nThe town hall was supposed to include Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, but Van Hollen said she had called him that morning, saying she tested positive for COVID-19 and would not be able to attend.\nVan Hollen wasted little time launching into what he called the \"big ugly betrayal of a bill\" — referring to recent Republican legislation that he said reduces Medicaid and food nutrition programs \"as a way to continue tax cuts for the wealthy.\"\n\"The people he said he was campaigning for are the ones going to be hardest hit,\" Van Hollen told the crowd, drawing vigorous nods from attendees.\nThe senator, who supports targeted tariffs on strategic industries, slammed Trump's across-the-board approach as \"just a way of taxing the nation.\" He warned that punishing clean energy investments creates an overall energy shortage that drives up electricity costs.\n\"We have a shortage of energy,\" Van Hollen said. \"By literally punishing clean energy, not only are you punishing the source of energy that's more environmentally friendly, you're also just reducing the overall supply of energy.\"\nICE FACILITY\nVan Hollen detailed his recent visit to Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Baltimore field office, where he said officials are operating what amounts to an unlawful detention center while claiming it's merely a holding facility.\nThe senator said ICE officials changed their standard from a 12-hour maximum stay to an average of 72 hours with some detainees held up to eight days, according to public reports.\n\"By any normal interpretation of the word detention, this is a detention center, despite what they're saying,\" Van Hollen said. \"If they weren't using it as a detention center, they wouldn't have had to change the 12-hour standard that had been put in place.\"\nVan Hollen said ICE officials refused to let him interview detainees, citing Maryland state law — a claim he called \"baseless\" since the law contains no such restrictions on congressional oversight.\n\"We left with more questions than answers,\" he said, adding that his office has demanded ICE provide evidence for their tracking systems and detention procedures.\nEASTERN SHORE PRIORITIES\nWhen asked about regional concerns, Van Hollen outlined three Eastern Shore priorities: quality education, affordable health care and job opportunities.\nHe expressed particular alarm about potential shutdowns of the Department of Education, calling the Chesapeake Bay \"a great national treasure\" and \"an opportunity to work in a bipartisan way.\"\n\"The Bay is lifeblood for watermen, tourism, seafood industry,\" he said, noting his work on H-2B visas for migrant workers in the seafood industry.\nVan Hollen touted efforts to combat invasive blue catfish: \"We have to eat our way out of this problem.\"\nPOLITICAL WARNINGSThe senator delivered some of his sharpest rhetoric when discussing redistricting, accusing Texas of preparing to \"steal the 2026 election\" through congressional map changes ordered by Trump.\n\"I do not believe in unilateral disarmament,\" Van Hollen declared when asked if Maryland should follow suit.\nHe demanded transparency on the Jeffrey Epstein case files, saying: \"Enough of this, release the damn files\" while protecting victims, not perpetrators.\nVan Hollen warned the crowd about threats to Social Security and environmental protections, calling the current moment a test of American democracy.\n\"The system is designed to take a lot of strain,\" he said, \"but the kind of strain that's being put on it right now, I'm afraid if we don't really push back hard right now, it could break.\"\nDespite the partisan edge to much of his presentation, Van Hollen closed on a unifying note, telling the audience: \"At the end of the day, it is all of you that will determine our future.\"\nThe town hall marked Van Hollen's latest stop in a series of public forums across Maryland as Democrats gear up for the 2026 midterm elections. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

His comments included:\"The worst has been numerous messages on social media and other media platforms — e.g., a newspaper editorial cartoon — that were vile, hateful and some of which were vulgar.\"\n\"Many of them chose to blame Trump supporters or policy decisions of the Trump administration for this tragedy.\"\n\"Far too many did not include expressions of sadness or sympathy for the deaths of innocent children and adults or compassion for the lifelong impact on all the flooding survivors.\"\n\"The only thing they have in common is they are devoid of any sense of decency and civility.\"\nDevoid of any sense of decency and civility. Sounds like the Trump administration to a T.\nMr. Reel and the Republican Party have forfeited all rights to criticize, for any reason, anyone for their perceived lack of empathy. Their leader, Donald Trump, during his first term, under the leadership of Stephen Miller, raised family separation at the border to an art form.\nDonald Trump famously mocked a reporter with disabilities while on the campaign trail in November 2015. He castigated John McCain on the campaign trail, saying \"He's not a war hero. He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured.\"\nThe recently passed budget bill (nothing beautiful about it) is going to force millions of people off Medicaid and SNAP and is already forcing some rural hospitals to close.\nThe recently enacted taxes (that's what tariffs are) are going to cause many small businesses to close and raise the cost of living for everyone else (except the uber rich). There's the failure to release the full Epstein files which just further downplays the plight of the many victims of this pedophile.\nSo please, Mr. Reel, spare us the lectures about empathy.\nSTEVE SHIMKO\nSt. Michaels \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore (D) in a Truth Social post on Aug. 24, saying he may reconsider federal dollars for rebuilding the Francis Scott Key Bridge and could \"send in the troops\" to Baltimore.Over 2,000 National Guard troops are deployed in Washington, D.C., with Trump alluding to other potential deployments around the country, including Baltimore.\nOn Aug. 21, Moore wrote a letter to Trump, inviting him to Maryland to see the progress on crime that the state has made.\n\"There is no higher priority for me, as the governor of my state, than the safety of my people. This is an issue of both professional and personal significance. I grew up in and around communities left behind by people in power, who sought to weaponize the pain of their constituents through hollow talking points that never changed the reality on the ground,\" Moore wrote in the letter.\nMoore cited recent crime statistics around the state, saying that he is deeply encouraged by the progress he has seen.\n\"Homicides in Maryland are down statewide by 20% since my inauguration two and a half years ago. In the first six months of 2025, the Baltimore Police Department continued to see double-digit reductions in gun violence, including a 22% decrease in homicides and a 19% decrease in non-fatal shootings from the year before,\" Moore wrote. \"If there's anything Maryland has proven over the last two years, it's that we can achieve performance without being performative.\"\nAt the end of the letter, Moore invited Trump to attend a public safety walk in September on a date of the president's choosing.\n\"Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked, in a rather nasty and provocative tone, that I 'walk the streets of Maryland' with him,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Aug. 24. \"I assume he is talking about out-of-control, crime-ridden, Baltimore?\"\nTrump furthered that he \"would much prefer that [Moore] clean up this crime disaster\" before he comes to the area for a walk.\n\"Wes Moore's record on Crime is a very bad one, unless he fudges his figures on crime like many of the other 'Blue States' are doing. But if Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum [sic] did in [Los Angeles], I will send in the 'troops,' which is being done in nearby D.C., and quickly clean up the crime,\" Trump wrote.\nTrump finished, saying that he gave \"Moore a lot of money to fix his demolished bridge.\"\n\"I will now have to rethink that decision?\" Trump said.\nMoore responded to Trump's post on Truth Social, saying, \"President Bone Spurs will do anything to get out of walking — even if that means spouting off more lies about the progress we're making on public safety in Maryland.\"\nIn an MSNBC interview following the exchange, Moore emphasized that federal bridge funding was authorized by Congress and President Joe Biden, not Trump.\n\"The 100% cost share that is now being done between the state of Maryland and the federal government was not authorized by Donald Trump,\" Moore said. \"It was authorized by Congress, and it was authorized by President Biden.\n\"Once again, the president's showing this is not about policy. This is not about supporting your people. This is not about what it is going to do to port workers and small businesses. This is an ideology, and it's a deeply dangerous ideology. Frankly, again, [the funding] he's talking about pulling that he did not give us in the first place.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Use of military in American cities is not new\n\n September 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 781\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n One policy of President Trump that has captured the current attention of the public, elected officials and the national media is his previous use of and future plans to use the military to address crime in select large American cities.In June, Trump federalized 4,000 California National Guard troops and mobilized 700 U.S. Marines in response to violent protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles.\nIn August, Trump mobilized the Washington, D.C., National Guard (which as president he controls) and also took over the Washington, D.C., police department to address crime in the District of Columbia.\nThere are ongoing and unresolved disagreements on the severity of the problem in select large cities, the need for and appropriateness of using the military for domestic law enforcement purposes, and the authority of the Trump administration to federalize state National Guard troops without informing or securing consent from governors.\nCurrently, the most outspoken elected officials who oppose Trump's actions are Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore.\nOpposition from large city mayors is not universal.\nWashington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser initially opposed Trump's decision to use the military in our nation's capital. She has since touted the positive impact it has had on reducing crime, especially on the numbers of murders and carjackings but still expresses unresolved concerns about presidential authority over D.C. affairs.\nOne irrefutable fact on this matter is that Trump's actions, while generating opposition, are not unprecedented.\nIn 1957, President Eisenhower dismissed opposition of the governor of Arkansas and issued an executive order federalizing the Arkansas National Guard. Eisenhower sent 1,000 U.S. Army soldiers to Arkansas to maintain law and order as the formerly white students-only Little Rock Central High School was integrated.\nIn 1962, President Kennedy dismissed the opposition of the governor of Mississippi and issued an executive order federalizing the Mississippi National Guard to join federal troops and U.S Marshals to help address violence resulting from admitting a Black student at the formerly all-white University of Mississippi.\nIn 1965, President Johnson refused a demand from the governor of Alabama to mobilize federal troops to defend a civil rights protest march. Instead, Johnson federalized the Alabama National Guard for that mission.\nIn 1967, President Johnson ordered the U.S. Army's 82nd Division and 101st Airborne Division to Detroit to address what were until then the bloodiest urban riots in the country.\nIn their official announcement about these orders, White House officials said Johnson's actions occurred after he concluded \"a condition of domestic violence and disorder\" existed.\nIn a televised address, Johnson acknowledged that normally law enforcement is the responsibility of local officials and the governors of the respective states. He also acknowledged the federal government should not intervene, except in the most extraordinary circumstances. Johnson explained his view on most extraordinary circumstances: \"The fact of the matter, however, is that law and order have broken down in Detroit. The Federal Government in the circumstances here presented had no alternative but to respond. We will not tolerate lawlessness. We will not endure violence. It will not be tolerated. This Nation will do whatever it is necessary to do to suppress and to punish those who engage in it.\"\nIn 1968, President Johnson ordered regular Army and federalized National Guard troops into Washington, D.C., to address rioting and looting the nation's capital following the murder of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. His order included airlifting a brigade of the U.S. Army's 82d Airborne Division (2,500 soldiers) from North Carolina to standby at Andrews Air Force Base\nDespite a contentious war of words between President Trump, Gov. Moore and Mayor Scott, there may be significant changes in how crime is addressed in Baltimore.\nMoore and Scott have launched a \"renewed collaboration\" between the Baltimore City Police Department and the Maryland State Police.\nMoore has suggested he is willing to accept help from the federal government to address crime in Baltimore, but only with federal law enforcement personnel such as FBI agents and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\nThese are shrewd and timely moves on Moore's part.\nThe results of AP NORC survey conducted late last month reported that two-thirds of the public responding to their survey think crime in the United States is a major problem and even more, 81%, think it's a major concern in cities.\nMoore has acknowledged without being as dismissive as he was previously that crime in Baltimore is a problem that needs to be addressed.\nUltimately, any success on reducing crime in Baltimore could help Moore's re-election campaign to advance a narrative he is serious about crime in Baltimore, and he is willing to work with a Republican administration in Washington on addressing it. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dozens march in Towson in support of democracy\n\n September 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LILLIAN GLAROS Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 665\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TOWSON — Dozens of people from states as far away as Texas and Kentucky marched 15 miles through Baltimore County on Sunday with a gigantic copy of the preamble to the U.S. Constitution in tow, in a show of support for American democracy.The march aims to show that the government needs to be held accountable and that its choices impact the future of the nation's children, said Maggie Bohara, the march's director.\nThe demonstration was part of the 160-milelong \"We Are America\" march that began on Sept. 6th in Pennsylvania and is expected to end in Washington, D.C., this Friday. Sunday's leg of it ended in Towson, with marchers carrying copies of the sections of the Constitution copied by more than 50 kids across the nation.\n\"We found as many children as we could across the country to help create the Constitution,\" Bohara said. \"It's their lives, it's their country we're fighting for.\"\nJaxy Lagrome, a resident of Perry Hall, said she decided to participate in the march because of her children, including her 10-year-old daughter Dana, who helped copy part of the constitution.\n\"I want the world to be a better place for them,\" Lagrome said. I want them to be able to be themselves, to be surrounded by good people, like the people here, and to be free to pursue what they want to do.\"\nLagrome was towing a large \"trojan horse\" behind her vehicle as she marches. As they make their trip, people are covering the horse with notes about what they care about, Lagrome said.\nIt's been a conversation starter, she said.\n\"I have a lot of Republicans who come up to me and ask questions, and when I tell them that this is really just to be funny, light hearted, keep everything positive and to bring community together, they're open to it too,\" Lagrome said. \"It's hard to be mad at the purple horse.\"\nA 16-year-old Montgomery County resident named Graham Milner joined for the weekend, influenced by issues like gun law policies and deportations. He said he thinks it's important to show that children care about issues that affect them.\n\"It is our future that is being affected … by anything that's being passed by Congress, and so it's really important that we are being represented,\" Milner said. \"The best way to do that is to come out and do it yourself.\"\nSome participants have been with the march since Philadelphia.\nJanet Carmosky from Albany, New York, and Jimmy Sandoval from San Antonio, Texas, are both walking the entire 160 miles.\nCarmosky said she came because she couldn't stand by while people's rights were crumbling.\n\"At this point, our rights have been so deeply eroded that it feels like a crisis,\" Carmosky said. \"I mean, it is a crisis. We have a constitution that no longer is respected by the leaders who … took an oath to defend it.\"\nFor Sandoval, it's important to march now in order to be a beacon of hope for Americans and show that people are willing to organize against despotism, he said.\nSandoval said he was inspired to march because of issues impacting his home state of Texas. He said he is concerned about Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the placement of the Ten Commandments in schoolrooms and political gerrymandering.\nThe march's focus on the Constitution also resonated with him, Sandoval said.\n\"We're like, 'hands off our Bill of Rights, our individual rights, our freedoms that make America great,'\" Sandoval said.\nPassersby were mostly supportive of the marchers as they traversed the road to Towson, honking in support. But there was a man who flipped the protesters off as he drove by.\n\"It's been a lot of positivity, for sure,\" Philadelphia resident Ashley Roman said. \"I think it's interesting how the haters come forward. It's like they're angry, but it's not really at us, it's more at their own actions.\"\nMarchers plan to arrive in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 17th and hold a rally on the National Mall, where political leaders like U.S. Rep. Jamin Raskin (D-Md.) are invited to speak, Carmosky said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Turning points? Perilous landscapes for media, free speech & political discourse after the killing of Charlie Kirk\n\n September 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: National \n \n 1462\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The maelstroms after the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk have created convergences and inflection points for social media, free speech and civil discourse across the U.S.Insensitive and offensive social media posts cheering Kirk's killing by a sniper during a rally at Utah Valley University Sept. 10 have resulted in some posters getting fired from their jobs. It has also prompted the Trump administration to talk about prosecuting and punishing \"hate speech.\"\nThe social media cheers of Kirk's murder also challenge longstanding societal norms \"not to speak ill of the dead.\"\nJared Meade, founder and principal of Rayne Strategy Group (a public relations firm with offices in Ohio and North Carolina), sees a conspiracy of contemporary uncivil discourse, social media echo chambers and people saying things online they might not utter in real-life settings.\n\"People are so quick to 'speak ill' of someone who has just died because the rhetoric and vitriol, particularly on both sides of the political spectrum, have become increasingly extreme and reckless,\" he said.\n\"When individuals like Charlie Kirk are labeled as Nazis, fascists, or similar dehumanizing terms, it has serious consequences. These labels strip these individuals of their humanity, creating a mindset where they are viewed as less than human. This makes it easier for society to dismiss and mistreat them or, as in the case of Charlie Kirk, incites violence,\" Meade said.\nKirk was CEO of Turning Point USA, a conservative group focused on college campuses. He was a top ally of President Donald Trump.\nA new poll by research YouGov shows 25% of Americans who are \"very liberal\" say political violence can be justified. Among self-identified \"liberals\", 17% say political violence can be justified. Overall, 26% of liberals under the age of 44 are okay with political violence in some instances.\nThat compares to 6% of conservatives and 3% of those who are very conservative, according to the YouGov poll.\nThose types of numbers and social media videos celebrating Kirk's death have prompted Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance and other conservatives to focus on violence from the political left.\n'ECHO CHAMBERS'Social media reactions hailing Kirk's killing display the current discord online and within American politics, according to Amore Philip, a PR strategist and founder of New York-based Apples & Oranges Public Relations.\n\"Cheering someone's death isn't politics; it's the loss of our humanity. Social media has turned ideology into a sport, and Charlie Kirk's killing is exposing just how dangerous that can be,\" Philip said.\nShe sees the Kirk killing and fallout as part of a bigger societal challenge.\n\"The bigger picture is this: Social media has created echo chambers where people defend their 'sides' rather than viewing issues empathetically. It rewards outrage, piling on, and polarization, as evident in this instance,\" Phillip said.\n\"The question isn't just about Kirk; it's about where we stand as a society when free speech becomes weaponized and death becomes mere content. At its core, this moment should remind us that political disagreement should never overshadow our ability to value human life or engage in meaningful dialogue,\" she continued.\nRania Sedhom, managing partner of New York-based Sedhom Law Group, also sees wider ramifications from Kirk's assassination.\n\"He was silenced by a 22-year old who disagreed with him. The repercussions of this form of expression permeates through our everyday lives,\" Sedhom said.\n\"Who is up for debate? How are people communicating? The workplace is fundamentally changed. Water cooler talk? Too risky. Discussions about anything of relevance? Too risky. Stating your opinion? Too risky,\" she said.\nStill, Meade sees some benefits brought by our social media-dominated discourse. \"Social media is a double-edged sword. It offers a platform for those who otherwise wouldn't have a voice. It provides opportunities for connection, information sharing and community building on a global scale,\" he said.\n'FREED\nOM TO WOUND'\nSome of the social media reactions cheering Kirk's murder are viewed as poor form, according to etiquette experts.\n\"Good behavior is more than table manners — it's the daily practice of respect, restraint, and compassion. After 25 years as an etiquette expert, I see how often we confuse freedom of speech with freedom to wound,\" said Lisa Mirza Grotts, a California-based etiquette expert, \"The Charlie Kirk murder was a bridge too far.\"\nShe says America has lost its behavioral compass.\n\"I'm struck by how far we've drifted from simple decency. We shout instead of listen, demand agreement instead of understanding,\" Mizra Grotts said.\nKevin Angelo Brown, a criminologist and criminal justice professor at Arkansas State University, said the saying and norm of 'not speaking ill of the dead' dates back to the 6th Century BC and ancient Greece and Sparta and carried into Roman and other Western cultures with the Latin phrase 'de mortuis nil nisi bonum,' meaning 'of the dead, say nothing but good.'\nBill Villanova, president of Frank E. Campbell: The Funeral Chapel in New York, said holding your tongue regarding the recently passed has been a \"longstanding tradition\", but the spontaneity and perceived anonymity of social media has changed that.\nStill, Villanova, whose funeral home has organized services for notable persons such as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Joan Rivers, John Lennon and Heath Ledger, said social media can also produce well wishers sharing stories about a departed person's positive impacts.\n'RISING CONTRADICTIONS'Kirk's assassination and the ugly aftermath online are also magnifying workplace, social media and political intersections with free speech rights.\nEmployees have been learning their social media posts regarding Kirk can have repercussions, including losing their jobs.\n\"The current dynamic highlights the rising contradiction between professional accountability in private employment and free expression in the public domain,\" said Edward Hones, owner of Seattle-based Hones Law, of workers and executives losing their jobs for their posts, mostly under at-will employment arrangements.\nOn Thursday, the Walt Disney Co. said it was indefinitely pulling ABC late night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air after he made comments Monday that Kirk's alleged assassin was \"anything but one of them\", referring to Trump's Make America Great Again \"MAGA gang.\"\nUtah prosecutors said in charging documents on Tuesday that Robinson told his parents that he killed the conservative Kirk because \"there is too much evil and the guy [Charlie Kirk] spreads too much hate.\"\nDisney ABC yanked Kimmel off the air after Nexstar Broadcasting and later Sinclair Broadcasting said they would stop airing the late-night show on their local stations after the Kirk comments.\nTrump welcomed Kimmel's indefinitely shelving as \"great news for America\" and said the ABC host was shelved for poor ratings.\nFree speech advocates and Democrats decried the move, pointing to Federal Communications Chairman Brendan Carr's criticisms of the ABC host. They say the Trump administration pressured Disney/ABC to nix Kimmel's show.\n\"This marks a dark new level of capitulation and censorship of speech more redolent of autocracies than democracies. The Trump administration's regulatory crusade against free speech has crossed an historic line with the indefinite removal of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' — an act of government-instigated censorship against satire and comedy,\" said Summer Lopez, interim co-CEO of Pen America. The group advocates for writers, literature and free speech.\nThe Trump administration — including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Vance — have talked about going after \"hate speech\", stemming from the Kirk fallout and their contentions that liberal and far-left groups rhetoric demonize Trump and his supporters.\n\"Hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is not protected by the First Amendment. It's a crime. For far too long, we've watched the radical left normalize threats, call for assassinations, and cheer on political violence. That era is over,\" Bondi said in a statement.\nSecretary of War Pete Hegseth has also ordered the U.S. military to identify and sanction personnel who have celebrated Kirk's assassination online.\n'ABSOLUTELY CHILLING'Trump said Thursday he was designating the anti-fascist, left-wing ANTIFA activist movement as terrorists. ANTIFA is a collection of smaller left-wing activist groups, opposed to Trump and right-wingers.\nConservatives point to instances of violence and vandalism perpetrated by self-proclaimed ANTIFA protesters and activists, including in the Pacific Northwest.\n\"President Trump is right. ANTIFA is a dangerous, radical group that thrives on chaos and violence. Rightfully declaring them a terrorist organization will help protect our communities,\" said U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, a conservative Republican representing Maryland's Eastern Shore. \"It's time to investigate those who fund them and stop the lawlessness once and for all.\"\nThere is pushback from the left over whether Trump has the power to designate domestic advocates as terrorists and how the government and police will treat left-wing opponents.\nFree speech advocates also note that controversial or unpopular speech is protected under the First Amendment as long as it does not incite violence or make violent threats.\n\"This is absolutely chilling. It's why carving out a 'hate speech' exception to the First Amendment is so dangerous. It grants the government the power not only to decide what constitutes hateful speech, but to punish it,\" said the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), a free speech group, in a statement. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Constitution attempted to create better world\n\n September 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KARY LOVE | Section: Columns \n \n 824\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Do you remember that before July 4, 1776, 99% of the people living in the world and 99% of those who had lived and were dead, had lived as slaves, serfs, peasants or indentured servants, and that only kings, emperors and lords had rights?Of course over human history many had fought for human rights. Over time, a tidal wave supporting human rights emerged among humans as the many suffered the cruelty and arbitrary rule of those unaccountable to the people — kings and their ilk.\nIn what I regard as the greatest political legal achievement in history, America threw off the tyranny of \"kings and aristocrats\" and established a \"government of the people, by the people and for the people.\"\nThe Constitution of September 17, 1787, was an imperfect effort to establish a better world with a government subject to the rule of law, wherein the people were represented by the law makers who had a duty to see the will of the people adopted into the nation's laws. Of course, the Constitution was not perfect at birth and the amendment process was included should it need alteration as issues emerged.\nThe 1787 Constitution was written in secret by the \"1% of the day\" and represented a retreat from the more universal declarations of human rights expressed in Jefferson's Declaration of Independence. The perpetual struggle between the interests of the few at the top and of the many below did not end with the revolution nor the Constitution. The revolutionary generation was appalled by the Constitution and demanded a Bill of Rights protecting the human rights the American Revolution bled and died to achieve be made part of, and enforceable against government, under the \"Supreme Law.\"\nFaced with an overwhelming reaction against the proposed Constitution, in order to get state conventions to agree to it, the \"Federalists\" agreed that the first order of business of the Congress once the Constitution was ratified would be to adopt a Bill of Rights demanded by the people. James Madison primarily whittled those down to the first 10 amendments, adopted in 1791, to appease American Revolutionaries and their families who demanded that the revolution's great achievements be written into law.\nHowever, despite a Bill of Rights, America suffered under a continued struggle between power and the people. As a result the various interests fought over \"representation\" because that was where the foundation of power lay under the Constitution. One Amendment submitted early on raised the issue of what representation was needed if the people were truly to have input into how their government mutated and ruled going forward. Making sure sufficient representatives were present to cover the divergent interests of the people was debated and the Congressional Apportionment Amendment was one submitted by the states to ensure representation not be diluted.\nAs James Madison wrote, in Federalist Paper No. 55:\n[F]irst, that so small a number of representatives will be an unsafe depositary of the public interests; secondly, that they will not possess a proper knowledge of the local circumstances of their numerous constituents; thirdly, that they will be taken from that class of citizens which will sympathize least with the feelings of the mass of the people, and be most likely to aim at a permanent elevation of the few on the depression of the many.\nThe congressional apportionment amendment suggested one representative for every 30,000 people, eventually increasing to one for every 50,000. This amendment was never ratified. In 1929, the House was frozen by Congress at 435 members, leading to larger districts and a growing number of constituents per representative.\nToday, each representative serves approximately 760,000 constituents, a significant dilution of actual ability of \"representatives\" to represent the people. One contemplates this dilution of representation is manifested in our current dissatisfaction with our federal government; after all, our nation was founded in part on the cry \"no taxation without representation,\" because unless the people consented to the use of their money by meaningful representative government, the founding generation called such taxation without representation mere \"theft.\" Today taxation without real representation results in use of tax dollars for purposes most Americans oppose but that benefit a \"select\" few.\nAs Constitution Day was celebrated this week, Americans ought reflect on the fact that lack of meaningful representation has diluted their status as Americans who self-govern. They ought reflect on the fact the Bill of Rights enshrining their human rights in the supreme law is being diluted by laws passed by unrepresentative congresses and executive orders issued in defiance of the supreme law.\nNeither the Constitution nor the Bill of Rights descends from the heavens to preserve the greatness of America. Both require active support daily by the people in order to live and survive the grasping hands of those who disdain government by the people preferring government by money. The continuation of the great revolution for human rights, equality before law and justice for all, begun at the founding of America, is the duty of every American. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Charlie Kirk relished engagement with critics\n\n September 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Columns \n \n 725\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Charlie Kirk — a conservative political activist, co-founder of Turning Point USA and ally of President Trump — was assassinated Sept. 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.Charlie had a huge following of supporters who strongly agreed with his conservative values and views. He also had a huge following of detractors who strongly disagreed with him.\nThis column will not focus on defending or challenging his views on the issues of the day.\nIn today's deeply divided world, an effort to change strongly held views is an exercise in futility.\nInstead I will focus on how he conducted himself in expressing and discussing his views.\nIn watching videos of Charlie's events with large crowds of mostly young people, college students and high school students, I was always impressed with how different those engagements were in contrast to much of the political debates in our society.\nCharlie presented his strongly held views without being aggressive or condescending. He always listened intently and respectfully to those who strongly disagreed with his views. He regularly took questions, answered questions and listened to criticism of his views.\nHe encouraged and relished direct engagement with supporters and critics alike.\nAt the opening of his events, he often told attendees — if you disagree with my views, come to the front of the line so we can share and talk about our respective positions.\nHe was the epitome of a person who could disagree without being disagreeable.\nDespite his civil approach in delivering, defending and discussing his beliefs, he was regularly branded by his opponents as, among other things, a misogynist, racist, transphobic, homophobic, fascist, Nazi and a Hitler.\nImmediately following his death and since then, there have been countless people saying or writing they condone, support, justify or are actually celebrating Kirk's murder.\nThey have a constitutional right to do that. They do not have human decency.\nThey do not understand or commit to the belief that every human life has value deserving protection and respect.\nThat is true even when that human expresses his or her beliefs that his or her opponents may strongly disagree with or even abhor without being murdered.\nMao Zedong, longtime leader of China, once said, \"Politics is war without bloodshed, while war is politics with bloodshed.\"\nCurrently in America, politics has become war with bloodshed.\nThis lack of civil discourse and respect for differing opinions is not exclusive to any religious affiliation or political party.\nIn just the past few months, two children were murdered, and seventeen people were injured when a shooter opened fire during worship in a Catholic school in Minnesota. The shooter's manifesto described his hatred of Blacks, Hispanics, Christians, Jews and President Trump.\nAlso in Minnesota, a pro-abortion rights Democratic — Farm-Labor Party state representative was murdered along with her husband. A fellow pro-abortion rights Democratic -Farm — Labor Party State Senator, and his wife were shot by the same individual, but both survived the attempted murder. The murderer is an anti-abortion advocate.\nMurders of children, elected public officials and political activists such as Charlie Kirk are more than tragedies.\nThey are a further indication of a warp speed acceleration in our society on the decline of civil discourse and decency, and the desensitization of the loss of human life.\nNext year will mark 250 years of America's experiences with free speech and civil discourse on and a wide range of divisive issues.\nI am increasingly uncertain free speech and civil discourse in America will ever return.\nIn the book, \"Poorer Richard's America,\" there is an ominous suggestion that Charles Darwin's \"Theory of Organic Evolution: Natural Selection,\" applies not only to nature but also to nations.\nOne example is Great Britain.\nAt one time, Great Britain was the most powerful nation in the world.\nIt was often said, \"The sun never sets on the British Empire.\"\nAfter the end of World War II, Great Britain declined rapidly as a great world power.\nSome suggest that America is on a path to do the same and will do so sooner rather than later.\nThat outcome is not inevitable.\nAlexis de Tocqueville, a 19th century French diplomat, political scientist and social critic suggested that \"America is great because America is good. If America ever ceases to be good, it will cease to be great.\"\nIt is not too late for Americans, individually and collectively, to strive to be good with a renewed commitment to freedom of speech, civil discourse and respect for all people, all ideas and all beliefs. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Israeli Jews safety depends on Palestinians' safety\n\n September 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SARENA NEYMAN | Section: Columns \n \n 818\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As we enter the 10 days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur — a time meant for reflecting on where we've strayed from compassion — I keep returning to the dehumanization of Palestinians I've witnessed among the observant Jewish community I grew up in.Over the years, I have spoken out against Israel's assault on Gaza and have been accused of spewing \"ignorant, pathetic Al Jazeera-fueled antisemitic rhetoric.\" \"You will not be admired for your performative moral integrity,\" they admonish. My critics are often otherwise compassionate people, yet their support for the Israeli army remains unwavering.\nMy devotion to Israel was once as absolute as theirs. My parents — both Holocaust survivors — loved Israel second only to their children. They sent me to Zionist schools and summer camps; I grew up immersed in Hebrew music and literature. To me, Israel was not just a country; it was our shield against another Holocaust.\nOnly later did I learn about the forced expulsions of Palestinians and how the Israeli army — which I had been taught was the most moral in the world — had armed death squads in Africa and Latin America. My Israeli cousin trained troops for Idi Amin, whose regime slaughtered half a million Ugandans. When I asked my mother how Israel could have done this, she said everyone hated us, so we took our support where we could get it.\nHer words rattled me. How could this survivor of five concentration camps, who rebuilt her life as a beloved pediatrician, embrace a moral exceptionalism that excused Israel for abetting genocide?\nOver time I came to see her response as born of unspeakable trauma. The Nazis had torn her baby sister from her arms. She had been beaten and starved and witnessed death on a daily basis. Centuries of persecution embeds a fierce tribalism: Protect your own at all costs. But as Rabbi Daniel Bogard points out, \"Trauma does not give us moral clarity. It just makes us traumatized.\" And trauma, left unhealed, breeds more trauma.\nHamas's attack on Oct. 7 reawakened Jews' deepest wound — our ancestral fear of extermination. The Israeli government seized on this to justify a campaign of annihilation: deliberately starving and attacking civilians, restricting humanitarian aid, bombing hospitals and schools.\nEven as Israel escalates its Gaza assault, defenders minimize these horrors. Despite Israeli media restrictions and unprecedented journalist deaths, the emerging evidence looks nothing like self-defense. But when dozens of human rights groups call it genocide, the messengers are discredited to deny the message. \"How naive you are,\" comes the refrain. \"Don't you understand these groups hates us?\"\nThe ease with which my own people excuse these atrocities is chilling.\n\"I'm watching something that is so evidently horrific and inhumane,\" Jon Stewart shared on The Daily Show. Yet when he condemns these actions, he is warned that speaking out threatens Israel's survival, even though it is Israel's actions, not Jewish dissent, that endanger the country most.\nAnd he's right. Studies show Israeli violence fuels antisemitism, which then \"justifies\" more militarization, creating an endless, deadly spiral that both brutalizes Palestinians and endangers Jews everywhere. Furthermore, adds Jewish Currents publisher Daniel May, the argument that Jews are \"at risk no matter where they live and no matter what they do or say,\" distracts us from addressing the conditions that actually drive anti-Israel violence.\nAmong my detractors, acknowledging this context is taboo. Mention decades of occupation, and you're accused of excusing the horrific kidnappings and murders of Oct. 7.\nI believe Israel has a right to exist, but survival built on another people's suffering isn't survival — it's moral collapse that sows the seeds of our own undoing. I understand that tribalism served an evolutionary purpose, forging loyalty in times of threat. But when it hardens into a moral blind spot, it justifies cruelty and brands truth-telling as betrayal.\nAs Israel edges toward near-total obliteration of Gaza, we must confront the trauma-fueled myth of victimhood. Backed by billions in U.S. aid, Israel is no longer David. It has become Goliath. But Goliath's strength is also his weakness; brute force creates more enemies than it destroys.\nYet the community in which I grew up still clings to the fantasy that Israel can eradicate Hamas through its military might. In fact, the opposite is true. As journalist Peter Beinart warns, our destinies are intertwined: \"If you want Israeli Jews to be safe, Palestinians also have to be safe. And Palestinians cannot be safe unless they are free.\"\nThis means abandoning the dehumanizing narrative that Palestinians are terrorist monsters who use children as human shields. Because only by cultivating genuine empathy — by recognizing Palestinians as people just like us, who want safety and dignity for their families — can we break this cycle of trauma. The choice before us is stark: Continue down this path of moral blindness that endangers both peoples, or find the courage to imagine a different story — one where Jewish safety doesn't require Palestinian extinction. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Greet the military in your city with flowers\n\n October 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ARNOLD J. OLIVER | Section: Columns \n \n 643\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n During some of the large anti-war demonstrations during the 1960s some of the protesters gave flowers to the troops faced off against them. In the 1967 March on the Pentagon, it was the 503rd Military Police Battalion, and elsewhere the National Guard was deployed. An iconic photo from 1967 shows a young man placing a flower into a soldier's gun barrel during the protest.Let's bring that custom back when the U.S. military occupies your town in 2025, but this time let's include a note along with the flower.\nAllow me to explain.\nThe demonstrators of the 1960s understood that the soldiers faced off against him were not the enemy. Nearly all of the soldiers were young and patriotic and trying to do the right thing. Many of them were under economic hardship and wanted help paying for their education. The flower symbolized the protesters' belief that the soldiers were not their enemies, and they did not wish to be theirs. And in fact, as the almost entirely peaceful protests grew, many soldiers came to sympathize and began to actively oppose the war as well.\nNow we have federalized Guard troops being called out by President Trump in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Portland with other cities soon to follow. Chicago is likely next. The authority for this is said to be Title 10 of the U.S. Code that says that the president may federalize the National Guard if the U.S. \"is invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation; there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion ... or the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"\nLegitimate grounds for a military or National Guard deployment do not exist. The claim that crime is spiraling out of control is false, and those pushing for the deployments know it. There is zero credible proof that crime is increasing. According to a recent FBI report (August 2025) robbery, assault, rape and murder all continued a decline that began post-COVID. We are not being invaded, there is no rebellion, and the laws are being enforced about as well as ever.\nA second reason against deploying the military on our streets is that the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 forbids the use of military forces within the country for active law enforcement except in exceptional circumstances such as insurrection, and then must be explicitly approved by Congress. The military is forbidden from making arrests, conducting searches, issuing warrants or interfering with local law enforcement. The law also applies to National Guard forces unless approved by state governors. No governors this year have made any requests for federalized National Guard troops.\nAnd it is worth noting that Trump's military forays into cities are only being used in Democrat-run areas. High crime in red state cities is ignored. And the Trump administration refuses to realize the obvious danger of political violence and threats from MAGA and the American right which are much higher than those from the left, according to the Anti-Defamation League, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and others. Antifa is officially (and improperly) designated as domestic terrorists while violent right-wing groups get a pass from the administration.\nAnd the president's rhetoric seems aimed at inflaming and dividing. The \"enemy from within,\" \"full force,\" \"thugs,\" \"vermin\" and much more. And there is hardly a peep of protest from the Republican party.\nSo this time around, how about if we give the troops a note along with the flower? You could use wording such as this:\nDear U.S. soldier:\nYour service oath included a pledge to uphold the U.S. Constitution, and your training taught you to disobey illegal orders. The orders sending you here (insert name of your city or town) are unlawful and unjust. You have a legal obligation to disobey.\nWe encourage you to go home, and we will support you in that decision. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Los Angles and now Portland, Oregon, is not OK.Nor is Trump's directive \"we are going in\" to Chicago and his claim that he is ready to deploy in Baltimore. Some will dismiss this as merely Trump's stunts to divert attention from the unstoppable Epstein inquiries. I believe Trump is testing whether he can deploy and control our military in these Democratic cities, despite laws to the contrary, for a more sinister purpose.\nDeploying armed troops on U.S. soil for domestic law enforcement invokes authoritarian tactics. It echoes the tactic of securing military power to override civil governance — an infamous step that Adolf Hitler took when the German army aligned with him. By federalizing the Metropolitan Police Department and overriding local control under Section 740 of the D.C. Home Rule Act, the president has bypassed D.C.'s elected government.\nCentralization of control is a hallmark authoritarian approach. Declaring D.C. is in a \"crime emergency\" despite statistics showing plummeting crime rates and deploying troops primarily for a show of power, mirrors how Hitler used fabricated emergencies to legitimize crushing civil rights. This same situation is true in Portland, with reduced crime rates and no need to send in federal troops.\nThe National Guard and regular military forces were deployed in Los Angeles to assist the Immigration and Customs Enforcement forces in the apprehension of criminal immigrants. The idea was to find criminal immigrants and deport them. However, as we have seen, many innocent immigrants were swept up into this process.\nOnce Trump controls the military outside the Constitution then there is really no one left to oppose him. In theory the United States Congress can prevent this, but as they have demonstrated since Mr. Trump's inauguration, that is not happening.\nThe Supreme Court has yet to show its ultimate independence of Trump's control. Gaining the support and cooperation of the military was the final part of the plan that Adolf Hitler put into operation in his creation of the Third Reich, which eventually led to World War II. We must resist.\nThe question is what should we be doing in the face of these circumstances? I would offer these types of efforts as being very important:\nWe must stay informed and engaged. Read and listen to what is happening in the politics of our country, express our opinions and thoughts, attend meetings sponsored by our elected representatives, insist that our elected representatives have meetings.Defend our democratic institutions. Make sure you know what the Constitution says and defend those words.Demand that our government do its job and serve the people as they were elected to do.Resist rhetoric that tries to manipulate our thinking. Make sure that we do not accept the takeover of Washington, D.C. as a legitimate response to out-of-control crime that is in fact steadily decreasing. Fight the normalization of unlawful activities.Learn from history. There is too much that is happening in the current administration that mirrors things that happened in Germany in 1933. Do not ignore those signs.Vote. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Wes Moore last week blamed President Donald Trump for a federal shutdown that he says is landing especially hard on the Maryland workforce.\"Since Donald Trump has come on board, he has fired over 15,000 Marylanders that are federal workers,\" Moore said in a press conference. \"Donald Trump doesn't have an interest in governing.

They need to prioritize Maryland families first by putting D.C. grandstanding aside by supporting a clean CR to reopen the federal government,\" he said in a statement.\nTrump has threatened mass government layoffs if congressional Democrats refuse to get on board for a Republican spending bill. And that means something in Maryland, where a huge chunk of the workforce is employed directly by the federal government, or is a contractor for one of its agencies.\nIn 2024, prior to job cuts under the Trump administration, an estimated 269,000 Maryland residents were employed by the federal government, state officials told reporters on Wednesday. They said about 210,000 were federal contractors.\nMoore said that 15,000 jobs have already been cut in the past year. Now, those who are still on the payroll will go without paychecks, and those who are nonessential will be furloughed.\nState officials can't do much to help those employees absorb the impact, but Moore vowed to do all he could to provide some support.\nHis administration plans to keep paying out for safety net programs, assuming they'll get their federal reimbursement as usual. They haven't heard otherwise, state officials told reporters last week.\nThe governor is asking the courts and utility companies to protect furloughed federal workers from eviction, foreclosure or utility shutoffs while they are involuntarily suspended from work. He's also expanding emergency assistance programs for federal employees.\nBut the state will not be able to support these programs indefinitely, Moore said. If the shutdown continues, the state and its residents face worsening consequences.\n\"We can see big infrastructure projects delayed,\" he said. \"We can see military families, people who already sacrificed for this country, go without pay for weeks. We can see small businesses dip into the red.\"\nMoore said that his administration will monitor and respond to growing uncertainty caused by the shutdown.\n\"We are going to do everything in our power,\" Moore said, \"to make sure that, despite the federal government deciding to leave all of us on our own, that people in the state of Maryland will know that the state, at least, and this administration will continue to fight for them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland lawmakers, union leader challenge memo threatening furloughed federal workers’ pay\n\n October 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AUDREY KEEFE Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 598\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Furloughed federal workers may not be entitled to back pay when they return from the government shutdown, according to a draft memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget, first reported by Axios.The memo comes almost a week into the shutdown and marks a stark change in the Trump administration's position on furloughed federal workers' pay.\nPresident Donald Trump further confused the issue on Tuesday. Asked by a reporter whether federal workers should get retroactive pay after the shutdown ends, the president responded: \"It depends on who we're talking about.\"\n\"For the most part, we're going to take care of our people,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \"There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we'll take care of them in a different way.\"\nHowever, Maryland lawmakers and a top union leader said the White House and the OMB are attempting to violate a 2019 law and potentially halt about 750,000 federal employees' pay.\n\"The law is the law,\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said in a statement. \"That legislation was signed into law — and there is nothing this Administration can do to change that.\"\nEverett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said in a statement the memo is \"an obvious misinterpretation of the law.\" The AFGE is the largest federal employee union and represents more than 820,000 workers. Kelley lambasted the memo's goals and said it is an attack on federal employees.\n\"The livelihoods of the patriotic Americans serving their country in the federal government are not bargaining chips in a political game,\" Kelley said.\n\"Those who want the government to stay open and operating do not threaten its employees,\" Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said in a post on X. \"Federal workers aren't political pawns; they're patriots.\"\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, said in a statement \"the president has no right to just pay the federal workers in his own political camp.\"\n\"The president is threatening to deliberately violate the law; or he is suffering from a debilitating case of legislative amnesia,\" Raskin said. \"Either way, he should refresh his memory on the law he signed. And if he chooses to barrel forward anyway, he should get ready for a fight in court.\"\nThe Government Employee Fair Treatment Act was signed in 2019 by President Donald Trump during the last government shutdown. The bill ensured back pay for federal employees during lapses in federal spending.\nNow, an amended version is providing OMB with an alleged loophole, stating the compensation is only mandatory \"subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse,\" the bill said.\nThe new interpretation means furloughed workers could only be paid if the funds are specifically appropriated by Congress, according to Axios. This differs from the original statement made in 2019 by OPM, which said furloughed workers would receive retroactive pay.\nEssential federal employees, such as military service members and air traffic controllers, may be the only workers entitled to pay once the government reopens, according to the White House memo.\nVan Hollen argued the interpretation shift threatens the original intent of the law. He previously worked with former Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, in 2019 to \"ensure federal employees would receive guaranteed back pay for any future shutdowns,\" he said in a statement.\nRep. Glenn Ivey, D-Maryland, said instead of \"attacking government workers,\" Republicans and the Trump administration should come to the table with Democrats and create a solution to the Medicaid cuts and expiration of the Affordable Care Act.\n\"Democrats are trying to force (Republicans) to fix the problem they've created, and that's what we're going to do,\" Ivey told Capital News Service. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moments later, the Sons of the American Legion (SAL) commander found himself standing before his peers — \"dumbfounded,\" as he described it — as he was presented with the national SAL Squadron Commander of the Year award.The award was given by Maryland SAL Commander Jason Miller of Chestertown and followed by words of praise from Department Commander for the state of Maryland Nikki Randolph of Kent Island.\n\"John leads by example, and is exactly the kind of person we want representing the American Legion,\" Randolph said. She added, \"I wish every American Legion Post in Maryland was like Post 18 in Centreville,\" crediting the Post's long-standing leadership and teamwork in support of veterans.\nQueen Anne's County Commissioner Phil Dumenil also took part in the ceremony, reading a proclamation signed by all five commissioners recognizing White's dedication.\nIt read, in part:\n\"John has been a dedicated member of the SAL since 2015. He devoted countless hours each day volunteering at Post 18, supporting not only squadron activities, but the entire Post family — handling the ordering, shopping, advertising and setup for weekly Friday night dinners. He welcomes veterans each Monday morning for their Veterans Helping Veterans meetings at the Post. John is instrumental in coordinating the Mid-Shore Toys for Tots program, managing logistics across four counties, and personally ensuring that children in need receive toys, candy and letters during the annual Letters to Santa program that reaches approximately 150 local children each year.\n\"He actively participates in setup and cleanup for the annual Wreaths Across America ceremonies at two local cemeteries, honoring the memory of veterans with dignity and respect. John has contributed significantly to the growth and improvement of the Post home, assisting in fundraising and working with contractors during major renovations, ensuring the success and sustainability of Post 18. The success of Post 18 is a direct reflection of the dedication and teamwork of its members, with John White leading by example — always willing to assist anyone in a time of need, and serving as a cornerstone of the Post's continued success and strength.\"\nWhite joined the SAL in 2015, eligible through his grandfather and father, both U.S. Navy veterans. His grandfather served during World War I; his father and father-in-law were Vietnam veterans. His father-in-law, who served in the Air Force, flew 116 fighter-jet missions.\nWhite said he joined the Legion in their honor and to serve other veterans. \"I had regrets that I never served in the military,\" he said.\nOf the award, White added, \"This is a Post award, really. It's not about me. You've seen the turnout we get when our Post hosts events — we have great support from our membership. The award might have my name on it, but it's really for all of us. I don't do all these things by myself.\"\nWhite also credited past commanders of the Centreville Post \"who have led the membership to serve the community and other veterans.\"\nBefore his retirement, White served 32 years with the U.S. Department of Justice as a multimedia IT specialist. He is a graduate of DeMatha High School in Hyattsville, Md., where he played football under famed coach Morgan Wootten. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
