MICHAELS - A brand new piece of fire equipment is in service for the residents of St. Michaels and Talbot County.St. Michaels Volunteer Fire Department's Engine 45, an engine tanker, was put into service on July 27 and has already run calls, including pumping water for the response to an attic fire in town last week.Engine 45 is a 2023 E-One Cyclone, featuring a 1,035-gallon water tank, Cummins L9 engine, Hale QMAX pump, Harrison Hydraulic Generator, Whelen and Firetech lighting, and an Arkon Electric Monitor.St. Michaels VFD President Chris Thomas said the new engine has a larger water tank, a necessity in the rural environs of St. Michaels and elsewhere the engine will serve in the area, often not near hydrants.The new engine carries 1,000 feet of 5-inch supply hose, 500 feet of 3-inch hose, five attack lines, a Blitzfire Monitor, a battery powered fan and work lights, and a full complement of firefighting tools.Engine 45 replaced Engine 49, a 2009 engine, in the top of SMVFD's rotation as the \"first due\" engine. Engine 45 was purchased to replace Engine 48, a 1990 engine that served the department for 33 years, and was placed in reserve in the department's fleet.Thomas said the older engine had exceeded the expected 30-year service window, and that while it is still serviceable, parts for repairs are getting harder to find and the apparatus lacks updated safety features.Typically, the department would sell the engine, Thomas said, but it is being retained as a precaution due to the lengthy lead time to fill orders that has become the norm in the fire apparatus manufacturing industry.Engine 45 was designed by the SMFD Engine committee and purchased through Patriot Fire in Grasonville. The engine cost $718,850 and carries well over $200,000 of tools, hose, radios and breathing apparatus.The RFP for the new engine was put out in 2021, and the committee moved swiftly to finalize the purchase, and the efficient of the process led to the relatively rapid acquisition and placement into service, Thomas said.The funding for the fire apparatus came from a variety of sources. \"It's a combination of fundraising efforts and money that we get from the county, town and state,\" Thomas said.\"The department thanks the generous residents and businesses who helped make this purchase happen through their donations and support over the past few years,\" the fire department said in a statement about the new engine.Thomas, who is in his third year as the department's president, said the department's board does a good job of strategic budgeting for future equipment replacements and maintenance of the fire station.Fundraising efforts include barbecue chicken dinners, a fund drive and a rotation of other types of campaigns, but he said the department's pit beef and pit turkey offerings were particularly tasty. \"I think that it is off the charts it's phenomenal,\" he said.SMVFD has around 70 members, and of those about half are fire and EMS personnel.Just like fire companies across the country, paid and volunteer alike, SMVFD faces a manpower crunch.Thomas said the nature of the demographics of the St. Michaels area poses a challenge for the department, as many residents are retirees, although the talent pool of retirees helps ensure the administrative part of the community organization is well staffed.As far as fire and EMS personnel, Thomas said, \"We're hurting just like everyone else.\" Still, the department forges on as the status quo of consistent calls for emergency response continues, and the department continues to plan and save for future acquisitions.Thomas said the brush truck and tanker truck are both in the latter stages of their service, and the department continues its work on that front too, continuing to raise and secure funds and being prepared for what is now a three-to five-year wait time on new equipment.The newest member of the SMVFD fleet isn't the first with the title of \"Engine 45\" - the previous 45 was an engine with an open cab and tailboards that volunteers ride on, braving the heat and cold depending on the season, before carrying out their emergency response.The equipment has changed, but the fundamental aspects of the job have not. Engine 45 sits in the right hand of the middle bay of the firehouse, waiting to carry to the volunteers to the next call. \n \n Caption: MIKE DETMER/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nSt. Michaels Volunteer Fire Department President Chris Thomas gives a thumbs up as he pulls Engine 45 out of the engine bay. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Escape or die - BI: 'Kidnapped, chained' woman escaped from cell built inside home\n\n August 7, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Molly O Brien; Herald & News | Page: A3 | Section: News \n \n 932\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n An Oregon man faces interstate kidnapping charges after a woman - who police say was \"kidnapped, chained (and) sexually assaulted\" - escaped from a sound-proof, cinderblock cell constructed in the suspect's garage.Negasi Zuberi, 29, rented a house in the 1300 block of North Eldorado in Klamath Falls, Oregon, with his wife and two children, Klamath Falls Police Chief Rob Dentinger told the Herald & News. Klamath Falls is in southern Oregon near the California border.\"This woman was kidnapped, chained, sexually assaulted and locked in a cinderblock cell,\" Stephanie Shark, the assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Portland field office, said in a news release.\"We have identified three additional victims from other states where (Zuberi) has lived,\" Shark told the Herald & News.Information on the victims has not yet been released as the investigation is ongoing, Shark said.Zuberi is confirmed to have lived in 12 different states over the past decade.\"Those states could include: California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Utah, Florida, New York, New Jersey, Alabama, and Nevada,\" the FBI said in a statement.The suspect's residence on North Eldorado Drive was rented to him by Klamath Falls Mayor Carol Westfall and her husband, Kevin, who own the house.The mayor told the Herald & News that she and her husband rented the property to Zuberi and his two children six months ago. There was no mention of a wife or roommates on the lease, Westfall said.According to a criminal complaint filed in U.S.District Court in Oregon, Zuberi solicited the woman, identified only as Adult Victim 1, in the early morning hours of July 15 to engage in prostitution along Aurora Avenue in Seattle, an area known for sex work.Afterward, Zuberi told the woman he was an undercover officer, showed her a badge, pointed a stun gun at her, and placed her in handcuffs and leg irons before putting her in the back of his vehicle, the complaint says.The suspect then drove the victim 450 miles to his home in Klamath Falls, sexually assaulting the victim during the trip, according to the FBI and federal prosecutors.A news release from FBI's Portland office said after arriving at his home, the victim was moved into a cinderblock cell constructed in Zuberi's garage. A metal door made it so the victim could not open the door from inside the structure.\"Once Zuberi left, the victim says she repeatedly banged on the door and was able to break the door open and escape the room,\" the release said.She said after she was moved to the cell, Zuberi said he was leaving \"to do paperwork.\" The victim \"briefly slept and awoke to the realization she would likely die if she did not attempt to escape the room.\" Punching the metal door, she managed to break some of the welded joints and create an opening big enough to climb through, Klamath Falls Police Capt. Rob Reynolds said at the news conference.\"When she was trying to escape the cell itself, she repeatedly punched the door with her own hands,\" Reynolds said. \"She had several lacerations along her knuckles.\" In Zuberi's garage, the victim managed to break into the suspect's vehicle and grab a handgun. She then escaped to the street, climbing over a wooden fence on which investigators found blood.The victim flagged down a passing motorist who helped her notify the police and the motorist transported her to the emergency room at Sky Lakes Medical Center.\"Her quick thinking and will to survive may have saved other women from a similar nightmare,\" Shark said in the news release.Evidence found at the suspect's residence included handwritten notes, one of which was titled \"Operation Take Over.\" Entries on the bulleted list included \"Leave phone at home\" and \"Make sure they don't' have a bunch of ppl in their life. You don't want any type of investigation.\" Investigators also found a handwritten document with a sketch for an underground structure using concrete blocks, foam insulation and waterproof concrete.After the victim's escape, Zuberi ran with his wife and two children to Reno, Nev.The criminal complaint said Zuberi and his family were located by two Nevada State Patrol officers in a Walmart parking lot the following afternoon, July 16.He was in his car holding one of his children in the front seat while talking to his wife, who was standing outside the vehicle. The complaint said Zuberi initially refused to get out of the car and attempted to cut himself with a sharp object which led to profuse bleeding. Zuberi also attempted to destroy his phone but eventually surrendered.The child was reported unharmed.The mayor said there were no indications of Zuberi's criminal activity.\"We had service people going there, and he would invite us in,\" Westfall said. \"It was incredibly brazen.\" \"He came into this town, but it's over for him,\" she added.The U.S. Attorney's Office for Oregon said the Klamath Falls man had been indicted on kidnapping and sexual assault charges.\"Zuberi, 29, also known as Sakima, Justin Hyche, and Justin Kouassi, has been charged with interstate kidnapping and transporting an individual across state lines with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity\" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement. \n \n Caption: FBI\n \nA man renting a home from the mayor of an Oregon town built a \"cinderblock cell\" and allegedly held a kidnapped and chained woman captive before her escape, according to FBI.\n \nFBI\n \nThe FBI says a kidnapped woman escaped from a cell (pictured) built inside an Oregon home.\n \nMOLLY O'BRIEN/HERA LD & NEWS\n \nThis is the house in the 1300 block of North Eldorado Avenue where Negasi Zuberi, 29, allegedly held a woman in a cinderblock cell in the garage. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The area was cleared by noon.\"Members of the Baltimore County Homeless Services Division have been working closely with Baltimore City officials to address the encampment near Dundalk and Holabird Avenues,\" Baltimore City police said in a statement sent to the Old Dundalk Neighborhood Association. \"We understand how concerning it is to see this situation in your community. As the encampment is located on city property, the Baltimore City Mayor's Office of Homeless Services is leading response efforts in coordination with other City agencies, including the Baltimore City Police Department, Baltimore City Department of Public Works, and Baltimore City Department of Transportation with support from nonprofit organizations under contract with Baltimore County to provide outreach and access to services.\" People began living in tents on a strip of grass in front of the Holabird Business Park earlier this year.Community groups wrote to county and city leaders for months asking for a solution, but the encampment was located just inside the city line. The Baltimore County government doesn't have any jurisdiction on that property, but county police officers are often on standby just up the street.The Old Dundalk Neighborhood Association joined with other community groups on the city-county line: Boston Courts, Norwood-Holabird and Graceland Park. In February, they wrote a letter to officials to request a solution.People living in tents longterm poses a lot of public health concerns, and city police were regularly called out to the encampment.Several people in the camp used drugs during the daytime, and panhandling at the intersection was very common.Baltimore police Precinct 12 Capt. Glenn Wiedeck and City Police Maj.Kiera Saunders had coordinated for crime calls associated with the camp. It was a welcome collaboration between the city and county law enforcement.\"They're actually speaking to each other right now and that didn't happen in the past,\" ODNA President Jess Lilli said in April.Last month, the Baltimore County Continuum of Care Homeless Roundtable hosted a job and resource fair at the Sollers Point Multipurpose Center. The Baltimore County Homeless Services Division continually works to help people who are homeless and seeking help.Baltimore County Police issued a statement promising to help connect homeless people with resources, and prevent a similar encampment from forming in Dundalk.\"Though this is a Baltimore City operation the Baltimore County Police Department is aware of the impact it may have on the surrounding county communities and is taking steps to offer any homeless person(s) services and resources if they attempt to migrate into Baltimore County,\" BCPD said.\"Officers will also be in place to remind any of these homeless person(s) that the camp sites they are used to in Baltimore City will not be allowed in Baltimore County.\" \n \n Caption: PHOTOS BY CO NNOR BOLINDER.\n \nA Baltimore City garbage truck pulls up to the homeless encampment.

Here's the problem with that: Hairdryers, curling wands and flat irons are required to produce heat, which means they pull large amounts of amperage to get them good and hot. Plugging them into a power strip is just asking for trouble. These types of hairdressing appliances must be plugged directly into a wall outlet - preferably one with a ground-fault circuit interrupter breaker to avoid danger should those tools accidentally be exposed to water.REFRIGERATOR AND FREEZER.These appliances pull too much current for a power strip because they are continuously cycling on and off.That will quickly overload a power strip. These items need to be plugged directly into a wall outlet dedicated solely to that appliance.TOASTER.Here's the clue: It has exposed wires inside those slots that heat up to become red-hot. It takes a lot of current to fire up those wires, which can easily overload a power strip. So, no, do not plug your toaster into an extension cord or power strip.Ditto for your toaster oven.MICROWAVE.I still think of my microwave oven as a miracle for food preparation, thawing, cooking and reheating in a fraction of the time it takes a conventional oven. However, such incredible activity demands more energy than what a power strip can deliver.SPACE HEATER.Most portable heaters consume 1,500 watts of energy on their high settings. Connect one to a power strip and it becomes potentially hazardous due to allowing them to run for an extended period. \n \n Caption: MARY HUNT \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

St.Michaels recorded about 2.7 inches of rain, while Easton recorded just over 2 inches. Denton saw about 1.7 inches of rainfall in the 24-hour period.Dorchester County Emergency Management Planner Jimmy Windsor said the 4 inches of rain in about two hours quadrupled forecasts.The heavy rainfall caused flooding in some areas of the city - emergency responders assisted motorists in the Henry Street area who were caught in more than two feet of stormwater.A lightning strike near Vienna is believed to have started an outdoor fire on Maiden Forest Road. The fire was quickly controlled.Weather service storm reports indicated damage to an Oxford restaurant and an \"abundance\" of downed trees and wires in Bozman. Downed trees and wires were reported in portions of Queen Anne's County.The storms had a more significant impact in northern and western Maryland, with numerous downed wires, trees and roadway hazards caused by the strong winds. Areas in the western part of the state also reported large hail, according to the weather service.A spokesperson for Maryland's largest power utility, BGE, called the destruction \"catastrophic.\" \"This is damage that if you worked in electric distribution at BGE for your entire career, you may see it once,\" Nick Alexopulos said at a news conference Monday night.In Westminster, Maryland, dozens of vehicles were trapped amid a string of power lines that fell like dominoes onto a highway. No injuries were reported. Utility crews turned off the electricity to the power lines, and the 33 adults and 14 children in the vehicles were able to get out safety, Maryland State Police Superintendent Col. Roland Butler said at a news conference Tuesday.First responders and others worked as a team and saved lives Monday night, Gov. Wes Moore said.\"There were people who were stuck and stranded in cars who were able to sleep in their own beds last night,\" the governor said.The storms, which spread across much of the mid-Atlantic region disrupted air travel.By Monday night, more than 2,600 U.S. flights had been canceled and nearly 7,900 delayed, according to flight tracking service FlightAware.The trouble continued Tuesday with hundreds of delays and dozens of cancellations.The Federal Aviation Administration, which rerouted planes around storms on Monday, warned Tuesday that low clouds and winds could impact airports in New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Las Vegas and San Francisco and thunderstorms could mean delays in Boston, Atlanta, Florida and Chicago. \n \n Caption: MIKE DETMER/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nCambridge municipal personnel work on Aurora Street near Henry Street the day after a storm dumped 4 inches of rain in two hours\n \nJERRY JAC KSON/THE BALTIMORE SUN\n \nLooking east from Route 97, a man stands in the field of downed power lines and poles on Route 140 in Westminster, Maryland Tuesday morning.\n \nJERRY JAC KSON/THE BALTIMORE SUN\n \nDale Rogoff Greer, left, talks with Baltimore County firefighters after several trees took out the power lines and fell on her daughter's car by her house on Gittings Avenue in Towson, Maryland, Monday evening. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Police obtained an arrest warrant charging Ray with attempted murder, first-degree assault, reckless endangerment and use of a firearm in a violent crime or felony.Deputies from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office responded to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton around 9 p.m. Sunday for a shooting victim. The victim, identified as Jahari De'Mon Cooper, 39, of Talbot County was driving near Unionville when Ray passed him and pulled off to the side.As Cooper passed Ray's vehicle, Ray shot at him multiple times, striking both him and his car. Cooper drove himself to the emergency room for treatment, police said.Police said Ray fled the area in his vehicle, failed to stop for a stop sign at the intersection of Unionville Road and Bruffs Island Road, left the roadway and struck several parked vehicles, disabling his own car.Ray then fled on foot into the nearby woods, prompting a 24-hour manhunt beginning in the early morning hours Monday. Numerous police vehicles from the multiple agencies involved in the suit lined Bruffs Island Road and other nearby streets. A helicopter was seen circling the search area early Monday afternoon.The search for Ray continued despite severe storms hitting the area Monday night into early Tuesday morning.Police said investigators uncovered information early Tuesday morning that Ray may have slipped through the search area during the storms and made his way toward the Washington, D.C., metro area. Talbot County Sheriff's Office investigators then contacted the U.S. Marshals Capitol Area Regional Fugitive Task Force with information on Ray's possible location.The U.S. Marshals task force located Ray in northern Virginia Tuesday afternoon.Around 12:46 p.m. Tuesday, the Alexandria Police Department responded to a shooting in the Potomac Yard Shopping Center, located in the 3600 block of Richmond Highway in the city. After arriving, officers learned that the U.S. Marshals task force had found a wanted fugitive, who was later identified as Ray.Ray was shot when the task force attempted to apprehend him, police said. He was taken to the hospital with life-threatening injuries.Detectives from the Alexandria Police Department are investigating the shooting and are communicating with the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, police said.Ray is on probation for a 2009 attempted second-degree murder conviction.Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble expressed his appreciation to the multiple agencies involved in the manhunt.\"I am incredibly grateful to the countless state, local and federal law enforcement officers on the Eastern Shore, CARTIF, and the Alexandria Police Department who willingly put themselves in harm's way to make our community safer during this manhunt,\" Gamble said in a statement.He added: \"During these strange times, as the Maryland Legislature continues to make policing more difficult, it is inspiring to know that there are still selfless men and women who are willing to risk their lives daily for all of us, knowing that their every action will be scrutinized by people who have risked nothing and have never known real danger.I can't thank these public servants enough for their sacrifice and heroism.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Currently, volunteer firefighters on the Mid-Shore have two options for training facilities in Princess Anne in Somerset County or Centreville in Queen Anne's County.Components of the project include a 3,500-square-foot concrete public safety building for first responder training, a 3,600-squarefoot classroom training and storage building and a 1,500-square-foot concrete pad for car fire, extrication and stabilization, and traffic safety training.Training for fire departments will include firefighting skills, rescue, and motor-vehicle fire and extraction. Law enforcement training will include hostage rescue, physical training and testing, traffic training, Homeland Security and K-9 operations. Emergency Medical Services can use classroom facilities for their training.\"This state-of-the-art training campus will not only support EVFD members for their training but will also help us in recruiting and training new members for the department. The training campus will also enable us to support our partners in law enforcement and emergency services in their training and recruitment needs and to better coordinate our roles in emergencies.We encourage the community to support our fundraising efforts as we embark on this $5 million goal,\" said fire Capt. Daryl Caldwell.The town of Easton gifted the use of a 2.7 acre property on Mistletoe Drive to the volunteer fire department for a state-of-the-art training center. This facility will serve both the town of Easton and the six local volunteer fire departments in Talbot County, as well as fire departments across the Mid-Shore. Talbot County has 260 active firefighters that respond to thousands of calls. EVFD responded to 896 calls involving 10,000 man hours in 2022 and conducted 1910 hours of training in 2022.\"It has never been more important than now to train our first responders and emergency personnel who serve Talbot County every day. There currently is no dedicated first responder training campus in Talbot County. The Friends of the EVFD and its volunteers accepted the challenge to raise $5 million for facility construction and operational expenses for the new campus.This campaign is essential toward ensuring cutting-edge training is available for all emergency services personnel,\" said campaign co-chairman Brett Whitehead.\"The sheriff's office is very excited to see this project come to fruition. The facility will not only offer training to our dedicated volunteer firefighters but will be able to support training for our deputies and police officers. Our citizens deserve the best-trained law enforcement officers. This training facility will support localized training to better equip our deputies while saving hard-earned taxpayer funds through reduced travel time and associated expenses. The facility will also be available for K-9 training for tracking people as well as drug detection,\" Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said.\"We're very excited about the brand-new state-of-the-art training facility to be used by fire departments, EMTs, and law enforcement around the Mid-Shore. This facility will allow us to train and recruit talented first responders from around the region. The Town is fully committed to helping our first responders safely and effectively serve our community, and this training facility is a crucial resource that will improve many facets of their operations. We are very thankful for the dedication and selfless service of the men and women who volunteer to protect and serve our Town, and thankful that they go above and beyond to ensure our community's safety, Easton Mayor Megan Cook said.For further information or to donate to the Friends of the EVFD Public Safety Capital Campaign for its Emergency Services Training Campus in Easton, contact Brett Whitehead at (302) 236-6249 or by email at whitenj20@gmail.com. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF FRIENDS OF THE EASTON VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT\n \nAn artistic rendering shows the planned Emergency Services Training Campus in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS - The Commissioners of St. Michaels voted unanimously Wednesday to revise job descriptions in the town's police department and approve raises in light of the new organizational structure.The need to restructure the small police department came about earlier this summer after former Chief Anthony Smith retired on June 30. Newly appointed Chief Jeffrey Oswald was sworn in the same day, leaving his former position as the department's captain unfilled.Instead of attempting to locate a new officer to serve as captain, with a salary ranging from $85,000 to $100,000, Oswald suggested restructuring the department through restructuring and promoting two of his officers to sergeants.The department's old structure included a chief, a captain and two corporals, each with two officers under them. The newly proposed and now-approved structure includes the chief and two sergeants, each with two officers under them.A memo in the town's meeting agenda packet indicated that both sergeants will be able to fulfill each other's roles, but each will have a separate primary focus in assisting the chief: one to help handle patrol responsibilities and one to aid in administrative tasks.Oswald said he previously handled the responsibilities of the captain position for 12 years while ranked as a sergeant and lieutenant and wanted to provide his officers with the same opportunities for advancement.The new structure will have a minimal budgetary impact, as the total base salary impact for the restructuring is $7,200.The promoted sergeants will receive mandatory first line administrator training and will be recognized by the Police Training Commission to take command in Oswald's absence. The positions come with a two year probationary period. \n \n Caption: FILE PHOTO\n \nThe St. Michaels Police Department is located at 100 S.

The threat followed an argument between the two men at a local restaurant earlier that evening.After leaving the restaurant with the rest of his family, the man said they walked to McWilliams' house and knocked on his door. The man told police McWilliams came to the door armed with a shotgun, pointed it at him and said that, if the man entered the home, he would shoot him.Police who spoke with McWilliams at the home said they could smell the odor of alcohol on his breath and on him. McWilliams told police that he left the restaurant after the argument and returned home. When he heard the man knock at the door, he armed himself with the shotgun and went downstairs to answer.McWilliams also told police he did not point the shotgun at the man and that he felt \"threatened\" by something the man said earlier in the evening.Police recovered the shotgun, identified as a Remington 870 20-gauge. The gun was found with one live shot shell in the chamber with the safety off, police wrote in charging documents.McWilliams appeared in the county district court Aug.7 for a bail review. He was ordered to remain held without bond.A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for Aug.28. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Raid a chilling example of an America to avoid\n\n August 16, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A7 | Section: Editorial \n \n 801\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n If there has been one overarching theme to the tumultuous politics of this era, it is the repeated reminders of just how fragile America's democratic institutions truly are.The specter of a sitting president and his supporters attempting to overthrow a valid election is the clearest example but by no means the only one.Missouri has recently seen such dystopian situations as state censorship of public libraries, private medical decisions regarding reproduction and gender being outlawed, and a governor demanding a criminal investigation against a newspaper reporter for exposing a state record-keeping failure.These aren't things that are supposed to happen in America.Even against that increasingly ominous backdrop, though, the story out of Kansas this week stands out as a unique Orwellian outrage that demands a forceful rebuke.Police and sheriff's deputies in tiny Marion, Kansas, on Friday raided the office of the Marion County Record, the local weekly newspaper, confiscating computers, cellphones, the newspaper's file server and other records.They also raided the home of publisher Eric Meyer, which the newspaper claims contributed to the death of Meyer's 98-year-old mother, veteran journalist Joan Meyer, possibly from a heart attack.The raids were authorized by a search warrant seeking information about a relatively minor (and apparently untrue) allegation that the newspaper had improperly obtained personal records regarding a local businessperson.Marion County Magistrate Laura Viar hasn't explained the justification for issuing the intrusive search warrant instead of a standard subpoena, which would be the norm in such a situation.A certain ex-president, recall, dodged and defied a subpoena for about three months before a court finally authorized the kind of invasive search that the newspaper was subjected to immediately.If none of this has yet spawned that uncomfortable tingling of the spine, consider this: The raid was led by newly hired Marion police Chief Gideon Cody, whose professional past the newspaper was in the process of investigating even as he and his officers stormed in.Cody reportedly injured a reporter's finger during the raid when he personally snatched a cellphone from her hand.Did we mention that this all happened not in some banana-republic military dictatorship but in a Kansas town that is not far from (literally) the geographic center of America?At least as troubling as the obvious abuse of authority by police and the judge is the muted initial reaction of Kansas state officials.The top law enforcement officer in the state, Kansas Bureau of Investigation Director Tony Mattivi, released a statement defending the raid and declaring, \"No one is above the law.\" This is true. Journalists are required to adhere to the law like anyone else.But the special constitutional protection of America's free press requires an abundance of caution and restraint when it comes to police interaction with journalists.This appears to have been exactly the opposite of that, for no legitimate reason that anyone involved has articulated.It is important not to draw conclusions before all the facts are in, but the available information alone makes it difficult to see how this could be anything other than a blatant abuse of power to punish and silence a local newspaper.The stated trigger for the raid - a reporter's computer search seeking information about a local businessperson's DUI - doesn't even sound like a crime, let alone one that could possibly justify the wholesale hauling of computers and cellphones out of a newsroom by police.Again, why didn't the judge simply issue a subpoena for the information?Perhaps the local officials who instigated this chilling attack on the free press thought their community was small and remote enough that it wouldn't end up on anyone's media radar.They were, thankfully, wrong.More than 30 news organizations, including The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, joined press advocates in formally protesting the raid to local officials and, more importantly, publicizing it nationally.Given the aggressive pushback by the publisher, it's almost certain the higher courts will ultimately review the judge's incomprehensible decision to authorize these raids.That decision should be forcefully overturned, the \"evidence\" obtained should be returned to the newspaper and rendered inadmissible in court - and city officials should get a new police chief.And every American who hears of this and other stories about those in power seeking to undermine the nation's constitutional protections should resist the urge to let it become some kind of new normal.It isn't, and it must never be.REPRINTED FROM THE ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH DISTRIBUTED BY CREATORS.COM \n \n Caption: MARION COUNTY RECORD\n \nThis surveillance video shows Marion Police Department confiscating computers and cellphones from the publisher and staff of the Marion County Record on Friday, Aug. 11, 2023 in Marion, Kan. The small newspaper and the police department in Kansas are at the center of a dispute over freedom of speech that is being watched around the country after police raided the office of the local newspaper and the home of its owner and publisher. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Workers tried to drive the flaming trailer out of the warehouse, but it was too late. The flames had caught the inside of the building.Everyone evacuated safely.The fire quickly went from one alarm to two and then three, bringing firefighters from throughout the region.\"It was Federalsburg, Preston, Bridgeville, Hurlock, Seaford, El Dorado, Secretary, East New Market and Sharptown.I called for a third alarm because everyone is so short on manpower during the day,\" said Federalsburg Fire Chief Steve Cox.He had some ideas about how the fire started.\"One of the guys was working with a plasma cutter inside and apparently caught one of the trailers on fire. Once that foam caught fire, it just took off. No one got injured, thank God. So, all it is now is pulling it apart to put it out. We laid a line, put in two hand lines in service to protect the office. The office is still OK. A little water damage, but OK.The roof was collapsing when we pulled up, so I knew we couldn't put anybody inside,\" Cox said.Once the fire was contained, some firefighters did put on oxygen tanks and carried chainsaws into the smokefilled wreckage to overhaul and make sure all the fire was extinguished.Armor Trailer employs about 25 people. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY TOM MCCA LL/\n \nAfter containing the blaze, a firefighter rests with a cool wet towel given out by the EMS.

    "content": "Four prison murders, but officials plead immunity\n\n August 24, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: George F. Will | Page: A7 | Section: News \n \n 735\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Jacob Philip and Denver Simmons, who are serving life sentences in a South Carolina prison for unrelated double homicides, spent two and a half hours on April 7, 2017, murdering four inmates in Simmons's cell.Simmons later said they hoped to get the death penalty.They did not, because the victims' families objected to their getting what they supposedly wanted.They lured John King with a promised coffee, strangled him with an extension cord, and stuffed him under a bed.Thirty minutes later, according to a court document, Simmons strangled a second inmate while Philip \"stomped\" on his ribs, causing them to \"pop.\" Thirty minutes later, they stabbed their third victim with a broken broom handle.They then used a trash bag to cover the cell door window, and invited into the cell a fourth victim, whom they strangled with their forearms, the extension cord and a broom handle.Apparently sated, they walked to the prison's administration building and suggested that officers check Simmons's cell.This month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit affirmed a district court's judgment that King's family cannot sue to hold anyone at the prison responsible for King's death.Herewith redundant evidence that \"qualified immunity\" enables government actors to violate constitutional rights with impunity.This doctrine shields officials from accountability for civil rights violations if there is no \"clearly established law\" forbidding exactly, or almost exactly, what the official did.Even minor factual differences can immunize the official, on the theory that if the official's behavior did not precisely match the fact pattern of a prior case, the official did not have fair warning that his action was wrong.The perverse effect is that the more uniquely gross the unconstitutional behavior is, the easier it is for the government official to successfully claim immunity.King's family asserts that his death resulted from prison officials' being \"deliberately indifferent\" to the danger he was in. He was held in a prison unit for inmates with \"persistent mental illness.\" There Philip and Simmons, who had violent prison histories, according to the court document, were in charge of administering other inmates' janitorial duties, and enjoyed special privileges, including unsupervised roaming from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.Sgt. DeWaun McKan conducted the required security checks every 30 minutes, but did not look into Simmons's cell, as his training required.When alerted to the bodies, McKan neither checked for pulses nor performed CPR, instead radioing for help.King's family sued McKan and various prison administrators under a theory of \"supervisory liability.\" The 4th Circuit affirmed qualified immunity for everyone: \"There is no clearly established constitutional right to properly conducted security checks.\" From this logic-chopping tendentiousness, the court concluded that neither McKan nor others \"knowingly\" disregarded the law.And the Constitution's Eighth Amendment proscription of \"cruel and unusual punishments\" supposedly requires King's family to \"pinpoint\" with \"specificity\" a \"precise\" constitutional right violation. The \"general risks\" of prison life are insufficient.In a demolishing dissent, Judge James A. Wynn Jr. wrote that what the majority called an \"atrocity\" - an atrocity without a remedy? - occurred because two double-murderers could circulate through the prison unit unsupervised.McKan's security checks were risible; he did not notice four corpses during five checks. McKan ignored the policy of instructing inmates to remove coverings of windows.The Supreme Court has affirmed an Eighth Amendment duty \"to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners.\" And \"deliberate indifference,\" the 4th Circuit's majority opinion noted, \"is established not only when the prison official 'knew of a substantial risk' of serious harm, but also when the official 'must have known about the risk\" (the court's emphasis added).The 4th Circuit has held that \"a prison official cannot hide behind an excuse that he was unaware of a risk, no matter how obvious.\" And \"there is no requirement that the very action in question must have previously been held unlawful for a reasonable official to have notice that his conduct violated that right.\" Qualified immunity has, at most, a narrow justification: protecting government actors (e.g., police officers) who must make split-second decisions in dangerous situations. Granting qualified immunity in a \"failure-to-protect\" case constitutes permission for lethal neglect.Americans would gag if they had an inkling of what occurs, unreported, in prisons.Americans should, however, be sickened when judges, with hairsplitting misapplications of qualified immunity, openly abet governmental malfeasance that allows prison violence.When prisoners depend on protection by governments that cannot be held accountable for culpable indifference, mayhem proliferates, lethally.Reach George Will at georgewill@washpost.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Immediately soaked in standing water, Reynolds proceeded to pull himself through 100 feet of spider-infested pipe barely wider than his body, toward the tiny kitten.The multi-hour ordeal ended triumphantly when both kitten and officer emerged at the other end; both of them wet, scraped, stinky and Reynolds minus one boot, but otherwise healthy and in good spirits!The kitten, now named Beverly Marsh, is safe and sound at The Animal Care Shelter for Kent County, where she has received preliminary treatment to prepare her for adoption.If you found this story touching - or entertaining - consider making a donation to ACSKC to help cover the cost of Beverly's care and help Reynolds get a new pair of boots at acskc.org/support/general-donation.This story was shared by Michael Wessel and Allison Atadan, Animal Care Shelter of Kent County. \n \n Caption: ACS KC\n \nThis 10-week-old calico, now named Beverly Marsh, is being cared for at the Animal Care Shelter for Kent County.

Police said the suspects then entered a Ford Edge with a Delaware registration and fled the area.Police said officers had responded to Walmart earlier that morning to respond to a report of a vehicle that had been gone through.In video footage, police say a small SUV was observed pulling into the parking lot at approximately 5:47 a.m., parking next to a Hyundai passenger car, exiting the SUV and getting in the Hyundai. Footage showed them returning to the SUV later and leaving.At 7:06 a.m., CPD officers responded to the Holiday Inn on the 2700 block of Ocean Gateway to a report of a Kia Sol that had been gone through and the steering column being pulled in an attempt to steal the vehicle.Through further investigation, detectives observed the same Ford Edge pull in the parking lot at approximately 5:33 a.m.Investigators found that the same Ford Edge had returned to Walmart at approximately 7 a.m. Police said three males exited the vehicle and entered the store, allegedly stealing several items before returning to the vehicle and leaving the area.Detectives identified one of the individuals as a 15-yearold from Cambridge.The Laurel Police Department in Delaware told Cambridge police that the Ford Edge was stolen in their jurisdiction.At approximately 10:47 a.m., CPD detectives were contacted by the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, who advised the Ford Edge had been located in Trappe.TCSO deputies were standing with the stolen vehicle when another vehicle came to the scene, and one of the deputies saw the 15-yearold juvenile in the back seat.Police placed the 15-year-old under arrest for the stolen vehicle. The 15-year-old was also found to have been reported missing through the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office and had an active warrant for his arrest in Delaware.The 15-year-old was later transferred to the Lower Shore Juvenile Detention Center to await pick up by Delaware law enforcement.CPD detectives identified two additional suspects as a 15-year-old male juvenile and a 17-year-old male juvenile, both from Cambridge.CPD detectives have also referred all three teens to the Department of Juvenile Services on the charges of attempted carjacking, attempted robbery, second-degree assault, theft less than $100, rogue and vagabond, malicious destruction of property, attempted motor vehicle theft and theft of $1,500 to under $25,000.Police said detectives notified the Laurel Police Department of the teens' identities so charges can be filed in Delaware. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Identifying faulty circuit breakers can protect your home\n\n August 25, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A13 | Section: News \n \n 799\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Electricity is at the center of our everyday lives. From computers, cell phones, televisions, and even now our vehicles.We find ourselves in a world where most things are powered by electricity, and we just trust that this electricity is safe.There are a multitude of items that ensure that we are delivered safe electricity throughout our day, and one of the most important items is our circuit breakers.Daniel Morris, Certified Master Inspector with Blackwater Home Inspectors, is a preferred partner with Mid-Shore Board of Realtors and explains circuit breakers and home safety.Circuit breakers are a safety device that is used to protect the electrical wiring running throughout our homes. The wiring in our home is designed to handle a certain amount of electricity that is normal for the fixtures it's attached to. The circuit breaker will detect if more electricity than the wire is rated for is being used, and \"trip\" to shut off the electrical current to the fixture.What happens if this system fails?The wiring can then become too hot from this increased electrical current and cause a home fire to start. Throughout the development of the electrical safety devices found inside of our homes, there have been some defective products that made their way into some homes. Here are some of those circuit breaker panels, and how to identify if they are installed in your home.Federal Pacific Electric company manufactured a series of panels from 1950-1980 called a \"Stab-Lok\" panel. The Federal Pacific Electric company purposefully cheated safety testing to ensure that their new \"Stab-Lok\" panel would pass the testing.When in actuality, these circuit breakers were later found to have a failure rate of about 30 percent. This means that in the case of too much electrical current being sent down the wire to a fixture, the breaker will not trip, and will cause the circuit to become overloaded and potentially cause a fire. These panels and breakers were installed in millions of homes during the production time, and while estimates vary, hundreds of thousands are believed to still be in use. Replacement of both the circuit breakers and panels is recommended.Identifying these panels and breakers is very simple however. Look at your electrical panel and see if the name \"Stab-Lok\" is identified anywhere on the cover plate, you will not need to remove any screws. Also, look for the red coloring located behind the circuit breaker number rating (15,20,30,50, etc.). When in doubt, always reach out to a licensed electrician for help in identifying.Another common circuit breaker panel with a history of safety defects is the Zinsco/Sylvania electrical panel. This type of electrical panel began production under the Zinsco name, before eventually being bought out by the Sylvania company. Sylvania then continued the production of this circuit breaker panel with no changes made. These panels were installed from the mid-1950s through the mid-1970s. These types of electrical breakers also had a history of failing to trip when overloading occurred. This led to arcs and overloading of the breaker to panel connection.The circuit breakers would often become fused to the electrical panel and be unable to be removed. What's worse, they would also melt the internal components of the breaker and make them unable to be tripped whatsoever.These breakers and panels are also easily identifiable.First, look for the labeling of the panel. The older units will have the \"Zinsco\" name, while units produced in the '70s will have the \"Sylvania\" name. Both of these panel names, however, will use the same breaker look. The breakers are skinnier than other electrical breakers seen today.They also had utilized colors, much like the Federal Pacific panel that you do not see. The moveable part of the breaker, that will (hopefully) move in the event of a trip, is colored either red, a light green, or a brighter green color. Identifying if there is damage to these breakers is only possible by having a licensed electrician remove the breaker from the panel.There are more dangers with electricity, however these two common electrical panels are easily identifiable, and can save your home from damage.If you have a home built before the 1990s, it may not hurt to take a minute or so to double check your electrical panel to ensure it is not one of these two defective panels.If you suspect you have one of these panels or are not sure what type of panel you have, reach out to a local electrician or a qualified home inspector to learn more.Morris can be reached at 443-528-1633 or email him at.

The Maryland Center for School Safety encourages Marylanders and visitors to:▪ Pay attention when driving, especially in school zones and during times of day when school buses are typically on routes.▪ Stop when a bus stops. It is illegal to pass a school bus with its red lights flashing.▪ Prepare to stop when the school bus is flashing its yellow lights and be cautious of students beginning to move toward the bus during these times.▪ Students of all ages are unpredictable.Therefore, prepare for the unexpected and maintain a safe distance from school buses at all times.Violators who are stopped by a police officer face a fine of up to $570 and three points on their driver's licenses.Infractions carry a monetary penalty for each violation.For additional school bus safety tips, visit the Maryland Highway Safety Office. \n \n Caption: JEFF FAUGHENDER/COURIER JOURNAL\n \nSchool buses packed with students make their way to school in Lexington, Kentucky.

As other units arrived, a perimeter was set up and K-9 units were called to assist along with aviation units.After about three hours of law enforcement officers' searching the area, Hockensmith was unable to be located.Investigators learned the vehicle Hockensmith was operating had been reported stolen, according to the police report.\"The vehicle was reported stolen to the Denton Police Department by Hertrich Chevrolet (in Denton), and we actually located another vehicle on the property that was stolen from them that they didn't even know about,\" Baker said.On Monday, Aug. 21, Delaware State Police posted on its Facebook page a request for help from the public in locating Hockensmith, who \"has three active felony warrants for his arrest for a host of offenses, including theft, burglary and a police pursuit.\" The Caroline County Sheriff's Office Criminal Investigation Division responded back to the Marydel property where the incident began. A second vehicle was located and recovered that also had been reported stolen through the Denton Police Department.As a result of the on-scene investigation, deputies arrested a female associate of Hockensmith identified as Danyeal L. Shahan. Shahan is being charged with motor vehicle theft and related charges. Shahan was wanted through the state of Delaware. She is being held on bond at the Caroline County Detention Center, according to Baker.The Caroline County Sheriff's Office has active warrants for Hockensmith \"for the two motor vehicle deaths (of) two brand new cars from Hertrich Chevrolet here in Denton,\" Baker said.This is an active investigation and anyone with information is asked to contact the Caroline County Sheriff's Office at 410-479-2515. \n \n Caption: TODD RANDALL HOCKENSMITH\n \nDANYEAL SHAHAN \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

James Henning has announced his retirement after more than 26 years of service to the Sheriff's Office and residents of Caroline County, according to an announcement on the office's Facebook page Tuesday, Aug. 29.\"Major Henning's experience and contributions to the profession will truly be missed,\" the post stated. \"Sheriff Baker and this agency wish him well in his retirement and all his future endeavors.\" Henning, 49, began his career with the office in November 1996 as a deputy sheriff in the patrol division and soon transferred into the narcotics task force for eight years before being being promoted back to the patrol division as a sergeant.In August 2011, Henning was appointed chief deputy by then Sheriff John R. Bounds and served in that capacity for over 12 years.Sheriff Donnie Baker said Henning \"was a very dedicated employee during his time here at the Sheriff's Office, and he will be greatly missed.\" \"Major Henning has always played a very important role to the success of many projects within our agency, to include our new facility, our body-worn camera program and our drone program, just to name a few,\" the Sheriff's Office posted on Facebook.Henning is a published author, and his \"Practical Narcotics Investigations\" is a manual for law enforcement professionals that explains how to complete narcotics investigations.A veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, Henning enlisted during the Persian Gulf War and, after serving four years, was honorably discharged with the rank of sergeant.Henning earned his bachelor's degree in management from the Johns Hopkins University and has taken numerous post-degree courses and earned several certificates. He has garnered a dozen awards and honors.He is a member of the Cybersecurity Association of Maryland Inc., the Maryland Association of Police Planners, the National Deputy Sheriff's Association and the International Association of Law Enforcement Intelligence Analysts, among others.Greensboro Town Commissioner and former Easton Police Chief David Spencer posted on Facebook, \"Congratulations and enjoy your retirement! Thank you for your dedication and service to our country. Good luck in whatever your future holds.\" \"I first met James Henning years ago when he was a student of mine at the Johns Hopkins University's Police Executive Leadership Program, where he was finishing his Master's degree,\" Dr.Marc A. De Simone Sr. posted on Henning's Linkedin profile.\"James has a great ability to lead and inspire others through his natural interpersonal skills and attention to detail,\" De Simone wrote. \"He puts others first, and has a cheerful heart. I know him to be a man of great character and competence.\" Baker said he will carefully consider Henning's replacement.\"I will be looking to replace the chief deputy in the coming months,\" Baker said. \"I will be taking some time and considering all my options,\" looking within the Sheriff's Office first. \n \n Caption: COURTESY CAROLINE COUNTY SHERIFF's OFFICE\n \nMAJ.

    "content": "Voters need facts on abortion issue\n\n August 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 559\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Despite the looming shadow of the absent frontrunner, last week's Republican presidential primary debate did get into enough non-Donald Trump substance to establish that even the putatively mainstream part of the GOP field is still far out of line with mainstream America on major issues.Especially one that potentially affects half the population in the most intimate ways imaginable.On abortion, the grotesque, deeply misogynistic lie that legions of pregnant women are sitting around waiting until just before birth so they can maliciously abort their babies got wide airing with zero pushback from the candidates on the Milwaukee stage. (Or from the Fox News moderators, for that matter.)The related claim that President Joe Biden and other mainstream Democrats favor policies allowing abortion for any reason up until \"the moment of birth\" was also tossed around as if it was established fact instead of political slander.In fact, Biden and mainstream Democrats' support for abortion rights generally echoes what was enshrined in the now-defunct Roe v. Wade: protection of that right up until fetal viability, which by definition is not late-term abortion.\"Roe v. Wade got it right,\" Biden said earlier this year, going on to specify his support for restrictions in the final trimester.Polls show Americans agree. Gallup found in May that support for unfettered abortion rights in the first trimester (which is when the vast majority of abortions happen) was a record-high 69%.Further, all available data indicates that even in the most permissive states, late-term abortion almost never happens, and when it does, it is virtually always a dire medical emergency.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 91% of abortions occur in the first trimester - long before fetal viability.The fewer than 1% that occur in the third trimester are by definition medically complex and risky procedures that are virtually always the result of life-threatening medical emergencies for the woman or dire fetal abnormalities.But Wednesday's debate would have the nation believe this rare and tragic anomaly is commonplace and has widespread Democratic support.It's as towering a lie as any Trump has ever told (which is saying something), and they were all on board with it.This is a classic Republican strategy today, akin to other bogeymen like transgender athletes in high school sports and critical race theory in grade school classrooms: They take a phenomenon that is exceedingly rare or nonexistent, strip it of context, and cast it as an evil plot against the culture by liberals.The actual threat is far more real and was plainly visible on the Milwaukee stage last week.When former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said the GOP needs to find political consensus on abortion policy, former Vice President Mike Pence pushed back, reiterating his call for a national ban and declaring that \"consensus is the opposite of leadership.\"If that sounds like, Never mind what the people want - well, that is, after all, the GOP's position in Missouri and other states that are fighting to prevent the issue from getting onto state ballots.That relentless strategy isn't about stopping a procedure that almost never occurs. It's about stopping women from having any say at all over what happens inside their own bodies. No matter which Republican wins the nomination, voters shouldn't forget that this is the party's overriding goal.REPRINTED FROM THE ST.

It is a crime whereby traffickers exploit and profit at the expense of adults or children. All persons under age 18 who exchange sex for something of value are human-trafficking victims regardless of the presence of force, lies or threats. A child cannot legally consent to commercial sex.The Eastern Shore is an attractive place for trafficking because of its geographic location in proximity to transportation routes by land, air and sea that offer opportunities for human traffickers to go undetected.Major highways like I-95, Routes 40, 50, 301, and 13 all make transporting victims and meeting buyers easy. In addition, three major international airports, inexpensive bus transportation, train service, and a high rate of seasonal work, make Maryland attractive to human traffickers.To learn about how to identify possible human trafficking victims, the industries where human trafficking most likely occurs, and ways to help, visit WeSupportSurvivors.org. If you would like more information or would like to request an anti-human trafficking presentation for your place of work or community, email Susan Ahlstrom at sahlstrom@forallseasonsinc.org. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nSusan Ahlstrom is For All Seasons' new human trafficking navigator. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

An Easton woman is facing numerous charges of theft, identity fraud and forgery after allegedly forging checks in the name of a man she served as a caretaker for.Nancy P. Guiseppe, 71, is charged with felony theft and fraud of $1,500 to under $25,000, 68 counts of forgery and other smaller amount theft and fraud charges in connection with several incidents in 2020.In December 2022, the Talbot County Sheriff's Office received a report of a caretaker, identified as Guiseppe, forging checks in a victim's name and cashing them.The victim, who was cared for by Guiseppe, died in 2020.A family member of the victim told police that Guiseppe had written herself a large check from the victim's checkbook for an unknown reimbursement and falsified numerous other checks by forging his signature, according to charging documents.Guiseppe reportedly attempted to cash another large check from one of the victim's accounts into a different bank account around the time of his death, but the transaction was stopped, the family member told police.After the victim's death, family members noticed his checking account had a negative balance, according to charging documents.Deputies who investigated the checks noted that the signatures on certain checks were different from a check previously signed by the victim.Police said Guiseppe was served with a criminal summons on July 21. She is scheduled for a trial in Talbot County District Court on Oct. 16, according to online court records.Anyone with information about this case is asked to contact Sheriff's Cpl.

Siple, 30 - of tasing and pepper-spraying her during the fight, which occurred shortly before 9:30 p.m. Wednesday in the unit block of Cedar Hill Circle, the same street on which Siple lives, court records show.Ambulances crews drove the two purported victims to a Delaware hospital for treatment, police said. One of the women suffered a stab wound to her chest, and the other had \"multiple lacerations\" on her body, police added. The woman who suffered the stab wound to her chest remained hospitalized on Thursday afternoon, and the other alleged victim was discharged from the medical center after receiving treatment, according to police.Cecil County Sheriff 's Office deputies rushed to the unit block of Cedar Hill Circle at 9:29 p.m. Wednesday, after receiving a dispatch regarding a stabbing, and they spoke with the alleged victims shortly after arriving there, police reported.The wounded women told investigators that Siple stabbed them with a knife in front of 84 Cedar Hill Circle and then went to her residence at 82 Cedar Hill Circle, where they believe that she discarded the weapon, court records allege.\"While clearing the (82 Cedar Hill Circle) residence, investigators observed a knife with a gray handle on the couch inside the home. Investigators observed apparent blood on the knife,\" according to the charging document.In the parking lot where the stabbings had occurred, investigators noticed an apparent blood trail that spanned from there to a residence several doors away on that block, where the alleged victims live, court records indicate.Siple is charged with attempted second-degree murder and six other offenses, including two counts each of first-degree assault and reckless endangerment, court records show. She remained in the Cecil County Detention Center on no bond Thursday afternoon, after her bail review hearing earlier that day, according to court records, which indicate that Cecil County District Court Administrative Judge Bonnie G.

At that point, a 25-year-old-man whose last name also is Butler noticed the suspect strangling the father and intervened, court records show.That man punched Butler in the head, causing him to release his chokehold, and then he attempted to pin the suspect to the ground while the father tried to recover, police said. The two men started wrestling in the driveway while the father went inside the house and called 911, police added. The father went back outside, announced that he had called the police and then left the property, court records show. At that point, the man who had intervened released Butler, who, in turn, went into the residence, court records show.During the on-scene investigation, deputies went into the residence and found the handgun that Butler allegedly had discharged in the driveway, police reported.While running a computer check on the handgun's serial number, investigators determined that the firearm had been reported stolen to Maryland State Police at the North East Barrack on Sept. 1, 2000, exactly 23 years ago on Friday, court records indicate.Butler is charged with first-degree assault, a felony that is punishable by up to 25 years in prison if convicted, and five misdemeanors, including reckless endangerment, possession of a stolen firearm and theft of property valued at more than $100 and less than $1,500, court records show.He remained in the Cecil County Detention Center on no bond Thursday, one day after his bail review hearing, according to court records, which indicate that Retired Cecil County District Court Judge Stephen J.

    "content": "Ex-Cecil County deputy charged with revenge porn\n\n September 5, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton; cahamilton@cecilwhig.com | Page: A3 | Section: News \n \n 1090\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CECIL COUNTY - A former Cecil County sheriff's deputy is facing 11 criminal charges amid allegations relating to two victims, including that he took an image of his genitals - while on duty, in uniform and inside agency headquarters - and sent that image to a woman and that he took photos and video of another woman while engaged in sexual acts with him and later sent them to different social media users, all without her consent, according to the Maryland Office of the State Prosecutor.Prosecutors reported that the defendant - Elkton resident Kyle Logan Thomas, 28 - has been charged with misconduct in office, witness retaliation, visual surveillance with prurient intent, revenge porn, and distribution of obscene material.Thomas was not arrested, but rather was served with charging papers in August, according to Cecil County Circuit Court records, which indicate that his initial appearance in court is set for Oct. 24.In another development, Thomas received a 10-day jail sentence on Aug. 24 in a related criminal case after a judge found him guilty of violating a protective order, according to Cecil County District Court records. Thomas has not started serving his sentence, however, because he appealed the case, court records show.SUSPENDEDThomas worked as a sworn sheriff's deputy for approximately two and a half years - from February 2021 through the first half of last month, according to Capt. Michael Holmes, a Cecil County Sheriff's Office spokesman.Holmes emphasized, however, that Thomas had been on suspension during his last nine months with the agency amid an administrative investigation into his alleged misconduct.That suspension, which was in accordance with agency protocol, stripped Thomas of all police powers and prohibited him from interacting with the public as a law enforcement officer, Homes said.\"On Oct. 28, 2022, the Cecil County Sheriff's Office received a citizen complaint regarding Deputy Kyle L. Thomas. The complaint centered around several allegations of misconduct occurring on duty and off duty involving Deputy Thomas.On the same date, the Cecil County Sheriff's Office promptly suspended the law enforcement authority of Deputy Thomas,\" Holmes outlined.Holmes continued, \"An internal investigation was begun immediately regarding the allegations. As the investigation progressed, Sheriff's Office investigators worked with the Cecil County State's Attorney's Office and the Office of the Maryland State Prosecutor regarding criminal conduct revealed in the investigation.Deputy Thomas was assigned to restricted non-law enforcement duty with no public contact while the investigation continued.\" On July 18, the sheriff's office \"separated Deputy Kyle Thomas from employment,\" Holmes reported, declining to elaborate due to personnel matters are private.Then, on Wednesday, Maryland State Prosecutor Charlton T. Howard III announced that his office filed 11 criminal charges against Thomas after completing an investigation into the complaints against him. In that announcement, Howard commented, \"Honesty and integrity is essential among our law enforcement officers.We will continue to investigate and, where appropriate, charge, individuals who engage in behavior that undermines the values of the offices they hold.\" VICTIM 1As part of an overview near the top of the Maryland Office of the State Prosecutor charging document, investigators explain, \"Thomas, who was married, frequently utilized Snap chat to communicate and exchange photos and videos with other users because the communications or other exchanges typically disappear.\" The charging document indicates that Thomas \"became engaged in a romantic relationship\" with a woman, whom investigators identified as Victim 1, and that Victim 1 ended that relationship with him in August 2021.\"Throughout their relationship, Thomas shared photographs and videos with Victim 1, primarily via Snap chat, depicting Thomas engaged in sexual acts,\" according to the charging document.At approximately 12:20 p.m. on June 16, 2021 - while in duty amid a shift that went from 7:45 a.m. to 7 p.m. that day - Thomas shared a video with Victim 1 using the \"My Eyes Only\" album on Snap chat and the image \"depicted Thomas in his deputy uniform, in the sheriff's office building, holding, touching his exposed penis,\" court records allege.Victim 1 attempted to end her relationship with Thomas several times and in response, according to the charging document, Thomas \"made verbal threats\" to her.On or shortly before Oct. 28, 2022, Thomas learned that the sheriff's office was investigating him and that Victim 1 had been interviewed by agency investigators and that \"a copy of the video that he shared with Victim 1 on Snap chat had been provided to the CCSO,\" according to the charging document.In response, Thomas contacted Victim 1 several times at her place of employment - a doctor's office - on Nov. 11, 2022, and again on Nov. 14, 2022, and requested to make a complaint against her, court records show.Thomas was not a patient of the doctor, investigators noted.Because of his behavior, Victim 1 obtained a order against Thomas, which he allegedly violated on March 1, some five months ago, and that led to the filing of a criminal case against Thomas on May 4.On Thursday, visiting Kent County District Court Judge John E. Nunn III imposed a 10-day sentence on Thomas after finding him guilty of violating a protective order, court records show. But Thomas appealed the case and, because of that legal action, he has not started serving his 10-day sentence, according to court records.VICTIM 2The charging document indicates that Thomas became \"engaged in a sexual relationship\" with a woman, whom investigators identified in court papers as Victim 2, at some point in 2019. It indicates that Victim 2 ended their relationship at some point in May, some four years later.Throughout their relationship, Thomas took videos and photos of himself and Victim 2 \"engaged in sexual acts,\" according to the charging document, which further alleges that Thomas took those images without Victim 2's consent.\"Several times throughout their relationship, Victim 2 attempted to end her relationship with Thomas. In response, Thomas sent videos of himself and Victim 2 engaged in sexual acts to Victim 2. Thomas threatened to send videos of Victim 2 engaged in sexual acts to other individuals or post the videos online,\" court records allege.On July 3, 2022, Victim 2 told Thomas to delete the photos and videos that he had on his phone, court records show. But Thomas told Victim 2 that he couldn't because he was anxious to post them on social media someday \"maybe when you get pregnant or married,\" according to the charging document.\"From at least April 2022 through and including at least January 2023, Thomas sent dozens of videos of himself and Victim 2 engaged in sexual acts to other Snap chat users without Victim 2's consent or knowledge.Thomas asked random Snap chat users to watch the videos. Thomas also paid several Snap chat users to watch the videos,\" court records allege. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Realtors are in a unique position that sometimes puts them in harms way.As a buyer or seller being aware of this will make all involved have a better understanding of why Realtors ask or do certain things.Local Realtors say they feel the most vulnerable at open houses and when showing property. Nationally, 4% of agents reported being victims of assault, robbery, theft and other undisclosed crimes.Many of the incidents occurred at open houses, home showings and in the agent's own vehicle.Although locally this is rare, it is still a possibility. Each September, Realtors are reminded about potential risks on the job and are asked to review the Member Safety Report (NAR.Realtor/Safety) for themselves and their clients.Allowing strangers to enter your homes always comes with risks, noted Megan Rosendale, president of Mid-Shore Board of Realtors. That is why jewelry, valuables, and medicines, should be locked up or removed from the property.Some agents make use of visual recordings and posted signs that say \"camera in use\" to try to deter thieves. There was a situation a few years ago in Talbot County where a person was going to multiple open houses and taking prescriptions, the police and other agents were notified.Realtors also use a lock box system called SentriLock.SentiLock records the code of the agent who opened the box plus the time the box was opened and when the key was returned. A combination box does not have this protection, and once the combination code is given out there is no way to know who is entering your property.Rosendale said, \"I also speak with my clients about not showing their home by themselves, not all agents, and buyers are who they say they are. We tell our children not to talk to strangers.I tell my sellers not to talk to other agents or buyers and have them refer all inquiries to me.\" Here are a few ways some Realtors protect themselves and their clients:▪ They take a picture of the license plate of the buyer's car and the client's identification.▪ They do not drive or ride with their clients unless they know them well.▪ They hold the first meeting with the clients in the real estate office or a public location.▪ They do not hold an open house alone.▪ They never meet a client for the first time at a vacant property.▪ They use a smart phone or application to track their whereabouts and to alert colleagues in case of▪ emergency.▪ They have their phone charged, carry a charging cord and hotspot for poor cell phone areas.▪ They carry mace and maybe even a weapon.We understand that meeting clients in private locations can be a part of our job, as well as hosting open houses and showing vacant properties in areas with poor or no phone coverage, noted Rosendale.That is why it is important to take preventative measures and be aware of the surroundings to help the agents and clients stay safe from would-be criminals.The Mid-Shore Board of Realtors mission is to advocate for its members and the public to preserve the right to own, transfer and utilize real property.

The UN group estimates 52% of the refugees living in Bangladesh's largest camps are children.Humanitarian groups have outline stories of young children (some aged 10 or 11 or even younger) who are orphaned and trying to survive in Bangladeshi refugees camps. The sprawling camps have seen fires, sexual violence and have been hit by typhoons and other climate change-fueled storms.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken marked the Aug. 25 anniversary of the start of persecutions in 2017 against mostly Muslim ethnic groups in Buddhist-majority Myanmar The U.S. and human rights groups deemed the persecutions - which stems from a 1982 Burmese law that says Rohingyas are not citizens of the southeastern Asian country - as a genocide and ethnic cleansing.Blinken said in a statement that the U.S. wants \"accountability for the atrocities committed by the Burma military\" and voiced concerns about continued internal strife and fighting within Myanmar between government and opposition forces as making an already rough humanitarian situation even worse.\"The United States has provided over $2.1 billion to assist those affected by the crisis in Burma, Bangladesh, and elsewhere in the region since 2017, remaining the leading single largest donor of life-saving humanitarian assistance to those whose lives have been upended by the violence.The escalation of violence throughout the country has exacerbated the dire humanitarian situation, particularly for members of ethnic and religious minority communities, including Rohingya,\" Blinken said.The U.S. and other countries have imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar and visa restrictions on government and military officials deemed responsible for the persecutions of Rohingya peoples as well as other religious minorities and pro-democracy dissidents.Those include restrictions on supplying jet fuel to the Burmese government and military as well as prohibitions on doing business with state-controlled banks and financial institutions after a military coup took full control of Myanmar in 2021.But the UNHCR has voiced concerns about conditions at the refugees camps - including food supplies and the rise of sexual violence and trafficking of women and children - amid drops in international financial support.\"In Bangladesh, funding shortfalls are already adversely affecting the wellbeing of nearly one million Rohingya refugees.Any further cuts to the Rohingya response will severely impact access to food, shelter materials, cooking fuels, sanitation facilities, and livelihood activities,\" said UNHCR in a statement last month.A recent call for $876 million in new investment in helping the Burmese refugees is falling short, the UN says/\"The Rohingya response is facing a severe funding crisis, illustrated by two recent cuts in food assistance.There is an urgent need to invest in collective efforts to allow Rohingya to become self-reliant as they cannot, and do not wish to, remain dependent on humanitarian aid,\" said UNHCR Representative in Bangladesh Johannes van der Klaauw in a statement last month.The U.S. announced a $74 million humanitarian assistance package for Bangladesh including $61 million for refugees from Burma.By comparison, Blinken was in Kyiv Wednesday, Sept. 8, where he was slated to announce another $1 billion in U.S. military aid to Ukraine in it was against invading Russian forces. The U.S. has sent $75 billion in military, intelligence, technology and humanitarian aid to Ukraine and President Joe Biden is seeking another $24 billion from Congress. \n \n Caption: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/CREATIVE COMMONS/CAPTAIN RAJU\n \nA young girl at a Rohingya refugee camp in Ukhia, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh.

    "content": "'25 kids should not take this whole city down' - Cambridge council grapples with youth crime in city\n\n September 14, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 5 | Section: News \n \n 610\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - Youth issues were the overwhelming theme for the third Cambridge City Council meeting in a row.At the Sept. 12 meeting, residents and commissioners alike made comments about juvenile crime.Lance Cephas, who is the father of Commission President Lajan Cephas and Commissioner Sputty Cephas, said crime is affecting everyone, including the children and families who aren't part of the problem.He further noted the children who aren't contributing to juvenile crime are being punished for the actions of about 25 children, \"25 kids should not take this whole city down,\" he said.Lance Cephas stressed the importance of educating the kids that are caught doing things they shouldn't be.\"Because if you send them back home to that same environment, ain't nothing going to happen,\" he said. \"A lot of police officers, they'll pick them up, they'll let them go, and soon as they're around the corner, they've done something else to somebody else. So you've got to get them and educate them.\" He said he understood both his children's, Lajan and Sputty, and Mayor Stephen Rideout's points of view regarding the juvenile curfew but said the council shouldn't be \"at each other's throats\" and \"controlled by 25 kids.\" \"We've all got to come together,\" he said.In late August, Rideout vetoed a juvenile curfew ordinance which commissioners had passed Aug. 14.Before that, in July, Rideout had proposed an alternative curfew ordinance which had additions and changes from the original curfew ordinance. These included adding definitions and altering language on enforcement procedures and penalties.Since Rideout vetoed the original curfew ordinance, Sputty Cephas has made amendments to Rideout's alternative ordinance in an effort to compromise and \"find middle ground.\" According to council meeting documents, Cephas plans to recommend these amendments Sept. 25 when Rideout's proposed ordinance will be read for a second time.During the meeting, Sputty Cephas talked about finding that middle ground.\"Commissioner Atkiss made a point to say that $100 is a lot of money for a struggling parent,\" he said.\"My day job is in banking, so I understand that struggle as well.\" Sputty Cephas said he would like to keep fines as part of the penalty for not following the curfew, but said he cut them in half in his amendment. Instead of a $100 fine, it would be $50.At the end of the meeting, Rideout suggested to Sputty Cephas that the two of them get together to talk about the proposed amendments to the alternative ordinance. Sputty Cephas agreed to meet.Two presentations were given during Monday's meeting, as well. One presentation was given by Pam Gregory, president and CEO of United Way of the Lower Eastern Shore, and one by Lisa Molock, chief executive director at Let's Thrive Baltimore and an organizer for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.Molock talked about the work she has been doing in Baltimore, and Gregory talked about the economic issues that many Marylanders face. She shared data from a report that focused on asset limited, income constrained and employed (or ALICE) Marylanders and shared data on Dorchester County residents specifically. Gregory said that in Dorchester County, 45% of residents are below the ALICE threshold.During public comment, Theresa Stafford said poverty is a \"lead driver\" for many other issues in Cambridge.\"We need to get serious about fixing the problem of poverty,\" Stafford said.\"Bringing in industries or businesses that will pay good wages, and of course, supporting getting kids educated because that's the other key driver that keeps driving up the crime.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nPam Gregory, CEO of United Way of the Lower Eastern Shore, gives a presentation at a Cambridge City Council meeting on Sept. 11. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "It's time to confront ongoing youth violence\n\n September 15, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Armstrong Williams | Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 689\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n If you go to Google and type \"heinous crimes up with young people,\" you'll see over 2 billion results.It's a stark reminder that the alarming trend of young people committing gruesome acts isn't a new phenomenon, but the sheer proliferation and frequency of these acts most certainly is. Our society is grappling with a disconcerting reality - a reality born out of the convergence of various factors.From the messages embedded in our music to the desensitizing violence prevalent in our culture, and even the erosion of moral and ethical values, each contributes to the emergence of a more violent society.It's a society where individuals no longer temper their darkest impulses, and regrettably, it's our youth who often find themselves on the frontline, manifesting behaviors at an unacceptable rate. This is a phenomenon that should deeply trouble us all and lead us to pause in concern for the direction in which our society is headed.These young individuals, driven by a cocktail of influences, often react impulsively or, in the gravest of cases, meticulously plan calculated crimes that result in the loss of innocent lives. We've witnessed stories like that of Mackenzie Shirilla, a name etched into the annals of a society grappling with the aftermath of senseless violence.Shirilla was recently found guilty of the murder of her boyfriend, Dominic Russo, and her friend, Davion Flanagan. Their tragic deaths underscore the gravity of the situation we're facing - a situation where young people are becoming entangled in webs of aggression and desperation. In Shirilla's case, she purposely sped up her car to 100 mph and drove straight into a wall, instantly killing her boyfriend and friend.The breakdown of morality in our society is contributing to this disturbing trend. Traditional values that once served as guiding principles seem to be waning, leaving a moral vacuum in which right and wrong are increasingly ambiguous. The erosion of moral foundations means that young people are less equipped to distinguish between ethical choices and destructive actions.The deterioration of ethics further compounds the issue. Ethical conduct is the cornerstone of a civilized society, fostering a sense of responsibility and accountability. Yet, as we witness these disturbing trends among our youth, it becomes evident that the concept of ethics is losing its grip. The pursuit of personal gain, even at the expense of others, has become alarmingly normalized.As we reflect on these developments, the implications for our future are profoundly concerning. A society that permits the erosion of morality and ethics in its younger generation is sowing the seeds of its own demise. The actions of today's youth foreshadow the trajectory of tomorrow's adults. If we fail to address these concerning trends, we risk a future marked by increased violence, social fragmentation and a dearth of empathy.It's time for us to confront these unsettling truths and take meaningful action. By reemphasizing morality and ethics in our families, communities and institutions, we can recalibrate the moral compass of our youth. This requires an unwavering commitment to fostering values that prioritize human dignity, compassion and respect for one another. Only through concerted efforts to restore these foundational principles can we hope to guide our society toward a more harmonious and promising future.This alarming trend of young people exhibiting violence and aggression should serve as an urgent wake-up call for our educational institutions. We must prioritize emotional education alongside academic excellence. By equipping our youth with the tools to manage their emotions, resolve conflicts constructively and communicate effectively, we can help curb the escalation of anger and violence.It's imperative that our schools become places not only of intellectual growth but also of emotional well-being and character development.The rising wave of heinous acts committed by young people underscores the pressing need for a comprehensive societal response. We must address the erosion of morality and ethics, and we must prioritize emotional education within our education system. This is a challenge that requires the collective effort of families, communities, educators and cultural influencers. By refocusing on our shared values, investing in the emotional well-being of our youth and fostering a renewed sense of empathy, we can shape a society that rejects violence and paves the way for a brighter and more harmonious future.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Geraci said in the release. \"I've said it before, and I will say it again: The safest way to enjoy fireworks is to attend one of the many public fireworks displays throughout the state.\" This is the second such tragedy to occur in Maryland in the last few months.Around 9 p.m. on July 5, the Office of the State Fire Marshal and the Charles County Sheriff's Office were called to Bannister Circle in Waldorf after a caller reported that a man had been injured while setting off fireworks.Damon Hammond, 20, died after a mortar he was holding exploded, causing serious chest and hand injuries that claimed his life.If residents do decide to celebrate with fireworks on their own, the state fire marshal's office offered several tips on how to do so safely.First, purchase fireworks in the location where you intend to discharge them. Local municipalities maintain a list of which fireworks are permitted for use in the area.Read and follow all label warnings and instructions and do not allow small children to use fireworks, and do not consume alcohol while using fireworks.Have a bucket of water or a hose available to extinguish any fireworks that have been used, and always remember to fully extinguish any remains of fireworks in water before disposal.Twitter:@JesseSoMdNews \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The agency and its extraordinary volunteer advocates have been the voice for more than 100 children in the Caroline County foster care system due to abuse and/or neglect.CASA volunteers are unstoppable advocates for a child's best interest. They sustain this dedication despite the heartbreak and complexity of the cases and the diverse needs of children. Whatever each child's and youth's circumstances, CASA volunteers are frequently the only consistent adult in their lives and the ones who can make the difference between achieving permanency or lingering in the system, between succeeding in school or becoming involved with the juvenile justice system.Their tireless efforts make a huge difference in the life of a child, as kids with CASA volunteers spend less time in foster care, have greater access to more resources, do better in school, and are much better prepared for young adulthood and independent living.CASA volunteers are the heroes who \"Change a Child's Story.\" In honor of this monumental achievement, CASA of Caroline will be holding a celebration dinner, A Legacy of Caring: Twenty for Twenty, at Caroline's Table in Denton on Thursday, Oct. 12 at 6 p.m.Caroline's Table will provide the setting for an elegant and intimate evening, complete with a four-course meal and wine pairings. The keynote speaker for this event is Lisa Spicknall, who will share her inspirational story about the power of advocacy. Spicknall is currently the executive director of Donate Life Maryland, has served as executive director of MADD, and has been a victim advocate since her life was forever changed on one tragic night in Talbot County in 1999.She has presented to numerous federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI and has been recognized for her work through awards including the Maryland Governor's Victim Assistance Award and People Magazine's Heroes Among Us Award.The goal for the celebration is to raise $20,000 in honor of 20 years of child advocacy in Caroline County. Tickets are $150 per person, and donations are welcome. If you are interested in attending the dinner or making a donation in honor of this milestone, please visit casaofcaroline.org or contact CASA of Caroline at info@casaofcaroline.org or call 410-479-8301. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He added the areas most affected were the Hoopers Island area, Taylor's Island and the Wingate, Toddville and Bishops Head areas.Dorchester County Council member Rob Kramer monitored how the storm affected the county over the weekend.He said the road past the Hoopers Island Causeway \"took a little bit of a beating.\" While the causeway had been closed Saturday, it has since been reopened.Windsor said Water Street in Cambridge also shut down temporarily due to the storm.Over the weekend, the Sheriff's Office was trying to limit traffic through Worlds End Turn as well, he said.The county's Department of Emergency Services had few, if any, flood-related calls over the weekend, Windsor said.\"I know the [Hoopers Island Volunteer Fire Company] assisted some people with getting back to their residences from places they were at on the island after it had started to flood,\" he said.As part of the county's contingency plan, the National Guard was brought into the county. Kramer said the county received the guards once Gov.Wes Moore declared a state of emergency in response to Tropical Storm Ophelia on Friday.\"They had brought a couple Humvees with them,\" Kramer said. \"They were just a contingent plan in case we needed them.\" Windsor said while the county didn't end up needing assistance from the National Guard, it did some pre-deployment area reconnaissance \"just to make sure they knew where they were going if they had to go anywhere.\" As of Wednesday, Windsor said most of the flood water has receded.\"There is still some high water areas in the lower part of the county, which is not being helped by the fact that we currently have a higher than usual tide cycle,\" he said. \"But everything is back open.\" Windsor asked that the public use caution when traveling in those lower parts of the county in case the water has made it difficult to navigate the roads.\"In the grand scheme of things, this was minor compared to some of the storms we've had in the past,\" Kramer said. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF DORCHESTER COUNTY COUNCILMAN ROB KRAMER VIA FACEBOOK\n \nParts of southern Dorchester County saw flooding caused by tropical storm Ophelia. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Both were ordered to remain held without bond following bail reviews Monday afternoon.With assistance from the Cambridge Police Department, detectives from the Easton Police Department arrested Kevron Chase, 34, ofCambridge and Chadnee Harris, 32, ofHurlock on Saturday.Chase is charged with first-and second-degree murder, first-and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, using a firearm in a felony crime and illegal possession of a regulated firearm.Harris is charged with acting as an accessory after the fact offirst-and second-degree murder and acting as an accessory after a felony.The charges against the two stemmed from the early morning shooting at the Sidetracked Saloon. Police responded to the bar just before 2 a.m. Saturday morning for a report of shots fired.Officers found a large crowd in the parking lot and a man, later identified as Antonio L. Smith, suffering from a gunshot wound to the head.Two shell casings were found in the parking lot, according to charging documents.Officers initiated lifesaving efforts until Talbot County paramedics arrived and transported Smith to the University ofMaryland Shore Medical Center at Easton, where he was pronounced dead.In charging documents, police said multiple witnesses were interviewed. Multiple people identified Chase as the shooter.Police reviewed the bar's security camera footage, which showed Chase and Harris entering the bar shortly after midnight and exiting to the parking just before 1 a.m., according to charging documents.Further review of the video footage reportedly showed Chase and Harris standing between two cars near the entrance of the bar and Smith approaching the two.The officer reviewing the footage wrote in charging documents that Chase pulled a handgun from his waistband area and pointed the handgun at Smith. Chase put the handgun back toward his waistband area and then appeared to hand the gun to Harris, police said.Smith and Chase began physically fighting in the parking lot, drawing a crowd.Charging documents said Harris walked toward the two men fighting near Chase and that the crowd quickly dispersed. Smith appeared to duck behind a car and Chase walked toward Smith, pointing a handgun at him.The officer who reviewed the footage wrote in charging documents that they saw a muzzle flash from the gun and Smith collapse in between two cars.Security camera footage captured the license plate number on Chase's car, police said. Police shared information with surrounding law enforcement agencies and obtained location data on Chase, who was found in the car with Harris during a traffic stop on Race Street in Cambridge. Both were detained by police.In interviews with Cambridge police, Chase told officers that the physical fight began over Smith trying to rob him several months before, according to charging documents. Chase told police that Smith's friends shot at him, and he fired a single shot back toward their area, but Chase denied shooting Smith.Talbot District Court Judge Karen Ketterman ordered that Chase and Harris remain held without bond during bail reviews Monday afternoon, citing concerns about public safety.Chase and Harris are scheduled to appear for preliminary hearings in the county district court on Oct. 30. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nA 23-year-old man was shot and killed outside the Sidetracked Saloon in Easton on Saturday, Sept. 30. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I'm going to live his legacy, and I'm going to live a legacy for myself as well.\"Carla Young said she is still trying to figure out who she is since losing her son A'Corie Young, who was killed in Cambridge in April 2022.\"My whole life changed,\" Young said. \"I never knew I could feel the way I felt since his passing.\"Young said her faith has helped her.\"I hope nobody has to stand where I'm standing,\" she said. \"But it's just something we have got to walk together. We've got to stand together and do all that we can to make a difference.\"Young's daughter, Meisha Woolford spoke about the need for more millennials to get involved.A 2003 graduate of Cambridge-South Dorchester High School, Woolford said students were taught to \"go to college and leave and never look back.\"\"But there's a problem with that,\" she said. \"All of the good people are not here. So if all of the good, influential millennials are not here, what's happening to this generation?\"Woolford said it's time for those millennials to get involved \"and realize we've all got work to do to make this a better and safer place for our youth.\"Tyreese McAllister and her husband, Anthony McAllister, traveled from Alexandria, Virginia, for the event. Since losing their daughter, Ayana, to gun violence, the McAllisters have started the Ayana J. McAllister Foundation. According to its website, the foundation's mission is to use advocacy and education strategies to engage minority communities that have been disproportionately affected by gun violence.On Saturday, Tyreese McAllister spoke about the importance of having hope.\"Hope is not just a fleeting emotion,\" she said. \"It is a driving force that propels us forward. It is the belief that we can make a difference, that our actions matter and that change is possible.\"Tyreese McAllister said it will take more than gun laws to solve the problem of gun violence in America.\"We need boots on the ground,\" she said. \"We need people in the communities to make this change.\"Cambridge Mayor Stephen Rideout called the event-which also included speeches from faith leaders, musical performances, food and activities - powerful.\"In a town of our size, a community that is engaged, as I felt it was Saturday, with the help of groups such as Moms Demand Action and our police department, we're going to be able to do a lot to start addressing this problem,\" Rideout said in an interview.Rideout said it will take more than \"a couple meetings\" to solve this problem. He mentioned things the city is doing to address gun violence, including Police Chief Justin Todd's efforts with community policing and the juvenile curfew that went into effect Sunday.Rideout said he sees the curfew as tool to help identify families that may need help or benefit from local services.Rideout talked about his own efforts to address gun violence and juvenile crime. He said he has a meeting scheduled with a representative from the governor's office to discuss juvenile justice concerns and has reached out to delegates about possible legislation he thinks could help bring cases to the court \"in a more effective way.\"\"To me, the gun is the symptom,\" Rideout said. \"My view, from my experience in Virginia [as a judge] on the bench, is that we can get help get family services to kids in a way that will get them back on the right track and not be engaged in fights and violent action.

Last year, 564 people died on Maryland roadways, while in 2007, 615 people were killed on state roads.\"We are on track at this point, if the numbers stay consistent, to go over 600 fatalities,\" Nizer said during the Transportation Revenue and Infrastructure Needs meeting last month. \"We have not seen that kind of numbers since 2007 and so we are sounding the alarm.\" More traffic around the fall and winter holidays often increases the toll.\"We see a lot of fatal crashes during holiday weekends and especially during those highly traveled holidays,\" Elena Russo, a spokesperson for the Maryland State Police, said. \"We see a higher volume of traffic and with a higher volume of traffic, as you can guess, we see a lot more violations of the rules of the road.\" The number of roadway fatalities in Maryland rose in 2020. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic decreasing travel across the state, Maryland saw 574 roadway fatalities in 2020, 39 more deaths than the year prior. Traffic deaths continued higher than typical pre-pandemic numbers into this year.On Sept. 12, Gov. Wes Moore announced more than $11.5 million in funding for 85 organizations, agencies and programs working to improve roadway safety in Maryland. The money is destined for measures such as overtime traffic enforcement, to prevent distracted or impaired driving and to promote use of seat belts and child seats.Changes in driving behaviors since 2020 are at least partly responsible for the increase in roadway fatalities, said Ragina Ali, public and government affairs manager for the American Automobile Association - Mid Atlantic.\"We know there were less people on the roadways, at least in our area and across most of the country, but it seemed like those who were driving were engaging in more dangerous and risky behaviors,\" Ali said. \"That they kind of thought the roadways were open and raceways and we did definitely see an alarming increase in dangerous driving behaviors.\" The unsafe and reckless driving habits that proliferated during 2020 have continued into 2023, she said.\"Any increase in the fatalities on our highways is alarming,\" said Russo. \"And when we see our numbers increasing, it should be a wake-up call to motorists to sort of revisit the rules of the road.\" The leading causes of roadway fatalities have been consistent in the years since 2020. Over the last four years, distracted driving has been involved in the most crashes, followed by speed. Often, though, several things contribute to a crash.\"In some instances, a crash may have multiple factors,\" Ali said. \"In other words, somebody may be impaired and be distracted.They may be distracted and speeding.\" According to John Seng, founder of the Maryland Coalition for Roadway Safety, a shortage of police officers monitoring roadways and, ironically, an increase in speed cameras encourages speeding.\"(When) you get to drive 11 to 12 miles over the speed limit and still not get a ticket for speeding through electronic speed enforcement,\" Seng said, \"you are tacitly saying, 'It's OK if you speed eight miles over the speed limit.'\" According to Russo, law enforcement agencies across the country have faced difficulties recruiting officers.\"Like every law enforcement agency in this nation right now, we're having a tough time recruiting individuals who are qualified for the job,\" Russo said. \"One of the primary reasons may be public perception at this time of law enforcement.In the media, you've seen a lot of high-profile incidents that include police misconduct and therefore our citizens may have lost trust in their law enforcement agency.\" While the number of crashes has decreased every year since 2018, the number of fatal crashes continues to rise, according to MDOT. In 2018, one in every 243 crashes was fatal. Comparatively, in 2022, one in every 203 crashes was fatal.Prince George's County has led the state every year at least since 2016 with more fatal crashes than any other county, according to MDOT's Crash Data Dashboard. In 2022, 121 roadway fatalities were reported in Prince George's County, 21% of the statewide total.Just a few days ago, on Sept. 29, four people died in a crash in Prince George's County after their car ran into a tree on Woodmore Road.Commuters' reliance on Prince George's roadways is one reason the county sees higher rates of fatal accidents than any other county in Maryland, according to Ron Weiss, a member of the MD Route 210 Traffic Safety Committee.\"A lot of people travel through Prince George's County to get to the District to work,\" Weiss said.\"A lot of the traffic on our roads is commuting back and forth from the Beltway and I think that plays a part (in) it.\" One area of concern for drivers in Prince George's County is Maryland Route 210, known colloquially as Indian Head Highway.According to Rev. Robert L. Screen, founder of MD Route 210 Traffic Safety Committee, in 2022 10 people died on the 14-mile segment of MD 210 in Prince George's County.\"People are scared, they're nervous, they're anxious,\" Screen said. \"I can't tell you the number of people that avoid 210, they go on other roads to avoid going on Indian Head Highway. The reputation precedes itself in the mindset of a lot of people that live in this community.\" According to Screen, Route 210, sees higher volumes of traffic than other highways because it offers access to Washington, D.C., which when combined with increasing populations in Charles County and St.Mary's County from infrastructure improvements has meant more wrecks.\"It's got a reputation in the area and it's not a good reputation,\" Weiss said. \"It reflects not just on Fort Washington or Accokeek or Oxon Hill; it reflects poorly on all of Prince George's County and Maryland.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Antoine Patton and Lt. Greg McCray spoke at the town hall.Patton spoke about some of the things the department does to increase positive interactions with the community.\"If you look on the news, it would have you to believe sometimes that police officers are only there when bad things happen,\" he said. \"But we want our community to know that we love them, and we're here to work together.\" Patton mentioned how the department takes children and senior citizens Christmas shopping every year. This year, he said he had the idea for \"12 Days of Christmas\" where the department will take children and senior citizens out shopping from Dec. 12 through Dec. 24.Patton talked about a Thanksgiving dinner the department hosted last year and plans to host again this year.\"In five to 10 years these children will be teenagers and these teenagers will remember the things that we did,\" he said.Todd shared some of the city's crime data at the meeting as well.Since 2019, the Cambridge Police Department has taken 114 illegal guns off the streets, he said.Compared the the record number of seven homicides in Cambridge last year, Todd said there have been two homicides so far in 2023.\"I don't call that success by any means,\" he said. \"The day we have zero is the day we've been successful. [[---]] But it's progress. And that's what we have to keep banking on as we keep getting better as a community and a city.\" Todd said the number of juvenile crimes (committed by those under 18) is \"continuously getting worse.\" \"Out of the 300-and-some assaults that we've had this year, 127 have been committed by juveniles,\" he said.Todd brought up the juvenile justice reform bill, passed in 2022, which stops youth, under the age of 13, from facing criminal charges like assault and weapons violations.He said something needs to be done to fix this reform.\"And the juveniles know it,\" he said. \"We have 12-year-old kids telling us, 'What are you going to do to me?'\" With the juvenile curfew in Cambridge, which went into effect Oct. 1, Todd said the last thing he wants to do is fine a parent.\"But at the end of the day, if we can help one child or one family, one parent to better parent their child, and get them out of the streets, then we've done something right as a community and it's a start,\" he said about the curfew.In 2010, Todd said the department had 52 officers. When he entered the role of police chief, there were 29 total officers with two in the police academy.\"At that time, we had a department that was depleted,\" he said.The department is building itself back up. Todd said there are 39 total officers in the department right now, with four in the police academy.\"So we'll get those out of the police academy in December, and we'll keep building our Criminal Investigations Division,\" he said.Todd said he hopes to increase the diversity of the department. He said that 67.5% of both civilian employees and sworn officers in the department are white. Black employees make up 22.5%. Hispanic employees and Asian employees each make up 5%.\"We want to mirror our community,\" Todd said, acknowledging that this is no easy feat.\"But I just want the public to know we're working hard to get there,\" he added.After the meeting, Gary Gordy, one of the residents in attendance, said that he thinks more policing is needed in Cambridge and thinks it's good the department is hiring more officers. He said that when it comes to crime, Cambridge needs cameras.Gordy added that some of the problems the city is facing with crime could have been prevented if the city had acted earlier.\"We wait for years to get things done,\" he said. \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nCapt.

Wilson, 59, on Thursday, police announced.The charges, which include acting as an accessory, altering physical evidence and obstructing and hindering a police officer, stem from Wilson's alleged involvement after the shooting death of Easton resident Ty A. Brooks in early August.Police responded to the area of 104 Blake Street around 7 p.m. Aug. 7 for a report of a person who had been shot and was laying in the grass.Officers arriving on scene rendered aid to the man, later identified as Brooks, until paramedics arrived. Brooks died from his injuries at the scene, police said. He was transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore for an autopsy.Police said earlier in the day, Brooks argued with individuals that were near and operating a 2018 Land Rover Range Rover, which was parked in the 100 block of Blake Street.Brooks left the area and returned later, operating an ATV. Brooks confronted the same individuals with a shotgun, police said.Police said after the group exchanged words, a man seated in the driver's seat of the Range Rover fired shots through the front passenger seat window and struck Brooks' side.The man in the driver's seat was identified by police as Daseir Cornish, 22, of Denton. Cornish is charged with second-degree murder, assault, manslaughter and related charges in connection to Brooks' death.After Brooks was shot, he fell off of the ATV, police said. The Range Rover fled the scene accompanied by a gray Hyundai sedan.Police said Thursday that when officers were attempting to secure the crime scene and render aid, Wilson walked to the area where Cornish allegedly shot Brooks and retrieved his cell phone, which was dropped by Cornish. Wilson left the area with the phone, police said.Wilson was released on a $25,000 unsecured bond, according to online court records. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Trooper 7 guided ground rescue crews to the victim location, but conditions proved to be inaccessible by foot or boat.MSP's Trooper 2, which is based at Joint Base Andrews, was dispatched at about 1:20 a.m. to assist with a hoist extraction and take over rescue operations.Once overhead, the pilots on Trooper 2 hovered the Leonardo AW-139 helicopter approximately 50 feet above the marshy terrain while a trooper/paramedic was lowered below to assess the victim.The victim was extracted utilizing the air-lift rescue vest. The trooper/paramedic and victim were hoisted back into the aircraft.Trooper 2 then landed at a landing zone established by the Dorchester County Fire and EMS Department, where the victim was transferred to ground paramedics for a secondary evaluation.The victim ultimately did not require treatment or transport.The Maryland State Police Aviation Command has served Maryland citizens since 1970 and operates a fleet of 10 AW-139 helicopters from seven bases throughout the State. Each aircraft provides coverage 24/7/365 to Maryland residents and visitors.The MSPAC missions include medevac, law enforcement, search and rescue, homeland security and disaster assessment.The success of the missions relies heavily on the cooperative efforts of local fire, rescue, EMS, law enforcement agencies and partners at the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Park Police. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Strained blue lines - Police battle mental health challenges along with crime\n\n October 17, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; Apg National Enterprise Editor | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1287\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Police officers, corrections guards and staff at jails and prisons and other law enforcement personnel are in stressful and dangerous vocations.They are one of the emerging frontline populations in America's current mental health crisis that saw record numbers of suicides last year and increased levels of anxiety and depression.There have been 87 officers killed in the line of duty so far this year and more than 1,400 officers have died due to on-the-job events and causes between 2020 and 2022 (including 863 attributed to COVID), according to the Officer Down Memorial Page.Another 1,172 police officers, corrections staff and emergency dispatchers have taken their own lives since 2017 (including 69 so far this year), according to Blue H.E.L.P, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit group. The FBI is asking local police to start reporting officer suicides in their crime reporting.Law enforcement officers have a 54% greater suicide risk than the general U.S. population, according to a 2021 analysis by researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the State University of New York Buffalo.A record 49,449 Americans died by suicide last year - 79% of them men, according to the CDC.The suicide numbers and mental health stressors among the rank-and-file are not lost on police chiefs, county sheriffs and other law enforcement advocates across country in a vocation where there have been historical stigmas and cultural hesitancies to talk about mental health.PEER SUPPORTA number of departments across the country are turning to peer support programs to overcome those past and current stigmas and hesitations and to tell officers it's OK to seek assistance.In Florida, Capt. Kenneth Rainey with the Sarasota Police Department said his law enforcement agency is restarting a peer support program that fell by the wayside a decade ago.\"It never got the attention it deserved,\" Rainey said of past efforts.That's changing.Rainey, who leads SPD's professional standards operations, said a new coordinator will be hired to lead the peer support efforts along with six initial officers who will stand ready to talk to their cohorts about on the job stressors.He said the program will rollout in early 2024 with hopes for growth.\"Nobody knows officers better than their coworkers and fellow employees. We're really trying to eliminate the stigmas associated with mental health saying that its OK to ask for help,\" Rainey said.Sarasota, on Florida's west coast, has 185 officers and staff.The U.S. Department of Justice is working with law enforcement agencies on establishing peer support programs related to officers' mental wellness. That includes training sessions and publications focused on best practices for such efforts.In addition to police, the peer path is increasingly being followed by a number of colleges, high schools and middle schools to help overcome hesitations to talk about mental and behavioral health issues with employers, teachers, doctors as well as family members.STAFFING STRESSESIn Wyoming, Laramie County Sheriff Brian Kozak said staffing shortages and turnover rates have been challenging his agency and other law enforcement departments across the country. That takes a toll on existing personnel's morale and mental health if they are working short-handed with mandatory overtime shifts.\"The pressures of the job from working so many hours are catching up to them,\" said Kozak.Police agencies across the country have been beset by officer shortages and high numbers of retirements with an aging workforce and stresses of the job.Kozak was elected sheriff in 2022 and was previously police chief in Cheyenne. He said when he became sheriff there were 70 openings. Now, that number is down to 20 with a staff of 220.Like other police agencies, Kozak said his department is looking to grow a peer support system to help patrol and corrections officers who deal with violence against and abuse of children, suicide attempts and those suffering from chronic mental illness.\"Just a few weeks ago, we had a deputy who was stabbed,\" the Wyoming sheriff said.Kozak said his agency works with a psychiatrist who specializes in working with law enforcement and is part of required debriefing sessions after officer-involved shootings and other traumatic calls.The Laramie County Sheriff's Office keeps employees' visits to counselors and therapists anonymous.The agency currently has eight staff members and officers as part of the peer support efforts that also include the county fire department.\"We're looking to expand that,\" Kozak said.NEW CULTURESA number of departments are seeing more officers able to reach out on the mental health front thanks to employee assistance programs that went and have stayed more virtual during the pandemic.That has helped officers with privacy concerns and the ability to get appointments with counselors who might be more available online.\"It's all about affecting a new culture within an organization that it is OK to say you are not ok,\" Rainey said.In Wisconsin, the Eau Claire Community Foundation launched a new effort in April raising money funds from businesses and the public to reimburse local law enforcement officers and staff with costs associated with seeking mental health help.\"The fund was recently established to reimburse local law enforcement personnel for mental health expenses not covered by their health insurance; grants will be paid directly to the Eau Claire County Sheriff's Department (since we can't make grants to individuals) and applied to their requests for reimbursement,\" said Rebecca White Body, program coordinator for the Wisconsin effort.Kozak said a key to those efforts is finding counselors and programs that officers and staff will trust.'FREQUENT REMINDERS'That can be a challenge with some old school cops.Capt. John Bollinger, administrative commander for the Talbot County Sheriff's Office on Maryland's Eastern Shore, said there needs to be \"frequent reminders that seeking help is not a sign of weakness.\" \"I am old school, 43 years on the job, so this was difficult for me to learn, but being in a command position changes your perspective when looking out for the welfare of your people,\" he said.Bollinger said negative views of police - are part of the challenging equation.Unfavorable views of law enforcement were magnified after the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer in 2020 and other high profile shootings, but also stem from institutional inequities in the broader criminal justice system that disfavor poor people and people of color.The U.S. prison population (including in local jails and those being held in custody before trials) totals more than 1.76 million people (the most of any country), according to the World Prison Brief research group.The U.S. has the highest per capita incarceration rate among industrialized countries and one of the highest rates in the world.Bollinger said unfavorable views of the police (whether they come from politicians, the news media or general public) take a toll on officers' morale and wellness.\"Too many citizens nationwide believe police officers are generally bad people,\" Bollinger said, pointing to news stories that emphasize the \"bad actions of a few police officers.\" Rainey agrees and sees its impact on officers.\"It's challenging to put on a police uniform and feel or just assume there is just disdain for you just as a result of your profession,\" he said.\"Individuals know in their own hearts that the great majority of police get involved because they want to help people.\" \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nNew York City Police Department officers attending a funeral of a fellow officer.

That sent me down the road of advocacy.\" \"My children didn't have the opportunity to have their rights and needs met,\" said Spicknall. \"We need to make sure that any victim that is out there, that their needs are met while they are going through the judicial process.\" The CASA, or Court Appointed Social Advocate, program provides trained volunteers to act as advocates on behalf of the needs of children currently under the protection of the courts.These advocates are appointed by judges overseeing cases involving charges of child abuse or neglect.One of the earliest CASA supporters in Caroline County was retired Circuit Court Judge J. Owen Wise.\"Let's just say I transported the national idea to Caroline County,\" he said. \"After I retired as (a) judge I said 'we need this here.' The idea was started by a judge in Washington State.\" Wise said that he saw a need for the program from the bench. For him, all you had to do was ask one simple question - how are you doing?\"You have a kid under the court's supervision and you ask, 'What do you need?' I will never forget one kid was shocked that I asked him,\" he said.\"He said he just wanted to see his sister.They were our charges. They were our wards. I wanted to make sure that every kid had the best that we have to offer.\" Wise credited the workers at CASA, who do all the day to day work of advocacy for the program's decades-long legacy in Caroline County.According to those in attendance Thursday night, advocacy can come in lots of different forms.\"We had a young intern come into my shop. He is part of one of the advocacy groups from around here, said Jason Lee, owner of Jason's Computers in Easton.\"He wanted an internship in technology and he really couldn't get an opportunity anywhere else. So we brought him in. He turned out to be one of the best interns we have ever had. He is a great young man from a broken home. It is not his fault.\" Organizers set an ambitious fundraising goal for the anniversary event, attempting to bring in $20,000 to celebrate 20 years. Each attendee paid $150 for admission.\"This year we are celebrating 20 years of child advocacy here in Caroline County,\" said Amy Horne, executive director of CASA of Caroline.\"We have served over 100 children in the last 20 years.We have trained more than 75 volunteers to advocate on behalf of abused and neglected children. This is kicking off our twenty for twenty campaign that we are going to carry through the holiday giving season.\" \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/TIMES RECORD\n \nFrom left, Hon.

Duda, 25, was charged with 46 counts of possession of child pornography.Duda is currently being held without bond at the Caroline County Detention Center.In January, the Caroline County Sheriff's Office Criminal Investigations Division began an investigation into the possession of child sexual abuse material through a internet platform that had been occurring in Denton. The investigation led to the identification of Duda.The Caroline County Sheriff's Office, with the assistance of the Maryland State Police and Homeland Security investigations, served a search warrant at Duda's residence.The Maryland State Police Computer Crimes Unit coordinates the Maryland Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.This is a combined law enforcement effort involving police departments across Maryland that is made possible in part due to grant funds provided by the Governor's Office of Crime Prevention, Youth and Victim Services and by a federal grant from the U.S. Department of Justice.Task Force investigators focus on identifying those involved in child pornography via the internet and other related crimes that victimize children. \n \n Caption: Austyn Duda \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

For drivers 21 and older, fatal crashes rose 8% and deaths rose 11%.The report from the Governors Highway Safety Association acknowledges that young people are driving less than they were 20 years ago, but highlights several other reasons for the improvement, while offering recommendations for building on them.State programs that phase in driving privileges were at the top ofthe list. These programs, called graduated drivers license laws, often restrict or ban certain activities, such as driving at night or with peers, for teens. The GHSA suggests strengthening those programs and even expanding them to cover drivers 18 to 20 years old, like Maryland and New Jersey do.Other recommendations include bolstering adult and parent participation in their child's driving education, more peer-to-peer education programs and making driver training accessible to all.\"Young drivers are the riskiest age group on the road, and the reasons are straightforward- immaturity and inexperience,\" said Pam Shadel Fischer, author ofthe GHSA report. \"Many young drivers simply don't have the behind-the-wheel experience to recognize risk and take the appropriate corrective action to prevent a crash.\"According to the National HighwayTraffic Safety Commission, overall traffic fatalities dropped 3.3% in the first halfofthe year compared with the prior-year period and have now fallen in five straight quarters after a pandemic surge. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Juveniles 7 and older could be. If they committed a serious crime, it was up to the local state's attorney if they were tried as an adult. Those cases most of the time involved older juveniles, 13 and above, for things like murder, rape and robbery.Less serious crimes went to Juvenile Court if Juvenile Services and the state's attorney agreed. Juveniles found guilty or delinquent in Juvenile Circuit Court could receive sentences from probation, home detention, detention in a juvenile facility and other things like community service and counseling.If there were any damages or restitution the court could require the parents to pay that or face jail time themselves.Really only the serious crimes and repeat offenders saw the inside of a court room, most of the time the juvenile was seen by a juvenile services officer and were counseled and warned not to commit any further acts or they could face a court hearing.Well, the wisdom of the Annapolis lawmakers has blown all of that to hell. The age now for a juvenile to \"not be charged with any crime is under 10 years old.\" Furthermore, any juvenile under the age of 13 cannot be charged with a crime also unless it is a crime of violence.That means crimes like theft, car theft, burglary, vandalism, arson, drug dealing, having a handgun or other deadly weapon, trespassing, disorderly conduct, failure to obey a police officer, and even crimes that are a non-violent felony, and the list goes on and on.If you can think of a crime, and it is not a crime of violence then they cannot be charged period.This also includes simple assault since the lawmakers do not think that is even a crime of violence. The police will just turn the juvenile over to the parents, and there are no consequences for their criminal behavior. If your property is lost, damaged or destroyed you will have to sue their parents since there will now be no court hearing for the parents to be ordered to give you restitution.This will make you a victim a second time, cost you money and make your insurance go up if you have coverage on the property stolen or damaged. The very worst case is where a juvenile under the age of 10 murders or kills someone, and they cannot be charged.These new laws are already seeing crime out of control within just a few weeks that it has been law. I am aware of a juvenile in Dorchester County that stole 11 motor vehicles and was released without charges. Another with a loaded hand gun released without charges. In Wicomico County, a teacher was assaulted by a 12-yearold at school and since it was simple assault the juvenile was not charged.There will be more and more horror stories in the weeks and months ahead. What we are seeing is that gangs and adult criminals are recruiting these juveniles to do crimes on their behalf and training them not to say anything because nothing can be done to them. They will be used to help with drug dealing, theft rings and even carrying the guns and drugs of the adult criminals because nothing will happen to them if they are caught. They may even put them up to doing murders.Part of the new law also is that the police cannot question any juvenile under the age of 18 anymore without an attorney being present there for them. The juvenile's parents cannot waive that right either, so they cannot make their child talk to or help the police.Even if they tell the police who they were carrying the drugs or guns for it may not be able to be used in court against the adult if the juvenile did not have an attorney present there for them.What is happening is that we are now raising children to be \"career criminals\" because they will learn that nothing will happen to them and even into their adulthood and that is when they will most likely run into the criminal justice system because that will be all that they know and it will be too late for them.These new laws have tied the hands of your police officers into doing nothing for you but giving you the bad news that nothing can be done. The politician that introduced this law and got it passed has stated that the police can still do something the police can do a referral to Social Services to get the juvenile counseling. That is right, if a 9-year-old commits murder they get counseling.You may ask what can be done about this.Well, we all must make Annapolis reverse what it has done and see that we are causing our children to grow up without any morals.Call, write or email your local state delegates or senators. Talk to your local city councils and county councils and let them know that you are upset about these new laws and most of all support your police, deputies and troopers. Talk to your friends and family and get them involved also.Many of these lawmakers in Annapolis are already beginning to hear and feel what they did is wrong. They also are hearing from almost all the local state's attorneys and your law enforcement leaders that these changes are wrong and have and will increase crime and that children will be used by criminals.The sad part is the next legislative session is not until January 2024; therefore, this might not be undone until the middle of next year.The Fraternal Order of Police, Maryland State Lodge, and many of the nearly 80 local F.O.P. lodges across the state of Maryland are fighting many of these stupid laws and rules that have been imposed upon our citizens and our law enforcement by those in Annapolis.We hope you will support us in this fight because we care about it and you. Contact your local FOP Lodge and offer your support. Your voice counts and should be heard and now is the time to speak up because the world is going insane, and we must stop it if we can.I never thought that we would see this on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, but it has come here now and found us and now is not the time to be silent. I hope that we can count on your help to change this because we need it, and it's only going to get worse if we do nothing.Thomas R. Hurley is the local lodge president of the Fraternal Order of Police, Cambridge-Dorchester Lodge No. 27. He is a retired sergeant from the Cambridge Police Department. \n \n Caption: Thomas R.

Around 3 p.m., everything changed.Numerous officers from the Cambridge Police Department responded to the area of Rigby Avenue and Fairmount Avenue for a report of shots fired around 3:05 p.m. Police spread out, canvassing the area nearby for any witnesses.Minutes later, officers found the body of20 year-old Kevin Raeford laying in a wooded area near the 600 block of Edgewood Avenue. Police officers would later testify that Raeford's body was covered by a blanket.About 20 minutes after police were dispatched, Raeford was pronounced dead by medics. A medical examiner ruled his death a homicide by gunshot wound.Only one person is responsible for Raeford's death, and it wasn't a random shooter - it was Raeford's cousin, Geett Cornish, said Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard, pointing toward Cornish across the courtroom at the outset of his trial Tuesday.Cornish, 31, of Cambridge, faces first-and second-degree murder, assault, reckless endangerment and handgun charges in connection to the shooting that left Raeford dead.Family members who were present that day would be called to testify against Cornish, sharing emotions they'd struggled with for the past year, Leonard said. The family would provide the 'who' of the case, while others, including law enforcement, would fill in the 'what' and the 'where' of the shooting.But to Baltimore-based defense attorney Brad MacFee, testimony from three other civilian witnesses, along with Raeford's affiliation with a local gang, would be key for the jurors deciding the case.In his opening statement, MacFee asserted that Cambridge has a gang problem - a \"significant, substantial\" one. Raeford was a member of a more prominent local gang, and gangs and violence go together like peanut butter and jelly, he said.Two of MacFee's three three highlighted witnesses were possibly affiliated with gangs, and all three had varying motives to lie about what happened that day, including concerns about gang reprisal and fear of going back to jail, he said.\"My client's fate relies on whether or not you believe these three guys. That's it,\" he said.By lunchtime Tuesday, five witnesses had testified, including Raeford's mother, his girlfriend and three Cambridge Police officers.Testimony from police established the discovery of two separate crime scenes. The first, located at Fairmount Avenue and Rigby Avenue, was where officers found spent casings and blood spatter.The second scene, the wooded area near Edgewood Avenue, was where Raeford's body was found.MacFee asked three of the five witnesses about gang violence in the city, echoing his assertions from the opening statements.Testimony from a Maryland State Police crime scene technician, a ballistics expert and a medical examiner were expected Tuesday afternoon.Additional witnesses are expected to testify Wednesday and Thursday. A verdict is anticipated Friday. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY MIKE DETMER Crime scene tape blocked off the portion of Edgewood Avenue in Cambridge where a shooting victim was found by police responding to reports of gunshots on Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2022.\n \nGEETT CORNISH \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said, 'Is that my vehicle on fire?'\" said Anthony Wilson, a member of the lodge, who stood across the street as firefighters extinguished dwindling embers. (Some members) ran around here and saw the smoke and said there was a fire Then all of us came out and came over here.\" \"(There were) no injuries. Nothing but the dog. Everybody else was gone, except for the guy upstairs. We kicked the door pretty hard, and he finally came out, luckily. Everyone else was out after that, and it was just a matter of time waiting for the fire company.\"Dispatchers alerted local fire departments about the blaze at 5:46 p.m. About 60 first responders reported to the scene, according to emergency officials at the scene.An official from the St. Michaels Volunteer Fire Department, who was on the scene, confirmed that there were no injuries reported in the incident and that the fire was contained to a single structure, located at 21 South West St. in Easton.Due to the structure's age, he said, safeguards had not been included in its construction, making the duplex susceptible to the quick-spreading fire.Neighbors who gathered at the scene reported that the duplex, which consists of an upstairs and a downstairs unit, had been engulfed in flames at one point in the evening, with fire visible from both upstairs and downstairs windows.Firefighters on the scene included the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, the Oxford Fire Company, the Trappe Volunteer Fire Company, the St. Michaels Fire Department and the Cordova Volunteer Fire Company. EMS and law enforcement personnel were on site to assist.As firefighters began to extinguish the last remaining flames shortly before 7 p.m., a fire marshal arrived to begin conducting an investigation into the fire's cause. Findings from this investigation will be released at a later date.A GoFundMe has been established to benefit a resident of one of the two affected units.

These men and women are the backbone of our community, the least we could do is contribute to a facility that will help train them and give them the resources they need to be as prepared as possible for situations that come their way while protecting us.\"Located at 9095 Mistletoe Drive, the training campus will serve Talbot County fire departments, emergency service personnel, law enforcement and paramedics for specialized education and certification. Currently, volunteer firefighters on the Mid-Shore have two options for training facilities - Princess Anne in Somerset County or Centreville in Queen Anne's County.Components of the project include a 3,500-square-foot public safety building for first responder training, a 3,600-square-foot classroom training and storage building, and a 1,500-square-foot concrete pad for car fire, extrica-tion/stabilization and traffic safety training.Training for fire departments will include firefighting skills, rescue and motor-vehicle fire/extraction.

The fire had also penetrated the roof and partially collapsed the roof on the front left side.It took over 30 minutes to control the fire with a tanker task force.Through investigation, officials determined that the fire originated in a living room on the left front side of the home. The room reached a flashover - a thermally-driven event in which all combustible surfaces exposed to thermal radiation in an enclosed space rapidly and simultaneously ignite, according to the U.S. Fire Administration.The living room was a complete burn with a partial structural collapse and roof collapse, and all combustible materials in the room were a complete burn, according to charging documents. The investigation also revealed there were no other ignition sources available in the area of origin other than human behavior.The fire was identified as an act of human intervention with an open flame, classifying the cause of fire as incendiary.Rider's reckless conduct in igniting the house on fire \"clearly\" put emergency services personnel, specifically firefighters, in danger as they suppressed the fire, according to court papers.Rider was arrested in February and released on a $20,000 unsecured bond. In April, Rider entered a plea ofnot criminally responsible by reason ofinsan-ity, according to documents filed in court. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nA home in Easton was severely damaged following a fire late Thursday, Nov. 24, 2022. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When I came back it was all on fire.\" According to the fire marshal, there were no injuries or fatalities reported in the blaze, but all of the residents' belongings were lost.Dorsey's beloved terrier, Peanut, has been missing since the event. She said she thought about looking for the remains in the charred rubble, but she is pretty sure there is nothing left.The fire, which broke out at 21 South West Street in Easton shortly after 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, drew the attention of passersby, who alerted emergency officials to the blaze.\"It was some of them from the American Legion (which is next door) that were sitting there playing cards. They looked out the window,\" Dorsey said.The fire marshal estimates that $50,000 worth of damage was done to the building.They could not determine the smoke alarm status, and there was no sprinkler action.\"The building consisted of two apartments with the fire originating in the kitchen area of the downstairs apartment,\" the fire marshal wrote in a report about the incident.\"The families in both apartments were displaced due to the fire.\" Investigations into the preliminary cause of the blaze are still ongoing.Dorsey said her next step is to find a new place to live.She said she is being taken care of and has a place to sleep in the meantime.\"If everybody could say a prayer and thanks to everybody.This is different than yesterday when it happened.It was chaotic,\" Dorsey said.60 emergency personnel responded to the fire, according to the fire marshal's report, representing five volunteer fire departments, along with law enforcement and EMS personnel.Dorsey said in the aftermath of the event, she leans on gratitude that no one was hurt. She is also grateful she had renter's insurance.\"I've got to wait for the insurance adjuster to call me.They want to come and take pictures,\" she said.A GoFundMe has been established by Dorsey's grandson, De'Andre Dorsey.In the description on the page, De'Andre wrote \"Unfortunately my grandma's house caught on fire today (10/25), and she lost everything. Her dog, Peanut, who was by her side for 14 years, clothes, family photos, important letters and documents, several sentimental items, and, unfortunately, her savings were in her house.\" He continued, \"My grandmother has given her heart to the community of Easton, and today she is in desperate need of yours.\" More details can be found at https://www.gofundme.com/f/7u4cy-my-grandma. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRA\n \nThe fire is said to have originated in the kitchen of the duplex's downstairs unit. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Additionally, the ban includes public areas at local businesses.The ordinance was discussed during the mayor and council's September work session, with it then being introduced during that month's council meeting.Acting upon Maryland voters' approval by referendum of the legalization of recreational marijuana for adults 21 or older, the Maryland General Assembly passed the accompanying Cannabis Reform Act earlier this year.\"Because I'm a nerd, I probably read that 100-page bill 20 or 30 times,\" Chesapeake Beach Mayor Patrick \"Irish\" Mahoney declared during the September work session.After familiarizing himself with the new law, Mahoney told the council he has testified before a state Senate committee and worked with other mayors through the Maryland Municipal League to find ways to comply without ceding total control.\"Just common sense,\" Councilwoman Valerie Beaudin said of the ordinance draft. \"It falls along the lines ofwhat's already in place\" for smoking and vaping tobacco and drinking alcohol.Councilman Charlie Fink said he wanted assurances the ordinance wouldn't result in people \"being stopped and frisked.\"\"If you have it in your pocket, that's fine,\"Todd Pounds, town attorney, stated.During that same work session the mayor and council discussed a second cannabis-related ordinance affecting the legal sale of the substance within the town limits.Mahoney noted that unlike many other states, Maryland lawmakers declined to consider a \"local opt out\" for state jurisdictions that don't wish to have cannabis sales within their confines.\"You're trying to create a wholesome environment,\" Mahoney said of a prohibition on cannabis sales.The mayor added that the way the state is planning to tax the newly legalized product and distribute receipts to jurisdictions would mean the town would receive \"basically nothing.\"A public hearing on the latter ordinance proposal did not happen at the October meeting.When asked late last week why there was no hearing for the other proposed ordinance, Mahoney told Southern Maryland News that he learned at a Maryland Municipal League meeting recently that the state legislature is planning to revisit the law next session to clear up some of its ambiguous aspects. \n \n Caption: TOWN OF CHESAPEAKE BEACH PHOTO\n \nPatrick \"Irish\" Mahoney is the mayor of Chesapeake Beach. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Thompkins began striking the woman with his fists, then brandished a knife to stab her neck.The woman ran from her vehicle and collapsed in the front yard of a nearby house. Thompkins cradled her while holding the knife to his own throat, Franklin said.A witness attempted to help the victim but Thompkins threatened them, pointing the knife at them and yelling for them to get back.Multiple law enforcement agencies, including the Caroline County Sheriff's Office, Maryland State Police and Maryland Natural Resources Police, responded to the stabbing.Franklin said Thompkins punctured his own neck with a knife while running to the woods, evading officers.After 15 minutes and the use of multiple non-lethal methods, including a taser, to diffuse the situation, a state trooper was able to knock the knife out of Thompkins' hand to detain him, police said.Both Thompkins and the woman were flown to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore for treatment of their injuries.Following his arrest, a judge found Thompkins incompetent to stand trial in April 2022.He was committed to the Maryland Department of Health until August of this year, then transferred back to a local detention center upon being found competent, according to court filings.In court Monday, Franklin said he will recommend a 30-year sentence with all but 15 years of active incarceration suspended, followed by five years of supervised probation and special mental health conditions.State sentencing guidelines recommend five to 10 years, said Jesse Hicks, Thompkins' attorney. The plea is not binding, meaning a judge has the ability to impose a higher or lower sentence than what is recommended.Sentencing will be deferred until Feb. 1, 2024. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY MIKE DETMER\n \nPolice on scene in Preston for a reported stabbing Thursday, Feb. 17, 2022. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's a great little town.\" \"I'm going to stay and watch this thing grow, and continue to give excellent service to the citizens and the town,\" Trams said.\"We're very proud to have you, and you're doing a fantastic job,\" Town manager Tammy Kelledes said.Several town employees attended the ceremony. Paugh thanked them and said, \"I want to thank you guys for taking your time out of your busy Monday to join Lenox on his special day. It's been a long time coming.\" \"Even though it's been a short period of time in Greensboro, you definitely made an impact in the community,\" he told Trams.\"I'm always stopped and told about how well you're doing and how you interact with the community, and that's huge. And that's who you are. You're Mr. Community Policeman,\" Paugh said.\"You've done some amazing things, and you're worthy of the rank.\" Trams joined the Greensboro Police Department with Paugh seven months ago.Most of their law enforcement careers were spent with the Easton Police Department.Trams, 48, was a police officer in Easton for 22 years, completing his career there as a school resource officer at Easton Middle School.Paugh, 50, a 26-year veteran of the Easton Police Department, is leaving soon to join the Caroline County Sheriff's Office as commander of criminal investigations and a lieutenant, the same rank he attained with the EPD.In only seven months, Paugh said, \"We made a big impact.\" \"We completely redid all the cars - the technology in them.

Ketterman previously ordered Lopez to not have contact with any victims and to not enter or be found near several specific locations in St.Michaels.Lopez received about six months of credit for time already served in connection to the April charges. Following his release from jail, he will be placed on three years of supervised probation.Lopez will also be required to submit to a mental health evaluation and complete mental health and alcohol treatment. \n \n Caption: DIEGO ALBARADO LOPEZ \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

No motive for the fights was identified by law enforcement.The two schools have a long-standing athletic rivalry. Prior to Friday night, no incidents or similar altercations had occurred between the two recently.Fans were instructed to leave the stadium by school administrators and local law enforcement officers, while the respective coaching staff led their teams off the field.In an email statement Wednesday, Talbot County Public Schools said the safety of students and staff is always the highest priority.\"We are grateful for the support of local law enforcement, and the quick and decisive action taken by the Easton High administration in addressing the situation for the best interests of all concerned,\" said Debbie Gardner, TCPS' director of communications Easton High School's athletic director Kurisha Hoffman said in a text Saturday night that the schools agreed to rule the game a \"no contest,\" meaning it doesn't count for either team.Police said three arrests have been made so far, clarifying an earlier news release that said five juveniles were arrested.A 17-year-old Easton boy was charged with refusing to comply with a police order, obstructing and hindering, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.A 13-year-old Cambridge boy and a 15-year-old Trappe boy were both charged with assault and disorderly conduct.All three teens were charged by referral to the Department of Juvenile Services and released to their parents.Police said the arrests of two adults, a man and a woman, were still pending as of Wednesday afternoon.Two additional juvenile girls have been identified and also will be charged, police said.As of 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, police said one female connected to the altercations has yet to be identified as a juvenile or adult.Investigators and school resource officers, along with the Talbot and Dorchester counties' boards of education, will review videos in an attempt to identify other involved juveniles, who could possibly face criminal charges, police said.If anyone has information, they are requested to contact the Talbot County Sheriff's Office at 410-822-1020, by email at sheriff@talbotcountymd.gov, on Facebook at Talbot County Sheriff's Office or online at talbotsheriff.org.Star Democrat Sports Editor William Haufe contributed to this article. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Jury finds Tilghman man guilty of child sexual abuse\n\n November 3, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 3 | Section: News \n \n 732\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - After roughly five hours of deliberation Thursday, a Talbot County jury found a Tilghman man guilty on all but one count relating to the sexual abuse of a child earlier this year.The jury found Eric L. Werner guilty of 16 counts, including sexual abuse of a minor, third-and fourth-degree sex offenses, second-degree assault and displaying obscene matter to a minor.However, the jury did not convict Werner on one count of sexual abuse of a minor.The verdict comes after a four-day jury trial in Talbot County Circuit Court.The child's mother, whom the Star Democrat is not naming to protect the victim's privacy, expressed gratitude for the guilty verdict.\"Justice has been served today,\" she said in an email. \"We can't thank the Talbot County Sheriff's (Office), and the Talbot County State's Attorney's Office enough for their dedication to this case and the support that they've given my daughter and our family these past 8 months.\" She continued: \"I'd also like to express how important it is that parents, and guardians educate themselves and their children on the statistics and signs of sexual abuse and grooming. Empower your kids to speak up if someone is hurting them, being inappropriate with them, or making them feel uncomfortable. If your child discloses abuse to you, believe them, support them, and report the abuse to authorities or a mandatory reporter.\" \"What happened to my daughter was horrible, but it could have been a lot worse if she had not spoken up when she did.She will carry this trauma with her for the rest of her life, but we all hope that because she spoke up, it will help encourage another child to do the same and stop their abuse.\" Defense attorney Philip Cronan said he was disappointed in the verdict, but would see what comes next with sentencing, which is yet to be scheduled.Detectives from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office began investigating Werner, 61, in February after learning of multiple child sexual abuse incidents that occurred at a home in Tilghman that month.Police investigation revealed that Werner sexually assaulted a preteen girl through inappropriately touching her on three different occasions in February.Werner showed the child pornographic videos, which the child remembered in detail during the trial. Police testified to a specific adult website appearing in Werner's phone's search history.In closing arguments Thursday, Talbot County Deputy State's Attorney Chelsea Endzel highlighted the testimony and evidence presented during the trial as concrete proof that Werner established an inappropriate relationship with the child, grooming her, she said.Numerous text messages between the two, plus the child testifying to Werner initiating sexual conversations with her, further illustrated the inappropriate relationship, Endzel said.Later, Werner, asking the child to delete messages, indicated that he continued to coax the child into becoming comfortable with sexual contact, she added.Endzel also pointed to recordings of calls Werner made to his wife while in the county jail as additional corroboration for his guilt. During one call, Werner said the truth would get him \"into some trouble.\" And during another, he attempted to discredit her, telling his wife they needed to give a reason why she would lie, Endzel said.Countering the prosecution, Cronan acknowledged that the allegations against Werner would bother any juror, but questioned what the prosecution presented as facts.A point of contention between both attorneys Thursday morning was whether or not Werner had permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of the child - criteria that needed to be met to move forward with the sexual abuse of a minor charges.Though Talbot Circuit Judge Stephen H. Kehoe ruled that the prosecution had provided evidence demonstrating that Werner had temporary responsibility for the child during the incidents, Cronan still questioned if there was a change in responsibility between adults during his closing arguments.Cronan also questioned the consistency of the child's statements made to police compared to what she testified to on the witness stand, urging the jurors to find Werner not guilty if they only thought he \"probably\" or \"maybe\" touched the child inappropriately.In her final remarks to the jurors, Endzel said the child had no incentive to lie. She turned attention back to Werner, again highlighting his request for the child to delete text messages and pointing to the jail calls attempting to discredit her story.\"If that's not consciousness of guilt, I don't know what is,\" she said. \n \n Caption: ERIC WERNER \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Carey Deeley, Jr. sentenced Todd Holtzman, 57, to 15 years in prison and suspended all but eight years of active incarceration after he pleaded guilty to robbery.The case against Holtzman stemmed from his role in robbery reported shortly after 12:30 p.m. on Monday, April 17.Police said a man, later identified as Holtzman, entered the Bank of America from its rear entrance on Goldsborough Street and confronted a teller, demanding bills in certain denominations.The teller told police that the man put a black grocery bag under the sneeze guard at the counter and asked for money without dye packs or alarms, according to charging documents. The teller also told police that the man said he would not hurt her.After the teller gave the man the money, the man exited the bank from the same entrance on Goldsborough Street.The total amount stolen was $3,210, police said in charging documents.Holtzman will have to pay Bank of America the full stolen amount as restitution.Video surveillance reviewed later showed Holtzman discarding the hoodie and sunglasses in the area of 25 N. Harrison Street, police said.A K-9 team from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office tracked him to the area of the Walmart on Elliott Road near the bus stop, but did not find him.A Delmarva Community Transit bus driver told police they recalled picking up the man from Walmart about 45 minutes after the robbery and dropping him off in Cambridge 30 minutes later.In the same hearing in Talbot County Circuit Court, Holtzman also pleaded guilty to fourth-degree burglary in connection to an incident at Walgreens about a week before the bank robbery. He received a three-year sentence, all of which was suspended, according to court filings.Following his release from prison, Holtzman will be placed on five years of supervised probation. He is barred from entering the Bank of America and Walgreens. \n \n Caption: FILE PHOTO\n \nA Talbot County Sheriff's Office vehicle is on the scene of a bank robbery in downtown Easton.\n \nFILE PHOTO\n \nThe downtown location of the Bank of America is situated on the corner of Washington Street and Goldsborough Street.\n \nFILE PHOTO\n \nThe rear door of the Bank of America opens on to Goldsborough Street. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Police said McClain had an active Dorchester County District Court arrest warrant.Charges stem from an Oct. 3 incident where the Cambridge Police Department said officers responded to the 400 block of Caribbean Avenue around 1:40 a.m. regarding an armed robbery.Police said officers contacted the victim, who reported that after leaving their residence with a friend, another male subject came from the side of the residence, approaching the victim and knocking them to the ground.Police said the victim reported that the teen pulled out a handgun pointing and threatening to shoot them as he went through the victim's pockets, taking their wallet and vehicle keys. The victim then observed the friend he had met with, and the other male suspect get into the vehicle and leave the area.An investigation determined the suspect with the gun was a 17-year-old boy from Cambridge, police said. The teen was arrested and and charged as an adult.Police said that upon further investigation, McClain was identified as the \"friend\" of the victim.After being processed by CPD and having an initial appearance before a court commissioner, McClain was transported to the Dorchester County Department of Corrections on no bond. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There, police found 24-year-old Tyuane Johnson of Cambridge with a gunshot wound to the right side of his head.Over 30 spent shell casings were observed by police in various areas around the scene.Police attempted lifesaving measures while waiting for paramedics.Johnson was transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Dorchester, where he was pronounced dead.Autopsy results from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner ruled Johnson's death a homicide from a gunshot wound.According to Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard, police identified Savage in surveillance video of the shooting.L eonard said Savage fired a gun in the area, then fled toward a home on Greenwood Avenue.Savage was already prohibited from owning a firearm due to a previous conviction.During the shooting, Savage also sustained a gunshot wound to his left foot and left a trail of blood from the scene to Greenwood Avenue.In recommending the maximum penalty on the firearm charge, Leonard said Johnson's family was still not satisfied.In the months after the shooting, nearly a dozen men were arrested and charged in connection to Johnson's death and the chaotic scene that unfolded that night, including Savage.Charges against two of the men were eventually dismissed; others received time served sentences after pleading guilty to lesser charges. Three men were handed sentences ranging from 18 months to five years, to be served in state prisons.In September, Deondray Stanford, 23, of Cambridge, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for manslaughter, the most significant punishment in the case.But to the family, no plea would ever fill the hole left by Johnson's death, Leonard said.Defense attorney Andrea Jaskulsky agreed that Johnson's death was a tragedy, but asserted that Savage was the intended target of the fatal shooting. Other men charged in connection to the shooting were upset with Savage for not intimidating a witness in a different court case, she said.It was \"impossible\" to tell what was going on from the surveillance video, Jaskulsky added.Savage spoke briefly, saying that he was only walking out of his front door and didn't intend to hurt anyone.Both Savage and Jaskulsky asked the judge for consideration for a work-release program, which was opposed by Leonard and denied by Dean, though Dean said she would recommend work programs for him.Savage will receive credit for the 16 months already served in the county jail since his arrest last July.He will also be required to submit to mental health and substance abuse evaluations. \n \n Caption: FILE PHOTO \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Black was later transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center in Easton, where he was pronounced dead that evening.The medical examiner ruled that Black's death was an accident caused by a heart condition, with bipolar disorder as a contributing cause.Unanswered questions surrounding Black's death and excessive use of force spurred the litigation. The family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against multiple police officers, towns and the state medical examiner involved in the case in December 2020.No one was charged in connection to Black's death.In August 2022, the family and coalition reached a settlement that required police departments in Greensboro, Ridgely and Centreville to overhaul use of force policies and the enhancement of resources for police confronting mental health emergencies; officer training in de-escalation, intervention and implicit bias; hiring transparency; and public complaint reporting.The settlement also included a $5 million payment to Black's family from the police and municipal defendants.Black's death caused his family and the coalition to become deeply involved in Maryland's campaign for police reform and accountability.Efforts by the family and the Coalition led to the passage of Anton's Law in 2021, which makes police discipline records available to the community under Maryland's Public Information Act.Sonia Kumar, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Maryland, said the \"hardfought\" settlement is about ensuring the medical examiner is truthful about what happens when people, particularly Black people, are killed by police or corrections officials.\"We can't prevent such deaths if we aren't honest about what caused them, and this settlement is a crucial step towards that goal in future cases,\" she said in a statement. \"We hope this settlement will make a real, positive impact, but it is truly just the beginning of the reckoning needed to address decades of misrepresentations so we can bring justice to families still waiting for the government to tell the truth.\" \n \n Caption: ANTON BLACK \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Serving, protecting for 250 years - The Caroline County Sheriff's Office celebrates its sesquicentennial\n\n November 15, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 1A | Section: News \n \n 979\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - To mark the 250th anniversary of the Caroline County Sheriff's Office, a new badge has been struck, containing symbols of its history dating to colonial Maryland.But the badge itself is a symbol of the long line of sheriffs who have held the office since 1773, when Thomas Hughlett of Greensboro was appointed by the British governor after the county was formed from parts of Dorchester and Queen Anne's counties.Bookending the long blue line is Sheriff Donnie Baker, who, like Hughlett, is also a Greensboro native. He's the county's 77th sheriff.Caroline County Deputy Lt. Jacob Andrew is the unofficial historian of the sheriff's office. And because he's the fifth generation of the Andrew family to serve the office during the past century, he's well-qualified for the job.\"Jake was just teaching me something,\" Baker said. \"I didn't know that the first sheriff was buried up there (in Greensboro).\" According to Andrew's research, Hughlett was a plantation owner appointed to a one-year term by the governor to be in charge of weights and scales because he was deemed trustworthy.Ironically, the next year he became captain of the Caroline County Militia Fifth Company, which encompassed Greensboro, Goldsboro and Bridgetown during the American Revolution.Hughlett later became a judge. He is buried in a crypt in a tiny, privately-owned graveyard in a Greensboro subdivision, the site of the Hughlett family farm.During the Civil War, John Wilson Saulsbury served a two-year term from 1861 to 1863 and was required to swear allegiance to the Union.Andrew said Sheriff James Temple, who served from 1923 to 1926 \"was actually a pretty cool guy.\" A veteran of the Spanish-American War, Temple was known as the walking sheriff.\"He had the first Buick in Caroline County. He always told everybody that,\" Andrew said. However, \"he hated driving it.So, if he had to go serve a warrant on somebody, he'd walk from Denton to Ridgely, lock them up and walk them back.\" \"The original sheriff's office was pretty much a shed on the courthouse green, and it was very easy to break out of,\" Andrew said. The lynching on the green of Federalsburg blacksmith Marshall Price following accusations of murder in 1895 prompted the government to build a new jail across Gay Street on the Choptank River, where it stands today.In 1921, William Curtis Andrew, Jacob Andrew's great-great grandfather, became sheriff and served a two-year term. His son, William E. Andrew served from 1938 to 1946 and, following a four-year term by Saulsbury Sparks, served again from 1950 to 1961, dying of a heart attack in his office.William's son Louis C. Andrew served from 1961 to 1994, retiring when he was 70. His son, then-Deputy Charles Andrew, served as acting sheriff until Phil Brown was elected sheriff the following year.Back then, the sheriff and his family lived in the center section of what is now the Caroline County jail. Two wings were added to the large brick structure, but Charles Andrew remembers when the original section was home.\"I got to know a lot of inmates,\" he said.He recalls the night his \"mother had a fit\" when a naked woman was brought in by the state police.\"They had to come in the front door and walk down the hall which separated the living room and dining room directly back to that one-room office\" at the back of the house, he said.\"I would have been seven or eight\" years old, Charles Andrew said. \"So, she made my father go to the commissioners, and that's when they put stairs on the side of the building to come in the outside door.\" \"Back then, when my father started, he was only making $2,600 a year,\" he said. \"They had to supply their own vehicle. The only thing the county gave them was a radio that went into their own private car.\" That center section of the current jail is called the Andrew Building today.Until 1994, both the sheriff's office and jail were under the jurisdiction of the sheriff, according to Charles Andrew. When Brown became sheriff, the county Department of Corrections was formed as a separate agency, and Charles Andrew served as the superintendent for 13 years, after serving in the sheriff's office for 20 years.Charles's son Jacob, now the fifth generation to serve in the sheriff's office, serves the county with almost 50 fellow deputies. After serving in the Air Force, Jacob Andrew joined the sheriff's office and has been on the job for 19 years. \"I love it. I love my job,\" he said.The commemorative badge symbolizes not only his family's history of serving county citizens in the sheriff's office, but a long legacy of the office's commitment to public safety stretching back to the nation's founding.At the five points of the badge's star are a Revolutionary War soldier, the Caroline County Circuit Court building, the original courthouse before the renovations, the original sheriff's office on Gay Street, and the current office, completed in 2021 on Double Hills Road.\"One of the things that former Sheriff Randy Bounds wanted to do was have a wall of sheriff's (pictures),\" Baker said.\"So I told him that Jake is going to fulfill that dream of his.\" The sheriff's office is seeking memorabilia from the public for a future museum or showcase. If you have any artifacts, photos or clippings you'd like to share, contact Lt. Jacob Andrew at 410-479-4124 or jandrew@carolinemd.org. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nSheriff Donnie Baker commissioned this commemorative badge for the 250th anniversary of the Caroline County Sheriff's Office\n \nCOURTESY OF CCSO\n \nJoining current Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker, center, are former Sheriff Phil Brown, left, and Sheriff Randy Bounds.\n \nCOURTESY OF CCSO\n \nH.

    "content": "Republicans pledge to 'restore balance' with public safety agenda\n\n November 15, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Steph Quinn; Capital News Service | Page: 5 | Section: News \n \n 642\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS - Senate and House Republicans vowed Tuesday to redress what House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) called Maryland's \"soft on crime policies\" with a 2024 public safety agenda that would intensify punishment for adults accused of gun-related and violent crimes and reverse reforms to the youth legal system passed by the General Assembly in 2022.\"The crime we're seeing in our communities is not anecdotal, nor media manufactured,\" said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil and Caroline). \"It is real. The violence is real. And we are pleading with our Democrat colleagues to join us in making it their priority as well.\" The package would increase penalties for gun theft and violent firearms offenses, authorize law enforcement to search vehicles based on the smell of cannabis alone and limit eligibility for bail or reduced sentences for those charged with or convicted of violent crimes.One proposal would make theft of a firearm a felony - a measure Republicans have sponsored without success since 2018.Another would increase prison time and maximum fines for crimes committed with illegal firearms and would remove the \"drug dealer loophole\" whereby drug dealers receive a lighter sentence for possessing weapons than others committing similarly weighted offenses.A measure would eliminate reduced prison time for good behavior for those convicted of first-or second-degree murder, cap such reductions for other crimes of violence and prohibit bail for those accused of a crime of violence while facing pending violent crime charges.House and Senate Democratic leaders could not be reached to comment on the likelihood that the proposals in the package will clear Democratic majorities in both chambers.The youth justice proposal would require under-13 youth to appear before a juvenile court upon arrest for crimes involving firearms and broaden the juvenile court's jurisdiction to include youth on their third arrest for nonviolent crimes, including auto thefts. It would also allow police to interrogate youth with parental consent alone, rather than requiring that a young person first consult with an attorney.The proposal would allow law enforcement to skirt the Child in Need of Supervision process, which provides a pathway for police or citizens to enlist help from the Department of Juvenile Services in connecting youth of any age with services.Del. Jesse Pippy (R-Frederick) said current law, including the CINS process, has neither held \"offenders that happen to be juveniles\" accountable nor connected them with services.\"The argument we're hearing from on the street is (that) law enforcement doesn't know what to do with these kids,\" Pippy said.\"So they're not going anywhere.They're not getting any services. No one's talking with them. No one's following up with them.\" DJS data shows that most CINS cases end in referrals to services rather than in court, but also that law enforcement are using the process infrequently in much of the state.Though Pippy said he's open to programs to educate police officers on the CINS process, which dates to 1969 in Maryland law, he and others said that CINS is not sufficient.Buckel said youth involved in escalating and violent crimes \"need more than what theChild In Need of Supervision system can provide.\" Pointing to closures of DJS residential facilities in western Maryland, Buckel suggested committed placement in DJS residential facilities could give youth \"opportunities to succeed.\" \"They're not draconian prisons,\" he said. \"They're getting classes.They're getting education.\" But advocates of youth legal reform have pointed to research showing that youth incarceration increases the likelihood of recidivism and called for long-term investment in resource-starved communities.Senate Minority Whip Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll) stressed a need for balance in comments after the press conference, saying, \"I think we need to provide more accountability and more services that are truly effective.\" \n \n Caption: CAPITOL NEWS SERVICE\n \nMaryland Senate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey introduces the 2024 public safety agenda of the Joint Republican Caucus in Annapolis on Nov. 14. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dangerous minds - Israel-Hamas war, Musk comments, police surveillance spark new social media fights\n\n November 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; Apg National Enterprise Editor | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1895\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Holy Land war between Israel and Hamas is birthing increased police and government surveillance of social media, prompting calls for more Americans to report \"hate crimes\" and proposals to require all social media accounts to have public name verifications amid concerns about increases in antisemitism and terrorism threats.There are also pushes to deport some anti-war, pro-Palestinian foreign college students deemed supportive of U.S. designated terror groups and expel and ban Palestinian refugees from entering the country.The efforts are born out of security concerns stemming from U.S. support for Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza after the Oct. 7 terror attacks. But they are also sparking concerns about stunting or intimating dissent, privacy and other free speech protections.There is also a new social media battle over Twitter/X owner Elon Musk's support for a social media post that talked about anti-white sentiments among \"Jewish communities.\" A number of major media and technology advertisers, who also compete with social media platforms and some of Musk's technology ventures, have paused advertising on X. That includes Disney (which owns ABC and ESPN), Apple, Paramount Global (which owns CBS and Comedy, IBM, Comcast/NBC Universal (which owns NBC and MSNBC) and Warner Bros/Discovery (which owns CNN).Musk said he agreed with a post from a Twitter who said \"Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.\" \"You said the actual truth,\" Musk said in a reply Nov. 15, latter adding that his concurrence was geared toward progressive activist groups and the Anti-Defamation League.The Biden administration condemned Musk's statement Friday. \"We condemn this abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate in the strongest terms,\" the U.S. administration said in statement drawing parallels to the beliefs of the Robert Bowers, who faces the death penalty after the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh left 11 congregants dead.The ADL on Nov. 16 also criticized Musk. \"it is indisputably dangerous to use one's influence to validate and promote antisemitic theories, said ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblalt, who on Friday then praised Musk for his condemnation of pro-Palestinian and pro-Hamas phrases 'from the river to the sea' and 'decolonization.' Musk said Saturday some of the critics are dangerously using the episode to squelch free speech and that. he plans on suing progressive activists he claims inaccurately showed neo-Nazi and antisemitic posts next to Twitter/X advertisers' promotions.\"I am sticking to my principles. As for any fake advocacy groups who seek to suppress free speech, they should remember that karma is real,\" Musk said on his social media platform.EXPELLING FOREIGN COLLEGE STUDENTSThere is a GOP push to expel foreign college students deemed to be supporting Hamas, Hezbollah and other groups on the U.S. government's list of terrorist groups.A group of 21 GOP attorneys general - including Ashley Moody of Florida and Austin Knudsen of Montana - want the federal government to \"vigorously renew vetting of foreign students' and deport those deemed to have endorsed or provided \"material support to foreign terrorist organizations.\" \"It is possible that renewed vetting of foreign students already admitted to the United States may reveal activity that renders them ineligible to hold a student visa and liable to deportation,\" Knudsen, Moody and their cohorts wrote in a letter Nov. 8 to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the U.S.Department of Education.Free speech and civil liberties advocates say the reactions to anti-Israel war protests (some of which have seen antisemitic rhetoric) can bleed into censorship as well as quieting and punishing voices of dissent.\"Free speech means protecting speech you don't like. Sometimes it even means protecting speech you find abhorrent and hateful,\" said U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, after voting against censure measure aimed at U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, over her anti-Israel rhetoric and use of a pro-Hamas slogan.BANNING PALESTINIAN REFUGEESA group of congressional Republicans - including U.S. Reps. Andy Thomas, who represents the Eastern Shore, along with U.S. Reps. Ryan Zinke of Montana and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and U.S. Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, are also leading efforts to keep Palestinian refugees from the war out of the U.S. Zinke, Harris and Greene also wants to kick out Palestinians who entered the country on or after Oct. 1 in the aftermath of the Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks inside Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.They say said he does not trust the Biden administration or Palestinian authorities to adequately screen potential refugees.Critics say the proposal is xenophobic.Similar sentiments related to refugees and college students have been echoed by 2024 GOP presidential candidates such as former president Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has suspended pro-Palestinian students' groups in his home state deemed extremist and favored restrictions on public library and school curricula content deemed inappropriate or offensive.While conservatives press universities, who have sometimes aggressively banned right-wing voices from their campuses, to condemn and crackdown on pro-Palestinian student protesters, the American Civil Liberties Union wants them to uphold free speech principles.\"It is precisely in times of heightened crisis and fear that university leaders must remain steadfast in their commitment to free speech, open debate, and peaceful dissent on campus.These principles are the bedrock of academic freedom at all universities,\" the ACLU said in a statement.\"The First Amendment protects all people who live in this country, whether they're here as citizens, foreign nationals, or visitors,\" the civil liberties group said.ENCOURAGING MORE HATE CRIME REPORTINGDaines and a bipartisan senators including U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, have also recently written to FBI Director Christopher Wray and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security asking for more investigative and enforcement resources to be dedicated to addressing antisemitism.The Anti-Defamation League reports a 300% increase in anti-Jewish threats, vandalism and violence since the start of the war, which has seen more than 1,400 Israelis and more than 11,000 Gazans killed.In a separate letter, U.S. Sen Jon Tester, D-Montana, also said FBI and DHS efforts should also be focused on white supremacists echoing past and current Biden administration efforts to go after alt-right groups.The Biden White House, which has put a focus on going after right-wing groups since taking office in 2021, has also launched a new task force to go after \"Islamophobia\" during the war.On Tuesday, the FBI said it added Oregon to a nationwide effort aimed at encouraging getting more Americans to report \"hate incidents' ' with billboards posted in Eugene, Medford and Corvallis as well as digital signs at Portland International Airport.Similar hate crime billboards have been put up across the country, including last month in North Carolina, along with ads on public transit systems, social media platforms and local media outlets.Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI released new data showing there was a 7.3% increase in reported hate crimes in 2022 (11,634 cases versus 10,840) in 2021.There were more than 6,500 racially motivated incidents - 52% of them aimed at Blacks - and more than 2,000 cases related to religion - with 55% targeting Jews, according to DOJ.SOCIAL MEDIA SURVEILLANCE, FORCED VERIFICATIONSA state law in Montana backed by Knudsen and GOP Gov.Greg Gianforte banning Chinese-owned social media app TikTok is also one of the central fronts in efforts to restrict social media platforms and content.Montana lawmakers worry about TikTok's data security and ties to the Chinese government.The ban is being mirrored in other states.The Montana prohibition is being challenged by TikTok and free speech advocates in court.But there are also other efforts to increase government regulations and scrutiny and law enforcement surveillance of social media.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Nov. 13 that state police have ramped up social media surveillance and will reach out more to individuals and groups posting hate speech online.\"We're very focused on the data we're collecting from surveillance efforts. What's being said on social media platforms.And we have launched an effort to be able to counter some of the negativity. and reach out to people when we see hate speech being spoken about on online platforms,\" Hochul said. \"Our media analysis, our social media analysis unit, has ramped up its monitoring of sites to catch incitement to violence; direct threats to others.\" The New York governor said the rise in extremist and violent threats after the start of the war in the Middle East \"poses a clear and present danger.\" But the idea of more aggressive police surveillance of social media posts raises some concerns.Gerard Kassar, chairman of the New York Conservative Party, said police social media monitoring is potentially \"chilling to the core\".\"Law enforcement authorities can and should monitor legitimate terrorism suspects online, but spying on everyday citizens is unconstitutional and wrong,\" Kassar said.Republican presidential candidate and former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador Nikki Haley wants to require all social media accounts be verified by name thus eliminating anonymous online speech on major platforms.\"Every person on social media should be verified by their name,\" said Haley, who is increasingly being promoted as an establishment and neoconservative 2024 alternative to former president Donald Trump.\"First of all, it's a national security threat. When you do that, all of a sudden people have to stand by what they say. And it gets rid of the Russian bots, the Iranian bots and the Chinese bots. And then you're going to get some civility when people know their name is next to what they say, and they know their pastor and their family members are going to see it,\" Haley told Fox News.Haley also backs a TikTok ban pointing to the recent viral traffic of a letter criticizing Israel and the U.S. from Osama Bin Laden.Harris told Fox News Nov. 16 that Congress could soon take some actions related to TikTok and the issue will come down to speech versus national security, citing the platform's Chinese ownership.The verification push sparked a backlash from free speech advocates, particularly on the right who have already been upset over social media bans and content restrictions over coronavirus vaccines and challenges to the 2020 election results.They say it will eliminate anonymous dissent and speech.\"Nikki Haley is 'openly' pushing for the government to use private tech companies to censor speech. This is a flagrant violation of the Constitution and straight out of the Democrats' playbook.Any politician who thinks it's OK for the government to use the private sector as its censorship bureau shouldn't be allowed anywhere near the White House,\" said Vivek Ramaswamy, who has frequently sparred with Haley over TikTok and other issues. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nTwitter/X, Tesla and SpaceX's CEO Elon Musk gestures during an in-conversation event with Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in London, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2023.\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nRepublican presidential candidates former U.N.

    "content": "Juvenile crime, reform are top issues for Talbot County police\n\n November 22, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 5 | Section: News \n \n 615\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Talbot County is seeing increases in juvenile crime, along with upticks in petty thefts and some violent crimes, according to the county's top law enforcement officials.Updates on local crime trends from each law enforcement agency in the county dominated discussion at Talbot County's latest Police Accountability Board meeting on Tuesday, Nov. 14.Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble reported a 19% increase in calls for service and a 13% increase in reported crime handled by the sheriff's office, including some small increases in assaults and drug charges. Crimes relating to fraud of older residents are likely the biggest financial loss in the county, he added.Gamble identified juvenile crimes in schools as a particular issue for the sheriff's office, which has uniformed officers serving in most of the public schools.Recently implemented state juvenile justice reform laws have barred police from charging anyone under 13 with most crimes.Gamble said Easton High School and Easton Middle School are where police see most of the incidents involving children, and over 30% of this year's reported incidents involve children under 13.\"We have 12-year-olds that are punching other kids in the face time and time again in the schools, or assaulting other kids, and there's no services for them,\" he said.Police Accountability Board members acknowledged the concerns, asking what officers can do to better handle issues with youth under 13 and if police can work with the schools.Gamble said the school system doesn't have leverage to handle discipline other than resorting to suspensions.Looking forward, Gamble hopes to see movement within state leadership in Annapolis during the upcoming General Assembly session to push legislation to tackle issues with the juvenile reform laws.Outside of juvenile crime, those at the meeting discussed several recent local incidents.In Easton, two homicides occurred within town limits in the last few months - one on Blake Street in early August and a second at the Sidetracked Saloon in late September.Several thefts and robberies have also occurred in town, said Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey. Those include a series of burglaries at vape stores where individuals are seeking Delta-8 THC cartridges, a non-regulated and legal psychoactive substance with effects similar to recreational cannabis.Another issue of great concern to Easton residents is crime on the Rails to Trails pathways throughout town, Lowrey said, citing a serious assault on the trails in the summer.To alleviate those concerns, the town's police department is increasing patrols on the trails and issuing more citations, Lowrey said. Those efforts include repopulating the department's bike unit, which is down due to lower staffing levels.In St. Michaels, Police Chief Jeffrey Oswald didn't note any specific crime trends, though he did mention two car thefts, which are \"extremely unusual\" for the town, he said. The town's tourist season is coming to a close, which means St. Michaels will have a lower population and more shops closed up for the winter.The small St. Michaels Police Department is down a few officers, though two new officers are starting soon, Oswald said. The department was also able to secure higher starting salaries and increases for current officers.\"Things are looking up. It's just going to be a little while,\" he said.Oxford Police Chief Eric Kellner did not report any major issues, adding that Oxford is a \"very safe little town.\" The town's three-member police department was fully staffed until a few weeks ago, but Oxford's town commissioners recently agreed to increase the department to four full-time officers, Kellner said. The town is now looking to hire one additional officer. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nMembers of the Talbot County Police Accountability Board, seated to the right, listen to the county's top law enforcement officials during a Nov. 14 meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Com | Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 510\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - A Talbot County judge upheld felony charges against the Prince George's County man arrested in connection to an August shooting in Unionville.During a preliminary hearing Tuesday, Talbot District Court Judge Karen Ketterman determined there was sufficient probable cause to forward multiple felony charges against Stewart Orlando Ray to the county's circuit court.Ray, 37, was extradited from Washington, D.C. to Talbot County in late October on warrants charging him with attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment and firearm offenses related to the Aug. 6 shooting of a 39-year-old man.Deputies from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office responded to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton around 9 p.m. Aug. 6 for a report of a shooting victim.The man told police he was driving near Unionville when he noticed another car following him at a high rate of speed. The car, which the victim identified as belonging to Ray, passed him and pulled off to the side of the road near a stop sign, police said.As the victim passed Ray's vehicle, a man shot at him multiple times, striking both the victim and his car, the victim told police. The victim was struck in the hand and drove himself to the hospital for treatment, police said.The victim's girlfriend, who was previously with Ray, said Ray had previously made threats against the victim's life, a detective from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office said Tuesday.Police said Ray fled the area in his car, failed to stop for a stop sign at the intersection of Unionville Road and Bruffs Island Road, left the roadway and struck a parked vehicle, disabling his own car.In court, the detective testified that Ray's phone was plotting in the area of the shooting that night.Ray then fled on foot into the nearby woods, prompting a 24-hour manhunt beginning in the early morning hours. Police later learned that Ray's girlfriend picked him up in the area several hours later.The detective testified to Ray's girlfriend, telling police Ray admitted to the shooting and that Ray had a handgun with him when she picked him up.A U.S. Marshals task force located Ray in Alexandria, Virginia on Aug. 8. Police said Ray was shot when the task force attempted to apprehend him.He was taken to a local hospital with life-threatening injuries.A .40 caliber handgun was recovered in the car Ray was using in Alexandria, the detective said. While ballistics testing is still in progress, several .40 caliber casings were recovered from the shooting site in Talbot County.The detective also said Ray texted the victim's girlfriend, whom Ray has a daughter with, to tell his daughter that he was sorry and he loved her.Prosecutor Joyce Jones pointed to the threats and the victim saying a man parked and waited to shoot at him and his vehicle as substantial steps to attempt to murder the victim.Defense attorney Kisha Petticolas said it was \"curious\" that no one identified Ray as the man who shot at the victim, saying that without an identification, all other evidence was circumstantial.Ray will remain held without bond pending further court hearings. \n \n Caption: Ray \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wilson, 59, guilty of tampering with evidence connected to the man charged with murder in the shooting. She was given a one-year sentence, all of which was suspended, according to court documents.The charges against Wilson stemmed from her actions in the minutes following the fatal Aug. 7 shooting.Police responded to the area of 104 Blake Street around 7 p.m. that day for a report of a person who had been shot and was laying in the grass.Officers arriving on scene rendered aid to the man, later identified as 55-year-old Ty A. Brooks, until paramedics arrived. Brooks died from his injuries at the scene, police said.Police said earlier on Aug. 7, Brooks argued with individuals who were near and operating a Range Rover, which was parked in the 100 block of Blake Street.Brooks left the area and returned later, operating an ATV.Brooks confronted the same individuals with a shotgun, police said.Police said after the group exchanged words, a man seated in the driver's seat of the Range Rover fired shots through the front passenger seat window and struck Brooks' side, causing him to fall from the ATV.The man in the driver's seat was identified by police as Daseir Cornish, 22, of Denton. Cornish is charged with second-degree murder, assault, manslaughter and related charges in connection to Brooks' death.According to charging documents filed in Wilson's case, surveillance footage showed Cornish exiting the car after the shooting and dropping an object from his lap onto the sidewalk on Blake Street, police wrote.Six minutes later, the footage showed a woman, later identified as Wilson, emerging from the tree line between Blake Street and Glenwood Avenue. Wilson bent down to pick up an item on the sidewalk, which appeared to be the same item Cornish dropped, police said.During an interview with police, Wilson said she received a call from Cornish - her grandson - asking her to pick up the cell phone he dropped on Blake Street.The number Cornish called Wilson from was later identified as a number belonging to Raheem Green, 28, of Cambridge, police said. Green is charged with acting as an accessory after the fact of murder for allegedly helping Cornish flee from the scene and discard evidence.Wilson said she placed Cornish's phone in a bag on a bench behind a home on Glenwood Avenue.One of Cornish's friends picked up the phone, Wilson told police.In charging documents, police asserted Cornish's phone would have been evidence in the homicide investigation.The cases against Cornish and Green are still pending. Cornish is scheduled for a trial Feb. 26 to March 1. Green is set for a trial March 11 to March 15, according to online court records. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The child's mother said Chance was healthy and had no prior issues.The child's mother was not present in court Wednesday and did not wish to be there, Franklin said.\"This has been a nightmare for her,\" he said, adding that he didn't want the child's mother to relive the death of her son.Defense attorney Dana Boston agreed with the prosecution's recommended sentence, calling it and the plea agreement fair.\"Thirty-five years in prison for a 50-year-old man is not a slap on the wrist,\" he said.Pierce spoke briefly in court Wednesday, acknowledging the difficulty of the case and some guilt he held, but he ultimately denied criminal involvement in his son's death.\"I didn't murder my son,\" he said.As part of the plea agreement, Pierce is not allowed to contact the child's mother.When released from prison, Pierce will be placed on five years of supervised probation. \n \n Caption: SEAN CASEY PIERCE \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Henry, 27, guilty of two drug charges, handing down two 15-year sentences and suspending all but five years of each in a binding agreement. The two fiveyear terms will be served concurrently, according to court documents.Henry's release will be followed by three years of supervised probation.The charges against Henry stemmed from the Easton Police Department's investigation into a fatal overdose late last year.Police were dispatched to the Econo Lodge on Dec. 5, 2022, for an overdose victim.Officers began and continued resuscitation efforts until they were relieved by Talbot County paramedics.The victim was transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton, where he was later pronounced dead.Detectives with EPD's Criminal Investigations Division conducted the death investigation. After several months, Henry and Iyana Wilson, 27, were identified as the individuals who sold a cocaine and fentanyl mix to the victim, police said.Two cases involving alleged drug possession and distribution remain pending against Wilson.In September, Wilson entered an Alford plea to possession with intent to distribute narcotics in one case. She is set to be sentenced Dec. 15 in Talbot County Circuit Court.A second case charges Wilson with manufacturing narcotics, conspiring with Henry to manufacture drugs, possession of drug paraphernalia and obstructing justice.She is also alleged to have altered physical evidence relevant to a criminal proceeding and to have possessed contraband in a place of confinement by having narcotics inside her body while at the Easton Police Department, according to charging documents.The second case against Wilson is set for a status conference on Dec. 1. \n \n Caption: The Talbot County Circuit Court is located at 11 North Washington St., Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said securing a PROTECT coordinator has been a \"trying process.\"\"This has been going on for quite some time,\" Todd said. \"Salisbury hired their PROTECT coordinator a couple months ago.\"A Cambridge-South Dorchester High School graduate, Goodson was born and raised in Cambridge.After college, he served in the United States Army for eight years.Goodson served as a police officer in Howard County for four years after that, before getting hired as a special agent by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The jury could not come to an agreement on a reckless endangerment charge, resulting in a mistrial on that count.Thursday, Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard said the state had not yet made a decision on whether they will retry the reckless endangerment charge.The charges stemmed from a report made by two of Diaz-Santiago's family members that Santiago attempted to hit, choke and stab his stepfather, Jose Sierra, during an argument on Decoursey Bridge Road in Cambridge on May 6.Diaz-Santiago was originally charged with attempted first-and second-degree murder, as well.Leonard said it was a prosecutorial choice, based on the evidence in the case, to drop those charges before the trial.During opening statements of the trial, Leonard said that a family fishing expedition on May 6 ended in violence and bloodshed. She said Sierra was \"battered, bruised and in need of medical treatment,\" following the altercation.Worse than the physical injuries, Leonard said, are the long term effects Sierra is facing from the incident.Defense Attorney Michelle Moodispaw, from the Dorchester County Public Defender's Office, said that the state's case was based around the victim's claims.\"Because he said so,\" Moodispaw said in her opening statement, adding that law enforcement didn't talk with others in the area in which the fight took place.Moodispaw said that the case was not simple and straightforward, and said the jury would have just as many questions at the end of the trial as they did at the beginning of the trial.Moodispaw said Sierra was drinking that day, angry with Diaz-Santiago, and said Sierra hit Diaz-Santiago with a liquor bottle \"several times.\"According to police, following the incident, Sierra reported that Diaz-Santiago grabbed his throat, attempting to choke him, while on the fishing trip. Diaz-Santiago then allegedly attempted to hit Sierra in the head with a tire iron, but Sierra was able to block the hit, police said.The two men then got into their vehicle, with Sierra seated in the driver's seat and Diaz-Santiago in the backseat. According to charging documents, the victim told police that Diaz-Santiago put a knife to his throat and verbally threatened him.Sierra told police he exited the car and was followed by Diaz-Santiago, who then attempted to stab him in the upper chest area. Sierra was able to block the attack, but was cut on his left wrist, police said.The officer who took the report observed multiple signs of injury on Sierra, including bruise marks around his neck and shoulder, blood coming out of his right ear and bruises and cuts on his arms.Leonard said she could not give any comment on the trial due to pending litigation.As of Thursday afternoon, Diaz-Santiago is being held without bond. A status conference is set for Friday morning. \n \n Caption: A scene from the from the Dorchester County Circuit Court House \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Mark Warner of Virginia.\"We applaud the inspector general for moving quickly and encourage him to move forward to complete a careful and thorough review,\" Virginia's delegation said in a joint statement.The agency said it welcomes the review and pointed out that it had already released decision-making materials and a legal review of concerns raised by the director of the FBI.\"We carefully followed the requirements and process, and stand behind GSA's final site selection decision,\" an agency spokesperson said in a statement.The review comes after FBI Director Christopher Wray told staff in an internal message earlier this month that he was concerned about a \"potential conflict of interest\" in a GSA executive choosing a site owned by a previous employer.Wray said his objections were about the process rather than the site itself.GSA, which manages the government's real estate portfolio, denied any conflict.The agency said the site about 13 miles northeast of Washington was the cheapest one with the best access to public transit.Maryland and Virginia have long been vying to land the FBI's heasquarters.Maryland's leaders applauded the Greenbelt choice, saying was \"never about politics\" and the new facility would meet a \"dire, longstanding need.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Several items were seized from Labastida's home, including a loaded 9mm handgun, police said.Labastida is charged with conspiracy to escape, numerous counts of first-and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, firearm charges and malicious destruction of property over $1,000.Charges are still pending in Rockville for items seized from Labastida's residence, police said.The charges against Labastida stem from his alleged involvement with the patient's escape from the psychiatric facility.Officers from the Cambridge Police Department responded to the facility in the 5200 block of Woods Road just after 5:30 p.m. Aug. 1 for a shooting incident.Security officers on scene at the hospital told police that an unknown person in a black vehicle approached the building and shot several times into a glass window. The unknown person then kicked the broken window out, which allowed a hospital patient to escape with the unknown person in the black vehicle, police said.Police said no injuries were reported at the scene.Detectives from CPD's criminal investigation also responded to the scene and recovered several spent shell casings, police said.The patient who escaped was identified as Darrin Lee Jeter, 19, of Rockville.Police said Jeter had been committed to the hospital center for assault on law enforcement officers in Montgomery County.Detectives continued the investigation through contacting law enforcement in Montgomery County, where Jeter was later located.Jeter was charged with first-degree escape and is being held without bond. His case remains pending in Dorchester County Circuit Court.Labastida was ordered held without bond during an initial appearance Tuesday. A bail review is set for Wednesday in Glen Burnie District Court in Anne Arundel County. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Com | Page: 13 | Section: News \n \n 729\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - The Caroline County Problem-Solving Court recently was awarded more than $200,000 to continue its mission to help individuals who are in the criminal justice system to overcome their addictions, reunite with their families and make positive contributions to their communities.The grant, funded from the Federal Bureau of Justice Assistance through the Maryland Office of Problem-Solving Courts, funds a two-year pilot program that became effective Oct. 1.Caroline County Circuit Court Judge Heather Price explained the problem-solving court to the Caroline County Commissioners Oct. 10.Calling it \"a really amazing program to be a part of,\" Price also explained the purpose of the $206,138 grant.Problem-solving courts, sometimes called adult treatment or adult drug courts, use a team approach, calling on professionals in the community - the state's attorney, mental health professionals, parole and probation and corrections, law enforcement, among others - to help people who are already in the criminal justice system.Problem-solving courts are in 23 of 24 jurisdictions in Maryland.The crimes committed by those involved are mostly nonviolent and primarily driven by substance use disorders, Price said.\"If you have crime and an addiction, it affects first responders, it affects EMA (and) police, it affects the health department it affects the justice system, it affects corrections,\" the person's family and children in school, Price said. \"There's not an angle in this county that it doesn't affect, and most importantly, it affects the community as a whole.\"The team approach begins when the decision is made to accept a person in the problem-solving court, which then becomes a \"post-conviction, post-sentencing part of (their) probation,\" Price said.\"You have to successfully enroll in and complete problem-solving court, which is no easy task,\" she said. \"It takes at least a year, oftentimes longer, and it involves a multidisciplinary approach, so it's not just treatment for substance use disorder. It's required mental health treatment, and it's all these other factors.\" Four participants graduated in November 2022 and two in January 2023.\"I'm passionate about it because you can actually see when somebody gets it, and it's remarkable the impact it has on a community,\" she said. Seven participants currently are enrolled in the program.Commission Vice President Larry Porter said he's attended a graduation ceremony of those who successfully completed the program. \"I think it's a great program. I've seen it work,\" he said. Price encouraged the commissioners and interested people to attend the graduation ceremonies.Statistics supplied to the commissioners by Michelle Bethke, Problem-Solving Court Coordinator for the Caroline County Circuit Court, document the success of the program in Maryland.Adult Treatment Courts statewide demonstrated a \"9% reduction in rearrests over two years compared to individuals going through business-as-usual court processing,\" according to research commissioned by the Maryland Judiciary. Individuals spent 23 fewer days in jail. Two-thirds of ATCs showed improvements in rearrests over time.The Caroline County team is improving its performance, Bethke said. Compliance with best practices has increased from 60% to 89% during the past 18 months the team has revamped the program. \"We still have a lot on our to-do list to make more improvements,\" she said.\"It costs money to run the program,\" Price said. However, \"it saves money in the long run to the community without a question, and seeing people that go on and have jobs and reunite with families, mothers that haven't seen children in years, it's a really amazing program to be a part of.\"According to a December 2022 report issued by NPC Research to the Maryland Administrative Office of the Courts, the \"average statewide cost to administer an ATC was $27,134 per participant, and the largest spending category was substance use disorder treatment.\" Maryland saved an average of $14,352 per participant in reduced criminal justice and societal cost outcomes over two years.Price said Caroline County's PSC is one of four in the state that received the grant to implement a universal risk screening pilot program with high-risk, high-need individuals, and \"increase the diversity, expand the program, decrease the time of when a person is charged to when they are admitted into the program and, of course, connect individuals to community resources sooner,\" Bethke said.\"I think it's just great,\" Commissioner Frank Bartz said. \"I mean, you guys are being proactive, not reactive here, and (the program) is data-driven.\" \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nCaroline County Circuit Court Judge Heather Price explains the mission of the Problem Solv-ing Court to the Caroline County Commissioners Oct. 10. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He had no idea he was about to be killed \"execution-style,\" said Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard, who is prosecuting the case with Senior Assistant State's Attorney Ella Disharoon.\nWilliams, wearing a mask, approached Daniels with a gun, shooting him in the back. Then, he shot again, striking Daniels in the head twice before taking Daniels' belongings and leaving.\nAlthough a Cambridge resident on his way home that night found Daniels' body lying facedown on Pleasant Street within minutes of the shooting, and police and emergency medical services personnel performed CPR, Daniels was pronounced deceased at the scene.\nDaniels' death was ruled a homicide by multiple gunshot wounds, two of which were \"rapidly fatal,\" a state medical examiner testified Tuesday afternoon.\n\"He didn't stand a chance,\" Leonard said during her opening statement.\nHowever, Williams didn't count on surveillance cameras from local businesses capturing the shooting, she said.\nWilliams also didn't count on police arresting him while he was wearing the same backpack from the night of the shooting, or police finding Daniels' phone in his pocket, Leonard added.\nWilliams was arrested the next evening following a foot pursuit on Lincoln Terrace. After he attempted to flee, a Cambridge police officer fired, shooting Williams in the leg.\nBut to defense attorneys Michelle Moodispaw and Stephanie DeLang, evidence shown by prosecutors would not prove Williams guilty.\nVideo surveillance and forensics presented by prosecutors have limited value, Moodispaw said, urging the jury to consider evidence that wasn't being shown.\nThe only thing to be presented was \"maybes and possibilities,\" she said.\nBy the end of the day Tuesday, seven witnesses had testified, including Daniels' mother, police officers, crime scene technicians and the medical examiner.\nAdditional law enforcement witnesses and forensic analysts are expected to testify Wednesday. A verdict is anticipated Friday.\nThis week's trial is not the only pending case against Williams.\nWilliams is also accused in a second fatal shooting in Cambridge, which occurred roughly three hours after Daniels was shot.\nAround 10 p.m. Dec. 8, 2022, police responded to the 700 block of High Street for a second gunshot victim, who was identified as Lory Eugene Fields, 69, of Cambridge.\nFields was found lying in a yard with a gunshot wound to his head. He was declared deceased at the scene.\nWilliams is facing additional murder and robbery charges in connection to Fields' death.\nThough the shootings happened within hours of each other and all charges appear to be grouped together in Maryland Judiciary court records, Williams is set to stand for a second trial related to Fields' death in mid-January. \n \n Caption: FILE PHOTO\n\n Pleasant Street near the intersection with Race Street in Cambridge is the scene of the first fatal shooting that occurred Thursday evening, Dec. 8, 2022.\n\n FILE PHOTO\n\n Tire tracks line Pleasant Street in Cambridge where a fatal shooting occurred Thursday evening, Dec. 8, 2022. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Many of the children involved utilized their entire budget to purchase gifts for their families instead of themselves.\nFortunately, their kindness did not go unnoticed and was rewarded. The chaperoning officers found it in their hearts to give them a little extra so everyone left with a gift of their own.\nIn addition to the officers chipping in, there were a few shoppers passing by who also donated their own funds to the cause.\n\"This is a good place we live in,\" Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey said. \"I've seen these kids looking out for their families instead of themselves, our officers reaching into their own wallets to make sure no one is left out, and even just some local townspeople going out of their way to do the same. It is really moving, and I'm proud to see it all.\" After the shopping was completed, the group returned to the Elks Lodge to get wrapping.\nTape, wrapping paper, bags and scissors were all deployed simultaneously as the officers, and their companions took all the gifts and did their best to make everything look beautiful enough to go under the tree.\nOnce completed, the officers and children enjoyed pizza and snacks together, before wrapping up the day by playing a spirited soccer match on the lawn outside.\nIn all her years organizing the event, Henckel said she always sees familiar faces among the officers.\n\"You see a lot of returning officers and you know that's because they care. It's nice to see their eagerness to be here with the kids,\" she said in a news release. \"They really make a difference to these kids, and around our community.\"\nHenckel thanked the Elks Lodge for donating the space, the Easton Walmart for making the event possible and the three police departments for joining forces.\n\" To have their support over the years means more than you know,\" she said. \n \n Caption: GREG MUELLER/TOWN OF EASTON\n\n Officer Cordero Proctor of the Easton Police Department does some holiday shopping alongside his partner at Walmart in Easton for the Talbot Optimist's Shop with a Cop event. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Russell III handed down the prison term to Samuel Charles Hardeman, 55. His prison term will be followed by lifetime supervised release.\nHardeman had a previous federal conviction in a 2002 case in the Northern District of Georgia for use of a computer to entice a child to engage in sexual activity, for which he was sentenced to 174 months in prison.\nUpon his release from prison, Hardeman must continue to register as a sex offender in the places where he resides, where he is an employee and where he is a student, under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, per the judge's order.\nThe sentence was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek L. Barron, Acting Special Agent in Charge R. Joseph Rothrock of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Baltimore Field Office and Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble.\nAccording to the guilty plea, from Dec. 11, 2022, through Dec. 26, 2022, Hardeman engaged in conversations with an undercover law enforcement officer who purported to have a 10-year-old daughter.\nDuring the conversations, Hardeman expressed how he wanted to have sex with the 10-year-old, sent a video containing child pornography to the undercover officer and made plans to drive to New York, where the undercover officer purportedly lived, to have sex with the 10-year-old.\nHardeman communicated with the undercover officer by phone via video call, text and through the use of encrypted messaging platforms.\nThe Maryland U.S.\nAttorney's Office said the conversations occurred while Hardeman was on the sex offender registration for a previous federal sex offense conviction.\nDuring a call on Dec. 26, 2022, Hardeman expressed hesitation about traveling to New York to visit the undercover officer and her daughter. The officer did not hear from Hardeman after that time.\nOn March 14, 2023, a federal search warrant was executed at Hardeman's residence, where several electronic devices were seized.\nA forensic examination of one of the phones revealed the encrypted messaging account which Hardeman used to communicate with the undercover officer, a text message thread between Hardeman and the officer, photos sent to Hardeman by the officer at Hardeman's request, the photos and videos that Hardeman sent to the officer and dozens of images and videos depicting minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.\nForensic examinations of several other devices and Hardeman's cloud storage account recovered additional images of child sex abuse material, including bestiality.\nThis case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse.\nLed by the United States Attorney's Offices and the Criminal Division's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who sexually exploit children and to identify and rescue victims.\nFor more information about Project Safe Childhood, visit justice.gov/psc. For more information about Internet safety education, visit justice. gov/psc and click on the \"Resources\" tab on the left of the page.\nBarron commended the FBI and the Talbot County Sheriff 's Office for their work in the investigation.\nBarron thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Spencer Todd and Paul E. Budlow, who prosecuted the federal case. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The cause of the fire is still being investigated by the State Fire Marshal but does not appear to be arson-related.Fortunately, the Town has plenty of water capacity to serve the community in the coming months when demand is low during winter and early spring.\nNonetheless, with only a single, operable water treatment plant online, there is some potential of temporary domestic water service interruptions.\nPlease be assured that Town staff has quickly implemented precautionary and proactive measures to minimize any interruptions in water service to our community. To this end, we have implemented the following measures over the past several days: ¡ Hosted a meeting with Talbot County Emergency Services and other agencies to alert them of the issue.\n¡ Coordinated with Town engineers and water treatment equipment suppliers to review all treatment processes in the current operable water plant along with securing back-up equipment if a mechanical failure were to occur.\n¡ Worked with St. Michaels Fire Department to establish protocols for the use of alternative water sources if a major fire were to occur.\n¡ As lead time for replacement of pump and electronic equipment for the Marengo Station is many months out, the Town is coordinating efforts with our engineers in the development of a temporary water treatment system to be located at the Marengo site creating critical water system redundancy and capacity that will be needed in the coming months.\nEngineers have also started to order replacement equipment for the Marengo site.\n¡ Costs associated with this fire will be paid for by the Town's insurance carrier minimizing any use of local tax dollars.\nWith recent emergency planning efforts well underway, the Town is in a much better position than last week. Although there is no mandatory water conservation order at this time, we would appreciate any efforts from the community to voluntarily conserve water in the coming months.\nWe are optimistic this will be resolved without interruptions in water service. Please be rest-assured that the Town Commission and staff are working diligently to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.\nWe will keep the community informed with future Constant Contact communications and through updates to our website at www.stmichaelsmd.gov.\nIf you should have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact Town Administrator Rob Straebel at 410-745-9535. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF ST.

But that is not always easy in stressful and sometimes violent situations when emergency calls occur.\nHe sees merits in having counselors and social workers respond to some mental health calls and wellness checks that do not involve violence - with police sometimes in a support role.\nThat may help diffuse situations.\n\"They aren't the ones knocking on the door,\" said McDevitt, referring to programs in Florida, Wisconsin, Wyoming and other states.\n'PATCHWORK SYSTEM'\nAll U.S. states have some form of involuntary or civil commitment laws that allow for temporary or short-term placements in inpatient mental health settings, including hospitals, when a person shows serious signs of committing suicide or harming or killing others.\nThe landscape for those state laws is mixed with some states allowing for court-order holds and commitments related to substance abuse, according to a report by the Treatment Advocacy Center. five states - including Florida, California, New York, Wisconsin and Wyoming - allow for 72-hour holds.\nAnother seven states (such as Georgia and Texas) and the District of Columbia have 48-hour limits on the time someone can be involuntarily committed.\nEight states - including Maryland (30 hours), Delaware (24 hours) and Montana (the next business day) - have shorter time limits, according to TAC.\nSome state laws allow for family members to petition for commitments and there are situations where judges can impose holds related to substance abuse and self-harm.\nFor example, judges in Colorado can impose 180-days holds for substance abuse treatment.\n\"Our system is very patchwork,\" Dailey said.\nDailey said states need to look at how to better match mental health policies, including commitment laws, to the needs of patients. She said proper mental health treatment programs can take six months - not the 72-hour holds on the books in most states.\nDISINCENTIVES AND DIFFICULTIES\nThat varied and piecemeal approach isn't just related to varying state laws related to commitments and gun confiscation.\nMental health systems across the country are challenged by lack of inpatient facility capacity and a system where treatment, housing, employment and substance abuse services can be siloed.\n\"It's still really difficult to navigate the system,\" said Dailey, pointing to the lack of a central agency, information or support source for patients and their families.\nThat can leave individuals dealing with severe mental illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar and borderline personality disorders to navigate various bureaucracies while trying to overcome stigmas and fears of past and contemporary mistreatment of the \"mentally ill.\" \"Individuals have often had very bad experiences at inpatient or law enforcement settings,\" Dailey said.\nStigmas toward mental health continue including hospitalizations for patients worried about reactions from their families, friends and employers.\nThere are pushes in New York and some other states to allow for longer mandated hospitalizations and to make it easier for police and courts to involuntarily commit seriously mentally ill persons, including homeless people, after a series of high-profile assaults.\nSome bioethicists and mental health professionals argue that inpatient hospitalizations are not always the best treatment path for some patients.\nCivil libertarians worry expanding forced hospitalizations can lead to discriminatory treatment by courts and police of some classes of patients. There is plenty of history in the U.S. and other countries of political, religious and ethnic minorities as well as women being disproportionately \"put away\" by government authorities and mental health practitioners.\n\"Involuntary hospitalization is a serious deprivation of liberty that can be justified only in the narrow circumstance where there is mental illness and an imminent physical danger to the person to be committed or to others, evidenced by observed behavior, and where there is no less restrictive alternative. In such cases, strong procedural safeguards must be in place throughout to ensure that the due process rights of the individual are protected,\" said the New York Civil Liberties Union in response to state and local efforts to expand civil commitments.\nBut even if police and courts are more aggressive in pursuing forced hospitalizations, many states and regions lack the number of mental inpatient beds needed to accommodate such a push.\nPolice officers have to go through a number of legal and bureaucratic hoops to gain temporary and short-term holds.\n\"It'a big challenge,\" said Dailey, noting that officers can spend several hours going through the inpatient mental health process.\nSome states require specific staffing to transport an individual to a mental health hospital or another inpatient facility. And even then, police will find facilities completely full.\n\"It's much easier to bring them in and book them,\" she said.\nBY THE NUMBERS\nThe U.S. has seen a contemporary decline in the number of mental hospitals and institutionalized patients.\nIn 1955, when state mental asylums and short and long-term commitments were more common there were more than 500,000 beds nationally, according to the American Psychiatric Association.\nIn 1963, there were 800,000 mentally ill developmentally disabled persons kept in institutional settings - often at overcrowded and toxic mental hospitals, according to the Kennedy administration which pushed for systematic changes away from asylums.\nAs many as 1.5 million people were treated annually at those sanatoriums in the early 1960s.\nA study last year by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute Inc. showed there were still close to 471,500 patients at government-run, private and other mental hospitals in 1970.\nThat number stands at just 121,300 in 2020, the most recent data available.\nMoves toward de-institutionalization and U.S. health care business models focused away from inpatient settings have driven that trend.\nRED FLAG LAWS\nShootings in Maine in October that killed 18 people and injured 13 and at the University of Nevada Las Vegas Dec. 6 that killed three persons have sparked new looks at mental health approaches and red flag gun laws - especially after details of the New England killings by U.S. Army firearms instructor Robert Card emerged.\nTwenty-one states have so-called red flag laws on the books allowing for court and law enforcement to temporarily seize guns from individuals deemed likely to harm others or themselves.\nThose states include Nevada, Washington, Oregon, California, Florida, Maryland, Delaware, Illinois and New York, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, which supports increased gun control laws.\n\"Red flag laws are a tool law enforcement and others can use when somebody is clearly at high risk of doing something with a firearm, but they can't be arrested because no crime has been committed and they don't appear to need a mental health hold or qualify for one,\" said Amy Barnhorst, a psychiatrist at University of California, Davis, Health and a violence prevention expert in an analysis of the issue earlier this year.\nMaine's gun confiscation law requires an extra step of those states of having the individual question go through a mental health evaluation.\nMcDevitt said most of the time gun confiscations are done in response to concerns about potential suicide attempts and firearms are usually returned to their owners.\nIt can save some people from hurting themselves,\" said McDevitt, citing research showing for the laws can help reduce suicides.\nThere were 26,933 suicides committed with firearms in 2022 compared to with 19,592 homicides, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.\nSuicides by firearms made up 56.9% of all gun deaths and 54.4% of all suicides last year, according to CDC figures. McDevitt said owners often get guns back after anywhere between 30 days and six months depending on the state statute.\nPushes for additional red flags in other states face resistance from gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action worries red flag gun laws could be used by the government to take guns from critics and political opponents.\n'RARELY USED'\nDespite their increased advocacy, McDevitt said gun confiscation proceedings are rare.\n\"There aren't thousands and thousands of these things. They are pretty rarely used,\" he said.\nA 2022 analysis by the Associated Press said red flag laws have been little used due to lack of awareness and resistance from some sheriff 's offices and police departments to such policies on Second Amendment grounds.\nPart of that also stems from families being reluctant to broach the issue, McDevitt said.\n\"That's a very difficult conversation to have.\nMost people don't want to do that,\" he said. \n \n Caption: Bellevue Hospital in New York City is the oldest public hospital in the U.S. and is probably the country's most notable mental hospital via frequent references in movies and books as well as on television shows.\n\n Twenty-one U.S. states have implemented red flag laws that allow guns to be confiscated from individuals deemed mentally ill and a danger to themselves or others. Firearms account for the majority of suicides in the U.S. and more people take their own lives with guns than commit homicides with firearms. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was a most vivacious girl, always smiling.\nShe loved to give hugs and loved animals. She loved our cats and always asked about them whenever she saw us,\" Nancy, 67, rattled off, needing little time to gather her thoughts to describe Kyleigh when asked about her.\nHer 66-year-old husband, Tom, interjected, \"Nothing seemed to faze her. Kyleigh always seemed to be upbeat, like nothing was impossible.\" Nancy started to speak again, but paused for a few seconds before recalling the last time she saw and interacted with Kyleigh - on a morning maybe a week or so earlier.\nChaperoned by her grandmother, Kyleigh was waiting for the school bus to arrive and take her to Cecil Manor Elementary School.\nNancy, who lives three doors down from 317 Willow Drive, happened to be outside.\n\"It was right before school was out for Christmas break. She was telling me about all of her animals,\" Nancy said. (The list of beloved pets in Kyleigh's home included two dogs, a cat, three ferrets and two rats, according to a family friend.)\nWhen the school bus arrived, Kyleigh said her goodbyes - in a way that beautifully reflected her bubbly personality - and then she boarded.\n\"She said, 'I love you' and hugged her grandmom. Then she hugged me, too, and said, 'I love you',\" Nancy said, prompting Tom to marvel, \"I don't think she encountered anyone she didn't love.\" On Christmas morning, in stark and sobering contrast to the wonder and joy that the holiday holds for children, Kyleigh died in a swift-moving blaze that ripped through her family's two-story townhouse at 317 Willow Drive.\nSingerly Volunteer Fire Company of Elkton and other area volunteer fire companies rushed to that neighborhood, northeast of Elkton, at approximately 7:30 a.m. Monday after receiving a dispatch regarding a dwelling fire at 317 Willow Drive, reported Master Deputy State Fire Marshal Oliver J. Alkire, an agency detective and spokesman.\n\"Upon arrival, firefighters found the family standing outside their home, stating a young girl was still inside. Firefighters heroically entered the home and located the child. However, she was later pronounced deceased on the scene,\" Alkire said, before emphasizing on Wednesday, \"Investigators later learned that after family discovered the fire, they made several attempts to save Kyleigh during the fast-moving fire; however, they were unable to due to thick smoke and intense heat.\" The medical examiner attributed Kyleigh's death to \"thermal injuries and smoke inhalation,\" Alkire reported.\nThe spokesman updated, \"Deputy state fire marshals continue investigating the exact origin and cause (of the fire). While the fire remains under investigation, they have not recovered evidence that it was an intentionally set fire, nor do they believe or suspect that this was an intentionally set fire, and continue to explore all possible accidental causes.\" In addition to killing Kyleigh - despite heroic efforts by fire responders to rescue the girl - the blaze displaced 17 residents, including her five surviving family members, fire officials said.\nThe other 12 displaced residents lived in adjacent townhouses, fire officials added. Most of the pets at 317 Willow Drive, where Kyleigh lived, reportedly were lost in the blaze.\nThe fire displaced three adults and three children who lived at 319 Willow Drive, fire officials said. In addition, the fire displaced two adults and four children at 315 Willow Drive, fire officials added. The American Red Cross is assisting the 17 displaced residents, including Kyleigh's surviving relatives, the spokesman reported.\nNews of the fatal Christmas morning fire sparked an outpouring of community support for Kyleigh's survivors.\nAs Tom and Nancy - a retired couple that has owned and lived in their Willow Drive townhouse since 1993 - were speaking with the Cecil Whig on Wednesday afternoon, a woman pulled up in a sport utility vehicle and parked it.\nThe woman got out of the vehicle and purposefully walked over to a small patch of grass in front of the gutted remains of 317 Willow Drive, where a few people already had placed decorations and stuffed animals to show support, including at least one teddy bear. A strand of yellow \"Do Not Cross\" emergency scene tape was lying on the ground directly behind a teddy bear. Also nearby were two small, wooden crosses, one of which read, \"Grow in grace.\" There were three candles in tall, slim glasses - similar to ones that might be found inside a church - on the nearby sidewalk. Only one candle was burning, however, the purple one. The blue and orange candles had burned out. The woman who had arrived in the SUV unsuccessfully attempted to relight the other two candles amid a steady rain.\n\"I did not know Kyleigh and I do not know her family, but I just wanted to come here today,\" said the woman, a Rising Sun resident who identified herself only as Kathi.\nTeary-eyed, Kathi explained that she was experiencing sorrow after learning about the devastating blaze that killed Kyleigh and that she felt compelled to come to the place where it happened.\nShe placed a small teddy bear, one clad in a soldier uniform reminiscent of \"The Nutcracker,\" in the lap of a bigger teddy bear already on the ground in front of the burnt shell of a townhouse. The woman also left a snowman decoration.\nThe tragedy spurred Cecil County resident Theresa Retz into action, too.\nOn Tuesday, one day after the fatal fire, she started a GoFundMe page to benefit Kyleigh's surviving family, which does not have insurance, and she did so with the permission of Kyleigh's mother - Theresa Moats - according to Retz, who works with Moats at Terumo Medical Corporation in Elkton.\n\"We work together, but we are also good friends,\" Retz explained.\n\"I only met Kyleigh a couple of times. But I can say Kyleigh made everyone smile. Her personality brightened a room, and she was the life of the party.\" On Monday, a few hours after losing Kyleigh in the house fire, Moats reached out to Retz from an area hospital, where medical staff was observing her and the other surviving family members.\n\"I found out late that morning. She messaged me from a friend's Facebook account because her laptop had burned up along with everything else inside the house. She told me her house burned down and Kyleigh did not make it,\" Retz said, noting that she sensed Moats was emotionally discombobulated.\n\"She wanted to know how to get up with the (Terumo) supervisor to let the company know that her badge and scrubs burned in the fire.\nThat's how I knew her head was nowhere in the right place. I let her know that it's OK and don't worry about that right now.\" They communicated electronically with each other throughout the day, after Moats and the surviving family members had moved from the hospital to an area hotel that American Red Cross volunteers had arranged for their lodging, at least for the next few days, according to Retz.\nThe friends had their emotional first face-toface meeting on Tuesday, one day after the fire, when Retz went to the hotel serving as temporary lodging for Kyleigh's surviving family members.\n\"There was a lot of crying,\" Retz said.\nThat day, Retz set up the GoFundMe page to benefit Moats; her fiance, Kevin; Moats' 13-yearold son, Ethan; her 20-year-old son, Jordan; and Moats' mother - the grandmother whom Kyleigh hugged at the bus stop on that morning earlier this month, a heartwarming scene witnessed by neighbor Nancy Minor, who also was embraced by the girl before she departed.\n\"Anyone who ever interacted with Kyleigh would have a hard time forgetting her,\" Minor said, after recalling that scene at the bus stop.\nAs of Thursday afternoon, the GoFundMe page had generated $17,414 in donations for Kyleigh's surviving family members. Also helping with the donations collection is Beth Edwards.\nA section on the GoFundMe page reads, \"Theresa Moats and her family are wonderful people who have suffered a devastating loss on Christmas Day Funds will be used for Kyleigh's funeral, supporting the family, paying for their current hotel room, as well as helping to secure permanent housing. The family did not have insurance.\" \"People have been awesome.\nIn addition to (monetary) donations, there has been an avalanche of donated clothing,\" Retz said.\nThe list of items needed the most, aside from money, includes cell phones with chargers (T-Mobile network); restaurant gift cards; gasoline gift cards; Walmart and grocery store gift cards; and \"any type of special Christmas gift.\" When asked about Moats' emotional condition, Retz explained, \"She's holding up the best she can. She has to be strong, particularly for Ethan, who is now her youngest child.\" \n \n Caption: CARL HAMILTON/CECIL WHIG\n\n Teddy Bears and candles left by people in the community dot the ground in front of a townhouse at 317 Willow Drive near Elkton, where a blaze killed 10-year-old Kyleigh Nicole Treadway on Christmas morning.\n\n PHOTO COURTESY OF THERESA RETZ\n\n This photo shows 10-year-old Kyleigh Nicole Treadway, who died in a fire inside her Willow Drive townhouse near Elkton on Christmas morning.\n\n CECIL WHIG FILE PHOTO\n\n This photo shows the gutted remains of Willow Drive townhouses, after a Christmas morning blaze killed 10-year-old Kyleigh Nicole Treadway and displaced 17 residents, including her five surviving family members. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The company then called Cook's Electric LLC, a Dorchester County-based electrical contractor, who ensured power was restored and that all appliances were functioning.\nThe Maryland State Police Crash Team is leading the investigation. Once their investigation is complete, the team's findings will be submitted to the Caroline County State's Attorney's Office, which will decide whether charges will be filed in the case.\nThe cause of the crash remains under investigation. \n \n Caption: A Honda crashed into the front wall of a home on Main Street in Preston Sunday, Dec. 31. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Also taking the oath of office was Greensboro Police Sgt. Jake Smith. The ceremony and meet and greet preceded the town's first meeting of 2024.\nTrams, 48, has a 25-year career in law enforcement. He joined the GPD in March 2023. \"(Chief Paugh) did a lot of work to get us up to standards,\" Trams told attendees, adding he would continue that trend.\nTrams said he wants to fill out the department with three more officers. \"We want the best officers who can do the job that the town deserves,\" he said.\nSeveral of Trams' former colleagues from the Easton Police Department were on hand to applaud Trams' swearing-in, including Spencer, who was EPD police chief before retiring in Dec. 2022; Oxford Police Chief Eric Kellner, Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker; and former Greensboro Police Chief Lt. George Paugh, who hired Trams to the GPD and moved on in November 2023 to become commander of the criminal investigation division in the Caroline County Sheriff's Office.\nSeveral of Trams' family members attended, and Trams' law enforcement colleagues shared their thoughts.\nUpon joining the EPD, Sgt. Al Orrison said Trams offered him his trademark strong handshake and \"took me under his wing. My kids actually call him Uncle Lenox. I love this man.\"\nOrrison said Trams had not become cynical after so many years in law enforcement.\n\"When you get to that 15-, 20-year mark, you become very cynical, and it's hard to have compassion all the time,\" he said. \"But Lenox Trams always has compassion for everyone. He treats everybody fairly, and he's just an incredible human being.\"\nEPD Sgt. David Trevino said Trams has \"endless energy\" and \"never stops giving to people\" through mentoring and volunteer work.\n\"The town of Greensboro is very fortunate,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Talbot Police Accountability Board releases inaugural report",
    "date": "2024-01-07",

    "content": "Talbot Police Accountability Board releases inaugural report\n\n January 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Crime \n \n 749\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot County Police Accountability Board's first year was marked by challenges in adjusting to citizen oversight in policing, but \"reluctant confidence\" from law enforcement is believed to be growing, the board said in its inaugural report.The annual report, submitted to the Talbot County Council on Dec. 20, 2023, outlined the board's yearlong struggle in establishing a rapport with the county's four law enforcement agencies, which voiced concerns with the state-mandated legislation that created the board and a committee to review complaints of police misconduct.\nTrends in call volume, arrests, struggles with recruitment and retention, use of force and police-community relations within each of the county's law enforcement agencies were analyzed in the report.\nThe board also asked the County Council to consider a number of recommendations to improve police accountability in Talbot County.\nHowever, the board said most of the concerns from local police agencies centered on the Administrative Charging Committee, which is tasked with determining if officers should face administrative charges following a police agency's own investigation into the allegations. The committee also recommends appropriate discipline.\nThe committee is composed of five county residents and is helmed by Mitchell Ettinger, who also serves as the chairman of the Police Accountability Board.\nGaining the confidence of the county's law enforcement agencies proved to be the Administrative Charging Committee's great challenge last year, the report said.\nPolice questioned the wisdom of citizen oversight, the breadth of the committee's role and a lack of experience in law enforcement, which could translate to a gap in understanding the tasks and competing interests police officers face daily, according to the report.\nIn 2023, 15 complaints were submitted to the Administrative Charging Committee for review: 10 from the Sheriff's Office and five from the Easton Police Department.\nTwelve complaints resulted in officer exonerations or were ruled as unfounded charges. Three complaints ended with varying disciplinary actions — two of which involved disagreements on recommended dispositions between the Administrative Charging Committee and the officers' respective agencies, the report said.\nIn one case, a Sheriff's Office deputy was administratively charged for undue use of force. According to the report, the deputy deployed pepper spray in an attempt to stop a juvenile who was improperly operating a mini-bike on the road.\nThe Administrative Charging Committee found it was unreasonable for the deputy to do so and imposed charges. The committee recommended two days' loss of pay, which the deputy accepted, according to the report.\nThe Sheriff's Office also revised its policy to clarify that deploying pepper spray on a moving motorist is inappropriate.\nUse of force reports were a particular focus of the Police Accountability Board in 2023, according to its report. Law enforcement agencies now submit those reports quarterly.\nThe board's report said given the extensive interaction between police and the public, it was \"remarkable\" that officers only resorted to use of force on 10 occasions — six times by the sheriff's office, three times by the Easton Police Department and once by the St. Michaels Police Department.\nAnother case was heard against an Easton officer for unbecoming conduct off-duty, along with administrative failures to report conduct and a subpoena to testify. The allegations in that case were sustained, with the committee recommending two days' loss of pay or leave and a letter of reprimand.\nThe committee heard a third complaint against a sheriff's office deputy for speeding, which the deputy acknowledged. The deputy received a letter of reprimand.\nDespite a year of building relationships, some distrust still lingers between the Administrative Charging Committee and local law enforcement.\n\"...The LEAs most certainly will maintain that they did not (and do not) need citizen oversight to exercise proper review and disposition of citizen complaints,\" the report said.\nThough work remains to be done, the board believes the Administrative Charging Committee has established credibility with police through its \"well-reasoned and supported\" opinions on each of the complaints.\nEaston Police Chief Alan Lowrey acknowledged the lack of consensus between law enforcement and the committee on some case dispositions, but he said there was space for those disagreements.\n\"I think that we all want to be going in the same direction, and that is to have professional law enforcement in Talbot County,\" he said. \"I've never gotten a sense from either entity, the PAB or the ACC, that they're looking to do in law enforcement like has been the narrative nationally for a few years of some groups — not all groups.\"\n\"We understand that it's important to have a rule of law in our community, and we just want it to be done well,\" Lowrey continued. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Eastern Shore legislators prioritizing health care, public safety this session\n\n January 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: General Assembly \n \n 909\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — As the 446th session of the Maryland General Assembly kicks off, Eastern Shore legislators are focused on health care, public safety and the implications of the budget shortfall.Sen. Johnny Mautz, Sen. Stephen Hershey and Del. Tom Hutchinson all said the University of Maryland Shore Regional Health's new regional medical center in Easton is a top priority for Eastern Shore legislators this session.\n\"Making sure all the pieces are in place for that project to move forward,\" Mautz said. \"It's long overdue to be replaced and upgraded.\"\nMautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said there are multiple hurdles to achieving this, including state regulatory approvals and other \"loose ends.\" He said the University of Maryland Medical System has made it clear that a new medical center in Easton is also their top priority.\n\"Which is a huge help,\" Mautz said. \"However, making sure that everything else is in place ... it's a huge undertaking.\"\nHershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline) said that in creating an Aging & Wellness Center in Kent County and a freestanding medical facility in Dorchester County, the \"spokes\" are being put in place when it comes to health care on the Eastern Shore.\n\"But now we need the hub,\" he said. \"And so what we are advocating for down here in Annapolis — and I've spoken with the governor about it — is we need to finalize that final piece on how we deliver health care services in the Mid-Shore region.\"\nHutchinson (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico), who is on the Maryland House Health and Government Operations Committee, said he is sponsoring a number of bills that will make sure health care facilities have additional resources. He said he also plans to support bills related to better access to mental health care on the Shore.\nDel. Chris Adams (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico), who is the chair of the Eastern Shore Delegation, called public safety a \"top-line issue\" for this session.\nOn the Eastern Shore, Adams said that it has become more difficult to hire and retain law enforcement officers.\n\"I think it's because we've made this career path so difficult and so unclear about what the role is and what the responsibilities are,\" he said, adding that the job of law enforcers are to serve and protect.\nIn 2022, state legislators passed bills to limit what charges children under the age of 13 face. Adams said this legislation is a piece of this public safety issue.\n\"(Juvenile justice) has been an incremental step that has been, shall I say, just anti-police,\" he said.\nMautz said there are different approaches to amending the juvenile justice legislation. He said one approach is to look at enforcement and another is to look at services that can prevent children from engaging in criminal activity.\n\"You can have all the services in the world, but if you don't have the deterring enforcement, the services aren't going to do any good,\" he said. \"You've got to have both, and you really need to start with enforcement. I mean there's got to be a rule of law.\"\nHutchinson, who said he thinks the existing juvenile reform laws need to be modified, has spearheaded a group of different stakeholders in Dorchester and Wicomico counties to discuss the the juvenile reform laws and its effects.\n\"I got to the point that I invited the Secretary of Juvenile Services to come, where we could express our frustrations,\" he said.\nHutchinson said it will be interesting to see what the pushback will be on these laws. He said that some members of the General Assembly feel that the laws haven't been in place for long enough to amend them.\n\"Me, along with many, many other members of the delegation, completely disagree with that,\" he said. \"We need to address it now.\"\nWhen it comes to finances, the state is facing a projected $761 million budget shortfall for FY2025.\nAdams said he fears that tax increases are coming. He said that in his nearly 10 years as a legislator, this might be the first year he votes against the budget.\nHershey said dealing with the budget is a priority this session.\n\"We're going to have to find some ways that we can cut spending and pass a budget that doesn't include increasing taxes,\" he said.\nDel. Jay Jacobs (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline) said the legislature needs to be careful how it spends money.\n\"I like to prioritize the necessities first,\" he said. \"If you've got extra money after your primary duties are taken care of, then you can address some of that.\"\nJacobs said he has concerns with funding for the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, a statewide plan to increase public education funding, improve student outcomes and improve the quality of public education.\nHe said meeting the Blueprint requirements will be especially hard on his home county, Kent County, adding that a one-size-fits-all approach is not going to work.\n\"I am not at all in favor of one-size-fits-all anything,\" he said. \"Because we are so diverse in this state.\"\nJacobs said that counties should not have to face raising taxes \"to a ridiculous level\" or cutting services in order to fund the Blueprint.\n\"And some of that is potentially on the line right now,\" he said. \"That's what's very concerning.\"\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) said she understands that some jurisdictions are struggling to fund the Blueprint.\n\"I know what that looks like,\" she said. \"Because they can't get any more property taxes out of the citizens, because in areas such as Crisfield, they don't have anymore property to sell. It's flooded. So, it's a struggle.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Number of Cambridge homicides down in 2023\n\n January 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 743\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — There were less than half as many homicides in Cambridge in 2023 compared to the year before.In 2022, Cambridge saw seven homicides. In 2023, it saw three.\nCambridge Police Chief Justin Todd, who was sworn in as chief in January of 2023, called the difference progress. He credits the decrease in homicides to a few different things — namely, how the department polices and its partnerships with other agencies.\nOne of the police department's top priorities last year was community-oriented policing. For Todd, that meant being a part of the community that the department services.\nHe said getting out into neighborhoods and creating programs like neighborhood watches can help build relationships and trust in communities and, hopefully, reduce crime.\nAlong with prioritizing community policing, Todd said that the department has tried to be proactive in addressing gun violence and aggressive assaults. He said CPD is now taking an average of one gun off the street each week, \"well more than double\" the average in 2022.\nTodd also stressed the importance of working with other agencies and working with the community. He said that being a part of the Dorchester County Task Force, getting support from Cambridge City Council and focusing on community-oriented policing has all made a difference.\n\"I think a lot of people have come to the table in the last year,\" he said.\nCambridge Mayor Stephen Rideout said this decrease in the number of homicides in Cambridge is a significant one.\n\"Every shooting that we can stop is a step in the right direction,\" he said.\nRideout said he thinks CPD's community policing efforts are part of the reason for that success.\n\"It's just started, but I think they're building a trust within the community that just did not exist before now,\" he said.\nLieutenant Kyle Clark with Maryland State Police's Homicide Unit said that although he can't say for certain why the number of homicides has gone down in Cambridge, he can say that there has been a focus on collaboration between agencies.\n\"We do concentrate on a lot of collaborative efforts with other units within the State Police and also allied agencies,\" he said, specifying the use of task forces, gang units and gun units. \"And those are all tools that we use to combat the crime in any city.\"\nClark said that he would estimate about 50% of the homicides in the last two years in Cambridge have been gang-related. He said that in addressing gang violence, MSP, along with other agencies at all levels, do \"everything and anything\" to combat the gang violence.\nTodd said CPD is working to identify gang members and groups that are \"constantly harassing\" residents in different Cambridge neighborhoods. He said they have worked with the different agencies within the Dorchester County Task Force as well as federal agencies to identify who is bringing in handguns and where they are coming from.\n\"The partnership's been great with the Task Force and Maryland State Police,\" he said. \"The Homicide Unit with Maryland State Police — they handle all of our homicides. So we work hand in hand together. And that's what it's going to take.\"\nTodd said he has noticed gun violence and homicide rates begin to fall throughout the country.\nSpecific data on other crime rates in Cambridge should be released to the public in the next couple of weeks, Todd said.\nRideout said early intervention is important when it comes to crime prevention. Rideout was recently at a meeting about a flag football initiative by CPD and the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services.\n\"It was really an exciting possibility of where we can really start focusing, not only on the crime itself, but on the prevention and early intervention,\" he said.\nRideout added that engaging children in education and outside activities, such as programming at the YMCA or Boys and Girls Club, can have a positive effect.\nGoing into 2024, CPD's goals include continuing to build its manpower, focusing on data-driven technology and \"patrolling with a purpose.\"\nTodd said \"patrolling with a purpose\" means putting officers in the areas where crimes are occurring on the specific days and at the specific times they have been occurring.\nHe said that residents can also expect to see more data from CPD in the new year, including heat maps of where crimes are occurring.\nRegarding homicides, Rideout said the downward trend is good, but added that the work doesn't stop here.\n\"What we have to do is continue working on it and engage the community in working on it to hopefully keep these numbers down,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Heading out of his home on High Street in Cambridge, he was only set to be gone for a few hours before returning.But that night, what was a consistent routine for Fields was permanently disrupted, said Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard, who is prosecuting a case involving Fields' death with Senior Assistant State's Attorney Ella Disharoon.\nAround 10 p.m., officers from the Cambridge Police Department found Fields, 69, laying in the front yard of his own home. He had been shot once in the head at close range and robbed of the keys to his Chrysler 300, Leonard said.\nThough the keys were missing, the car wasn't; it remained parked in front of the home at 718 High Street. And 24 hours later, police found the person believed to be responsible for Fields' death sitting right in the driver's seat.\nThat return to the scene was how police caught Tramelle Williams, Leonard said.\nWilliams, 23, was arrested that evening following a foot pursuit on nearby Lincoln Terrace. After he attempted to flee, a Cambridge police officer fired, shooting Williams in the leg.\nAfter being taken to a hospital for treatment of his injuries, Williams was charged with first- and second-degree murder, assault, armed robbery and a firearms offense in connection to Fields' death.\nTo Leonard, testimony from Maryland State Police homicide investigators, officers involved in Williams' arrest, a medical examiner and crime scene and ballistics analysts would put the picture together, rendering a guilty verdict from the jury.\nBut to defense attorneys Michelle Moodispaw and Stephanie DeLang, a lack of witnesses, coupled with the limitations of DNA and ballistic evidence, would paint a different image — one in which Williams would be found not guilty.\nIn her opening statement to the jury Tuesday, Moodispaw emphasized the lack of testimony from witnesses.\nNo one saw the shooting. There was no video surveillance that captured the shooting either, only audio that seemed to be consistent gunfire from a city camera on a different street, police would testify.\nAnd although a 9mm gun was found by Williams when he fell, crime scene processing of the gun and Fields' car keys only showed that Williams couldn't be excluded as a contributor to the DNA evidence, she said.\n\"The question about what happened on Dec. 8, 2022, will remain unanswered,\" Moodispaw said.\nThe shooting on High Street wasn't the only one police responded to that night. Just three hours earlier, 24-year-old Taijay Brian Daniels was found dead from multiple gunshot wounds on Pleasant Street.\nWilliams was also charged in connection to Daniels' death. In December, a jury found Williams guilty of first- and second-degree murder, assault, armed robbery and multiple firearms offenses in the fatal shooting.\nMultiple witnesses testified at the outset of Williams' trial Tuesday, including Fields' daughter and significant other and law enforcement officers who responded to the scene.\nAdditional law enforcement witnesses and forensic analysts are expected to testify. A verdict is anticipated Friday. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Wes Moore said he expects \"robust debates\" about juvenile justice in coming weeks — and that his administration will be an \"active participant\" trying to balance rehabilitation with cracking down on crime.\"The hallmark of what I hope to see in any juvenile justice legislation that's going to make it to my desk can be summarized in one word: accountability,\" the governor said. \"I believe in rehabilitation, but I will not tolerate lawlessness.\"\nMoore's comments came Tuesday, a day before the opening of the 2024 Maryland General Assembly, in a press conference devoted to his legislative priorities regarding public safety. He said he plans to press for three measures aimed at promoting victim's compensation, expanding apprenticeships in law enforcement jobs and preventing firearm violence.\nBut he also mused aloud on the issue of juvenile justice, at a time when state Republican officials are calling for passage of tougher crime policies — and specifically for reversing recent reforms to the youth legal system. House Republican Leader Jason Buckel, R-Allegany, recently vowed to toughen up what he called Maryland's \"soft-on-crime policies.\"\nMoore said Tuesday he will demand accountability for young offenders who are repeatedly violating the law, or who use a handgun to threaten the safety of others.\nWhile Moore acknowledged the coming debate over juvenile crime this session, he stressed the importance of supporting communities and the advocates working at the grassroots level to prevent violence.\nHe said he supports lengthening probation for juveniles found guilty of certain crimes to allow for more time for rehabilitation programs. He also backs moving more crimes related to illegal guns from misdemeanors to felonies.\n\"It takes a village to raise a child, and it will take a village to build safer communities,\" Moore said.\nThe legislative criminal justice proposals Moore announced do not address the treatment of juveniles, but rather focus on other things.\nHe proposed establishing a firearm prevention center based on recommendations from the Safer States Initiative launched by Vice President Kamala Harris.\nThe statewide office would work in partnership with the White House, taking an \"all of government\" approach to effective prevention and intervention policies or programs, according to Rob Wilcox, deputy director of Biden's Office of Gun Violence Prevention. Maryland would be the first state to establish such a center, said Wilcox, who spoke at Moore's press conference.\n\"It's a critical step to focus investments and drive the strategies that we know will save lives,\" Wilcox said.\nAccording to Moore, 75% of homicides in Maryland are committed with a gun. He said he considers it not only a public safety issue but a public health issue. He pledged to get illegal guns \"off of our streets.\"\nTo help wage that fight, Moore hopes to recruit more people into law enforcement and public safety with a bill to promote apprenticeships.\n\"We need officers who reflect the diversity of our great state,\" Secretary of Labor Portia Wu said, \"and we need them to come from the neighborhoods they serve.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Paramedics later pronounced the boy and the teenaged girl dead at the scene, police added.\nTheir bodies were transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore, where autopsies will be performed to determine the \"cause and manner\" of their deaths, according to police.\n\"The preliminary investigation indicates the sister of the juveniles came home and found both children unconscious inside the home.

Bowman imposed a five-year sentence on the defendant — Elkton resident Kyle Logan Thomas, 28 — for misconduct in office and then suspended four years of the penalty, prosecutors said. Bowman also imposed a suspended one-year sentence on Thomas for visual surveillance with prurient intent, prosecutors added.\nIn addition, the judge ordered Thomas to serve three years of supervised probation after completing his one-year jail term, prosecutors reported.\n\"The defendant's conduct is best described as depraved, sadistic, and vicious,\" Bowman reportedly remarked from the bench while sentencing Thomas.\nThe sentence imposed by Bowman matched a recommendation made by Assistant State Prosecutor Abigail E. Ticse, who handled the criminal case with Deputy State Prosecutor Sarah R. David.\nAfter Wednesday's sentencing, Maryland State Prosecutor Charlton T. Howard III said, \"I am proud of our office's efforts to build a strong case against a law enforcement officer who was sworn to protect and serve, not to abuse and traumatize, the residents of Cecil County. We appreciate the Court's sentence and believe that it demonstrates to the residents of Cecil County and the entire State of Maryland that real consequences await people who commit crimes such as these, especially by those that hold positions of public trust.\"\nThomas had pleaded guilty to those two charges in October, as part of a plea deal in which prosecutors agreed to dismiss nine related charges against him, according to court records and Cecil Whig archives.\nIn August, two months earlier, Thomas was charged with misconduct in office, witness retaliation, visual surveillance with prurient intent, revenge porn, and distribution of obscene material. Thomas was not arrested, but rather was served charging papers.\nThomas had worked as a sworn Cecil County deputy for approximately two and a half years — from February 2021 until July 18, 2023 when the agency \"separated Deputy Kyle Thomas from employment\" amid an internal investigation into the allegations made against him, according to Capt. Michael Holmes, a CCSO spokesman. Thomas had been on suspension, per protocol, during his last nine months with the sheriff's office after the agency received a citizen complaint on Oct. 28, 2022 regarding his purported off-duty and on-duty misconduct, he noted.\nAs part of an overview in the charging document, prosecutors explained, \"Thomas, who was married, frequently utilized Snapchat to communicate and exchange photos and videos with other users because the communications or other exchanges typically disappear.\"\nThomas had a romantic relationship with a woman, who ended that relationship in August 2021, prosecutors reported.\n\"Throughout their relationship, Thomas shared photographs and videos with Victim I, primarily via Snapchat, depicting Thomas engaged in sexual acts,\" according to prosecutors.\nAt approximately 12:20 p.m. on June 16, 2021 — while on duty amid a shift that went from 7:45 a.m. to 7 p.m. that day — Thomas shared a video with VICTIM I using the \"My Eyes Only\" album on Snapchat and the image \"depicted Thomas in his CCSO uniform, in the CCSO building, holding, touching his exposed penis,\" prosecutors reported.\nThe woman attempted to end her relationship with Thomas several times and, in response, according to court records, Thomas \"made verbal threats\" to her.\nIn August 2021, VICTIM I attempted to cease all contact with Thomas, prosecutors reported. After an interaction between VICTIM 1 and Thomas in October 2022, VICTIM I and others made complaints about Thomas to the CCSO, which spurred the internal investigation that resulted in agency officials suspending Thomas, according to prosecutors.\nIn late October 2022, Thomas learned that CCSO was investigating him and that VICTIM I had been interviewed by agency investigators and that \"a copy of the video that he shared with VICTIM I on Snapchat had been provided to the CCSO,\" according to prosecutors.\nIn response, Thomas contacted VICTIM I several times at her place of employment — a doctor's office — on two days in November 2022 and requested to make a complaint against her, prompting her to obtain a final peace order against him, prosecutors said.\nProsecutors reported that Thomas went to a Cecil County District Court commissioner and requested that VICTIM 1 be charged with sharing the \"video of Thomas in his uniform exposing his penis to her husband and Thomas' employer, the CCSO.\" VICTIM I had provided that video to CCSO in October 2022 while making her formal complaint against Thomas.\nThe Cecil County State's Attorney's Office, however, dismissed the charges that Thomas had filed against VICTIM I, prosecutors reported. The MOSP criminal information filed against Thomas accused Thomas of taking retaliatory action against VICTIM I.\nProsecutors reported that Thomas became \"engaged in a sexual relationship\" with a second woman in 2019 and that she ended their relationship in May, some four years later.\nThey further reported that, throughout their relationship, Thomas took videos and photos of himself and the woman engaged in sexual acts and that he took those images without her consent.\nThe woman tried to end their relationship several times and, in response, Thomas sent videos of himself and the woman engaged in sexual acts to her, prosecutors said. Thomas also threatened to send videos of the woman engaged in sexual acts to other individuals or post the videos online, prosecutors added.\nIn July 2022, VICTIM 2 told Thomas to delete the photos and videos that he had on his phone, according to prosecutors. But Thomas told VICTIM 2 that he couldn't because he was anxious to post them on social media someday \"maybe when you get pregnant or married,\" prosecutors reported.\nFrom April 2022 through January, Thomas sent dozens of videos of himself and VICTIM 2 engaged in sexual acts to other Snapchat users without VICTIM 2's consent or knowledge, according to prosecutors. Thomas asked random Snapchat users to watch the videos, prosecutors said. Thomas also paid several Snapchat users to watch the videos,\" prosecutors added.\nWhen the Cecil County Sheriff's Office suspended Thomas on Oct. 28, 2022, agency officials served him a non-contact order forbidding Thomas from interacting with several specified people involved in the administrative investigation, including the second woman, prosecutors reported. Thomas refused to sign the non-contact order, according to prosecutors.\nThomas contacted the second woman \"in person, through text messages and on social media applications, including Snapchat\" from Nov. 12, 2022 through May 4, 2023, prosecutors reported. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He had been shot once in the head at close range and robbed of the keys to his Chrysler 300, Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard said at the outset of the trial Tuesday.\nThough the keys were missing, the car wasn't. It remained parked in front of the home at 718 High Street.\nThe shooting on High Street wasn't the only one police responded to that night. Just three hours earlier, 24-year-old Taijay Brian Daniels was found dead from multiple gunshot wounds on Pleasant Street, one of which was fired at close range.\nTwenty-four hours later, police saw the person believed to be responsible for the shooting around Fields' car.\nPolice approached Williams, but he attempted to flee.\nA foot pursuit ensued on nearby Lincoln Terrace. Williams reportedly brandished a handgun, police said.\nAfter he attempted to flee, a Cambridge police officer fired, shooting Williams in the leg. A handgun was found by Williams where he fell.\nFields' car keys and Daniels' phone were also recovered from Williams that night, police testified.\nWilliams was transported to TidalHealth Peninsula Regional in Salisbury for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries.\nHe was charged with first-degree murder in connection to both fatal shootings. In December, a jury convicted Williams of all counts related to Daniels' death.\nSurveillance footage and forensic evidence linked Williams to the two killings.\nA presentence investigation was ordered by Dorchester Circuit Judge William Jones, who presided over both trials. No sentencing date has been set yet.\nWilliams faces a maximum of life in prison without the possibility of parole for each first-degree murder conviction.\nIn a press release posted to Facebook, Leonard thanked the juries for their time and deliberations in the cases.\n\"While the senseless killings ... cannot be undone, it is the State's hope that these verdicts will give the families and loved ones of the victims a small sense of peace moving forward,\" the post stated. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Worried by spikes in youth crime, Maryland lawmakers close in on new fixes to the system\n\n January 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPH QUINN Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 602\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Almost two years after passing landmark youth justice reform, Maryland lawmakers are scrutinizing its impact on young offenders — and questioning whether they've done enough to make things better.The 2022 reforms were meant to help more young offenders avoid incarceration and get on the path to rehabilitation. But with spikes in auto thefts, carjackings and handgun violations by youth around the state, lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle are thinking about refining and updating the reforms this year.\nSenate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said there is an agreement taking shape among lawmakers who want to smooth the process for referring young people for rehabilitative services. State agencies have the resources to help kids and families, Ferguson said, but a lack of cooperation sometimes gets in the way.\nHe said one thing in need of improvement is the Child in Need of Supervision process, which lets law enforcement refer young people to Juvenile Services for assessment and programs when they get into trouble.\n\"What happened over the last few years is that the CINS process never led to actual conversations (or) collaborations amongst agencies that have various resources to surround the child with those supports,\" Ferguson said this week.\nIn their quest to change the law, lawmakers are motivated both by complaints from constituents and by a sense that youth crime is on the rise. While youth violent crime arrests fell 16.5% overall between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, according to a Juvenile Services report last year, carjackings increased by 85.4% and handgun violations rose almost 220%. Auto theft grew 64.6%, doubling between 2022 and 2023.\nSome Republicans blame the reform itself, and some prosecutors are joining them in raising concerns about the law. Among other changes, the 2022 reforms set 13 as the minimum age for a young person to be sent to juvenile court — except in cases of violent crime, where the minimum age is 10 — and prohibited police from interrogating youth without letting the child consult an attorney.\nBut Democrats are more interested in refining the system, and they're engaged in discussions that could produce a more sweeping set of improvements in the coming days.\nGov. Wes Moore's office is also involved in talks and expects that like-minded lawmakers may introduce legislation aimed at making improvements to the current law.\nSen. Jill Carter (D-Baltimore City), one of several lawmakers concerned about juvenile justice this session, said she wants to see police and prosecutors work together to use the tools the legislature has already given them.\n\"I think that the most effective thing that could happen is that law enforcement and prosecutors could work within the law, stop resisting it and work more collaboratively, and if they come up with suggestions, they should be data-driven,\" Carter said.\nSeveral lawmakers defended the 2022 reforms in a press conference with the Maryland Youth Justice Coalition this week, and urged law enforcement and state's attorneys to use the tools it set up.\nDel. Charlotte Crutchfield (D-Montgomery) said that the reform legislation is \"still in its infancy.\"\n\"We know that there are things that need to be put in place to ensure that it continues and that our youth are well taken care of under this legislation,\" Crutchfield said.\nProsecutors say it's not that simple. Juvenile Services officers sometimes see six or seven complaints regarding the same young person before prosecutors are notified, Montgomery County State's Attorney John McCarthy said during a recent Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee.\n\"Let us, as state's attorneys, have what we had before,\" McCarthy said, \"the ability to have those matters referred to us so that we may put a second additional set of eyes on it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

With Democrats controlling both chambers of the General Assembly, their opposition to repeal makes it unlikely.\nBut critics of the law — Republicans in particular — say the law is making it harder for police to do their jobs.\n\"The irony is, if we see someone chugging a beer, police can pull them over,\" said Sen. William Folden (R-Frederick), a police officer who serves in the legislature. He says the law potentially takes away probable cause for police when \"there is a crime occurring, just because you're saying, well, you're not allowed to use your nose anymore.\"\nAfter voters approved a ballot referendum legalizing cannabis for adult use, the General Assembly passed legislation in 2023 setting up licensing and taxation as well as other rules.\nThose laws were meant to address \"the harms of the past when it comes to criminalization of cannabis,\" Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), chair of the Black Caucus and sponsor of the odor law, told Capital News Service.\nMaryland's odor law isn't uncommon. In fact, several states that have legalized cannabis have said its smell doesn't warrant a police search of a vehicle, or they're considering such a provision.\n\"The public clearly wanted marijuana legalized, fine,\" said Sen. Jack Bailey (R-Calvert, St. Mary's), \"but we shouldn't do away with the requirements.\"\nBut top Democrats said they are only considering small alterations, including adjustments to the duties and makeup of the Maryland Cannabis Administration and related authorities.\n\"It was hugely complicated, lots of moving pieces for the cannabis bill last year,\" Ferguson said. \"And as we've been implementing, there's little things that have to be worked through.\"\nWilkins says the goal of Democrats and the Black Caucus is \"working closely with the administration to make sure that our intentions of the bill are carried out.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Numerous patients were transported, some with serious injuries. No fatalities were reported.Although yet to be determined, heavy fog is believed to be a factor in the mass casualty incident. Maryland Transportation Police dispatch received initial calls at 8 a.m. Saturday morning.\nInvestigators with the MDTA Police Collision Reconstruction Unit preliminarily believe 23 vehicles were involved in a chain-reaction crash on the westbound span. Additionally, investigators believe approximately 20 additional vehicles were involved in a series of secondary crashes.\nAccording to Sgt. Brady McCormick with the Transportation Authority, two patients were transported to local hospitals with serious injuries. Eleven additional patients were also transported to local hospitals. None of the injuries are believed to be life-threatening, McCormick said.\nAround 10 a.m., Director of Emergency Services for Queen Anne's County Scott Haas said he was still waiting for updated information from the scene. Multiple units from both Queen Anne's County EMS and fire and Anne Arundel County Fire Department responded and patients were being transported to several different hospitals, Haas said.\nTwo-way traffic on the eastbound span was suspended and officials directed alternating eastbound and westbound traffic every 20-30 minutes until conditions improve. All lanes were reopened at 2 p.m. Saturday afternoon, with delays still expected from the earlier closure.\nRequests for comment from the Kent Island Volunteer Fire Department, the responding station from Queen Anne's County, were deferred to the Maryland Transportation Authority.\nThis story will be updated as information is made available. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The fire originated in the home's rear porch area.\nSmoke alarms were present but did not activate, according to the Office of the State Fire Marshal.\nThe preliminary cause was accidental — combustibles were too close to a heater.\nThe state fire marshal estimated $125,000 in damage to the home's structure and a $25,000 loss in contents. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, jurors were unable to reach a verdict on a related assault charge, resulting in a mistrial on that count.Six witnesses testified in the trial for Charles M. Kling, 53, who was facing two charges — a fourth-degree sex offense and second-degree assault — in connection to an alleged incident involving a female employee at a business in St. Michaels on June 19, 2023.\nAccording to police, Kling was charged after he allegedly entered the business where the woman was employed, lured her away and touched her inappropriately.\nJurors deliberated for over three hours on Jan. 19 before returning a unanimous acquittal on the sex offense charge, according to Christine DuFour, one of Kling's attorneys.\nThe jury foreman told Talbot County Circuit Judge Stephen Kehoe, who presided over the case, that the jurors were deadlocked 11-1 on the assault charge, DuFour said.\nAccording to one juror, who spoke to DuFour in the presence of other attorneys and a bailiff, the majority was in favor of a not guilty finding on the assault charge, she added.\nThough a mistrial was declared, the prosecution does have the option to retry Kling for the assault charge.\nDeputy State's Attorney Chelsea Endzel, who prosecuted the case, was unable to comment.\nAndrew Jezic, one of Kling's attorneys, said if the state chooses to retry the case, he expects a full acquittal.\nPolice previously noted that Kling was a Tier III sex offender — a lifetime registry in Maryland.\nThe registration followed Kling's release from prison after serving time for a first-degree rape conviction in Anne Arundel County in 2004, according to court records.\nKling was sentenced to 25 years of active incarceration in that case, though he was released in spring 2020 and placed on supervised probation due to housing issues stemming from the pandemic.\nIf the prosecution does retry the case for the assault charge, the jury will not be able to consider Kling's prior conviction due to the acquittal on the sex offense, Jezic said.\nThough Kling was released from custody in Talbot County following the acquittal, he remains held in Anne Arundel County due to a pending violation of probation in the 2004 case.\nIn a bail review Tuesday, an Anne Arundel judge approved Kling's release to house arrest, DuFour said, but he has not yet been released.\nHe is set to appear in court for a status conference in Talbot County on Feb. 16 and violation of probation hearing in Anne Arundel County in March. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Findley, 26, is charged with two counts of indecent exposure and one count of disorderly conduct in connection to an incident along Peaviner Road in Ridgely.\nDeputies from the Caroline County Sheriff's Office responded to the 23000 block of Peaviner Road shortly after 11 a.m. Jan. 24 for the reported indecent exposure.\nThe victim told police she was driving down Peaviner Road when she saw a truck driver waving to get her attention. According to charging documents, the woman said she saw the man turn around and pull his pants down, exposing his buttocks from atop a tanker trailer.\nThe woman said her 6-year-old daughter also witnessed the indecent exposure.\nPolice said the woman showed deputies a cell phone photo of a man, which \"clearly\" showed a man exposing himself, according to charging documents.\nFurther down Peaviner Road, deputies found two tractor-trailers and a man, identified as Findley, matching the description the woman had given to police.\nFindley told police he waved to a vehicle while standing on top of a tractor-trailer tanker. According to charging documents, Findley said he bent over facing away from the passing vehicle, exposing his bare back to the car, and that he did not show his buttocks.\nPolice also spoke with Findley's coworker, who said he was not near the tractor-trailer during the incident, but did hear Findley yelling to a stopped vehicle.\nThe coworker told police that he told Findley to \"leave it alone\" due to ongoing community issues of manure being dumped in Caroline County, charging documents said.\nCourt documents filed for Findley's initial appearance before a District Court commissioner indicate that he is employed by Hartland Farms in Quarryville, Pennsylvania.\nHartland Holdings LLC owns a significant amount of land in Caroline County, including a property on River Road near Greensboro, which has a dissolved air floatation pit and has been the subject of recent outcry from local residents.\nFindley was released the same day on a $5,000 unsecured personal bond, according to court records.\nHe is set to appear for a trial in Caroline County District Court on March 21. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trappe woman found guilty of criminally negligent manslaughter by vehicle\n\n January 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Crime \n \n 787\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A Trappe woman who fatally injured an 84-year-old woman in a crash at the intersection of U.S. Route 50 and the southern end of the Easton Parkway nearly three years ago was sentenced Monday to 45 days in jail.Brittnee Ewing, 24, pleaded guilty to one count of criminally negligent manslaughter by vehicle — a misdemeanor charge — in connection to the fatal Easton crash, which occurred in the afternoon hours of April 8, 2021.\n\"These are the hearings where I feel the most powerless,\" said Talbot County Circuit Judge Stephen Kehoe, who presided in court Monday.\nThough no specific disposition was recommended by prosecutor Jennifer Wilson and defense attorney Stephanie Shipley advocated for a probation before judgment and no active incarceration, Kehoe handed Ewing a three-year sentence, suspending all but 45 days.\nThe case against Ewing stemmed from a multi-agency investigation into the crash.\nEwing, the driver of a Ford Escape, was traveling eastbound on Route 50 toward its intersection with the parkway at a high rate of speed — 85 mph prior to the crash, 79 mph at the time of the collision, Wilson said.\nVicki Harvey, 63, of Easton, was driving a Ford C-Max Hybrid that day. Jo Ann Wright, 84, of Easton, was her passenger.\nHarvey and Wright were crossing over eastbound Route 50 from westbound Route 50 at the light to turn onto the parkway, traveling roughly 25 mph heading toward the parkway, when they were struck by Ewing's car.\nWright was seriously injured in the crash, Wilson said. She was flown to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore. Harvey was taken to the hospital in Easton with minor injuries.\nWright suffered \"devastating trauma\" to her head, along with multiple fractures and bruises all over her body, Wilson said. She died at the trauma center on April 9, 2021.\nWilson said Ewing's car was \"completely destroyed\" in the crash. Ewing, who was also seriously injured in the crash, was flown with her 1-year-old son to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore for treatment.\nA witness who was driving westbound on Route 50 at the time of the crash told police that the C-Max Hybrid had a green light. According to the witness, Ewing did not slow or brake, Wilson said.\nIn a later interview with police, Ewing said she remembered picking up her son before the crash, though she said she wasn't in a hurry, Wilson said. She did not remember the crash.\nSpeaking in court, Wright's daughters, Julia George and Janine Conway, recounted the painful memories surrounding their mother's death.\nBoth women said Wright was internally decapitated, meaning her spinal cord separated from her skull. The family decided to remove her from life support.\nGeorge recalled how her mother would outstretch her arms when scared, voicing a fearful suspicion that her mother's broken wrists from the crash were from that movement.\n\"Her death was one of pain,\" George said, remembering Wright gasping for breath. A tear rolled down the side of her face around the time of her death.\nConway remembered rounding up her family together to take a photo with Wright on Easter, just days before the crash. She recalled urging her brother to get up for the photo, saying they wouldn't know if it would be the last picture they took with Wright.\n\"And it was,\" she said, her voice catching.\nConway and George asked the judge to hold Ewing responsible for her actions that day.\n\"The accident didn't kill my mother, the choices Ms. Ewing made killed my mother,\" Conway said.\nShipley acknowledged the family's pain and desire to hold Ewing responsible, saying Ewing did suffer physically and mentally from her split-second decision at that yellow light.\nEwing had undergone multiple surgeries following the crash, she said. The 24-year-old mother of one was unable to walk for months afterward.\nThe crash was out of character for Ewing, Shipley said — she had never even been pulled over before. Her life was one of service and hard work, she added.\n\"She lives with, every day, the thought that she killed someone else,\" Shipley said.\nWith tears in her eyes, Ewing apologized multiple times for her actions that day, saying she took full responsibility for the tragedy.\n\"I will carry this with me for the rest of my life, as I should,\" she said, looking back toward Wright's family members seated in the courtroom. \"I am so sorry.\"\nKehoe said he truly believed her, but given what happened, consequences were still needed.\nDespite Shipley's pleas for a delay in Ewing reporting to the county detention center to serve her term, Kehoe denied the requests. Ewing was taken into custody after the hearing.\nCourt records indicate Shipley filed a motion Tuesday afternoon requesting the court grant Ewing emergency release or home detention due to potentially life-threatening health issues. No decision was made as of press time. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Wes Moore on Wednesday for a public announcement of the proposals, alongside the lawmakers who crafted them.\nThe raft of changes, if enacted, would toughen a reform law the state legislature passed in 2022. Among other things, that reform barred police from charging young people under 13 except when they are accused of the most serious crimes.\nThe newly unveiled legislative package would expand that list of serious crimes and lengthen the maximum probation period that can be ordered by a judge. It would also expand the reporting responsibilities of a state agency charged with oversight of the youth justice system.\nThe announcement on Wednesday gave shape to Democrats' response to pleas for accountability amid spikes in certain youth offenses in recent years. While youth violent crime arrests fell 16.5% overall between fiscal years 2020 and 2023, according to a Juvenile Services report last year, carjackings increased by 85.4% and handgun violations rose almost 220%.\nAfter weeks of talks with law enforcement and advocates, the set of proposals represents a general agreement among Democrats, who control both chambers of the legislature and also hold the governor's office.\nBut advocates in the Maryland Youth Justice Coalition predicted in a written statement that the \"legislation introduced today will see thousands more kids incarcerated every year, particularly Black and brown children, and (exacerbate) the already serious racial disparities in Maryland's juvenile justice system.\"\nAs the minority party, Republicans have said in recent months that the reform law leaves Marylanders less safe and also prevents young people from getting the services they need. GOP lawmakers in Annapolis have their own ideas for change, including a measure that would prohibit young people who have committed sexual offenses from attending school in person.\nBut one key Republican on Wednesday said the Democrats' plan shows they are taking \"first steps\" in addressing flaws in the youth justice system. House Minority Leader Jason Buckel, R-Allegany, said he appreciates that Moore has put his weight behind the issue of youth crime.\n\"For him to be able to step in and say, 'Hey, I'm a Democrat. I'm from Baltimore City, but I'm going to step up and say too much is too much and this is a reasonable way to deal with this' — it's incredibly helpful,\" Buckel said.\nBuckel said he also hopes Moore will be able to persuade fellow Democrats to consider other tough ideas, too. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Sewage overflows in Cambridge, city prioritizing improvements\n\n January 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 779\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Harford County resident Jayne Ash saw more than she expected on Jan. 13 when she brought a group of people to Cambridge to look at birds.The end of Oakley Street, near the Choptank River, was flooded that day, Ash said.\n\"And the overflow was not draining,\" she said.\nThe group began to notice a white residue on the sidewalks, which seemed to have been left by the water, now below the curb but still flooding the street.\n\"The longer we stood there and the longer we looked, we just realized that this was just really nasty sewage water,\" Ash said, adding that she saw what looked like human feces floating in the water.\nAs the group was leaving the area, Ash said she could see a leak \"coming out of the street,\" bubbling up six to eight inches.\nThe entire experience worried Ash.\n\"We figured we probably shouldn't be walking in the water,\" she said. \"So we were kind of tiptoeing around the edges of where we normally would have gone.\"\nAsh said the city should have roped off the area, posted signs and pumped up the flooded water to transport it elsewhere.\n\"It's just so many things that they could have done, but I guess they weren't keeping aware of it,\" she said.\nAccording to the Code of Maryland Regulations, the owner or operator of any sewer system is required to report any overflow — defined as a loss of wastewater or discharge from a sewer system — to the Maryland Department of the Environment and local health department. This report must be made no later than 24 hours after the owner or operator becomes aware of the overflow.\nCOMAR also states that unless advised otherwise by the state or local health department, the owner or operator of the sewer system must notify the public no later than 24 hours after they become aware of the overflow if it enters shellfish harvesting waters, drinking water sources, waters used as public beaches or waters used for public recreation.\nThey must also notify the public if the state or local health department has reason to believe the overflow is a public health risk\nThe public must be notified via a public service announcement or paid advertising in a daily newspaper, radio station, or television station. According to COMAR, if appropriate, the public should be notified of larger overflows with potential environmental or health impacts through posted signage, as well as through the media.\nOn Jan. 17, the city submitted a telephone report to MDE. In a letter attached to the report, signed by Cambridge City Engineer Carl \"Bucky\" Jackson, Jackson said that high tides caused the sewage overflow event on Jan. 13.\nAccording to the report, the city was informed of the overflow by MDE on Jan. 17 following a complaint from a resident. No personnel from the city observed the overflow.\nJackson said in the report that based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Cambridge tide gauge, the overflow is estimated to have begun at 8 a.m. and stopped around 11:59 p.m on Jan. 13.\nJackson wrote that discharge from the overflow wasn't observed, but paper products were discovered around around the manhole where the overflow occurred. Once notified, the street and storm drains were cleaned and disinfected.\nIn an interview, Jackson said signage notifying residents and visitors of the overflow were placed at the location of the event within four hours of the city learning about it.\nJackson said it was surprising that high tide was the sole cause of this incident. He said that, usually, the cause is a mix of high tide and heavy rains.\nWater and sewer infrastructure improvements are one of the city's priorities this year.\nCambridge City Council has set out a $20 million capital program over the next five years for water and sewer infrastructure. The city has budgeted $8 million for fiscal year 2024.\nDuring a meeting between Cambridge City Council, city staff and local state legislators last Monday, Jan. 22, City Manager Tom Carroll said Cambridge annually gets fined for violating the Clean Water Act.\n\"We are focused on fixing the sewer issues and reducing or eliminating overflows,\" he said at the meeting.\nEarlier this month, the City Council awarded a contract bid to replace the West End sewer, located in the lowest lying area of the city at Water Street and Hambrooks Boulevard.\n\"Routinely, we have elicit discharges when we have wet weather events,\" Carroll said. \"We have sewage overflows. And we're hoping that this project will fix that.\"\nJackson said the West End sewer replacement will benefit Oakley Street near the river.\nCarroll said there are three other major sewer projects planned that are in \"various stages of design\" as well as a water booster station to accommodate new development. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Although there were three total homicides in 2023, Police Chief Justin Todd said the Dec. 18 fatal shooting of Taron Jones has been ruled justified, meaning that the person that shot Jones is not considered criminally liable and will not be charged with the murder.\nBurglaries were down 42%. Aggravated assaults were down 8.8%. Simple assaults were down 10%.\n\"The overwhelming amount of support that the Cambridge Police Department has received, along with the countless number of community leaders that have dedicated their time to assist in community engagement, shows that working together, we can flourish and continue to improve,\" the report says.\nCPD seized 53 illegally-possessed guns in 2023, according to the report. The majority of them, or 38, were pistols. Seven revolvers, six shotguns and two rifles were also seized.\nWhen it came to shots fired in 2023, CPD reported that it received 256 ShotSpotter alerts as well as 74 shots fired calls. ShotSpotter is a gunshot detection system that has sensors that can detect and locate illegal gunfire incidents and alert law enforcement.\nAccording to the report, the Criminal Investigations Division, which is made up of three detectives and an evidence technician, cleared 163 of its assigned 214 cases, or 76.2%.\nIn 2023, the department swore in eight new officers, making the total number of sworn officers 34, with two additional officers in the academy.\nAlthough this is two officers more than 2022's staffing rate, CPD still has fewer officers than it had in 2018, when there were 44 sworn officers on the force.\nThe department had one more civilian employee in 2023 than in 2022. This year, that number has increased one more, making the total number of civilian employees six.\nIn the summer, the department established the Office of Professional Standards. This new unit has been tasked with managing department policies and procedures, collecting data that can be used for better staffing officers and increasing transparency to the community.\nAt the end of 2023, the unit conducted a staffing survey to be completed in 2024. The results of this project will include a recommendation to Todd and City Manager Tom Carroll for approval.\nCommunity-oriented policing was a focus for the department in 2023. According to the report, CPD's Community Policing Unit hosted over 50 events over the year, including National Night Out and Shop with a Cop.\nGoing into 2024, community policing will stay a focus. According to the report, the goal of the department in 2024 is to continue to reduce crimes while increasing residents' quality of life.\nThe department has several specific initiatives it plans to implement this year, including \"Patrolling with a Purpose\" and initiating a Proactive Criminal Enforcement Unit in order to address areas identified as \"problem areas\" in Cambridge.\nThe department also plans to implement a drone program that can be used in missing persons, active shooters and barricaded suspects cases; increase cooperation with allied agencies and continue recruiting officers. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Violent Firearms Offender Act back before lawmakers a fifth time\n\n February 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Crime \n \n 872\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — For the fifth legislative session in a row, the proposed Violent Firearms Offender Act is back in front of Maryland lawmakers for consideration and hopes of passage through both chambers.Senate Bill 28 and Senate Bill 179, two separate bills both known as the Violent Firearms Offender Act of 2024, are being brought forward in an effort to address gun violence across the state.\nBoth bills include the same provisions, including altering a number of firearms-related offenses, expanding the definition of a crime of violence and specifying that a violation of parole or probation involving a firearm is not a technical offense.\nIt would also require the state Commissioner of Correction to provide incarcerated individuals with a reentry kit prior to their release.\nMore specifically, the bill would make the use of a firearm in the commission of a violent crime a felony — a crime that's currently a misdemeanor. The bill would also make the use of an assault weapon, machine gun or magazine with a capacity of more than 10 rounds a felony.\nCurrent state law also does not classify the use of a firearm while possessing drugs with the intent to distribute them as a crime of violence. If passed, the bill would remove that exception.\nAdditionally, current law says if a person who is prohibited from having a firearm due to previous felony convictions, for example, is caught with one, that person can be charged with illegal possession of a firearm — a misdemeanor crime with a maximum sentence of five years.\nThe bill would increase the maximum penalty from five years to 10 years in prison for a second offense.\nState lawmakers have previously heard and voted in favor of similar versions of the Violent Firearms Offenders Act, though it hasn't been able to move forward to becoming law.\nIn the 2020 and 2021 General Assembly sessions, the legislation passed the Senate, but failed to advance further in the House of Delegates. And in 2022 and 2023, the legislation failed to advance past the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee.\nHowever, SB 28, the Senate Republican Caucus version of the bill introduced this session by Sen. William Folden (R-Frederick), adds a new provision: imposing a penalty on a person who sells or loans a regulated firearm to someone else knowing that the firearm would be used to commit a crime or cause harm.\nIf the bill with that provision is approved, a person who violates that law would be guilty of a felony and could face a maximum of 10 years in prison.\nAt a Jan. 25 Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee hearing, Folden and SB 179 sponsor Sen. Ron Watson (D-Prince George's) testified to the need to finally pass the legislation.\nWatson, who's served in the Senate since summer 2021, focused on the fact that the bill has been presented multiple times without passage, and to the committee, the legislation wasn't new.\n\"But I have to ask the committee, are we ready now to take action?\" Watson asked. \"Because the state of Maryland is watching, and everything we've done over the last several years with respect to guns and trying to hold folks accountable, it is clear that crime is continuing to rise, particularly among our juveniles and the gun use.\"\nFolden, acknowledging that the two bills have \"the exact same posture,\" asked if Watson would support his bill's new provision adding punishment to selling or transferring a firearm to someone who commits a crime.\nWatson said in talking with attorneys about trying to punish the person who sold a firearm, it would be difficult to prove what the intent of a purchaser would be.\nFolden countered, saying it would be difficult, but not impossible, considering the number of people who communicate via digital platforms.\n\"Because if there's ever been a time (when) the opportunity exists to prove that there was the intent, it's now, with the environment we live in with the electronic devices,\" he said.\nWatson said he would be amenable to the provision if the committee agreed.\n\"But we have to do something,\" he said, with Folden agreeing. \"Standing still is not an option.\"\nThe currently proposed Violent Firearms Offender Act has the support of Shore lawmakers, too.\nSen. Steve Hershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline), a co-sponsor of SB 28 who has supported similar versions of the legislation since 2020, noted the emphasis that's being placed on public safety this session by Republicans, Democrats and Gov. Wes Moore.\n\"The feeling in Annapolis is that we need to do something about public safety and violent crime,\" he said, also pointing to the spread of crime across the state.\nThough he's not on the Judicial Proceeding Committee that determines which version of the bill, if either, will move forward, Hershey said the Senate Republican Caucus would be \"pleased\" to see either bill moved out of the committee and on to the Senate and House floors.\nThe Violent Firearms Offender Act is one of five pieces of legislation the Joint Republican Caucus is proposing this session as part of its public safety agenda.\nOther bills proposed as part of the agenda include the Gun Theft Felony Act of 2024 (SB 39/HB 304), the Safe Communities Act of 2024 (SB 44/HB 310), the Drug-Free Roadways Act of 2024 (SB 396/HB 320) and the Juvenile Justice Restoration Act of 2024 (SB 52/HB 319). \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She said the snapshots were proudly displayed on her walls.\n\"I cried, cried, cried,\" Demdy said as she watched firefighters extinguish the last remaining embers at 17 South Locust Lane, many of her belongings strewn across the front yard of the early 20th century house. \"I had everybody's picture on the wall. My walls were just full of pictures.\"\nDemdy's home of 27 years was one of two houses that caught fire a little before 3 p.m. Saturday. It was the second house fire that Demdy had experienced in her life. Her home a few streets over had been lost to a fire three decades prior.\nFirefighters were dispatched to the blaze at 3:07 p.m., by which time, neighbors said, flames were spreading quickly between the two structures.\nBoth Demby, who lived alone, and the family who lived next door were able to make it out of the houses, and emergency officials on the scene said that no serious injuries were reported.\nIt took firefighters a little more than two hours to control the blaze. Responding fire departments began to gather their equipment and leave the scene a little before 5:30 p.m.\nSeven local fire departments responded to the fire — the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, the Cordova Volunteer Fire Company, the St. Michaels Fire Department, the Preston Volunteer Fire Company, the Oxford Fire Company, the Queen Anne-Hillsboro Volunteer Fire Company and the Trappe Volunteer Fire Company, along with local EMS and law enforcement personnel.\nThe state fire marshal is conducting an investigation into the fire and its causes, the results of which will be available at a later date.\nThough exact damages are yet to be determined by the fire marshal, both houses sustained significant damage, and all residents of the structures were displaced.\nDemdy said she would be staying with a relative near Salisbury, and arrangements were made for her neighbors. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Officer fights to deter drivers like one who harmed him\n\n February 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LYDIA HURLEY Capital News Service | Section: General Assembly \n \n 740\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Less than four months after losing his legs in an attempt to stop a reckless highway driver, a Montgomery County police officer is at the forefront of a movement to crack down on negligent driving in Maryland.Sgt. Patrick Kepp plans to testify on two bills in the state capital of Annapolis this session — traveling from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, where he is still in active recovery from last October's incident.\n\"When I was brought into the conversation about new laws being created, right away, I knew it was something I wanted to do,\" Kepp said.\nRehabilitation is his first priority, he said, but treatment won't get in the way of his new mission. \"I will be there in Annapolis to make sure these bills happen,\" Kepp said.\nKepp announced his plans this week in a press briefing alongside Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich and Montgomery County lawmakers who are taking up the cause with him. Kepp's story has inspired them to craft new legislation that would punish repeat offenders of reckless driving.\n\"I'm going to call it the Sergeant Pat Kepp Bill on Reckless Driving,\" said Delegate Greg Wims (D-Montgomery), calling Kepp a \"hero.\"\nReckless driving isn't a new phenomenon in Maryland. Outraged by stories of dangerous driving on the Beltway or the Ocean City Expressway, Maryland lawmakers in years past have proposed legislation meant to stop these behaviors. This session, two other bills, separate from Kepp's, are making their way through the legislature, specifically aimed at ending the deadly game of drag racing or \"exhibition driving.\"\nBut Kepp's bill is a personal one, inspired by an officer who patrolled the sponsoring lawmakers' home district. Elrich visited Kepp while he was in recovery to propose the idea of working together on this set of bills, the officer said.\nThe two bills have not been filed, but the sponsors say they share common goals. The bills would change existing criminal law to widen the definition of what constitutes reckless and negligent driving and increase penalties for those crimes, the sponsors said.\nOne penalty they will propose is requiring offenders to appear in court for their offenses. \"It's way too easy for a driver to just pay a fine and get back on the road and do what they were doing before,\" Elrich explained.\nSgt. Kepp, who worked as an officer in the alcohol initiative unit, says these bills will \"give a little more teeth to some of our laws.\" Additionally, he hopes the law will address the \"overall frustration\" with the difficulty enforcing existing reckless driving laws. The penalties aren't tough enough, he said, and the fines aren't a good enough deterrent.\nIn the early morning hours of last Oct. 18, Kepp had just finished his shift when he heard a radio report of a speeding driver on Interstate 270. He joined other officers in an attempt to stop the driver. While Kepp was standing outside of his car, the driver struck him and left him critically injured, as Elrich recounted in the press briefing.\nThe Montgomery County Police officers on duty that night knew the driver \"had a history of speeding and taunting police into chasing him,\" Elrich said. Police say the driver targeted and intentionally hit Kepp, Elrich said, and he is now being charged.\nBoth of Kepp's legs were amputated due to the injuries he sustained that night. Now he said he spends every day — from 9:45 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. — at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center undergoing rehabilitation. He joined the Zoom call for Elrich's press briefing from the medical center, wearing a blue dry-fit shirt and a short military-style haircut.\nIt has been four months since the accident, and Kepp said he has had a dozen surgeries since.\nStill, he wants to speak on behalf of legislation that \"will strengthen our laws and make our roadways safer,\" Kepp said.\nThe aim of the bills is \"not for everybody to be thrown in jail, have huge fines, or lose their licenses,\" Kepp said, but rather to end reckless driving, especially by repeat offenders.\nElrich said he hopes the law will stop people from \"ignoring lights and sirens from law enforcement, breaking the rules of the road … and performing car tricks like drifting, peeling out, and doing donuts in the middle of a road.\"\n\"All it takes is a moment's loss of control over that vehicle,\" Elrich said. \"Instead of being entertaining, it would take little to transform it into a deadly incident.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

These stations are there for everyone and can be critical during heart emergencies.\nCaroline County Recreation and Parks and the Caroline County Department of Emergency Services joined forces to enhance safety measures within the community by introducing SaveStations at parks throughout the County. This collaborative effort aims to prioritize the well-being of citizens who frequent these public spaces.\n\"Putting these devices in public parks, emphasizes our goal in public safety,\" said Travis Breeding, president of Caroline County Commissioners. \"They're not just tools, they're symbols of our commitment to being ready for emergencies.\"\nSaveStations, equipped with AEDs and emergency communication tools, provide immediate assistance in the event of injuries or emergencies.\n\"Through this partnership, Caroline County residents can enjoy their outdoor experiences with greater peace of mind, knowing that assistance is readily available,\" stated a press release issued by the county.\nMore than 15% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur in public places. Studies from the American Heart Association show that nine out of 10 cardiac arrest victims survive after receiving a shock from an AED during the first minute.\n\"By adding these SaveStations around Caroline County we are giving citizens the ability to save lives,\" the release stated.\nAs part of the #CarolineCARES campaign, Caroline has picked six important spots throughout the county for these life-saving devices.\nThe high traffic public areas where the SaveStations are located are Marydel Park on Lepore Road, the Caroline County 4-H Park on Detour Road in Denton, Choptank Marina, Denton Elementary School on Sharp Road, Clark Harrison Memorial Park at Preston Elementary School and South County Regional Park on American Corner Road in Federalsburg.\n\"SaveStations are like watchful guardians on the field, ready to help if someone has a heart emergency,\" the release stated. \"This is especially important for the safety of all visitors. These devices show how prepared we are to help ensure everyone has access to emergency care when they need it most.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline Police Accountability Board reports progress\n\n February 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly | Section: Local News \n \n 1030\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — The Caroline County Police Accountability Board shared its second annual report with the County Commissioners at their Feb. 6 meeting.The bottom line: Of the thousands of contacts people had with county and town law enforcement officers, a handful of complaints were made, and a fraction of those resulted in disciplinary action.\nPresenting the report were Police Accountability Board Chairman John Bartlett and Board Administrator Kimberly Raeder.\nBartlett said he wanted to make one \"very important\" point: The Caroline County Sheriff's Office had over 26,000 calls for service in 2023, which generated only six complaints, he said.\n\"Five of those six were exonerated, meaning unfounded, and one was a very minor infraction, which led to a written reprimand,\" he said. \"I think that speaks volumes with law enforcement here in Caroline County.\"\nA state mandate\nRaeder explained the purpose and scope of the three police oversight boards mandated by the Maryland Police Accountability Act of 2021, which became effective July 1, 2022.\nThe role of the county's Police Accountability Board \"is to receive police complaints, recommend policy changes and identify any trends,\" Raeder said.\n\"The second board is the five-member Administrative Charging Committee, and their role is to look over and review completed complaint investigations and recommend discipline,\" she said. If the Charging Committee decides to administratively charge, they use the statewide police disciplinary matrix to \"decide what kind of discipline would be necessary based on the complaint.\"\nThe five members of the Charging Committee were appointed and trained in April 2023 at the Fretterd Center by the Maryland Police Training and Standards Commission.\nThe third board is the Trial Board comprised of retired Maryland Circuit Court Judge Owen Wise, a citizen and a police officer of the same rank, Raeder said. No complaints have been referred to this board.\n\"I'm proud to say that Caroline County is leading the way for other counties on the Eastern Shore who have reached out to us regarding using Judge Wise, if they need a judge for a trial board,\" she said.\nFew complaints filed\nAmong the county's municipalities, 15 complaints were filed, including a pending complaint related to an April 7, 2023, incident in Denton that prompted millions of views on YouTube, Bartlett said.\nA video of the incident shows Christopher Morgan threatening the residents and breaking the window of the storm door of a home while two Denton Police officers stand on the sidewalk watching.\nThe way the officers handled the call for service prompted Denton Police Chief George Bacorn to request the Talbot County Sheriff's Office to investigate the handling of the incident. Their findings were turned over to the Administrative Charging Committee.\nThere were no complaints from Ridgely or Greensboro. One was brought to the Police Accountability Board from Federalsburg, which was exonerated, Bartlett said.\nThe report breaks down the 15 complaints by percentages; numerically, four complaints are pending investigation, three were administratively charged, two were withdrawn by the complainant, four were exonerated and two were \"not in the purview of the ACC (Administrative Charging Committee).\"\nThe Accountability Board identified trends in the disciplinary process and didn't \"recommend any changes at this time.\"\n\"A common identified trend, however, has been the lack of activation of body cameras when officers interact with the public,\" the report stated. \"The ACC discovered this trend when reviewing completed complaint investigations which had no body camera footage for the ACC to review. The Board advised the municipal Police Departments and the Sheriff's Office to remind Officers to adhere to department policy and activate their cameras when encountering the public. The policy protects both the Officer and the Citizen if a complaint were to arise from the interaction.\"\nCost to the county\nBartlett thanked the commissioners for their \"financial support of the committee for legal decisions when needed.\"\nThe boards' complying with the state mandates has incurred expenses for the county, although some have been covered by the Police Accountability, Community, and Transparency Grant program.\nOf the $105,272 in grant funds received, the Accountability Board has spent $49,545, which includes the purchase of IAPro software for filing complaints, annual computer licensing for all board members, and pay for the Board's administrator.\nThe Police Accountability Board is asking the state to continue offering these grants, as well as other police-oriented grant programs for local police departments to be able to purchase \"the required technology, resources, and tools to comply with the law,\" including software and a change in the vendor for body cameras, so that every law enforcement agency in the county has the same system.\nOther costs included outside legal counsel, with expenses the County Commissioners agreed to fund to the tune of nearly $8,000.\nQuestions arose requiring legal clarification for both the Police Accountability Board and Administrative Charging Committee, and the county commissioners \"agreed to bear the expense of hiring outside legal counsel\" to represent both. \"Legal Counsel attends each quarterly meeting and provides interpretation of the Maryland Police Accountability Act of 2021 as needed,\" the report stated.\nThe legal expenses for the Police Accountability Board were $3,650, while those of the Administrative Charging Committee amounted to $4,300.\nPAB recommendations\nThe Accountability Board recommends \"changing ACC training from all in-person training to online meeting based or pre-recorded online training. With one member of our ACC board resigning this past July, we have firsthand knowledge of the burden imposed on the newly appointed volunteer Board member. As terms end or resignations occur, the pool of applicants will continue to shrink when advised that members must undergo uncompensated training prior to serving.\"\nAnother unanticipated result of the law has been the withdrawing of multiple complaints, which created a legal conundrum for the Accountability Board and is currently being resolved with the Office of the Attorney General.\nThe report also suggested amending the law by mandating only complaints of \"matters of public concern,\" that is, \"police misconduct, such as abuse of power, false arrest, police brutality, or criminal activity\" be referred to the Charging Committee, thus alleviating pressure on municipal police departments. \"Rude and discourteous\" behavior towards a citizen would be handled at the department or agency level, as suggested by the Accountability Board.\nTo read the full report, which includes rosters of members of the PAB and ACC boards, visit carolinemd.org/DocumentCenter/View/8606/2023-Annual-Report-PAB?bidId=.

Please know that while we may contact you to serve you various documents, we will never request money or gift cards. Any payments related to law enforcement or the jail are processed through the courts, never our office,\" GCSO said.\nThe scam artists might also use cloned police telephone numbers and actual deputy names. Again, police recommend hanging up immediately on the bogus callers.\n\"Scammers will be insistent that you stay on the line, which prevents you from thinking through their demands or calling someone else,\" GCSO said.\nOther police agencies across the state and country have also seen imposters posing as officers as part of various phone scams.\nNONPROFITS TARGETED\nThe Montana Nonprofit Association is also warning organizations of donation schemes that have so far targeted 19 groups statewide.\nMNA said a nonprofit will receive \" an unexpected donation of around $200,000 to honor someone's late mother.\"\n\"Multiple (organizations) have said the amount they received was $191,250, and that the email came from Alphonso Blye. The cashier's check looks legitimate so they cash it, \" the Helena-based group said in an announcement Monday.\nA few days later the same donor will contact the nonprofit and tell them the check should have been for $100,000 and request a refund of the remaining amount.\nThe check is bogus to begin and will bounce but scam rings hope to bilk groups out of $91,250 in the meantime.\n\"So far, everyone who has contacted us has managed to catch the scam before falling victim, but with this amount of money, the scammer only needs to convince one,\" MPA said.\nThe statewide association recommends confirming the identity of donors before accepting money and asking them to wait 30 days before issuing any refunds.\nMajor banks statewide and the Montana Bankers Association have also been alerted to the fraud scheme.\nRECORD FRAUD LEVELS\nThe Federal Trade Commission reported Feb. 9 that U.S. consumers lost a record $10 billion to fraud schemes in 2023.\nThat is a 14% increase from 2022. Some of that jump stems from crypto currency fraud.\n\"Consumers reported losing more money to investment scams—more than $4.6 billion—than any other category in 2023. That amount represents a 21% increase over 2022. The second highest reported loss amount came from imposter scams, with losses of nearly $2.7 billion reported. In 2023, consumers reported losing more money to bank transfers and cryptocurrency than all other methods combined,\" FTC which received 2.6 million consumer complaints last year.\nThe U.S agency received 2.5 million complaints in 2022. The FTC said last year saw an increase in consumer calls involving fraud rings impersonating government officials (including police) as well as businesses.\nThe FTC received fraud reports from 2.6 million consumers last year, nearly the same amount as 2022. The most commonly reported scam category was imposter scams, which saw significant increases in reports of both business and government impersonators. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "House of Delegates hears testimonies for Jamari's Law\n\n February 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Sarah Meador somdnewsintern@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 520\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Maryland residents on Feb. 7 testified before the state House of Delegates in support of Jamari's Law, which would increase the maximum penalty of manslaughter by vehicle.Jamari Tyrese Duckett, the bill's namesake, was a recent graduate of Great Mills High School and registered for college with plans to study mechanical engineering when a drunk driver killed him on July 9, 2022, in St. Mary's County.\nMatthew Mark Mazza was sentenced in October 2023 to the maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Mazza, 28, of Lexington Park will be eligible for parole after serving only 2 1/2 years, as vehicular manslaughter is considered a non-violent crime in Maryland.\nMazza's braking speed at the time of the collision was between 76 mph and 91 mph in a 40 mph zone at the time of the crash, according to the St. Mary's sheriff's office.\nJamari's Law proposes to increase the maximum penalty for manslaughter by vehicle to 20 years and 15 to 30 years for any subsequent convictions.\n\"This is reckless and a disregard for life when you get behind the wheel, drunk, driving over the speed limit. That could have been you, me, your kids, parents or grandparents in that car, and to only get 10 years and out a few years later on probation, is a slap to all families that have lost someone to a drunk driver,\" Shownda Greenwell, Duckett's mother, said at the hearing.\nOther families affected by drunk driving testified at the hearing both in person and over Zoom, urging the House Judiciary Committee to increase the maximum penalty to bring justice to their loved ones.\nDel. Brian Crosby (D-St. Mary's) is sponsoring House Bill 264, which is cross-filed with Senate Bill 26 sponsored by Sen. Jack Bailey (R-St. Mary's, Calvert). The Senate hearing for the bill occurred on Jan. 24.\n\"It was very painful for them, but it was very important that the legislators understand what is happening as a result of such a serious crime,\" Bailey said of the many families who testified at both hearings.\nThe bill does not propose a minimum sentence, but gives judges further discretion in their sentencing of those who are found guilty of the crime of manslaughter by vehicle, Bailey said.\nSt. Mary's County State's Attorney Jaymi Sterling (R) also urged both the House and Senate to increase the maximum penalty, stating that the lives lost to vehicular manslaughter are worth more than the 10-year criminal penalty equivalent to passing a bad check.\n\"We need your help,\" Sterling said at the Senate hearing last month. \"Please consider raising the penalties so that we have more to work with, so that we can rehabilitate, so that we can provide deterrence, but so there is also punishment.\"\nBoth the House and Senate bills were referred to the state legislature's committees.\n\"They're still seeking justice and trying to make sure that no other family should have to endure the same amount of pain that they did and not receive fair justice under the law,\" Crosby said.\nHe cited the bravery of all families who testified to bring justice to lives lost to vehicular manslaughter.\nIf the bill passes, the law would become effective Oct. 1. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to reports from local police, the accident is still under investigation.Onlookers from the scene said it looked as though the truck carrying a load of corn tried to cross in front of the oncoming train.\nUltimately the tractor-trailer made it successfully only half way across the tracks before being struck by the train. Nealson Street at Broad Street remained closed for hours while clean up was conducted. No injuries were reported.\nLeon Guin works as a jockey driver at Amick Farms on Nealson Street near where the accident happened. He said he saw the accident just after it happened.\n\"Our security guards heard the accident,\" he said, \"and two of our outside drivers saw and heard it also. They were bringing the chickens in at that time.\"\nFrom Guin's point of view, he could see the truck cab and front portion of the trailer wrapped around the side of the train. The covered load had spilled alongside the train tracks and the truck cab twisted so it looked as though the truck was driving on the tracks.\nPresident and General Counsel for Maryland and Delaware Railroad Company Cathrin Banks stated she had reason to believe the operators of the train did everything they were supposed to do approaching the crossing.\nPolice had to close access at the Nealson Street entrance of Amick, but operations continued via the Route 392 and Delaware Avenue entrance. Four hours later, Guin was leaving work and clean up operations were still continuing, he said.\nAt press time, Hurlock's Chief of Police Bruce Jones said he was not yet able to release further details of the accident, including the name of the truck driver and company they were hauling for. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Citizens are reminded to be aware of scams and know that the Sheriff's Office will never instruct someone to pay in such a manner.\"\nThe St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office said in a Feb. 14 advisory that some fraud rings while also impersonate federal agents and will target businesses.\n\"We urge all residents to be wary of calls or messages demanding immediate payment or threatening legal action. This is a tell-tale sign of a scam,\" SMCSO said in an announcement, recommending employers talk to workers about potential scammers.\nPolice across the country have been cautioning of similar schemes snd scams including ones related to supposed missed jury duty.\n\"The caller claims that the person missed jury duty and that there is a warrant for their arrest, but they can post a fine or bail to take care of it,\" the Gallatin County Sheriff's Office in Montana said in a community alert issued Feb. 12.\nThe law enforcement agency tells residents to \"hang up immediately\" and to not send any payments.\n\"Scammers want you to act fast. They'll pressure you, threaten you, and even try to keep you on the phone so you can't verify their story. Remember, don't let urgency cloud your judgment,\" the Washington County Government in western Maryland says in series of tips of how to avoid rip-off schemes.\nConsumer protection groups and police say some fraud rings will accept payments via gift cards or crypto currency, which are hard to trace and are additional signs of fraud.\nNONPROFITS, SMALL BUSINESSES TARGETED\nNonprofits and small businesses are also being targeted by fraud rings while other associations and charities are being impersonated by schemers.\nThe Maryland State Bar Association is cautioning members of phishing scams purporting to be from the group's leaders, including executive director Anna Sholl. The effort looks to gain financial and personal information from law firms and attorneys.\nCatholic Charities is also warning of imposter scams related to potential financial helping Maryland residents with water bill payments.\nContracting and cleaning businesses are also urged to be leery of bogus insurance providers.\n\"The Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) has become aware of an insurance-related scam that predominantly targets small painting, construction, and cleaning businesses,\" the agency said in scam alert issued Friday, Feb. 16.\nThe state agency said scammers are approaching small businesses about buying general liability or workers compensation insurance. MIA urges Maryland businesses to verify the legitimacy and licensing of the broker and company offering the insurance.\nAcross the country, there is another cautionary tale.\nMontana Nonprofit Association is also warning organizations of donation schemes that have so far targeted 19 groups statewide and could be used against other groups nationally.\nMNA said a nonprofit will receive \" an unexpected donation of around $200,000 to honor someone's late mother.\"\n\"Multiple (organizations) have said the amount they received was $191,250, and that the email came from Alphonso Blye. The cashier's check looks legitimate so they cash it, \" the Helena-based group said in an announcement Monday.\nA few days later the same donor will contact the nonprofit and tell them the check should have been for $100,000 and request a refund of the remaining amount.\nThe check is bogus to begin and will bounce but scam rings hope to bilk groups out of $91,250 in the meantime.\n\"So far, everyone who has contacted us has managed to catch the scam before falling victim, but with this amount of money, the scammer only needs to convince one,\" MPA said.\nThe statewide association recommends confirming the identity of donors before accepting money and asking them to wait 30 days before issuing any refunds.\nMajor banks statewide and the Montana Bankers Association have also been alerted to the fraud scheme.\nRECORD FRAUD LEVELSThe Federal Trade Commission reported Feb. 9 that U.S. consumers lost a record $10 billion to fraud schemes in 2023.\nThat is a 14% increase from 2022. Some of that jump stems from crypto currency fraud.\n\"Consumers reported losing more money to investment scams—more than $4.6 billion—than any other category in 2023. That amount represents a 21% increase over 2022. The second highest reported loss amount came from imposter scams, with losses of nearly $2.7 billion reported. In 2023, consumers reported losing more money to bank transfers and cryptocurrency than all other methods combined,\" FTC which received 2.6 million consumer complaints last year.\nThe U.S agency received 2.5 million complaints in 2022. The FTC said last year saw an increase in consumer calls involving fraud rings impersonating government officials (including police) as well as businesses.\nThe FTC received fraud reports from 2.6 million consumers last year, nearly the same amount as 2022. The most commonly reported scam category was imposter scams, which saw significant increases in reports of both business and government impersonators. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tilghman man sentenced to five years for sexual abuse of a child\n\n February 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Crime \n \n 680\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A Tilghman man was sentenced Friday to five years in prison for sexually abusing a child last February.After nearly an hour-long recess following statements from the child's family and the defense, Talbot County Circuit Judge Stephen Kehoe sentenced Eric Werner, 62, to five years of active incarceration.\n\"This is a very awful situation,\" Kehoe said prior to handing down the term.\nWerner received nearly a year of credit for time already served. He will be required to serve at least half of his sentence before being eligible for parole.\nState sentencing guidelines for the case recommended 15 to 30 years, according to Deputy State's Attorney Chelsea Endzel, who prosecuted the case and recommended 30 years of active prison time.\nThe sentence comes over three months after a jury found Werner guilty of 16 counts, including sexual abuse of a minor, third- and fourth-degree sex offenses, second-degree assault and displaying obscene matter to a minor.\nDetectives from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office began investigating Werner last February after learning of multiple child sexual abuse incidents that occurred at a home in Tilghman that month.\nPolice investigation revealed that Werner sexually assaulted a preteen girl through inappropriately touching her on three different occasions that February.\nWerner also showed the child pornographic videos, which the child remembered in detail during the trial.\nAt Friday's sentencing, Endzel emphasized Werner's \"calculated effort to groom and abuse the child\" over several months.\nWerner inserted himself into the child's life as a \"pseudo family member,\" learning what made her especially vulnerable, she said. And once the girl felt comfortable spending time with him, he began making sexual comments, increasing her self-consciousness, Endzel added.\nThings escalated further when Werner inappropriately touched the child.\nWerner always told the child not to tell anyone else about his actions, threatening the possibility of her going to jail, Endzel said, but in a show of \"astonishing strength and courage,\" the girl told a friend.\nFor the child's mother, whom the Star Democrat is not naming to protect the victim's privacy, it was difficult to see her child referred to as a victim and just as hard to put the impact into words.\n\"I have no way to measure what this has cost my daughter and … my family,\" she said.\nThe impacts were wide-ranging, she explained. Invoices added up with homeschooling and therapy. Hours of sleep were lost and anxiety built up. The child struggled \"every hour of every day.\"\n\"She — the victim, my daughter, my child — will never be the same,\" the child's mother said.\nDefense attorney Philip Cronan said it was easy for the prosecution to suspect \"nefarious intent\" with Werner's community activities involving direct contact with children, but Werner had never displayed similar behaviors, he said.\nPsychiatric evaluations deemed Werner to be a low risk for repeating similar crimes and determined he would have a high chance of success in returning to the community, he added.\nThough Cronan did not make a specific sentencing recommendation, he argued that Endzel had effectively asked for a life sentence, given Werner's age.\nWhen given a chance to speak, Werner acknowledged his actions as wrong, saying he lost his \"moral compass.\"\n\"I have no excuses and no explanations,\" he said.\nWhen released, Werner will be required to register as a Tier III sex offender — a lifetime registry in Maryland.\nHe will be under supervised probation for five years, is barred from contacting the child and must stay away from the child's home. He will also be required to complete mental health treatment.\nCronan did not give a comment following the sentencing.\nEndzel highlighted the \"huge team effort\" with the Talbot County Sheriff's Office in investigating and prosecuting the case, along with providing support to the family.\nBut above all, she commended the child for her \"bravery and strength\" throughout the process.\n\"The child victim stood up to her abuser in front of a courtroom full of strangers and found the courage to recount her abuse and withstand a grueling cross-examination,\" she said. \"This showing of tenacity and strength gives me hope that this remarkable child will one day recover from the abuse inflicted upon her and will find a way to move forward.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Officer fights to deter drivers like one who injured him\n\n February 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LYDIA HURLEY Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 739\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Less than four months after losing his legs in an attempt to stop a reckless highway driver, a Montgomery County police officer is at the forefront of a movement to crack down on negligent driving in Maryland.Sgt. Patrick Kepp plans to testify on two bills in the state capital of Annapolis this session — traveling from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, where he is still in active recovery from last October's incident.\n\"When I was brought into the conversation about new laws being created, right away, I knew it was something I wanted to do,\" Kepp said.\nRehabilitation is his first priority, he said, but treatment won't get in the way of his new mission. \"I will be there in Annapolis to make sure these bills happen,\" Kepp said.\nKepp announced his plans this week in a press briefing alongside Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich (D) and Montgomery County lawmakers who are taking up the cause with him. Kepp's story has inspired them to craft new legislation that would punish repeat offenders of reckless driving.\n\"I'm going to call it the Sgt. Pat Kepp Bill on Reckless Driving,\" Del. Greg Wims (D-Montgomery) said, calling Kepp a \"hero.\"\nReckless driving isn't a new phenomenon in Maryland. Outraged by stories of dangerous driving on the Beltway or the Ocean City Expressway, Maryland lawmakers have in years past have proposed legislation meant to stop these behaviors. This session, two other bills, separate from Kepp's, are making their way through the legislature, specifically aimed at ending the deadly game of drag racing or \"exhibition driving.\"\nBut Kepp's bill is a personal one, inspired by an officer who patrolled the sponsoring lawmakers' home district. Elrich visited Kepp while he was in recovery to propose the idea of working together on this set of bills, the officer said.\nThe two bills have not been filed, but the sponsors say they share common goals. The bills would change existing criminal law to widen the definition of what constitutes reckless and negligent driving and increase penalties for those crimes, the sponsors said.\nOne penalty they will propose is requiring offenders to appear in court for their offenses. \"It's way too easy for a driver to just pay a fine and get back on the road and do what they were doing before,\" Elrich explained.\nKepp, who worked as an officer in the alcohol initiative unit, says these bills will \"give a little more teeth to some of our laws.\" Additionally, he hopes the law will address the \"overall frustration\" with the difficulty enforcing existing reckless driving laws. The penalties aren't tough enough, he said, and the fines aren't a good enough deterrent.\nIn the early morning hours of last Oct. 18, Kepp had just finished his shift when he heard a radio report of a speeding driver on Interstate 270. He joined other officers in an attempt to stop the driver. While Kepp was standing outside of his car, the driver struck him and left him critically injured, as Elrich recounted in the press briefing.\nThe Montgomery County Police officers on duty that night knew the driver \"had a history of speeding and taunting police into chasing him,\" Elrich said. Police say the driver targeted and intentionally hit Kepp, Elrich said, and he is now being charged.\nBoth of Kepp's legs were amputated due to the injuries he sustained that night. Now he said he spends every day — from 9:45 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. — at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center undergoing rehabilitation. He joined the Zoom call for Elrich's press briefing from the medical center, wearing a blue dry-fit shirt and a short military-style haircut.\nIt has been four months since the accident, and Kepp said he has had a dozen surgeries since.\nStill, he wants to speak on behalf of legislation that \"will strengthen our laws and make our roadways safer,\" Kepp said.\nThe aim of the bills is \"not for everybody to be thrown in jail, have huge fines, or lose their licenses,\" Kepp said, but rather to end reckless driving, especially by repeat offenders.\nElrich said he hopes the law will stop people from \"ignoring lights and sirens from law enforcement, breaking the rules of the road … and performing car tricks like drifting, peeling out, and doing donuts in the middle of a road.\"\n\"All it takes is a moment's loss of control over that vehicle,\" Elrich said. \"Instead of being entertaining, it would take little to transform it into a deadly incident.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Its vociferous critics say ABATE's position is at a minimum, eccentric and at worst, dangerous.\nBut driven by a burning belief in personal freedom and a joy for riding, ABATE has used persistent, grassroots activism to keep the helmet issue alive in Maryland. It's why in nearly every legislative session since the state's mandatory helmet law took effect in 1992, the Maryland General Assembly has at least considered a bill that would make wearing a helmet optional for most riders.\n\"It's been 32 years this year to no avail,\" said Bob Spanburgh, Maryland ABATE's board chairman. \"But we keep introducing it. We have some pretty ardent supporters. We have a lot of people who think we're nuts, probably.\"\nLike many of its previous incarnations over the last three decades, this year's bill would make wearing a helmet optional if a motorcyclist is at least 21 years old, has been licensed for a minimum of two years and has completed a safety course. It is named in honor of Gary \"Pappy\" Boward, a former ABATE executive director and motorcycle rights advocate who died in 2020 of health issues.\nABATE and other supporters insist that they aren't opposed to riders wearing helmets if they so choose. But they feel the current mandate abridges freedom of choice and represents government overreach.\n\"I firmly believe that we as government do better when we educate people, (rather) than legislating something,\" said Sen. Mike McKay (R-Allegany, Garrett and Washington), the bill's primary Senate sponsor and a friend of Boward's. \"There are people that would like to have the choice (to not wear a helmet). And I tend to believe that we should give people the choice but 100% support educating them about it.\"\nEstablished in 1974, ABATE will mark 50 years of advocacy for motorcyclists' rights this June. Its animating issue has been eroding Maryland's helmet law, different iterations of which have been in place since 1968. Today, Maryland joins 16 other states and the District of Columbia in requiring all riders to wear protective headgear.\nSpanburgh, a 66-year-old retired carpenter, only casually followed politics when he joined ABATE in the mid-1980s. Initially, he saw the group as a community of like-minded individuals, who shared his enthusiasm for bikes, firearms, the outdoors and rock and roll. But right away, ABATE turned Spanburgh into an unlikely activist.\n\"At the first meeting I went to, the thing they told me (was), 'You got to register to vote. It's very important in this organization,'\" Spanburgh recalled. \"That was actually the first time I ever registered to vote in my life. I was 27 at the time.\"\nEach legislative session, the helmet bill faces cockeyed glances and prodigious odds. Contending with a wealth of scientific evidence, which shows crashes involving non-helmeted motorcyclists are much more likely to result in severe head trauma and death, the measure almost always dies in committee.\nBut ABATE ensures the issue is revived and relitigated, year after year, by finding ways to get in front of elected officials, despite limited financial resources and dwindling numbers. In the past, the group used a tactic it called \"piss house politics,\" which involved following lawmakers into the bathroom to gain an audience and get its message heard.\n\"They're diehards for what they believe in,\" said Del. Jay Jacobs (R-Caroline, Cecil, Kent and Queen Anne's). \"Thank God they do. They don't let go of this stuff. It's a tough fight over here to get that kind of legislation passed.\"\nWhile Republicans are the most likely to sympathize with ABATE's cause, the group engages lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. This year's bill, cross-filed as HB639 and SB503, has bipartisan sponsors in both chambers.\n\"I don't agree with them that they shouldn't wear a helmet, but I do agree about the civil liberty issue,\" said Sen. Jill Carter (D-Baltimore City), one of the bill's Senate co-sponsors.\n\"They are adamant as dedicated motorcyclists that this is not something they want mandated to them,\" she added.\nIn a recent hearing of the House Environment and Transportation Committee, opponents included highway safety groups, medical associations and public health officials. They argued that a weaker helmet law would increase motorcyclists' risk of injury and death, impose an avoidable burden on taxpayers and encumber the healthcare system.\n\"A lot of people might say, 'Well, it's my free will to do whatever I want to do, no matter how stupid it is,'\" Gene Ransom, CEO of MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society, said in an interview. \"The problem is, when it comes to healthcare … your decision then ends up costing the entire system a whole lot of money.\n\"Not only is it the right thing to do and the smart thing to do — logical people wear helmets when they ride a motorcycle or a bike or other things — it also is appropriate from a common good and cost point of view,\" Ransom added.\nThe bill is scheduled for a hearing before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee later this week. Spanburgh hopes to see the measure make it out of committee and get a vote on the House or Senate floor. If unsuccessful, proponents vow they won't stop trying.\n\"If I don't do it, who else is going to do it?\" said Ken Eaton, Maryland ABATE's executive director. \"We try to get other people to help us as much as possible. But if I don't do it, how can I convince other people to do it?\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Hosted by Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 108, the event's location has varied through the years. It was held this year at the Centreville United Methodist Church.\nThe event began with the Pledge of Allegiance and a moment of silence led by Sheriff Gary Hoffman. Senior Pastor Rev. Karen Handy of Centreville Methodist Church welcomed and addressed families, friends and community members.\nChase Armington, past president of Lodge 108 and current Queen Anne's County deputy began, \"Tonight, we gather to honor our fallen heroes. It is our duty to never forget them, for they have paved the path forward with their lives. The path leading us here tonight was born from tragedy. Incredible losses. Unbearable pain for our families, friends, and the community. These honored in front of you served our community with pride, dignity, and honor. Knowing their lives could, at any moment be taken, so that we may live. So that we may continue on the path they have now paved.\"\nSue Nickerson, who lost her son, Centreville Police Officer Michael Nickerson, in 2001 explains, \"The FOP from QAC started (this event) and they will always have it on February 13, the night that Michael (Nickerson) and Jason (Schwenz, Queen Anne's County deputy) were killed. But, it's to honor all emergency people who have passed away in the line of duty from Queen Anne's County.\"\nAs a mother who lost her son, this event is near to her heart. Nickerson said, \"It means a lot. It really does. QAC is willing to step up, and support the families, and acknowledge the jobs that our law enforcement, our firefighters and our EMTs have done. It is very much appreciated.\"\nFirst responders marched in for the Presentation of Colors, holding flags to honor those lost in the line of duty.\nQueen Anne's County State's Attorney Lance Richardson spoke about stoicism and how it applies here. \"The heroes we celebrate tonight were tragically taken from us. We don't have any control over that. But what we do have control over is how we respond to it, how we react, how we pick up the pieces and go on. Stoicism also places an emphasis on appreciating the unity and precious gift of life.\"\nDuring this powerful remembrance, family members came, first responder representatives saluted and all placed long-stemmed red roses by the framed photographs.\nThe names of the fallen heroes were read along with the date of their End of Watch.\nTen Queen Anne's County residents and fallen heroes' pictures filled the front table: Queen Anne's-Hillsboro Volunteer Fire Company's Daniel Lister, Sudlersville Volunteer Fire Company's \"Buck\" Clough, Kent Island Volunteer Fire Department's \"Dougie\" Thomas, United Community Volunteer Fire Department's David Brinkley, Centreville Police Department's Michael Nickerson, QA Sheriff's Deputy Jason Schwenz, DNR Warden Charles Rider, and Maryland State Police troopers Thomas Noyle, Philip Russ and Wallace Mowbray.\nRadio transmission echoed for all to hear to mark the ultimate sacrifice given on that fateful Feb. 13, 2001, \"Today we honor the memory and pay tribute to those who greatly served and protected QAC and the State of Maryland. May their dedication and sacrifice never be forgotten and may they rest in eternal peace.\" Bagpipes played 'Amazing Grace' from the balcony overhead. Silence filled every space of the church.\nHandy closed, \"Lord, you gave them the gift of courage of serving others. Lord, mend those hearts that are broken in the loss of these loved ones. Lord, we pray that this memorial tonight has brought a bit of peace. Lord, we lift up and thank you for each of these persons. We thank you and pray for those that they have left behind.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The woman has yet to be located.Kenneth Stefan Bradley, 41, is charged with kidnapping, assault and related charges in connection to Tiyavauna Britt's disappearance.\nAn arrest warrant indicated Bradley was arrested in Anne Arundel County on Monday, Feb. 19. He was ordered held without bond during a bail review in Glen Burnie District Court that day, according to court records.\nBritt, who was first reported missing to the Easton Police Department on Tuesday, Feb. 13, remains \"critically missing,\" according to charging documents authored by a Maryland State Police sergeant.\nAccording to charging documents, Britt's mother told police she had attempted to contact her daughter several times between Jan. 31 and Feb. 13, but had not been able to reach her. Several other family members were unable to make contact with Britt, her mother told police.\nBritt's mother also told police that the car typically driven by Britt was found unoccupied in the Dollar Tree parking lot in Easton.\nThe car was found unlocked with Britt's belongings inside, including her phone and wallet.\nBritt's mother said she found a note in the driver's side door of the car that appeared to be \"a list of couple goals,\" according to charging documents. Police wrote that the end of the letter said \"No phones, no kids, just us.\"\nIt was not clear who authored the note.\nAccording to charging documents, Britt's mother believed her daughter was with her ex-boyfriend, identified as Bradley. The mother feared for her daughter's safety, citing previous domestic violence history between the two.\nBradley is currently on probation for a previous assault conviction related to Britt in Talbot County.\nIn early September 2021, police responded to an alleyway in Easton, where they found Britt crying. According to charging documents in that case, Britt told police Bradley was chasing her in his truck after the two got into an argument.\nBritt told police that Bradley pulled her hair, grabbed her by the throat and choked her. He also reportedly held a pillow over her face and mouth, threatening to kill her, and told her not to leave.\nBritt was found to have abrasions on her neck consistent with being choked, along with abrasions on her wrist and redness to the back of her neck at her hairline, police wrote.\nWhile that case was still pending, police were called to an apartment in Hurlock in April 2022 for another altercation between Bradley and Britt, though that case was later placed on the stet, or inactive, docket.\nBradley was convicted of second-degree assault in Talbot County Circuit Court in June 2022 and was sentenced to 10 years, with all but time already served suspended.\nHe was placed on three years of supervised probation and ordered to complete an abusers' intervention program, though a violation of probation report filed on Feb. 16 indicated he had not provided verification of completing the course.\nIn further investigating Britt's disappearance, police spoke with three other people who knew her, all of whom said they had last heard from or seen Britt on Wednesday, Feb. 7.\nBritt's employer told police she was seen leaving work in Delaware around 3 p.m. Surveillance footage from her employer showed Britt wearing a black coat and black sweatpants, police said.\nA woman who identified herself as Britt's cousin told police she was with Britt that afternoon and heard her and Bradley having a verbal argument on the phone before the couple planned to go to dinner at Portside in Cambridge.\nThe cousin told police Britt dropped her off in Hurlock around 6 p.m., according to charging documents. The two spoke on the phone for several minutes afterward.\nPolice said a man who identified himself as an acquaintance of Britt said he received a phone call from her shortly after 7:30 p.m. The man told police he briefly spoke with Britt before hearing a male voice, adding that he believed the man with her \"started to assault\" her before the call suddenly ended.\nDetectives obtained cell tower records for Britt's phone, giving police a timeline of events leading to the last time her phone was active, according to charging documents. Police wrote that Britt was in downtown Cambridge and Great Marsh Park that evening.\nThe last known cell tower location placed Britt's phone at Great Marsh Park shortly before 8:30 p.m. Feb. 7, police wrote.\nPolice also obtained cell tower data for Bradley's phone number, which placed him in the same area and locations as Britt during that time frame.\nOfficers from the Cambridge Police Department reviewed surveillance footage between Portside and Great Marsh Park, which showed a dark-colored Chevrolet Suburban pulling into the park shortly before 7:30 p.m.\nAccording to charging documents, a Black male was seen exiting the vehicle with a woman who appeared to have her hands bound. The man walked the woman to the rear of the vehicle, opening and closing the hatch, and walked her to the front of the vehicle — out of view of the camera, police noted.\nFurther review of the camera footage revealed audio of male and female voices. Police wrote that \"sounds of loud thuds\" also were heard, which \"appear to be consistent with forceful strikes.\"\nPolice interviewed a man connected to Britt on Feb. 16, who identified the voices as Britt and Bradley.\nCharging documents said a \"dark object\" was seen lying on the ground in front of the vehicle as it drove away shortly before 8 p.m. The same vehicle was seen returning about 25 minutes later.\nPolice wrote that the footage showed a male driver leaving the vehicle and walking toward the object. Within minutes, the man was seen \"carrying and dragging\" what appeared to be a \"small statured, light skinned female\" consistent with the woman observed in the videos.\nThe man later carried the woman's \"limp body\" to the rear cargo area of the vehicle, placing other unknown items there before leaving at 8:30 p.m.\nPolice have not shared further information on Britt. Anyone with knowledge of her whereabouts is asked to contact Maryland State Police.\nBradley is set to appear for a preliminary hearing in Dorchester County District Court on March 12. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Then you make corporal, then sergeant, the first sergeant and then lieutenant. There are 23 barrack commanders in the state,\" she said.\n\"One day I had an epiphany. I knew I didn't want to go to college. I really wanted to go to work. I had no law enforcement in my family at all. None. I am still here,\" she said.\nShe has been a lieutenant for six years, working at the JFK Highway Barrack before recently being moved back to the Eastern Shore. She was a commander there for those six years.\nHer experience has helped her understand the requirements of the barrack commander job.\n\"My main responsibilities are oversight of all barrack operations. I now have three assistant commanders. The administrative staff falls under me — not just troopers, but dispatchers as well. It is a good amount. You need to know your people and what is going to motivate them,\" she said.\nFred Stanco, assistant barrack commander, said, \"(Gappert) is the captain of the ship. She is the beginning and the end of the installation. So everything is hers.\"\nGappert's jurisdiction is three counties — Dorchester, Talbot and Caroline.\n\"I love working at this barrack because we have three good sheriffs. The municipality chiefs are great. I have only been back a few weeks, but the troopers and the officers get along great. We all work together,\" she said.\n\"I think what I am looking for the most would be the relationships with the sheriffs' departments and the municipalities. We do monthly chief's meetings. So community relationships and relationships with our allied partners are important,\" she said.\nOne of the struggles she will need to work to overcome is recruitment, Gappert said. The Maryland State Police are recruiting for cadets at the end of April.\n\"It has always been a concern not having enough troopers. We are doing the best we can for right now,\" she said.\n\"The climate of getting people to want to be cops and troopers, it is exhausting trying to get people on board to do the job,\" she said.\nThey have a full time recruiter to try and get people to join.\n\"We do job fairs. We go out of state. We go to schools. The philosophy is to get them when they are young and have them go into the cadet program and then from there get them in the academy,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Why we cannot solve America's gun problem\n\n February 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LARRY PIFER | Section: Columns \n \n 614\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On Feb. 14 the shooting of at least 23 people in Kansas City abruptly halted the celebration of the Super Bowl win by the Kansas City Chiefs. At least one person is dead. At least half of the victims were under the age of 16 (one only 6). The state of Missouri has some of the most permissive gun safety laws in the country. There are no background checks required, no permit to carry a concealed gun, no restrictions on gun ownership by violent offenders, no requirement to lock up firearms and no restrictions on assault weapons. Two juveniles are charged for this slaughter.The United States has more guns than people. We have mass shootings on a weekly basis. Our laws regulating gun sales, ownership and use are some of the most lax in the world. The United States has a gun homicide rate 26 times that of other high-income countries. The second leading cause of death for children under 18 years-old is gun homicide (second only to automobile deaths). This is our shameful problem.\nMost everyone wants to fix it. Polls show that as many as 97% of us support a universal criminal background check on all gun purchases. Much of the senseless killing and mass shooting is by assault style weapons developed for use in war. The Second Amendment to the Constitution grants us the right to bear arms, but not for the unconstrained use of weapons of war to murder our fellow citizens and children.\nA large majority of us want to ban these weapons. So what prevents us from altering what we have done to ourselves? Why can't we do better in saving our children from gun violence?\nIs the latest tragedy in Kansas City a possible turning point in this terrible tale? Could the gun protectors suddenly perceive an economic impact if families cannot safely attend large gatherings and so they think twice about attending sporting events, the Easter parade or other American celebrations? Gun protectors seem unmoved by school, church or grocery store shootings, but perhaps families and individuals who value their safety above their support for guns might shy away from attending large events, costing event-organizers real money.\nPeople might be less willing to spend large sums to attend a football game with their family if they fear that others with concealed weapons might also attend.\nI truly believe that the issue lies with one party of lawmakers and politicians who have made their pact with the National Rifle Association. The elected members in one party in both the Senate and the House have consistently fought against laws that would help solve this problem. They oppose universal background checks, a ban on assault-style weapons and red flag laws that identify people who should not have guns.\nThey have successfully subverted what the citizens in the United States want. I believe that the lawmakers in one party have done this as a political weapon and message. I think they believe they must run on this stance for political gain. What a horrible, horrible thing to do. But until this stance changes, or such lawmakers are defeated, this is what we citizens, the next victims, must live with. And the framers of our Constitution did not intend for us to arm ourselves with weapons of war to defend ourselves at a celebratory parade.\nI appeal to all of you, for the sake of our children, our fellow citizens and ourselves — do not vote for any candidate who opposes an assault weapons ban, red flag laws or universal background checks on gun sales and ownership.\nOur future and our lives depend on it.\nLarry Pifer lives in Easton and is a member of the Talbot Democratic Forum. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A date remembered and honored by many in Queen Anne's County for the last 22 years the Fallen Heroes Memorial continues to be observed Feb. 13. Hosted by Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 108, the location has varied through the years but was held this year at the Centreville United Methodist Church.The event began with the Pledge of Allegiance and a moment of silence led by Sheriff Gary Hoffman. Senior Pastor Rev. Karen Handy of Centreville Methodist Church welcomed and addressed families, friends, and community members.\nChase Armington, past president of Lodge 108 and current Queen Anne's County deputy, began, \"Tonight, we gather to honor our fallen heroes. It is our duty to never forget them, for they have paved the path forward with their lives. The path leading us here tonight was born from tragedy. Incredible losses. Unbearable pain for our families, friends, and the community. These honored in front of you served our community with pride, dignity, and honor. Knowing their lives could, at any moment be taken, so that we may live. So that we may continue on the path they have now paved.\"\nThe event started from tragedy, continues years later as a way to honor and remember those who have unselfishly given their lives for others. Sue Nickerson, who lost her son, Centreville Police Officer Michael Nickerson, in 2001 explains, \"The FOP from QAC started [this event] and they will always have it on February 13th, the night that Michael [Nickerson] and Jason [Schwenz, Queen Anne's County deputy] were killed. But, it's to honor all emergency people who have passed away in the line of duty from Queen Anne's County.\"\nNickerson is the Maryland Concerns of Police Survivors (COPS) Director.\nAs a mother who lost her son, this event is near to her heart. Nickerson said, \"It means a lot. It really does. QAC is willing to step up, and support the families, and acknowledge the jobs that our law enforcement, our firefighters, and our EMTs have done. It is very much appreciated.\"\nFirst responders marched in for the Presentation of Colors, holding flags to honor those lost in the line of duty. Queen Anne's County State's Attorney, Lance Richardson, spoke about stoicism and how it applies here. \"The heroes we celebrate tonight were tragically taken from us. We don't have any control over that. But what we do have control over is how we respond to it, how we react, how we pick up the pieces and go on. Stoicism also places an emphasis on appreciating the unity and precious gift of life.\"\nRichardson went on to quote the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, \"When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive — to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.\" Applying this quote, Richardson said, \"So, tonight, we honor those who gave the ultimate sacrifice, their lives, so we could go on living our lives in peace and safety.\" He ended by encouraging all to 'earn this.' \"We must continue to honor these brothers and sisters, live a life that would be a testament to their memory, and continue to do God's will and God's work.\"\nDuring this powerful remembrance, family members came, first responder representatives saluted, and all placed long-stemmed red roses by the framed photographs. The names of the fallen heroes were read along with the date of their End of Watch. Ten Queen Anne's County residents and fallen heroes' pictures filled the front table: Queen Anne's-Hillsboro Volunteer Fire Company's Daniel Lister, Sudlersville Volunteer Fire Company''s \"Buck\" Clough, Kent Island Volunteer Fire Department's \"Dougie\" Thomas, United Community Volunteer Fire Department''s David Brinkley, Centreville Police Department's Michael Nickerson, QA Sheriff's Deputy Jason Schwenz, DNR Warden Charles Rider, and Maryland State Police troopers Thomas Noyle, Philip Russ, and Wallace Mowbray.\nRadio transmission echoed for all to hear to mark the ultimate sacrifice given on that fateful Feb. 13, 2001, \"Today we honor the memory and pay tribute to those who greatly served and protected QAC and the State of Maryland. May their dedication and sacrifice never be forgotten and may they rest in eternal peace.\" Bagpipes played 'Amazing Grace' from the balcony overhead. Silence filled every space of the church.\nHandy closed, \"Lord, you gave them the gift of courage of serving others. Lord, mend those hearts that are broken in the loss of these loved ones. Lord, we pray that this memorial tonight has brought a bit of peace. Lord, we lift up and thank you for each of these persons. We thank you and pray for those that they have left behind.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "State lawmakers hope to protect judges’ privacy\n\n February 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TYRAH BURRIS Capital News Service | Section: General Assembly \n \n 629\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Just a few months after a Maryland judge was killed in front of his home, state lawmakers are considering a measure that would remove personal information from the internet to provide more safety for judges.The Judge Andrew F. Wilkinson Judicial Security Act is named after the judge, who was shot and killed in his driveway in October 2023 by a man he'd ruled against in a custody dispute.\nSponsors hope the proposed change would provide more safety to judges and their families.\n\"The threats that happen to the members of the judiciary, they happen all the time,\" said Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City), House sponsor. \"It's a very challenging job to begin with, but a particularly challenging job when you add on the threats that they face and their families face.\"\nWilkinson isn't the only judge whose life was put in danger. All cross the country, state legislatures are looking to beef up protections for judges. In 2022, Congress passed the Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act, in honor of the son of New Jersey Federal judge Esther Salas. Salas was targeted by a lawyer who found her address and personal information online. Her son was gunned down in their family home. That law allows federal judges to remove personal information from federal government websites, according to a statement on the United States Courts website.\nDuring the 2024 legislative session, the Maryland General Assembly is trying to do something similar. The bill would protect the privacy of judges by removing or prohibiting personal information from being published on the internet or any form of social media. The bill passed in the Senate and now moves on to the House.\nWatchdog and advocacy groups in other states that have considered similar legislation have raised concerns about the possibility of withholding too much information about elected and appointed officials, who ultimately answer to the public. In a committee hearing, Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore) expressed concerns that the effort could be too broad.\n\"While I understand there was a specific concern about people posting and immediately wanting to be able to act, that was just one circumstance, and I just thought it was too broad,\" Sydnor said in an interview with Capital News Service.\nAfter Wilkinson was killed, Jason DeLoach, the president of the Maryland State Bar Association, said he began working with others to put the bill together.\n\"When Judge Wilkinson was tragically murdered, I looked his wife in the eye at his service and I told her that the MSBA would be actively involved in making sure that we improve judicial security and doing everything we can to prevent this type of thing from happening again,\" he said during an interview with CNS.\nAs an attorney, DeLoach said he thinks that it's important to trust that a case will be resolved based on the facts and evidence of the case.\n\"We don't want the judge to have to think about anything other than the facts and the evidence,\" he said. \"When judges are being threatened, or there's a potential for violence, that may persuade them on how they're going to rule.\"\nShortly before he died, Wilkinson ruled against his shooter in a divorce case granting the man's ex-wife custody of their children. Police suspect that was the motive for the shooting later that night.\nStephanie Wilkinson, the wife of Judge Wilkinson, said in her testimony before lawmakers that the gunman ambushed Wilkinson while he stepped outside to take a walk.\n\"I am devastated that I lost my husband, but my heart is beyond repair that my children have lost their father,\" she said. \"Please help make things right by supporting this bill. By doing so you will assure my children, and the children Drew saved that day in this domestic case, that he did not die in vain.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland Democrats close in on refined juvenile justice bill\n\n February 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPH QUINN Capital News Service | Section: General Assembly \n \n 789\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Democratic leaders are \"very close\" to agreement on adjustments to their controversial juvenile justice bill, including changes to the list of crimes that should qualify children ages 10 through 12 for delinquency jurisdiction, a key lawmaker said Thursday.Sen. Will Smith (D-Montgomery) said discussions on the bill are \"still an iterative process,\" but that the bill's architects plan to limit under-13 jurisdiction to regulated firearms violations and third-degree sex offenses. An earlier version of the bill included auto thefts, among other crimes.\nIn addition, Smith said, leaders are also looking at changes to improve the process for referring young people to rehabilitation services, through what is known as the \"Child in Need of Supervision\" petition.\n\"It's to hold the entire system accountable and to ensure that youth get the support and the treatment that they need,\" Smith told Capital News Service in an interview Thursday afternoon.\nDemocratic leaders have been negotiating behind the scenes as they try to reconcile their initial proposal, introduced in January, with testimony and data pouring in from prosecutors, public defenders, victims and youth advocates.\nNow, after months of briefings and hours of testimony in House and Senate committees, they are closing in on an amended bill that will present their refined plan for holding young people, as well as adults in government, accountable for youth rehabilitation.\nWhatever they may ultimately pass will be an update to the Juvenile Justice Reform Act, approved by Maryland lawmakers in 2022 to protect the rights of children and improve their chances at turning their lives around.\nCurrently, lawmakers are negotiating a \"more prescriptive and clear\" Child in Need of Supervision process, which would unfold in court and create a paper trail rather than being handled informally by the Juvenile Services department.\n\"We're trying to make sure that there's an actual more formalized, universal application of CINS across the state,\" Smith said.\nAnother change they are considering has to do with what happens when a young person fails to show up for two or more rehabilitation treatment appointments.\n\"You can have probation extended if you miss treatment,\" Smith said, \"but you cannot be incarcerated.\"\nIn addition, he said, public defenders pointed out that many young people under 13 aren't competent to stand trial, and they aren't getting rehabilitation services during the time when they are working to gain that competency.\n\"There are no services provided while that process is happening,\" he said. \"And this whole thing is about getting kids and families services and supports.\"\nThe lawmakers have also been looking at data in their deliberations, especially about which crimes have spiked among young offenders, Smith said. That data is guiding decisions about expanded jurisdiction and other matters.\nIn addition to data, hearings in February brought emotional testimony into the spotlight.\nSome lawmakers questioned whether the January proposal went too far to reverse the reform measures — and whether it was overly influenced by media accounts and public perception that youth crime is out of control.\n\"During the hearing, I kept asking, where's the data?\" said Sen. Charles Sydnor (D-Baltimore County). \"At times, we've allowed the media to drive our policy, and we're supposed to be data-driven. So show me the data.\"\nChildren under 13 accounted for less than 3.5% of all Juvenile Services intakes during the latest fiscal year for offenses the January proposal wanted to add, including deadly weapon, handgun, motor vehicle theft and misdemeanor sex offenses. That's down from 6.5% the year before reforms went into effect, according to a racial equity impact note released Tuesday by the Department of Legislative Services.\n\"Everyone agrees that auto thefts are up for adults and juveniles,\" said Sen. Jill Carter (D-Baltimore City). \"But the issue is that kids 12 and under doing it is miniscule.\"\nAmid assertions that the bill would worsen racial inequality in Maryland's juvenile justice system, some witnesses speaking in support of the January bill have pointed out that youth crime also victimizes communities of color.\nBaltimore Deputy District Public Defender Alycia Capozello said in one recent hearing that the original proposal would disproportionately punish \"little boys of color who historically have been adultified.\"\nGordon Pack, who spent almost 43 years in prison after being tried as an adult when he was 15, said he thinks lawmakers should build up the state's offerings of rehabilitative services and treatments before putting more kids into formal involvement with the juvenile justice system.\n\"All they're trying to do is equip law enforcement with another tool to address things, and they want to think that law enforcement will take the best tool in that situation,\" Pack said. \"And this is how we're supposed to think. If you're a legislator, you're supposed to think like that.\"\nStill, Pack said he thought lawmakers were moving too fast with the initial version of the bill.\n\"I think,\" he said, \"they've got to be cautious.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

During the training, operators are subject to challenging scenarios to help provide CPR instructions more proficiently.\n\"The results have been phenomenal,\" Rose said. \"We have doubled, and in some cases tripled, the number of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Charles County. They're walking out of a hospital after they've stopped breathing.\"\n\"We also reported that we had improved the application of bystander CPR from 27% to 43%, improved bystander application of an AED from 23.5% to 28.6% and saw the number of survivors that were discharged from the hospital increase from five to eleven,\" a written testimony Rose provided to the board said.\n\"It reminds me of an incident when I used to coach soccer,\" Commissioner Ralph E. Patterson II (D) said. \"We had a cardiac arrest incident.\"\nPatterson recalled how the operator he talked to was calm and helped guide those present through the situation, underscoring the importance of legislation like House Bill 1092.\n\"Currently, Charles County is the only jurisdiction that participates in this program,\" Rose said. \"This bill would make it mandatory for 911 centers to provide, not necessarily this particular program, but one similar to it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Cornish was given an active sentence of 10 years in prison and will have to serve half of that due to it being a violent offense. He was also given five years of supervised probation upon his release.\n\"This is a tragedy all the way around,\" Densford said. \"The Cornish family is grieving because there's some sort of prison, but the end of that sentence was 'but they can visit him in the Talbot County Detention Center. We have to go to a cemetery.' That's obvious to everyone.\"\nBefore the sentencing, family members of Brooks and Cornish gave statements to the judge for consideration. Brooks' family described him as a caring and spiritual man. They said that Brooks would mentor the youth around him and provide his best guidance.\nTyniqua Fooks, Brooks' daughter, said he was a wonderful man and a fantastic grandfather to her two-year-old daughter. Fooks said that Brooks made a promise to her that he would be there for all the special moments in his granddaughter's life.\n\"Unfortunately, that promise was taken away from my father,\" Fooks said. \"She will no longer be able to see her grandfather… He won't be at any of those special moments in her life. It has been hard for me to describe them and move on.\"\nCornish's family described Cornish as a kind, shy, loving, but, most importantly, a protective young man to the people around him and the animals he loved.\n\"We are here today due to unfortunate circumstances, and I offer my most sincere apologies to all who have been affected,\" Sara Ringold, Cornish's mother, said. \"This has not been easy to grasp by any means. I hope that my son is not defined by this moment because this is not who he is.\"\nThe charges stem from an incident that occurred Aug. 7, when Easton Police responded at about 7 p.m. to the area of 104 Blake Street in reference to someone who had just been shot and was lying in the grass. They rendered aid until paramedics arrived, but Brooks succumbed to his injuries at the scene.\nAccording to statements, Brooks argued with individuals operating a 2018 Land Rover Range Rover parked in the 100 Block of Blake Street. Brooks left the area in a vehicle, police said, and later returned operating an ATV. He confronted the same individuals with a shotgun and a fanny pack with additional shells, police said.\nAfter exchanging, Cornish, who was seated in the driver seat of the Range Rover, fired shots through the front passenger seat window and struck Brooks, police said. Brooks fell off the ATV as the Range Rover fled the scene. Cornish disposed of the Range Rover in a parking lot and abandoned the weapon in a river.\nAttorney Molly Fox told the judge that Cornish came to her in August when a warrant went out for his arrest to review his options, and he decided to turn himself into the police. Cornish had no prior arrests. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

He was released on his own recognizance.\nThe investigation began in October when a tipster reported to Newark Police that he had witnessed Gordon-Somers engaging in hand-to-hand drug transactions inside the restaurant, which is a popular nightlife destination among University of Delaware students. He also alleged that Gordon-Somers used drugs to take sexual advantage of young male staffers, according to court records.\nIt's not clear if police investigated at the time, as the narrative provided in court documents doesn't pick back up until December, when plainclothes officers in the Street Crimes Unit encountered Gordon-Somers during an unrelated drug investigation.\nThe unit was working with a cooperating witness, who had arranged to purchase cocaine from a drug dealer. The witness learned that the dealer had to go to Main Street to pick up cocaine from a supplier.\nOfficers watched as the dealer pulled into the City of Newark's Lot 2, a public parking lot on the north side of Main Street, across the street from Grotto Pizza. The lot is partially reserved for employees of downtown businesses, who can purchase monthly parking permits there.\nGordon-Somers arrived on foot, and he and the dealer both got into Gordon-Somers' SUV, which was already parked in Lot 2. Police observed Gordon-Somers hand something to the dealer, according to court records.\nPolice then scoured surveillance footage from Lot 2 and found footage of an earlier incident in which Gordon-Somers and another Grotto employee got into Gordon-Somer's SUV. Gordon-Somers handed the employee something from the center console, and the employee could be seen snorting a substance two separate times. After wiping his noise, the employee and Gordon-Somers walked back to Grotto Pizza, court documents indicate.\nOfficers continued to monitor surveillance footage throughout January and February. On Valentine's Day, the cameras captured footage of Gordon-Somers getting into his vehicle in Lot 2 shortly before noon. Another man got into the passenger seat and they conducted a hand-to-hand drug transaction, court documents allege.\nPolice obtained a search warrant for Gordon-Somers's vehicle and pulled him over Feb. 23 as he drove on Elkton Road. Inside the vehicle, police found 23 grams of cocaine, packaged in 15 baggies. Officers also determined that Gordon-Somers' Maryland driver's license had been revoked.\nAccording to court records, Gordon-Somers told police he had been selling cocaine for two years and specifically admitted to at least four drug sales in Lot 2 and Lot 1, which is located behind Grotto Pizza. He also admitted snorting cocaine inside his vehicle.\nAccording to Gordon-Somers' LinkedIn profile, he has worked for Grotto Pizza since 2012. A 2020 post on the restaurant's Facebook page hailed Gordon-Somers as an \"all-star\" employee who started as a dishwasher and worked his way up to become general manager.\n\"Michael has been suspended from employment and is not permitted on the property pending the outcome of his trial,\" Grotto Pizza President Jeffrey Gosnear said in a statement. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Antonio Hayes (D-Baltimore City) said he was voting in a Finance Committee meeting when a member of the press texted him about a security threat to the State House. A few minutes later, a state trooper in the room notified committee members to shelter in place, before they were escorted out of the building.\n\"I wish I would have gotten a text message internally before I got one externally, but I think just given the series of events, it is what it is,\" Hayes said.\nThe incident occurred around 5 p.m. Thursday when an anonymous call was made to the Annapolis City Police Department threatening to target the state capitol. After nearly two hours of lockdown, the Maryland Capitol Police determined there was no evidence of a potential threat.\nThe Senate and House of Delegates convened Friday, each opening their floor sessions with a standing ovation for the law enforcement officers who sprang into action.\n\"Yesterday was certainly a very scary moment for many, a very intense moment, but a moment when our first responders did everything that they were supposed to do and kept everyone safe, followed protocol and really responded to a very intense situation appropriately,\" Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore County) told reporters Friday.\nCapital News Service reached out to a spokesperson for the Department of General Services, which oversees the Maryland Capitol Police, who provided no comment on the communication efforts by law enforcement.\n\"The one thing you can't have happen is, you don't want to over alert or over alarm the people you're trying to protect,\" said Sen. Will Folden (R-Frederick), who also serves as an active duty police officer in the city of Frederick. \"It's a necessary element to only provide absolutely necessary information to not create panic.\"\nThe incident occurred just days after the General Assembly signed a contract with Motorola to incorporate a text message alert system for state officials in the State House complex, according to Ferguson. That system is still being built, he said, and was not in use at the time of the threat.\n\"Within the structure we have right now, (state troopers) did an amazing job. I think we all would like a world in which we had a text service to keep us informed.\" said Sen. Sarah Elfreth (D-Anne Arundel).\nHayes added, \"I didn't even realize that we were in the middle of negotiating a text messaging contract, which I think would have been helpful.\"\nWhile it isn't clear when the alert system will be up and running, lawmakers expressed gratitude for police efforts yesterday. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As a member of this nation's youth, I live in fear. Although possession of a firearm is meant to protect, it has proven repeatedly that it can be used to harm or even end lives. The nation has seen this recently, such as the shooting at the Chief's Super Bowl parade or the Parkland shooting six years prior.\nI expect this double-edged sword will continue to be a hot-seat issue for this nation's politics for a long time. As said in the op-ed piece, politicians are not concerned about the idea of gun control, but rather how they can sway voters toward their campaigns. These politicians prevent our nation from solving this major issue for all people in this country by rejecting proposed policies that would help the cause, such as universal background checks.\nUltimately, if we were to get past these politicians and their negligence, we could create a future for Americans to live without fear of being a victim to gun violence. This initiative does not need to be immediate. Realistically, it will be a gradual process that I may not even see in my lifetime, but I am hopeful that one day the fear that many hold for gun violence ceases.\nCLYDE FORMILLEZA JR.\nNewark, Delaware \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Juveniles carrying guns and firing upon a parade of innocent civilians should show that this is a crucial conversation to have.I agree that in Missouri there needs to be better gun safety laws such as background checks and permits to carry. A requirement to lock up firearms countrywide is essential in a household because juveniles like this can get guns from family members.\nI agree that it is an issue that one party has made an agreement with the National Rifle Association, and they have their bias toward it. Opposing criminal background checks does not seem safe or smart in any capacity. Some lawmakers change and alter their ideals purposefully to receive votes. I do not think guns should be completely outlawed and banned. I think everyone should have the right to own a firearm barring obvious constraints such as mental illness or a criminal record.\nHowever, there absolutely needs to be background checks across the country and ensuring that guns in the house are locked up and out of reach from children.\nJOSEPH MURPHY\nNewark, Delaware \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ross stated that Rider had been voluntarily admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital and issued a bench warrant for Rider's failure to appear in court that morning.\nA tentative trial date has been scheduled for Aug. 19 at 9 a.m., according to the Maryland Electronic Courts website.\nAccording to court documents, the bench warrant can be executed once Rider has been released from Johns Hopkins Hospital.\nThe $20,000 unsecured bond that Rider had been released on in February 2023 also was revoked Monday.\nRider's attorney Stephanie Shipley filed a motion Friday to postpone the trial, according to court documents. In the motion, it states that Rider had been admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital \"on an emergency basis for acute medical issues, with further transfer planned to an inpatient facility in the State of Maryland.\"\nOn the same day, the State's Attorney's Office issued its position on the defendant's motion to postpone the trial. According to court documents, the state's consent to the postponement was contingent upon \"further appropriate medical documentation.\"\nShipley presented an updated letter from Johns Hopkins Hospital at the status hearing Monday morning.\nThe 15 charges Rider faces stem from a Nov. 24, 2022, incident where firefighters responded to a fire at Rider's home at 27930 Peach Orchard Road in Easton.\nDeputy State Fire Marshal Shayne McKinney, who investigated the fire and authored the incident narrative, wrote in charging documents that a Talbot County deputy responding to the scene informed him Rider had possibly attempted suicide that evening based on evidence found within the home. Rider had attempted suicide in the past as well, according to the deputy.\nAccording to court documents, a person connected to Rider told officials he had called Rider several times that evening, adding that Rider had clearly indicated to him that he was attempting suicide and wanted to be left alone. Charging documents indicated that Rider told the person that he lit the house on fire during their conversation.\nRider was located a short distance away from the home and transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton for emergency care.\nThrough investigation, officials identified the fire as an act of human intervention with an open flame, classifying the cause of fire as incendiary.\nAccording to court documents, Rider's reckless conduct in igniting the house on fire \"clearly\" put emergency services personnel, specifically more than 45 firefighters who responded, in danger as they suppressed the fire.\nRider was arrested in February 2023 and released on a $20,000 unsecured bond.\nIn April 2023, Rider entered a plea of not criminally responsible by reason of insanity, according to documents filed in court. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lawmakers work toward juvenile justice solution\n\n March 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPH QUINN Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 994\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Lawmakers are moving toward consensus on changes to Maryland's juvenile justice system, discussing how to address crime by children ages 10 to 12 and get them into rehabilitation programs that can help.The House and Senate have each passed their own version in this effort, and lawmakers are now turning to the task of agreeing on a shared solution.\nThe main point of contention between the two bills now is whether kids who are being shielded from prosecution should go to programs without Department of Juvenile Services involvement or, instead, go into a Juvenile Services process that would play out in court.\n\"I think that what it comes down to is both sides want to find some way prior to the child being put directly into DJS, of having a stop on the way before that happens,\" said Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City), co-sponsor of the House bill.\nSen. Will Smith (D-Montgomery), co-sponsor in the Senate, said that in discussions to agree on a single bill, lawmakers will \"do whatever makes sense to ensure that, obviously, our youth have the supports to succeed and public safety is upheld.\"\nBut as the measures advance, they also differ on the crimes that would trigger mandatory rehabilitation.\nThe House bill would give kids accused of auto theft or firearms violations for the first time a chance to avoid court by participating in a so-called \"diversion program\" chosen by the arresting officer. Such a program is meant to offer services and divert a child from entering the juvenile justice system.\nThe Senate bill would send kids accused of auto theft for the first time to court through an existing DJS procedure, known as the \"Child in Need of Supervision\" process.\nIn current law, when law enforcement or a member of the public reports someone as a Child in Need of Supervision, a DJS intake officer can decide whether to refer the young person to services or file a \"CINS petition\" in court. A CINS petition asks the judge to assess the case and decide on an appropriate intervention.\nThe amended Senate bill would require the filing of a petition in court, but only in cases of children under 13 accused of auto theft for the first time.\nWhile a judge could choose from a range of options in such cases — such as community-based services, a substance abuse rehabilitation program or an out-of-home placement — incarceration would not be on the table. And if a child did not complete the rehabilitation, the judge could recall them to court.\nLawmakers are also working to address lapses of communication between police and DJS with their bills.\nBoth bills would require police to file a written report with DJS when they refer a young person to services or take them into custody. The CINS petition required in the Senate bill would also create a written record that would go into a child's case history.\nSmith said that by requiring an intake officer to send children before a judge, the Senate bill will allow children \"to have the ability to get services and support, but there will be a level of accountability there.\"\nBoth bills would specify that if a child repeats the same offense a second time, they could be sent to court with the possibility of incarceration.\nClippinger said he's \"happy to hear more from the Senate\" but that creating a separate CINS process for children ages 10 to 12 accused of auto theft could create confusion.\n\"The special kind of CINS, at least how it is described to me, sounds an awful lot like just putting kids at the Department of Juvenile Services,\" Clippinger said. CINS \"has been administered disparately\" by DJS, he added.\nEven with these changes, the amended bills have failed to win the approval of some youth advocates and public defenders.\n\"Only one diversion for a kid who's 10, 11 or 12 is not going to solve the problem of whether they're competent to stand trial,\" said Kimber Watts, attorney in the Forensic Mental Health Division at the Maryland Office of the Public Defender.\nWhen a young person is charged with a crime, they undergo a process to determine whether they are \"competent\" to understand the court proceedings. During this process, they can only receive services to help them attain competency.\nIn cases when children are ruled incompetent, Watts said, \"then we're high and dry, and we can't get them whatever it is they need.\"\nBoth versions of the bill moved through their chambers with largely favorable votes, with support from Democrats and Republicans.\nSen. William Folden (R-Frederick) said that while the Senate bill wasn't \"as far-reaching as we would like to have had,\" it would help hold kids accountable for their rehabilitation.\n\"That's an important component, being able to have that recall authority of the judge to say that their sentencing and their guidelines have some teeth,\" Folden said.\nNeither bill would change a 2022 law that bars police from interrogating minors before they have consulted with an attorney.\n\"There are parents that want law enforcement to be in contact with their child and say, 'Listen, you're going down a bad path. Don't do this. This is why,'\" said Folden. \"That type of candid dialogue is now gone because the officer can't talk (with the young person) even with parental consent.\"\nThe House and Senate both amended their bills to move up the work of the proposed Commission on Juvenile Justice Reform and Emerging Best Practices from October to July. The House bill would push back the implementation date of its other measures to January to give some jurisdictions time to stand up diversion programs, while the rest of the Senate bill would go into effect Oct. 1.\nDel. Cheryl Pasteur (D-Baltimore County) said she decided to vote for the bill because the House had \"ameliorated\" penalties for 10- to 12-year-olds. She urged her colleagues to use the commission to prioritize prevention of youth crime.\n\"We have commissions, and sometimes the seats don't get filled. We don't take them seriously,\" Pasteur said. \"This time, we need to take it seriously.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A detective was able to locate both of the vehicles, and they came to a stop on Ryceville Road in Mechanicsville.\nThe alleged shooter, David Hardester, 42, of Mechanicsville, cooperated with responding officers and was detained after a felony stop was conducted, according to charging documents.\nThe document says an officer asked Hardester where he was coming from and he said, \"Down there at the Aqualand neighborhood. I was just going to talk with him.\"\nHardester was asked how he knew the man he allegedly shot at, to which he told officers that his wife knew him, the document says.\nOfficers talked to the other man who said Hardester was going to meet him at his house and that he was expecting a fight with him because Hardester was aware that the man was talking to his estranged wife, according to charging documents.\nThe man told officers that he believed they would have a fist fight and \"get it over with as men,\" charging documents say.\nThe two met in a parking area by the man's residence and began arguing when the man began to walk away. When his back was turned, he heard a loud gunshot, felt a \"whiz\" allegedly from a bullet go past him and ran from Hardester, the document says.\nUpon taking Hardester into custody, police allegedly located live ammunition and Hardester's 9 mm handgun, which was later determined to be his service weapon.\nAccording to the charging documents, Hardester's driver's door had damage consistent with a gunshot entering the door panel from inside the truck and exiting out the door.\nOfficers were able to obtain video footage that was consistent with the victim's story.\nHardester's estranged wife came to the scene at Ryceville Road and informed officers that before the alleged shooting Hardester had assaulted her at her home in St. Mary's County after finding out about her new relationship, charging documents say.\nHardester informed her that he was going to go to the man's house and allegedly grabbed her, slammed her into a wall and left the residence. Hardester's estranged wife took the opportunity to warn the man that Hardester was coming, the document says.\nCurrently, Hardester is suspended without pay, according to the Prince George's County Police Department. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was found guilty on all counts — which included first- and second-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault, robbery and firearms charges — in both trials.\nA motion for a new trial for the death of Fields, filed by Williams' defense in late January, was denied at the sentencing hearing Monday.\nAccording to court documents, Williams' defense argued there was insufficient evidence to support that a robbery had occurred and that Williams had intended to kill or harm Fields. His defense included in the motion that evidence related to Daniels' death was \"unintentionally admitted and sent back\" to the jury in the trial for the death of Fields.\nAccording to court documents, in response, the state said the motion for a new trial should be denied because the evidence \"clearly supported a conviction on all counts,\" and said none of the jurors had knowledge of the Daniels case.\n\"'Taijay Daniels' would be nothing more than a 'John Doe' to the seated jurors,\" the state's response to the motion says.\nAt the sentencing hearing, Jones denied the request for a new trial. He said there was sufficient evidence to prove that Williams was responsible for the death of Fields.\nJones said there was an extensive voir dire to make sure no jurors in the Fields trial knew anything about the Daniels case. He said that when the document related to Daniels' death was given to the jury on the Fields case, the jury was told to disregard it.\n\"And they did,\" he said.\nBefore the sentencing was handed over on Monday, Williams was given the opportunity to speak. He said he was sorry to the families of Daniels and Fields, and maintained his innocence. Williams said he thought he could benefit from going to a psychiatric hospital.\nThe events that resulted in the deaths of Daniels and Fields took place on Dec. 8, 2022. That day, the Cambridge Police Department responded to two shootings in the span of a few hours.\nDuring the trial for Daniels' death, Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard said Daniels was found dead from multiple gunshot wounds on Pleasant Street, one of which was fired at close range.\nSurveillance footage shown in court showed Daniels' last minutes walking past a corner market, followed by Williams shortly after. A video from an apartment complex on Pleasant Street showed a man identified as Williams approaching Daniels with a gun. Daniels dropped his phone as Williams extended his arm, shooting him in the back.\nThen, Williams shot again, striking Daniels in the head twice before taking his belongings and leaving.\nDuring the trial for Fields' death, Leonard said Cambridge police had found Fields lying in his front yard. He had been shot once in the head at close range and robbed of the keys to his Chrysler 300, she said.\nPolice testified that Fields' car keys and Daniels' phone were recovered from Williams the night he was arrested.\nAt the sentencing hearing, members of both Daniels' and Fields' families spoke.\nDaniels' mother, Barbara Gabbin called her son a giver, adding that he was \"full of love.\"\n\"Taijay was my world,\" she said.\nFields' daughter Lauren Davis wrote a letter to her deceased father, which she read at the sentencing.\n\"I have been so lost without you,\" she said, later adding that she would give anything for just one more day, one more second with him. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "CPD juvenile crime report shows juvenile referrals, vehicle thefts are up\n\n March 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 631\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — The number of juvenile referrals made by the Cambridge Police Department has increased since 2021, according to a CPD report that looks at juvenile crime from 2021 to 2023.Juvenile referrals are incident reports, written by the police department, that are sent to the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services. According to the report, CPD issued 114 juvenile referrals in 2023. The year before, in 2022, 111 juvenile referrals were issued.\nIn 2021, 63 juvenile referrals were issued.\nCambridge Police Chief Justin Todd said that with juvenile referrals, instead of arresting a child and bringing them back to the police department to be charged, the Department of Juvenile Services steps in.\n\"Say two children get involved in an assault,\" Todd said. \"They fight each other, there's no serious injuries. We do juvenile referrals and send them to Juvenile Services so Juvenile Services can do their part by following up with the child and the parents, instead of (CPD) actually going through an arrest practice with them.\"\nTodd said a change in juvenile laws has contributed to this rise in referrals.\nUnder the Maryland Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2022, children under the age of 13 can only be charged with crimes of violence, which include murder, robbery, carjacking and first-degree assault, among other offenses considered violent.\nIn its report, CPD states that this act has also made it so that most children are released by police to a parent or guardian unless they are arrested on a warrant or writ issued by the court, or they have a violation involving a firearm or crime of violence.\n\"So instead of charging a child, we just send a report on over to the Juvenile Services and let it be handled at that level, since it's not a crime of violence,\" Todd said about the referrals.\nThe CPD report also shows that the number of juvenile warrant arrests recorded in Cambridge has decreased 80%, from 25 to five, between 2022 and 2023.\nTodd noted this change is significant and said it could possibly be attributed to the change in laws as well.\n\"It's simply because we're not receiving the court orders or the warrants to go and file paperwork against juveniles,\" he said.\nOther than the referrals, Todd said there isn't a huge difference in the data over three years. He said the area where CPD is seeing a big difference is stolen vehicle cases involving youth.\nFrom 2021 to 2023, the number of motor vehicle thefts has gone up from 15 to 102. The CPD report states that for 15 reports of vehicle theft in 2021, 10 cases involved juvenile suspects.\nFor the 102 reports of vehicle theft in 2023, 29 cases involved juvenile suspects.\nIn the report, CPD said that in 2023, all of the juvenile offenders caught and charged with vehicle theft were immediately released due to changes in state law.\n\"Through investigation and statistical analysis, we have determined that the overwhelming suspect profiles for these crimes are male juveniles under the age of 16,\" the report said. \"But we have detained suspects as young as 11 for stealing vehicles in Cambridge.\"\nAccording to the report, there is one 12-year-old that has been arrested for vehicle theft 11 times in the past three years.\nAs the number of vehicle thefts have increased in Cambridge, Todd said the current juvenile laws have affected what police can do when the suspect is a child.\n\"We can't interview that juvenile after we arrested him because of the new juvenile laws,\" he said. \"... We can't go and do an interrogation or anything without first asking — not even permission from the parents — we have to have (the child) obtain a lawyer.\"\nTodd said it's unlikely a lawyer would have the child speak with the police in this instance.\n\"So that's where our juvenile laws really are starting to affect us,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Jury acquits woman who stabbed two women in neighborhood fight\n\n March 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1193\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A woman maintained that she stabbed two women in self-defense during a dispute that turned physical on the street of a neighborhood near North East in August and a Cecil County Circuit Court jury apparently believed her or concluded that prosecutors fell short of proving otherwise, acquitting the defendant of attempted second-degree murder, first-degree assault and all other charges on Thursday.Jurors deliberated approximately two hours at the conclusion of a three-day-long trial before finding the defendant — Lacey N. Siple, 31 — not guilty across the board. Assistant State's Attorney Ellis Rollins prosecuted the case. Siple was represented by Assistant Public Defender Denise Winston. Cecil County Circuit Court Judge William W. Davis Jr. presided at trial.\nTestimony showed that an ongoing dispute between Siple and other people in the Cedar Hill neighborhood, including the two women who suffered stab wounds, cropped up a few times over several days. The disharmony purportedly related to one of Siple's children shooting other kids in the neighborhood with a toy gun that is typically used to fire gel balls. The dispute came to a head in the unit block of Cedar Hill Circle at approximately 9:30 p.m. of Aug. 30 when, according to state witnesses, Siple and the two women got into an argument that turned physical.\nTestifying as state witnesses, the two woman who suffered stab wounds admitted to macing Siple during the altercation — but qualified that they did so after she became aggressive, lunging at them.\nOne woman testified that Siple stabbed her near the shoulder, causing blood to squirt out from the gash, and then stabbed her in the back as she retreated. She suffered a total of four stab wounds, according to state testimony.\nThe other woman suffered knife wounds, including on her arm and hand. Ambulance crews drove the wounded women to a Delaware hospital for treatment. One law enforcement officer testified that first responders applied a tourniquet to the arm of one of women because her wound was so severe. The ground was covered in blood where the incident occurred and there was at least one blood trial leading to a nearby residence, according to testimony.\nSiple testified on her own behalf, giving an account that was similar to another defense witness, a female friend of hers..\nThey testified that the two women who suffered stab wounds were part of a mob that descended upon them on the street in front of Siple's residence and threatened them, as they were walking to Siple's home to pick up pizza that Siple had forgotten. Siple testified that she had forgotten the pizza because moments earlier, before the mob showed up, four masked men got out of of vehicle and ran toward her children while making threats, prompting them to run into their friend's residence, where they had planned to eat dinner. Siple's friend testified that she volunteered to accompany Siple back to her place to retrieve the forgotten pizza, because it was clear that Siple was terrified.\nSiple testified that a man punched her in the face, as the mob behind him started closing in. \"I thought I was going to die. I thought they would stomp me,\" Siple testified.\nAfter Siple had been pepper-sprayed by one of the women, Siple grabbed her knife and started flailing her arms blindly, Siple told jurors. \"I was just trying to get home, trying to get home with my kids. I didn't mean to hurt anybody,\" Siple sobbed on the witness stand, maintaining that she didn't realize that she had stabbed anyone.\nHer friend testified that she pulled out her own pepper-spray container and squirted it toward the mob surrounding Siple, causing people to back away and giving her an opening to grab Siple and lead her away. During her testimony, that woman emphasized a few times that the events were frenzied and unfolded swiftly. Once home, Siple tossed the blood-covered knife on her couch, which is where investigators later confiscated the weapon, and dead-bolted the door, according to defense testimony. She did not unlock that door until police arrived.\nDuring his cross examination, Rollins asked Siple why she didn't call police when the four masked men chased and threatened her and her children. He also asked why she didn't do likewise when the mob descended upon her. Siple explained that if she were viewed as a \"snitch\" in that neighborhood it would put her life and the lives of her four children in jeopardy. In addition, she testified that she was wise enough not to pull out a cell phone in front of a group of aggressors, revealing that she even possessed one, because someone simply would snatch it from her.\nRollins reminded the jury during his closing argument on Wednesday afternoon that Siple had been convicted of theft, which is a crime that involves deceit and, therefore, is one of the convictions that can be used to impeach the credibility of a trial witness. \"There was no mob,\" Rollins asserted.\nThe prosecutor told jurors that Siple was the \"initial aggressor\" and spurred an altercation with the two women, whom he opined were forthright in their testimonies. After that altercation with the two women grew into a \"more significant fight,\" Siple grabbed a knife she had in her waistband and lunged toward them with the weapon, according the scenario proffered by Rollins during his closing argument.\n\"She (Siple) was the aggressor. She started it and she was going to end it,\" Rollins told jurors before contending, \"She raised it to a deadly force level. She upped the ante. She brought a knife to a fistfight.\"\nAlong those lines, Rollins maintained that the cuts on hands of one of the women who testified for the state were \"defensive wounds\" and also told jurors that the women pepper-sprayed Siple to fend her off.\nIn addition, Rollins told jurors that the women didn't suffer only cuts, but also puncture wounds — calling into question Siple's account of waving the knife blindly. \"She didn't just slash the victims; she stabbed them,\" Rollins stressed.\nBut Winston emphasized in her closing argument, \"My client acted in self-defense.\"\nWinston reminded jurors of where the Aug. 30 confrontation between Siple and the neighbors occurred, as well as the ones that happened during the days leading up to it. \"Every time there was an interaction, it happened outside of her house. They went to her; she didn't come to them,\" Winston told jurors.\nAddressing the one woman's stab wound to her back, in context of the state's assertion that she was trying to retreat, Winston told jurors, \"If you're twisting and turning, you can get stabbed all over the place.\"\nWinston also told jurors to recall the police body-cam audio that, according to the defense lawyer, captured the terror in Siple's voice when, unbeknownst to her, responding law enforcement officers knocked on her door after the incident. 'She screamed, 'Who is that?',\" Winston said. Then that recording reflects a calmness in Siple's voice when she learns that it is police officers knocking on her door, according to Winston. \"She says, 'OK, OK, let me unlock the door',\" Winston told the jurors.\nSummarizing toward the end of closing argument, Winston commented, \"They brought the fight to her. She just wanted to go home.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

He is scheduled to go to trial this summer.\nDiminution credits are \"an incentive tool used behind the wall to maintain order, encourage good behavior and offer opportunities to learn and develop the skills needed to return to the community,\" said Marguerite Lanaux, the district public defender of Baltimore City.\nDel. Jackie Addison, D-Baltimore City, said that, as a mother and grandmother, she hopes to see the measure passed this legislative session.\n\"I have three daughters and a granddaughter and I would never want that to happen to anyone, not just my family but anyone,\" Addison, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in an interview with Capital News Service. \"I just pray that it does get passed because it is a very important bill, and we need the bill.\"\nBut some public defenders say that taking away diminution credits won't incentivize inmates to do the work while they are still incarcerated to prepare them for the real world, and it won't make communities safer because they will be released anyway.\nAn alternative option, they say, would be providing better programs for sexual offenders in Division of Corrections facilities.\nThe measure would \"make the DOC a more traumatizing place so across the board it will have a negative effect on all incarcerated people and our communities when they are released,\" said Gabriel Ellenberger, of the public defender's office, during a committee hearing.\nThe proposed measure is named after Pava LaPere, who was the CEO of a tech startup company called EcoMap Technologies.\n\"While she is physically gone from this world her vision and dreams will still live on,\" LaPere said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge man pleads guilty for altering evidence in fatal Easton shooting\n\n March 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Crime \n \n 559\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A Cambridge man pleaded guilty Monday to altering evidence in an August 2023 fatal shooting in Easton.Raheem Green, 28, was handed a suspended 18-month sentence with credit for time served and three years of probation — the first year supervised — after entering an Alford plea Monday morning.\nAn Alford plea allows a person to maintain their innocence while acknowledging the state had enough evidence to obtain a conviction.\nThe Aug. 7 shooting took place in the 100 block of Blake Street and resulted in the death of Ty Brooks, 55, of Easton.\nIn late February, 22-year-old Deseir Cornish, of Denton, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and possession of a handgun in the death of Brooks. Cornish was sentenced to 10 years in prison and five years of supervised probation upon his release.\nGreen had initially been charged with acting as an accessory after the fact of murder for allegedly helping Cornish flee from the scene and discard evidence. The charge was amended to altering physical evidence.\nAt the plea hearing Monday, Talbot County Circuit Judge Broughton Earnest read the conditions of the plea agreement. He said that per the agreement, the state and defense would agree to dropping an additional charge of accessory after the fact, and Green would receive a fully suspended sentence with a 25-day credit for time served and probation.\nAt the hearing, Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale detailed what happened the day Brooks was found unresponsive in the grass with three gunshot wounds.\nCoale said Brooks had gotten into an argument with a group of young men around a white Range Rover parked on Blake Street that day. He said Brooks left Blake Street and returned with a shotgun, operating an ATV. When Brooks approached the passenger side front window of the Range Rover on the ATV and held up the shotgun, Cornish shot Brooks with a handgun.\nCoale said Green was outside the driver's side of the Range Rover at the time and got into a Hyundai to leave the area. He said Cornish, who was in the Range Rover with other individuals, followed Green.\nGreen told police that he drove to a gas station. At the gas station Cornish asked to use Green's cellphone. After Cornish returned the cellphone to Green, a passenger in the Range Rover told Green where to meet them so they could abandon the Range Rover.\nUpon abandoning the vehicle, Green gave the individuals that had been in the Range Rover a ride, Coale said.\nAfter Coale spoke, Green's attorney, Stephanie Shipley, said Green was not a part of the group of young men, adding that Green is in his late 20s. She said Green left the scene in his car when he heard gunshots, and the Range Rover followed him without him telling them to do so.\nShipley later said Green was simply \"in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" and the only mistake he made was lending Cornish his cell phone and giving the individuals in the Range Rover — including Cornish — a ride. She said Green didn't know Brooks had been killed when he gave them the ride.\nAfter accepting the plea, Earnest said that although he did not want to ignore the emotional trauma Brooks' family has faced, he didn't think Green was directly involved in the shooting and accepted the sentencing recommendations made by the State's Attorney's Office and the defense. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to court documents, Rider's reckless conduct in igniting the house on fire \"clearly\" put emergency services personnel, specifically more than 45 firefighters who responded, in danger as they suppressed the fire.\nRider faces 15 charges for this, including arson, malicious destruction of property and reckless endangerment.\nA trial for the case was set to begin March 4, but at a status hearing that morning, Judge Thomas G. Ross stated that Rider had been voluntarily admitted to Johns Hopkins and issued a bench warrant for Rider's failure to appear in court that morning.\nAccording to court documents, Rider was discharged from Johns Hopkins Hospital and placed in the custody of Deputy Fire Marshal Shayne McKinney on Monday.\nIn court documents, Rider's attorney Stephanie Shipley wrote that Rider and his counsel did not know he was being discharged immediately Monday morning following an endoscopy procedure and recovery from anesthesia.\nFollowing the discharge, Rider, through his defense, requested to be released to Avenues Recovery Center for inpatient treatment \"pursuant to the active referral from Johns Hopkins Hospital Psychiatric Department.\"\nAccording to court documents filed by Rider's defense, Rider's social worker Joseph Antonetti advised over the phone that Rider had obtained long-term placement in Avenues Recovery Center for 60 days.\nAt a bail review and status hearing on Tuesday, according to court documents, Ross granted Rider a bed-to-bed transfer to Avenues Recovery Center from the Talbot County Detention Center.\nThe conditions of this transfer, outlined in court documents, are that Rider must be fitted with a GPS tracking device, cannot leave Avenues Recovery Center for any reason and must return to the detention center upon completion of the 60-day inpatient program.\nIncluded in the conditions of this transfer, Rider cannot be given access to internet or any social media accounts. He cannot have contact with any state witnesses, other than his parents, Peggy Rider and Fred Rider Jr.\nA hearing for Rider's case is set for April 3. The trial is set to begin Aug. 19. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Dorchester County EMS confirmed the girl had died.\nPolice said because of the living conditions officers observed at the home, the Criminal Investigations Division of CPD assisted with the investigation, along with the assistance of Child Protective Services, Cambridge Code Enforcement and Dorchester County Animal Control.\nAccording to the news release, Cambridge Code Enforcement condemned the house.\nPolice said the Criminal Investigations Division consulted with the Dorchester County State's Attorney's Office for the investigation, resulting in the investigation being submitted to a grand jury where an indictment was issued for David and Mandy Insleys' arrests on Feb. 20.\nA trial is scheduled for July 16.\nBoth David and Mandy Insley have been released before the trial under level five supervision. This means that the Insleys are under house arrest with a curfew and GPS restrictions. This level of supervision entails weekly meetings with a case manager and random drug testing.\nAn additional requirement to their pre-trial releases is that they cannot have pets or minors in their home.\nAccording to court documents, a notice of a pretrial violation was filed in early March based on information obtained that the Insleys had dogs in their home. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The ATF procured Sky and assigned her to the accelerant detection program. Together, Decker and Sky graduated from Class No. 117 in December 2016.\nSky has worked alongside firefighters and investigators, responding to countless calls, assisting in investigations, and meeting what Decker estimates are thousands of people while working community and school events and public demonstrations across Maryland.\nDecker and Sky traveled regularly to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glyco, Georgia, where they assisted in training ATF agents during their academy.\nKnown for their keen sense of smell and unwavering commitment to their work, accelerant detection canines like Sky have been instrumental in identifying accelerants such as gasoline, lighter fluid, kerosene and even odorless solvents used in arson cases. Sky is a food-reward canine and has been fed with Decker's hand tens of thousands of times. On Friday, Sky celebrated with a bowl of food, her first since joining the program.\n\"As Sky enters retirement, everyone at the Office of the State Fire Marshal expresses our gratitude for Sky and Decker's commitment to keeping Maryland safe,\" said Chief Deputy and Acting State Fire Marshal Jason M. Mowbray. \"We wish Sky a well-deserved restful retirement filled with treats, belly rubs and endless playtime.\"\nAlthough she is now retired, Sky will soon have company. Starting this week, Decker will travel to the ATF Canine Training Center in Front Royal, Virginia, for six weeks to work with a new partner. When the pair graduate, they will return to Maryland and be one of only 71 teams in the United States. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Montgomery suggested that the remaining funds should be allocated to assist the Easton Police Department with purchasing the rest of the department's police vehicles.\nEaston Police Chief Alan Lowrey originally requested financial assistance for eight vehicles, but the council approved the purchase of four police vehicles.\nMontgomery offered an amendment to increase the allocation of police vehicles from four to seven, using the remainder of the funds from the American Rescue Plan Act.\n\"I would like to see us fully fund the police vehicles that are needed, according to Chief Laurie, rather than leaving money on the table at this point,\" Montgomery said. \"I think that's a clear need. It's a public service safety, which should be our highest priority.\"\nCouncilmember Maureen Curry supported the modification of additional financial support. The council estimated that each police vehicle would cost approximately $80,000. The council agreed to increase the funds from the original $320,000 to $560,000, an increase of $240,000.\nThe council unanimously approved both the amendment and the modified Ordinance 810.\nOther News\nThe council unanimously approved Resolution 623, authorizing a lease agreement between the town of Easton and the state of Maryland for a district court facility.\nThe council approved Resolution 618, authorizing a lease agreement between the town of Easton and the state of Maryland for a Maryland Veterans Affairs Office.

In his initial interview with police, Johnson admitted to carrying a .40 caliber firearm. An autopsy revealed that Woolford died from a single gunshot wound from a .40 caliber firearm.\nLast Thursday, Ennals' defense filed an emergency motion requesting to dismiss the case or provide alternative relief. Monday morning, instead of bringing a jury into the courtroom, a motion hearing was held.\nAccording to court documents, along with the dismissal request, Ennals' attorneys Larry Greenberg and Brice Litus also asked that the prosecutor, Jonathon Church of the Prince George's County State's Attorney's Office, be disqualified from the case.\nChurch assumed the case in October after the Dorchester County State's Attorney's Office was disqualified from the case.\nIn the motion filed last week, Ennals' defense asked that if the court does not grant these requests, the trial be postponed.\nIn a motion filed Thursday and a supplement to the motion filed Friday, Ennals' defense said the state has two audio recordings of witness statements that the defense was unaware of until Thursday afternoon. One of those statements, they said, implicates a suspect that is not Ennals.\nThe defense also said it was not provided certain data related to the case from a DNA anaylst, including \"hundreds of pages of documents,\" until Friday.\nEnnals' defense said it discovered the audio recordings and other documents that had been uploaded to a Google Drive in the previous three weeks \"by happenstance,\" without the state's disclosure of the additional evidence.\nThe defense said multiple files it received last week would not open. The files that were accessible, the defense attorneys said, appear to contain exculpatory or impeachment evidence. Exculpatory evidence is evidence that is favorable to the defendant or could exonerate the defendant.\n\"Trial is scheduled to begin in two days in a murder trial and we are still receiving new evidence,\" Greenberg and Litus wrote in the supplemental motion.\nIn response, Church said the defense had been aware of the recordings for a year and never mentioned or requested them, according to court documents. He said the state did not receive a request for the complete DNA file until March 11, and the state doesn't intend to introduce any DNA evidence in the case.\nAt the motion hearing Monday, Greenberg he was \"disheartened\" by the situation. He said he had a conversation with Church on Friday where Church admitted to not turning over the additional evidence.\nChurch said he had offered to meet with Ennals' defense in mid-November, which he said would have resolved \"99%\" of these issues.\nJudge Thomas G. Ross said he wouldn't grant the motion to dismiss, but would postpone the trial and charge it to the state. Ross also required the state to file all evidence and provide a complete list of the evidence produced.\nBACKGROUND OF THE CASE\nThis is not the first time Ennals' defense has filed a motion to dismiss this case.\nIn September, Greenberg filed a motion to dismiss the case due to the lack of a speedy trial along with a motion to disqualify Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard and the Dorchester County State's Attorney's Office from the case.\nThat same month, less than two weeks before a trial for Ennals was set to begin in, according to Greenberg and documented in court papers, Leonard told Greenberg she met with Daeveon Johnson — also charged in the shooting — to prepare for the trial and learned that two other people were involved.\nAccording to previous Star Democrat reporting, in a Sept. 27 hearing, Greenberg asserted that the information shared in the interview was exculpatory. Not disclosing exculpatory information to defense attorneys is a violation of the Brady rule, which requires prosecutors to turn over information that could exonerate a defendant.\nAt the hearing, 1st Judicial Circuit Administrative Judge S. James Sarbanes granted the motion to disqualify Leonard and the Dorchester County State's Attorney's Office from prosecuting Ennals. Sarbanes said he was \"troubled\" by recent happenings in the case against Ennals, particularly relating to evidence disclosures and the perception and appearance of fairness.\nIn February Greenberg and Litus filed two separate motions to dismiss the case. Reasons they listed for why the case should be dismissed included lack of a speedy trial, Brady violations and ex-parte communications between the state and the court. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mother of girl killed in Christmas Day fire facing 23 charges\n\n March 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1674\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ELKTON — The mother of a 10-year-old girl who was killed in a townhouse fire near Elkton on Christmas morning faces multiple charges — including involuntary manslaughter, child neglect and reckless endangerment — after investigators concluded that hoarding, overloaded electrical outlets and a lack of smoke detectors inside the dwelling were factors in the deadly blaze, according to Cecil County District Court records.For the same alleged reasons, the mother's live-in boyfriend is facing the same 23 criminal charges that have been filed against her, police reported.\nMaryland State Police investigators arrested the suspects — Theresa Ann Moats, 40, and Kevin Neal Summerfield, 41, now both of New Castle, Del. — on Friday, March 15, and charged each of them with involuntary manslaughter, neglect of a minor, reckless endangerment and 20 counts of animal cruelty, court records show.\nA portion of the charging documents filed against Moats and Summerfield focus on horrid living conditions discovered inside their Willow Drive townhouse where, according to Moats' own admission, as many as 35 pets, mostly dogs and cats, were kept at the same time.\nIn addition, court records allege that a \"vast majority of the floor was covered in caked animal feces\" and that the odor of animal urine and feces was pungent throughout the dwelling when Cecil County Department of Animal Services agents responded to that townhouse on Dec. 20 — five days before the fatal fire — after receiving a complaint.\nMoats and Summerfield remained in the Cecil County Detention Center on no bond Wednesday night, two days after their bail review hearings, according to court records, which indicate that Cecil County District Court Judge Clara E. Campbell presided over that proceeding. Preliminary hearings for Moats and Summerfield have been set for April 10, court records show.\nMoats' daughter — Kyleigh Nicole Treadway — perished in the swift-moving, two-alarm blaze that broke out inside 317 Willow Dr. in the Winding Brook neighborhood, northeast of Elkton, shortly before 7:30 a.m. on Dec. 25, 2023. Kyleigh was trapped inside that burning townhouse after her mother (Moats), her grandmother, her two older brothers and her mother's boyfriend (Summerfield) had escaped.\nCourt records indicate a woman believed to be Kyleigh's mother approached Capt. William Ryan of Singerly Volunteer Fire Company during the fire and told him that \"her baby was right inside the front door.\"\n\"Due to the magnitude and intensity of the fire, Ryan and other firefighters were unable to immediately enter the residence to recover the child. When it was safe to enter the residence, Captain Ryan pushed inside the residence and located the deceased child. The child was located near the front door of the residence,\" according to court records.\nAn autopsy revealed that Kyleigh's cause of death was listed as smoke inhalation and thermal injuries that included burns covering much of her body, according to police.\nIncluding Kyleigh's five surviving family members, the blaze displaced 17 residents in the three adjacent townhouses damaged by the fire.\nPOSSIBLE CAUSES\nDetectives with the Maryland Office of the State Fire Marshal determined that the blaze that killed Kyleigh started accidentally on the first floor inside an 8'-by-8' room, which was an addition at the rear of the townhouse, and that the cause is either an electric \"overload situation based on the multiple operating appliances\" or \"improperly discarded smoking materials,\" court records show.\nDuring their investigation, MOSFM investigators discovered multiple electrical power cords connected to one another, which were then all connected to a power strip. The extension cords were wound through the rest of the residence, including around and behind appliances and into the townhouse's backyard.\nDuring her interview with MSP investigators, Moats mentioned the electrical power cords in the backroom where the fire started, police said. Moats said she tried to extinguish the flames after her son woke her up in her second-floor bedroom to alert her about the blaze, police added.\n\"Theresa observed the 'orange fire' and attempted to put it out using water. Her efforts were in vain. Theresa explained that the backroom was filled with boxes of clothing and miscellaneous items. Among these items was an electrical power cord that was connected to an outside grill. She stated the grill was inoperable. Theresa Moats stated 'this all could have been preventable and that she misses her daughter.' She felt bad and felt it was her fault,\" according to the charging document.\nAs for the possibility of improperly discarded smoking materials causing the blaze, investigators noted that they found \"several empty Newport cigarette containers and cigarette-style lighters\" in that backroom, court records show.\nIn recorded interviews with MSP investigators, the adults who lived in that Willow Drive townhouse told detectives that smoke detectors had been installed one year before the fire and that they were operational, police said.\nHowever, fire investigators reported that they were unable to locate the remains of any smoke detectors within the townhouse. They further reported that the lack of smoke detectors likely caused a delay in the evacuation of the residence.\nIn addition, MOSFM detectives reported that they documented \"residential hoarding conditions\" inside the Willow Court townhouse during their investigation. Specifically, the detectives cited an \"overabundance of combustibles and clothing\" in the living room, in the dining/kitchen area and in the rear backroom where the fire started, noting that they removed large trash bags of clothing from there and that a connecting storage closet also was filled with combustibles, court records show.\nCourt records further state that the poor conditions of the home, the amount of 'hoarding', as well as the widespread animal waste and overabundance of trash and other combustibles — combined with the lack of smoke detection — likely delayed and hampered the home's evacuation.\nANIMAL SERVICES INVESTIGATION\nCharging documents indicate that two Cecil County Department of Animal Services officers went to 317 Willow Dr. on Dec. 20 — five days before the fatal fire there — and impounded 18 animals — 14 dogs and four cats — that showed signs of neglect and abuse, after receiving a call regarding \"multiple canines of various ages located within the residence,\" court records show.\nThe officers heard \"excessive barking\" when they knocked on the door, which continued when Summerfield let them inside the dwelling, police said. Once inside, police added, the officers \"detected the smell of animal urine and feces.\"\nCourt records allege that the officers observed eight pit bull mixed puppies of \"average health and slightly underweight\" crated without food and water. Officers also saw eight adult canines of mixed breeds and several cats of various ages inside the townhouse, court records show.\nThe officers further reported that a vast majority of the floor was covered in caked animal waste. Officers informed Moats and Summerfield that their animals could not remain in such conditions, resulting in several animals being surrendered to the officers. Officers reported that the surrendered puppies immediately ran to empty water bowls and attempted to drink after they were uncrated.\n\"When the officers arrived at the animal shelter, two emaciated puppies were found to be very dehydrated and needed subcutaneous fluids. All puppies ate and drank ravenously. Two crates of puppies each drank an entire bucket of water,\" according to the charging documents.\nDuring interviews with police, Summerfield, Moats and Moats' mother admitted that not all of the pets had been vaccinated; that the dogs urinated and defecated inside the townhouse \"all the time;\" and that the cats would \"urinate and defecate everywhere and it would get on Kyleigh's clothes,\" court records show. Summerfield acknowledged to investigators that the \"pet situation\" was \"ridiculous\" and excessive, police reported.\nAfter they impounded the 18 animals from that Willow Drive townhouse, the Animal Services officers \"planned to make a report to Child Protective Services, as the children in the home were subjected to poor living conditions,\" according to the charging documents.\nSIGNS AT SCHOOL\nOn Jan. 11, some 17 days after the fatal fire, an MSP investigator and a Cecil County Department of Social Services supervisor went to Cecil Manor Elementary School in Elk Mills, where Kyleigh had been a fourth-grade student, and interviewed her teachers, guidance and school nurse — all of whom cited signs of possible child neglect, court records show.\nAccording to the charging document, school officials were concerned over Kyleigh's hygiene, reporting that her hair and clothes would often emanate smells of animal waste. School officials also noted that other students in her class would avoid Kyleigh due to the smell of her clothes.\nThe school nurse routinely washed Kyleigh's clothes and washed and brushed the girl's hair on multiple occasions because it was \"matted, itchy and foul-smelling,\" police said. Staff members replaced Kyleigh's backpack twice because cats at her residence urinated and vomited on top of her previous backpacks, police added.\n\"Kyleigh's hygiene issues were described as 'terrible' and they needed to be addressed 3-4 times per day. Kyleigh stated to teachers that she had a 'ton' of pets and that she loved them,\" court records allege.\nCourt records allege that school staff attempted to contact Moats by email and by phone, but there was \"absolutely no involvement to address concern brought forth by the school,\" including the concerns that Kyleigh was \"disoriented during school and not mentally present,\" that she never completed homework assignments, and that she was academically performing at a level several years behind her peers.\nSchool staff members alleged that Moats \"showed a lack of care for Kyleigh,\" according to the charging documents, which also indicate that \"daily communication logs were sent home and they were never signed or acknowledged by Kyleigh's guardians.\"\nSchool officials told investigators that referrals were made to the Department of Social Services after Kyleigh moved with her family from Delaware and started attending Cecil Manor Elementary School and that the school provided a \"vast amount of support to Kyleigh and her family.\"\nIn one section of the charging documents, it reads, \"Prior to Christmas 2023, the school counselor visited Kyleigh's residence to drop off food and presents. The occupants (guardians) were unable to open the front door fully. Without stepping inside the residence, the school counselor could smell animal urine and feces emanating from the inside. Animal feces were observed on the floor of the residence when the door was ajar.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Eclipse 2024: Extra police, even National Guard troops being deployed amid alerts, government warnings\n\n March 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: Eclipse \n \n 1068\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n More police will be deployed, some National Guard troops are being activated and put at the ready and emergency orders along with aviation alerts have been issued for the total solar eclipse set to sweep across the U.S. on Monday, April 8.The eclipse will be visible across the continental U.S. with a swath of the country — from Texas to New England — experiencing as much as four minutes of daytime darkness with the moon blocking the sun.\nEclipse day and the weekend leading up to are expected to be one of the busiest travel periods in U.S. history.\nThat is prompting concerns about traffic congestion and how the events and expected high usage rates will impact internet and other communications connections including electronic transactions and payment systems.\nGasoline supplies could be impacted in prime viewing regions.\nTROOPS ACTIVATED\nThe Oklahoma National Guard is activating troops from a civil support unit to assist local government agencies during the eclipse. That includes members of a hazardous materials team.\nThe Oklahoma guard said March 18 it received a request for resources from the McCurtain County Emergency Management agency.\nThe state is in the path of totality where the moon will completely shield the sun on April 8.\nOklahoma officials expect as many 100,000 visitors to McCurtain County in the southeastern part of the state. The county, which has a population of approximately 31,000 people, is part of the sprawling Choctaw Nation Indian territory. The tribe is hosting a number of eclipse events.\n\"McCurtain County Emergency Management requested our support because they expect up to 100,000 additional people visiting their communities to watch the eclipse,\" said Lt. Col. Jabonn Flurry, an Oklahoma National Guard commander. \"This influx of visitors has the potential to overtax local resources and thanks to the training and experience our Guardsmen have working alongside local agencies all across Oklahoma, the (Civil Support Team) is uniquely qualified to support our fellow Oklahomans.\"\nOther states are deploying more state police and have National Guard troops and resources at the ready for the eclipse.\n\"The New York National Guard is prepared to provide troops and two of our Naval Militia patrol boats if required,\" said Eric Durr, public affairs director of the New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs.\nDurr said the Empire State's homeland security agency has not yet tasked the Guard with any eclipse-related deployments.\nThe eclipse's totality path will go through upstate New York including Rochester, Buffalo and Niagara Falls.\nThe New York State Police is implementing emergency plans and will deploy more troopers statewide for the eclipse, the agency announced Monday, March 25.\nIn Arkansas, the state's National Guard was part of pre-eclipse training exercises March 13 with state emergency managers and police. Arkansas' emergency control center will be activated April 6 through April 10.\nThe state expects as many as 1.5 million visitors for the eclipse and another 500,000 Arkansans traveling to areas of totality.\nPOLICE PRESENCE\nLocal police, state highway patrols and other law enforcement and emergency agencies across the country are planning for increased patrols, staffing and deployments for the celestial event.\n\"We will have additional staffing working the day of the eclipse in order to have more resources available since there will be additional people in the city,\" said Stan Reno, chief of police in Carbondale, Illinois, in the southern part of the state.\nReno does not expect additional state resources.\nIn Texas, which is viewed as a prime eclipse viewing spot in the U.S. because of its comparatively clearer skies than other totality locations, police, emergency and transportation managers are preparing for a deluge of visitors and in-state travelers to view the events.\nMore than 1 million people could visit the state, according to the Texas Department of Transportation.\n\"The public should expect a police presence on our roadways and across the city, the day of the event,\" said Jennifer Pryor, a public information officer with the Dallas Police Department.\n\"While the department is working to keep our roadways and streets safe during the eclipse, the public should be prepared for increased traffic and delays. Traffic may impact all areas of DFW (Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport), not just the city of Dallas. Plan extra time for your travels,\" she said.\nSgt. Tyler Ross, a spokesperson for the Ohio Highway Patrol, said there will be more police out for the eclipse and like other police warns motorists not to stop on the side of highways to view the astronomical event.\n\"Leading up to, during and after the eclipse, our troopers will be highly visible, enforcing all traffic laws and ready to assist, ensuring traffic flows smoothly and everyone enjoys this rare event safely,\" Ross said. \"Remember, stopping on the side of roads or exit ramps for viewing is prohibited and unsafe.\"\nThe eclipse will be the largest such event in the U.S. since 1806. There will not be another total solar eclipse in the U.S. until 2044.\nSocial media buzz about the eclipse is on the rise including its technological, public safety, natural, spiritual and metaphysical impacts.\nEMERGENCY ALERTS\nA number of governments in Texas, Ohio and other states in the totality path have issued special and emergency orders related to the eclipse.\nA special eclipse order issued by March 13 Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine's order instructs state agencies, including police, to prepare for the event and for those traveling for it to make sure to carry cash, cell phone chargers, blankets and other items.\nBell County, Texas, which expects 400,000 visitors for the eclipse (doubling its population) has declared a state of emergency for the event, urging residents to stock up on fuel, drug prescriptions and groceries before the influx of tourists and potential impacts.\nOther emergency and tourism agencies are recommending having cash on hand, fueling up on gas and stocking up on food and other staples before the April event in case of disruptions. Protective eyewear is also required to view the eclipse.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has issued a special alert for airlines and general aviation pilots for the April 8 eclipse.\nThat includes warnings of increased aviation traffic — especially in the prime path — and that there could be flight restrictions or changes ordered by the U.S. military or security agencies.\nThat could especially impact air travel and airports in areas such as Dallas, Houston, Little Rock, Arkansas; Indianapolis, Cleveland, Buffalo and Burlington, Vermont, according to the FAA.\n\"There may be a higher traffic volume than normal anticipated at airports along the path of the eclipse. Traffic should anticipate delays during peak traffic periods,\" the FAA said in its alert. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It was only a few hours after they crossed the Key Bridge on their way home that the bridge collapsed.\nA container ship slammed into the iconic bridge just before 1:30 a.m. Tuesday. Within seconds, the bridge crumpled into the chilly waters of the Patapsco River at the entrance to the Baltimore Harbor.\nIn the hours that followed, authorities began search and rescue efforts for survivors of the collapse. Radar indicated that vehicles had been discovered at the bottom of the river, which is about 50 feet deep.\nBy Tuesday evening, officials said that six construction workers who had been repairing potholes on the bridge at the time of the collapse had been presumed dead. Two construction workers were rescued in the efforts.\nTuesday morning, Santana looked out on the now collapsed bridge from a hill on Dundalk Avenue, across the street from the Logan Village Shopping Center.\n\"It was scary because it could have been us,\" Santana said.\nSantana wasn't the only one looking at what's left of the I-695 bridge. People filtered in and out Tuesday morning to see it for themselves. \"Shock\" was a word repeated often.\n\"Shock and dismay,\" were the words Judy Corkhum used to describe the emotions of residents she had talked to.\n\"Nobody in a million years thought we would wake up this morning to something like that,\" said Corkhum, who also viewed the collapsed bridge from off Dundalk Avenue. \"It brings back emotions from 9/11. ... You saw that and the first thing you think is, 'Oh my god. The people. The workers.'\"\nCorkhum, who recently moved to Baltimore from Dundalk, said she heard about the bridge collapse via a text from a neighbor at 4 a.m. Tuesday. She said her friend's son, a truck driver, \"literally just got over the bridge before it happened.\"\n\"She said, 'I was having a heart attack this morning thinking he was out on the road last night,'\" Corkhum said.\nCorkhum said her friend went into surgery this morning, so she was happy to know her son was OK.\nAnthony Meeks, a Dundalk native, said he heard about the collapse as soon as he woke up.\n\"The Key Bridge is a very iconic piece of Dundalk,\" he said. \"It's something that everybody who's from Dundalk or this city even has at one point in their life crossed.\"\nMeeks remembers being scared to cross the bridge when he was younger. These days, he crosses it every two weeks.\n\"It (will) make me go out of my way to find a different path to get to where I need to go,\" he said about the collapse. \"It could make my trips be a lot longer.\"\nMeeks called the incident an eye opener.\n\"Because it's like you don't really expect these kinds of tragedies and stuff to happen and occur in your neighborhood,\" he said.\nDundalk-Patapsco Neck Historical Society President Jean Walker said this is the first time Dundalk has experienced a large disaster like this.\nHistorical Society Vice President Joe Stadler called the event \"unbelievable.\"\n\"It takes a while to fathom it,\" he said.\nFor both Walker and Stadler, the bridge has been a big part of Dundalk. They said the founder of the Historical Society, Ben Womer, was \"instrumental\" in getting the bridge named after Francis Scott Key, the author of the national anthem.\n\"It's the backdrop for everything around here,\" Stadler said about the bridge.\nStanding on the hill, looking at the wreckage of the bridge, Corkhum said she had to make the trip from her new home in Baltimore to see what had happened with her own eyes.\n\"I'm so used to seeing that pretty view out there every day,\" she said. \"It's going to be horrible seeing that (there's) no view anymore.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Biden administration ready to release federal funds for Baltimore bridge\n\n March 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: YESENIA MONTENEGRO Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 935\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is prepared to provide federal funding to cover costs following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Wednesday in a White House press briefing.\"We are committed to delivering every federal resource needed to help Maryland get back to normal and we're going to work with them every step of the way to rebuild this bridge,\" Buttigieg said.\nWhile there is no estimate on the cost of rebuilding yet, there are provisions in place that allow funds to be released while the estimate is being determined. The Maryland Department of Transportation has released an emergency relief funding request, which will be processed immediately to start the funding process, Buttigieg said.\nThe infrastructure law authorized funding of the emergency relief account, which will most likely be used in this situation. According to Buttigieg, about $950 million is available. However, this money is used for other projects as well, so it is likely that Congress will be asked to authorize additional funding.\n\"That shouldn't be a barrier to the immediate next few days beginning to get the ball rolling,\" he said.\nPresident Joe Biden met earlier in the Oval Office with Buttigieg and U.S. Coast Guard Vice Admiral Peter Gautier. The president also spoke by phone with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Lt. Gen. Scott Spellmon, chief of engineers and commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\"The people of Baltimore can count on us to stick with them at every step of the way until the port is reopened and Francis Scott Key Bridge is rebuilt,\" Biden said in a post on X. \"We're not leaving until it's done.\"\nButtigieg said officials did not have an estimate yet of costs to replace the bridge. He also declined to estimate how long it will take to reopen the Port of Baltimore.\nAny private party found accountable for the accident will be held responsible, Buttigieg said. However, Biden's goal is not to have that process interfere with Maryland getting the financial help it needs, he said.\nButtigieg said it was \"possible if not likely\" the administration will ask Congress for additional money to refill the emergency relief account.\nHe said he hopes that some Republicans will work with Biden and Democrats to provide that funding. He also reminded members of Congress on the fence about supporting federal funding to remember that \"today this is happening in Baltimore, tomorrow it could be your district.\"\n\"Infrastructure is, or at least ought to be, a bipartisan priority,\" the secretary said. \"I know that partisanship has gotten in the way of some important functions and expenditures, but I would also note that the infrastructure package that was passed is known as the bipartisan infrastructure law for a reason.\"\n\"I think in a situation like this where you have a national emergency where it's gonna attract a lot of attention, I think it's gonna get through rather quickly,\" John Dedie, a political science professor at the Community College of Baltimore County told Capital News Service. \"There are gonna be some people that may grumble in the House a little bit, but I think that under the circumstances people are gonna realize economically something has to be done to build this thing.\"\nButtigieg said the Department of Transportation will focus on reopening the port, dealing with supply chain implications until the port reopens, rebuilding the bridge and dealing with surface transportation implications until the bridge can be rebuilt.\n\"The products that are now stuck behind the blocked channel are one piece of it, and that affects global markets everywhere,\" Maryland Sen. Sarah Elfreth, a Democrat who currently serves on the state's Budget and Taxation Committee, told CNS. \"Not to mention what can't come into the port for the time it takes to clear the channel.\"\nAbout 8,000 jobs are directly affected and between $100 million-$200 million worth of cargo moves in and out of the port every day, according to Buttigieg.\n\"Rebuilding will not be quick, or easy or cheap, but we will get it done,\" he said.\nThe accident investigation is led by the National Transportation Safety Board. The Coast Guard will also be providing investigators with its Marine Board of Investigation, which is one of the highest levels of investigation within the Coast Guard, Gautier said during the press conference.\nThe greatest immediate challenge, the vice admiral said, is going to be the removal of the bridge trusses now draped across the bow of the cargo ship. The bow of the vessel Dali currently is sitting on the bottom of the Patapsco River but there are no signs that the hull is leaking.\n\"What we do know is a bridge like this one, completed in the 1970s, was simply not made to withstand a direct impact on a critical support pier, from a vessel that weighs about 200 million pounds,\" Buttigieg said.\nAlthough there is no timeline yet, Buttigieg expects that the clearing of the channel will happen on a much quicker timeline than the reconstruction of the bridge. The Army Corps of Engineers is beginning the underwater surveys to understand the possible challenges the debris presents, Gautier said.\nThe State of Maryland is simultaneously conducting body recovery operations in and around the same area as the debris assessment, Gautier said. Six highway workers who were on the bridge at the time of the accident are missing and presumed dead.\nBiden plans to visit Baltimore as soon as possible, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. The Biden administration will work with local officials to ensure that a presidential visit would not disrupt the efforts at the scene.\nCapital News Service Washington Bureau reporter Torrence Banks contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

APG Chesapeake owns the newspaper in Dundalk on the east side of the bridge. Star Democrat reporter Maggie Trovato and I traveled to help the newspaper with its coverage of the disaster.Two observations.\nFirst, people in Dundalk had stunned looks on their faces that day. The bridge was iconic, a fixture on the city skyline. In an instant, it was gone. The shock was palpable, easily seen in the vacant stares of people who realized their lives would change but without yet fully understanding how.\nSecond, the scale of the disaster was massive. Photos cannot capture the size of the bridge structure nor the size of the ship that brought the bridge down. Seeing it from Dundalk, you begin to comprehend the challenging job ahead to simply clear the debris and reopen Baltimore Harbor.\nKudos to the Commissioners of St. Michaels for apologizing after approving a permit for a Makers Market to host a vendor event at Muskrat Park. City code prohibits the use of the park for for-profit ventures. Another code prohibits the use of tents on the park's lawns.\n\"We apologize that it was an oversight previously,\" Commission President David Breimhurst said. \"And I can tell you that the staff is well aware of what the issue was. These permits will be thoroughly vetted in the future before they come to us.\"\nYes, someone should have known about the ordinances that limit the use of the park. Yet the commission should be applauded for trying to find a solution to help artists and crafters to move to a more desirable location, an event that brings hundreds of visitors to St. Michaels each year.\nAt the commission's March 13 meeting, Trish Payne and Mark Montoya, members of Talbot County's local art community, requested the use of the park every other Saturday or every second Sunday starting in April for a local art vendors event.\nThere was vocal opposition by members of the St. Michaels Business Association, who said that the vendor event could harm to local businesses.\nAfter a heated discussion by members of the public, the commissioners approved the event on a trial run to begin in April to assess impacts to the local community.\nThat decision had to be reversed after the discovery of the city codes sections prohibiting the type of event Makers Market wishes to hold.\nToo frequently these days government agencies dig their heels into the sand and refuse to budge, even when they are in the wrong. The apology from the commissioners was refreshing.\n* * * * *\nA sad anniversary passed on Friday. It's been one year since Russian authorities arrested Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, falsely accusing him of being a spy. Much of the time he has been held in a tiny cell, awaiting a trial that has not yet been set.\nGershkovich was doing his job, reporting on news, helping readers understand what is happening in the authoritarian-run Russia. His arrest and detention shows the importance of freedom of the press and the dangers that authoritarian governments bring to people's freedoms. Those freedoms are in jeopardy all over the world as authoritarian regimes rise.\nIt is important to remember the role that reporters perform in a free society. Journalism is not a crime.\n* * * * *\nIn case you missed some of these, here are the top stories that appeared in the Star Democrat this week. You can read any of them you missed on StarDem.com.\nBridgerton Season 3: Teasers, Trailers, and the Tale So Far (From Limelight entertainment magazine).\nFour suspects evade police in search south of Trappe.\nSailing leader and community trailblazer Diana Mautz dies.\nJymil Thompson resigns from Talbot County Board of Education.\nShip issued mayday before hitting Key Bridge.\nBoard of Education member Donna DiGiacomo resigns.\nDenton dancer achieves mastery.\nCollege students travel to every Easton in US.\nCambridge is 1 of 6 picked for National Parks Service Chesapeake Gateways pilot. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The state's attorney's office released the information Friday afternoon.According to charging documents filed by the Maryland State Police, the students displayed swastikas, made Nazi salutes and directed offensive comments to a classmate because of the classmate's religious beliefs.\nThe state's attorney's office press release stated the behavior began last December and \"continued over several months despite repeated requests to stop.\"\nThe matter was reported to the state police, who investigated and filed the charges against the juveniles. The press release does not report the names or genders of the charged students.\nThe charges will be forwarded to the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services for appropriate action. That entity has the discretion to refer the charges to the Calvert County Circuit Court for a hearing. The state's attorney's office then would be required to prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\"Calvert County Public Schools is committed to providing students and staff with an environment that is safe, welcoming and free from all forms of discrimination,\" Susan Johnson, chief academic officer and spokesperson for the school system, said in a statement released Monday. \"The civil rights of all individuals will be protected. All complaints are investigated promptly. Upon completion of an investigation, students and school personnel may be subject to disciplinary action or consequences for discriminatory behaviors.\"\nCalvert County State's Attorney Robert Harvey (R) issued a statement last Friday.\n\"Maryland was founded on the principle of religious toleration,\" Harvey said in the statement. \"It is frankly astonishing that nearly 400 years later some people continue to persecute others based upon their religion. I call upon parents, educators and community and faith leaders to make sure that our children know that religious persecution has no place in our society.\"\nOn Tuesday, Commissioner President Earl F. \"Buddy\" Hance (R) stated, \"We will not tolerate hate speech. That's not who we are. I hope they [juveniles] get the counseling that they need.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A second survey taken two weeks later showed the same thing. According to the news release, the fractures were \"deemed highly indicative of non-accidental injury\" by Johns Hopkins medical staff.\nAccording to the news release, witnesses at trial testified they had observed Kautz shaking the 1-year-old boy on multiple occasions in 2022. Witnesses also testified to observing bruises on the child's body when he was returned from visitations with Kautz.\n\"These cases involve children who are too young to testify or to speak on their own behalf and are therefore difficult to prosecute,\" Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said in the news release. \"We are extremely grateful to the investigators at the Talbot County Department of Social Services, Easton Police Department and to the doctors at Johns Hopkins who came together to achieve justice in this case.\"\nKautz's sentencing is scheduled for June 10. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Officials from the U.S. Geological Survey said residents across the Northeast reported rumbling in a region where people are unaccustomed to feeling the ground move.The agency reported a quake at 10:23 a.m. with a preliminary magnitude of 4.8, centered near Lebanon, New Jersey, or about 45 miles west of New York City and 50 miles north of Philadelphia. USGS figures indicated that the quake might have been felt by more than 42 million people.\nAcross social media, users from Crumpton, Centreville, Worton, Ridgely, Wye Mills and Easton felt the quake. In Chester, one woman reported small vibration, less than 10 seconds. Melonie Mattison of Kent Island said she was sitting at here dining table when the chair wobbled.\nFor most though, unless they were sitting still it was an easy to miss experience here on the Shore. As Justin Davis quipped, \"I felt more trembles when a tractor trailer passes by.\"\nThe shaking stirred memories of the Aug. 23, 2011, earthquake that jolted tens of millions of people from Georgia to Canada. Registering magnitude 5.8, it was the strongest quake to hit the East Coast since World War II. The epicenter was in Virginia.\nThat earthquake left cracks in the Washington Monument, spurred the evacuation of the White House and Capitol and rattled New Yorkers three weeks before the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks.\nEarthquakes are less common on this side of the U.S. because the East Coast does not lie on a boundary of tectonic plates. But East Coast quakes can still pack a punch — its rocks are better at spreading earthquake energy across far distances.\n\"If we had the same magnitude quake in California, it probably wouldn't be felt nearly as far away,\" said U.S.G.S. geophysicist Paul Caruso.\nThe White House said in a statement that President Joe Biden had been briefed on the earthquake and was \"in touch with federal, state, and local officials as we learn more.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One in three of the top 100 free apps on the Google Play store have banner ads, including ads for adult content, the website says.\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, in 2022, 97% of American teenagers aged 13–17 used the internet every day, with 46% responding they used the internet almost constantly.\nDel. C. T. Wilson (D-Charles) was one of the sponsors of the bill.\n\"Tonight's vote is a landmark moment for Maryland kids and families working toward a better, safer online world,\" said Todd Minor Sr. and Mia Minor, parent advocates from Accokeek who founded the Matthew E. Minor Awareness Foundation. \"We've worked hard for this moment, and we're super proud our legislators had the courage and determination to stand up to the Big Tech lobbyists in the hope that other families will never have to suffer pain like ours has endured.\"\nThe Matthew E. Minor Awareness Foundation was created after Matthew Minor died at 12 years old as a result of the \"choking/black-out\" challenge that had been circulating on social media and other internet platforms.\n\"Today's vote shows support for the Kids Code model's safety-by-design and privacy-by-default principles that transcends political divides, reflecting growing public recognition of the urgent need for smart, effective policy solutions to protect kids online,\" Maryland Kids Code Coalition spokeswoman Marisa Shea of St. Mary's County said.\nThe bill has wide-reaching support, with organizations like the Digital Harbor Foundation, the Free State PTA, the Maryland Association of School Health Nurses, the Maryland Coalition of Families and the Maryland State Education Association testifying in favor of it. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Deputies responded to the store when a call went out that a theft had occurred.\nAccording to a sheriff's office report, \"Two males and one female entered the store and placed numerous colognes and perfumes into bags and fled the store. After fleeing the store, witnesses observed all three suspects enter a gray Mercury Montego that fled northbound on Route 4.\"\nAccording to court documents filed by Deputy Antonio Tavares, Deputy Justin MacWilliams located the Mercury traveling northbound on Route 4, which then turned onto Route 2.\nMacWilliams \"initiated a traffic stop in the area of Pushaw Station Road in Sunderland. During the traffic stop, five occupants were located in the suspect vehicle along with numerous bags of perfumes and colognes in plain view. The total value of the stolen items was approximately $7,694 dollars.\"\nIn addition to the merchandise that was allegedly stolen from the Prince Frederick store, Tavares reported in charging papers that several cellphones were also confiscated.\nThe five arrested are identified as Yeiner Jose Rodriguez Barcelo, 27, of Bronx, N.Y., Yoncar Alberto Rainoso, 21, of Manhattan, N.Y., Estefani Andrea Urbano-Zapata, 21, of Cape Girardea, Mo., Raimil Marquez Jimenez, 25, of Washington, D.C., and Adony Josue Carana, 27, of Manhattan N.Y.\nA sheriff's office press release stated that further investigation revealed Rodriguez-Barcelo was wanted on an open warrant from Pennsylvania for felony retail theft related to thefts at Ulta stores in Pennsylvania.\nCourt records show Carana, who was also listed with the alias Carrano, has been released after posting $10,000 bond. As of Monday, the other four remained at the Calvert detention center on a no-bond status.\nA district court hearing on the charges the five are facing is scheduled for June 3. Language interpreters have been requested for four of the five defendants, court records show.\nThe Prince Frederick Ulta has been the scene of similar thefts over the last three years. Other Ulta stores regionally and nationally have been targets of alleged thieves. Several national news outlets have reported allegations of a possible retail theft ring in the state of California. The alleged perpetrators there stole $8 million in cosmetics from several chains, including Ulta, and then sold the products on Amazon.\nIt is not known at this time if the five arrested in Calvert last week are part of a larger theft ring.\nCalvert County Sheriff Ricky Cox (R) issued a note of thanks in an agency press release to \"the witnesses on scene that went above and beyond to promptly call 911 and provide details of the suspects and suspects' vehicle.

As Marylanders escape winter weather, hopefully, there's a pause in the storm seasons.\nJune is considered the beginning of hurricane season and Johnson mentioned some things to stay alert to on the Eastern Shore.\nAt the Kent County Public Library on March 21, she introduced her audience to their program: SKYWARN.\nShe's looking for more and more people to become a spotter, who look out for the basics of thunderstorm development, storm structure and severe weather features, then report the information accurately.\n\"The main mission of the spotter is to be aware of the rapidly changing conditions of the weather,\" Johnson replied.\nAnd it's sorely needed too.\nJohnson said last year they reported the second most severe thunderstorms.\nThe third most for tornado warnings.\nAnd the fourth most in flash flood warnings.\nUnperturbed by the smaller audience in attendance, she was concise and enthusiastic while walking through the process of what to look out for.\nFor instance, people tend to be on high alert when they get something on their phone saying \"tornado warning.\" Not so much when they get a \"severe thunderstorm warning.\"\n\"That's a mistake to think one's worse than the other,\" Johnson commented.\nEspecially when water can be more harmful than wind in most cases, she said.\n\"When we look at the fatalities, 75% in the United States are due to water in some way; 50% of those are those are due to storm surge; 25% freshwater heavy rain flooding. Keep that in mind. Don't think, 'Oh, it's just a tropical storm.' No, you still need to pay attention and see what the hazards are.\"\nSevere storms should not be treated much differently than a tornado.\nShe then pointed out the difference between a storm watch and a storm warning. A watch means to keep an eye on the weather pattern.\nA warning means, don't just watch — get prepared.\nA severe storm warning means, gather up some candles for light, or buy extra gas for the back-up generator and do things that will prepare your family and yourself for a potential hazard.\nAs hurricanes emerge from the North Atlantic ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, Johnson reminded her audience how to categorize them and what that exactly means.\nHurricanes, big or small, she indicated, can create problems, such as tornados.\nThe uninformed, she added, might hear about a category 1 hurricane and think it's not much of a problem. They'll see it as a little rain and wind. Very minimal damage.\nThe savvy spotter though, will see that even a category 1 hurricane can create big problems, such as a tornado. The spotter will know category 1, simply describes the wind of the hurricane. Nothing else. It does not highlight the possibility of it creating tornados or other adverse weather conditions.\nAnd those who think tornados are only a threat in Kansas are in for a rude awakening.\nTornados hit everywhere, Johnson pointed out. Even in our backyard.\nShe said Hurricane Ida was a remnant tropical system that produced a lot of tornados in 2020.\nHurricane Isaias was a destructive Category 1 hurricane, producing the longest tracked tornado in Delaware history.\nTornados in Cecil County and Southern Delaware — resulted in fatalities last year.\n\"That's why we need you all,\" she said, encouraging her audience to report their observations to their nearest national weather station.\nTo become a spotter, adults are invited to complete the SKYWARN training.\nThose who finish the course join a volunteer program with between 350,000 and 400,000 trained severe weather spotters.\nIndividuals affiliated with hospitals, schools, churches and nursing homes or who have a responsibility for protecting others are encouraged to become a spotter.\n\"There can be no finer reward than to know that your efforts have given your family and neighbors the precious gift of time—minutes that can help save lives,\" as stated by the NWS.\nAnd as the movie \"Twisters,\" the sequel to the original from 1996, comes out in theaters shortly, Johnson jokes that she's preparing to field a lot more questions about tornados.\nShe discouraged the crowd on becoming storm chasers like sensationalist Hollywood actors and actresses, but rather to become informed citizens who save lives. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County residents show support for child abuse prevention with pinwheels\n\n April 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 606\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Four years since the first Pinwheels for Prevention planting ceremony in Caroline County, the number of shiny blue and silver pinwheels twirling in the breeze has grown.For the event, hosted by CASA of Caroline every year, the pinwheels are placed on lawns and in gardens throughout the county to spread awareness of child abuse and promote its prevention. CASA of Caroline Executive Director Amy Horne said the blue in the pinwheels represents the color of bruises, and the pinwheels themselves \"represent the whimsical, carefree childhood that all kids deserve.\"\nAt the annual planting ceremony on Fourth Street in Denton on April 10, Horne said participation has grown throughout the county in the past four years.\n\"My gosh, go up to the Town of Ridgely,\" she said in an interview. \"They have an amazing display.\"\nCASA of Caroline is a nonprofit organization that advocates for and helps find homes for abused and neglected children.\nOn the nonprofit's website, there is a virtual garden that shows where many of the pinwheels have been planted this year. Horn said hundreds of pinwheels have been planted.\nIn the 20 years the organization has been around, it has advocated for more than 100 children in the county, Horne said.\n\"People may think (that because) we're a close-knit county, that it doesn't happen here, but it does,\" she said about child abuse. \"With the tremendous outpouring of support — as you can see here, and that we receive all over the county — it's obvious that Caroline County is really committed to being a safe place for children and families.\"\nCASA of Caroline Board President Keith Johnson talked about the different agencies and organizations that are involved when children experience abuse.\n\"We have representatives from Denton Police Department and the (Caroline County) Sheriff's Office here,\" he said. \"A lot of times, those cases start with their work. But as those children progress, they go to social service and then our advocates, which serve each one of those children.\"\nCaroline County Circuit Court Judge Heather Price said in an interview that CASA reports offer an important perspective to judges.\n\"They give me a different angle than what the attorneys representing the parents would say or the attorneys representing the department,\" she said. \"Here you have the voice of the child that's speaking through an advocate.\"\nBefore attendees of the ceremony fanned out to plant pinwheels, citations and awards were handed out. Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) presented CASA of Caroline with a citation in recognition of the Pinwheels for Prevention campaign.\nDel. Jeff Ghrist (R-36, Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline), who was also in attendance at the event, talked about the importance of the services CASA of Caroline offers children.\n\"In order to be able to connect them with that one person that they can trust, it takes a community to do that,\" he said. \"It takes CASA to do that.\"\nAt the event, CASA of Caroline awarded the Caroline Career and Technology Center for the having highest participation across Caroline County Public Schools in coloring pinwheels to inspire hope from children experiencing abuse. Horn said 40% of CCTC students colored pinwheels. She said they will receive a Kona Ice party as their prize.\nCareer center Principal Courtney Handte said it means a lot to her and the center's staff that their students showed support for National Child Abuse Prevention Month, which is April.\n\"It's important for all students to know what is out there and available to them, and that they are not alone,\" Handte said. \"Caroline County is a small community, but we are mighty. And we will surround them with the support and love that they need during challenging times.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Housing secretary visits His Hope Ministries\n\n April 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 668\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Maryland Secretary of Housing and Community Development Jake Day, came to His Hope Ministries in Denton Tuesday to learn about the nonprofit's vision for the future.The organization, which provides services and shelter to those experiencing homelessness, wants to develop a new building and move to Market Street.\nThey toured bunk rooms at 409 Aldersgate Drive, where neat piles of clothes, toothbrushes, laundry detergent and ear buds lie. The shelter welcomes guests from September through the end of April, with accommodations for families, single men and women, and youths.\n\"They are seeking to grow because the demand is high,\" Day said. \"Part of that is that there just are not enough housing units, particularly affordable housing units in the Mid-Shore. We have underbuilt for the last 15 years. The consequence is that people are unhoused.\"\nExecutive Director Stefanie Johnson showed Day some architectural plans for a new facility she would like to build to expand His Hope's services.\n\"I did show him our design so far. We have an idea in mind for land, but so far, it is not available from the town yet. We have our Senior Haven, which is a three bedroom one bath home. It has three seniors in it. Seniors or disabled — it is transitional so they can stay there for up to three years,\" said Johnson.\nThere is a vacant lot next to this senior home where His Hope hopes to build their expanded facility.\nOne of the barriers to completing the project is its cost. Some of the visit was talking about money.\nDay said he believes the best fiscal options for His Hope to complete the project is through the Community Development Block Grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The state has $7.5 million to fund CDBG annually, he said.\n\"Probably for the Eastern Shore it is CDBG money. It gets to the end user when it is ready to be executed and spent for construction and design. This federal money has to serve the low income population,\" Day said.\nThe other option Day mentioned is Sowing Empowerment and Economic Development Inc., a nonprofit organization providing food, education, and training while promoting self-sufficiency and empowerment directly to low-to-moderate-income families.\n\"I believe both predevelopment and development costs are eligible. SEED is the institutional version of this. For the town, all it has to be is a community development goal that they're interested in. Helping unsheltered homeless be sheltered has positive health outcomes. A hospital and a shelter would go hand and glove,\" Day said.\nAndrew Breeding, treasurer for His Hope Ministries, called their hoped-for property the Market Street Property. The land is owned by the Town of Denton and used to be a Southern States facility.\n\"The challenge is putting a homeless shelter literally anywhere,\" said Breeding.\nJohnson said some local politicians are hesitant about the idea of building a shelter in town. Day said that representatives from his office, including him, could come and testify to the town council on behalf of His Hope's story.\nDay asked some pressing questions about how His Hope Ministries and the community interact.\n\"What's that look like between you and other organizations in the community?\" he asked.\nJohnson responded, \"It is impeccable. When we closed (for the warmer months), we called and said, 'Hey, do you have room for our families? Talbot Interfaith in Easton, and in Cambridge the Salvation Army, we are all on speed dial. Even the Christian Shelter in Salisbury. This community is so giving.\"\nDay also toured the office and youth drop-in center of His Hope Ministries on 105 Gay Street, housed in a spacious Victorian house with a broad porch. The inside is inviting and colorful. There is room for classes on financial literacy, and there are many positive affirmations on the walls.\nAmidst a big black board filled with affirmations, Day was invited to grab some chalk and add his. He wrote, \"A mistake will not define you. Get back up and keep going.\"\nThis report has been updated from earlier versions to correct the name of His Hope's treasurer. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Experts discuss Mid-Shore impacts of human trafficking\n\n April 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 751\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Around 180 people attended the For All Seasons presentation on human trafficking on Tuesday night at the Avalon Theatre, where a panel of experts painted a picture of a changing landscape for trafficking crimes.With the increasing use of social media, traffickers find and groom their victims at home, a more methodical trust-gaining method than before the advent of the internet, they said.\nAccording to Thomas Stack, anti-human trafficking and sexual assault response manager for Mayor's Neighborhood Office of Safety and Engagement for the City of Baltimore, because young people's lives are so transparent online, traffickers can target individuals who are alone, mad at their parents and not doing well in school. Low self esteem is the target, he said.\n\"It is all about getting the word out there. Human trafficking has been around a long time, but the awareness has probably only been around for the last 20 years,\" Stack said. \"Maryland has a toxic mixture of both poverty and wealth. The poverty is a major risk factor for exploitation and the wealth is the buyers of sex, the people who are willing to purchase people for their pleasure.\"\nMaryland is also geographically vulnerable to trafficking, the experts said.\n\"We are two hours from Philly, three hours from New York, we have a lot of sporting events, we have two major cities, and we have airports and casinos, everything a trafficker wants,\" Stack said. \"Like we have the Preakness coming up. There will be a lot of males who have traveled here. The traffickers know that and will bring their victims of sex trafficking to service those males.\"\nThe speakers made it clear that human trafficking happens in the Mid-Shore community.\n\"There was a 15-year-old trafficked in Denton, so it is here,\" Stack said.\nBy becoming more aware of the problem, they said, community members can identify victims and reach out.\nHeather Amador, deputy director of victim services policy and programs for the Governor's Office of Crime Prevention and Policy, was one of the speakers. She said members of the community can look for signs of trafficking, like bruises, new tattoos and new suggestive clothing.\nRed flags can also appear online, Stack said, like if a teenager has multiple Facebook profiles with some that have nothing to do with their family or friends.\n\"Human trafficking is here. People don't want to believe that their neighbors are capable of such things,\" Amador said. \"A lot of human trafficking victims don't even identify as a victim. They see themselves as voluntarily engaging in it. They don't see the coercion that goes along with it. They are deceived to go down this path or forced into addiction. They think they are helping someone else out.\"\nAmador had one victim in her office who simply said she needed to make money. She was a runaway and had nowhere to go, Amador said, and she needed housing.\nAmador came across a case where a child had to perform a sex act to get lunch money in her lunch account and emphasized that that is trafficking too.\nFor All Seasons offers a host of services around human trafficking, from trainings, to getting the word out, to psychological services, to addiction services.\nBeth Anne Dorman, CEO and president of For All Seasons, says it takes a village to combat trafficking.\n\"Our anti-human trafficking efforts focused on a team-based approach,\" she said. \"We collaborate with law enforcement, first responders, Department of Social Services, child advocacy centers, school administrators, teachers and the hospital, officials from the towns and counties we serve.\"\nThen she introduced a video of Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman, who created and helped pass legislation to make the Maryland Regional Navigator program when she was a legislator. This program supports survivors of trafficking. For All Seasons is a participant.\n\"Maryland recorded 118 cases of human trafficking involving 173 victims. This figure includes sex and labor exploitation. Child sex trafficking is also a concern. Since 2012 over 500 children have been identified by Child Protective Services as reportedly being trafficked in Maryland. This remains vastly under reported,\" Lierman said in the video.\nShe said she was committed to ensuring access to services for every survivor of sex trafficking in Maryland. She highlighted For All Seasons as \"essential to the safety and wellness of our communities.\"\nThe night ended with a call to action for the audience.\n\"It is a hidden crime so we all have to be alert,\" said Susan Ahlstrom, regional navigator at For All Seasons. \"We all have to be vigilant.\"\nFor more information on human trafficking and available resources, visit missingkids.org, polaris.com and netsmartz.com \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said that last year the department averaged getting one illegal firearm off the street per week in Cambridge alone.\n\"We know there's more out there, and we know there's still crime,\" Todd said. \"But we're making progress.\"\nAccording to the CPD report, in the first quarter of 2024, CPD submitted 200 crime incidents committed within its jurisdiction to the National Incident-Based Reporting System, a national reporting system for crimes used by police departments. That is compared to 247 incidents submitted in the first quarter of 2023.\nThis year, the majority of those incidents have been assaults.\nThe CPD report also states there was a 33.3% decrease in ShotSpotter alerts for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023. ShotSpotter is a gunshot detection system that has sensors that can detect and locate illegal gunfire incidents and alert law enforcement.\nThe CPD report states there was a 40.9% decrease in shots fire calls compared to the first quarter of 2023.\nThe first quarter of this year, there were 46 Shot Spotter alerts and 13 shots fired calls in Cambridge, according to the report. There was one shooting in that time.\nTodd confirmed that shooting was on March 1 in the 800 block of Phillips Street. According to previous Dorchester Star reporting, police found several spent shell casings from multiple calibers of handguns on the scene. Isaiah David Foster, 23, of Cambridge was arrested on firearm possession charges, as well as resisting arrest and obstructing and hindering, following the incident.\nAccording to the CPD report, calls for service increased 9.1% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023. Todd said this is a good thing because it shows that officers are out in the community doing their jobs.\nCompared to 171 adult arrests, there were eight juvenile arrests and 34 juvenile referrals in the first quarter of 2024.\nAlthough Todd said he didn't have those numbers for this time last year, when it comes to juvenile crime, he thinks Cambridge is \"stagnant.\"\n\"I think there's a lot of work to do with juvenile reform,\" he said. \"We have to put more emphasis on figuring out why these kids are out committing these crimes and getting in touch with families by working through social services and Juvenile Services.\"\nTodd said that the department will have a better understanding of the state of crime in Cambridge come summer.\n\"When the kids get out of school, that'll be a big factor of just how good we're doing crime-wise,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore enacted a set of protections for workers and their families that his administration describes as \"a moral imperative.\"Hours after the state's legislature adjourned, a bill increasing fines for work zone speed violations and another covering educational costs for families of fallen workers were among the first measures from the 2024 session that Moore signed into law.\nAt a bill signing ceremony, Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller, a former transportation engineer, invoked two fatal crashes that inspired the new legislation. In March 2023, six highway workers died when a car careened into a work zone on Interstate 695.

In February, Matta's sentencing was postponed so that he could receive a psycho-sexual evaluation before being sentenced.\nAt the sentencing, Deputy State's Attorney Chelsea Endzel recommended the maximum sentence of 33 years with 10 years suspended, or 23 years to serve in prison.\n\"We are very happy with the outcome of this difficult case as it honors the trauma and harm suffered by the child victims in cases involving possession and distribution of Child Sexual Abuse Material and the threat that individuals who have a sexual interest in children pose to society,\" Endzel said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "VAMSA seeks donation of 25 acres for veterans care site\n\n April 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DOUG BISHOP Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 651\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE — Two years into a successful start of VAMSA, the Veteran and Military Support Alliance organization, retired U.S. Army veteran Joe Candella, who serves as president of VAMSA, and retired U.S. Air Force Medical Administrator Eric Johnson, Jr., VAMSA executive director, explained their vision for veterans care, going forward.VAMSA seeks to make sure all local veterans receive the benefits they've earned in service to our nation.\n\"Through statistics provided, 30% of all veterans don't receive any benefits from the Veterans Administration they're entitled to. That is shameful,\" Candella said.\nMay will mark the first anniversary of the VAMSA's resource center, located in office space located at Bay Bridge Marina, 337 Pier One Road, Suite 101, Stevensville, provided free by owner and veteran Walt Petrie.\nThe resource center provides a place where military veterans who are experiencing any type of concerns obtaining their VA benefits or services they may need can find immediate help.\nThe center also provides a 24/7 hotline, 1-844-MIL-VETS, for any veteran suffering from PTSD and immediate assistance for suicide prevention, which several years ago was considered an epidemic among military veterans.\nJohnson said, \"There's been a slight decline in the suicide rate going down the past two-years, when veterans were dying on average of one every hour. However, those still dying in this way is unacceptable, and the need for help for veterans suffering is still urgent.\"\n\"This resource center is for all veterans and their families,\" Johnson said, \"The VA benefits veterans earned also cover family members. We want to help their families too.\"\nBoth Candella and Johnson are pleased with the quick coming together of VAMSA and what its been able to accomplish thus far. The resource center is what Candella called \"Phase 1 of what we want to do for veterans. Phase 2 would be to have a small community where veterans could live and have the resources right there within the same property.\"\nThey're looking ahead to complete that vision of veterans care.\nCandella explained, \"There are those in Queen Anne's County who own large farms/acres that they might be able to afford to donate to help create such a small community for veterans. We have an architect working on a drawing/design for such a community of tiny small homes, starting at 300 to 500 square feet for one veteran to reside. For two people to reside, the home would be slightly bigger. We're thinking we'd have 25 to possibly 50 tiny homes within the 25-acres, a center for services veterans need, an exercise room, and a swimming pool. This community would be veteran centered for their needs.\"\nJohnson referred to the community as, \"Operation Thank You for Your Service.\"\n\"Fellowship is so important for veterans,\" Johnson said. \"All of them lived by a moral code — 'I'll die for you, you'll die for me,' if it came to that. Those in combat learned to live by that code.\"\nCandella said, \"As soon as we get the resource center staffed full-time, we'll be ready to move forward with the living community, and I'm expecting with the support we've received thus far, that will be in a matter of a few months\" Since the interview, the center is now staffed full-time. He added, \"There are communities like the one I've described already in existence in Brunswick, Georgia, and in Alabama. Those communities for veterans were put together by local people wanting to assist veterans in need.\"\nAlso serving on the VAMSA board of directors, Dr. Sushma Jani, professional psychiatrist, of Centreville, who wrote the clinical practice guidelines for both the Department of Defense and Veterans Administration.\nJohnson said, \"We're blessed to have such people working with us. Many of us believe that the mission of their project to care for veterans has been divinely inspired. Everything that has happened thus far has been the answer to many peoples prayers.\"\nAnyone who would be interested in helping with the donation of 23-acres for a veterans community can email executive.director@vamsa.us. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

(Juveniles who are at least 16 and are accused of committing certain serious crimes, including carjacking, automatically are charged as adults.)\nBecause officials cannot serve the two suspects with the charging documents until after extradition, Nitz declined to release their names on Thursday.\nPolice reported that the suspects approached the elderly woman in the Royal Farms parking lot in the 5400 block of West Pulaski Highway (Route 40) and asked her for a short ride in her Nissan Altima.\nThe victim obliged and started driving toward downtown Perryville, as the suspects had requested, police said. Then one of the suspects asked her to turn onto Honaker Street, and she did, police added.\n\"When they got to the end of Honaker Street, the suspect in the front seat asked her to stop and then both suspects demanded that she exit the vehicle. When she did, the two suspects assaulted the woman. They threw her to the ground and drove away in her car,\" Nitz outlined, before noting that PPD officers rushed to the scene at 7:06 p.m. after the incident was reported.\nParamedics reportedly gave the victim medical attention.\nIn addition to searching for the stolen vehicle and the suspects in Perryville and the surrounding area, officers broadcasted a be-on-the-lookout (BOLO) over the police radio, Nitz reported. In addition, investigators entered information about the stolen vehicle and the carjacking incident into two national crime databases, which proved to be beneficial in the investigation, according to Nitz.\nPolice located the stolen Nissan in York, Pa. while handling an incident that involved 10 suspects, including the two females who allegedly committed the carjacking in Perryville, Nitz reported.\nAuthorities in York contacted PPD early Thursday morning after matching the Nissan they had recovered to the stolen one that PPD investigators had entered in the national databases, according to Nitz.\nPolice in York charged the two suspects with possession of stolen property in that jurisdiction, Nitz said. PPD investigators filed numerous criminal charges, including carjacking, against the two suspects in Cecil County, he added. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "After two deadly work zone crashes, Maryland officials press for change\n\n April 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SAPNA BANSIL Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1103\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After a pair of deadly work zone incidents cast attention on the dangers of road work, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore enacted a set of protections for workers and their families that his administration describes as \"a moral imperative.\"Hours after the state's legislature adjourned, a bill increasing fines for work zone speed violations and another covering educational costs for families of fallen workers were among the first measures from the 2024 session that Moore signed into law.\nAt a bill signing ceremony, Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller, a former transportation engineer, invoked two fatal crashes that inspired the new legislation. In March 2023, six highway workers died when a car careened into a work zone on Interstate 695. Nearly a year later, six construction workers repairing potholes atop the Francis Scott Key Bridge were killed when a container ship struck the bridge, causing it to collapse.\n\"The men and women in the construction industry place themselves in harm's way every day on the frontline of service,\" Miller said. \"We saw it happen on March 22, 2023. And we saw it happen again on March 26, 2024. It's a moral imperative that we protect workers who provide critical service, public service for all of us.\"\nAmong the measures to receive Moore's signature was the Maryland Road Worker Protection Act, which Miller championed throughout the legislative session and touted Tuesday, during an event overlooking the site of the I-695 crash to mark National Work Zone Awareness Week.\nEffective June 1, the new law permits the installation of multiple speed cameras within a single work zone and raises the fine for speed camera violations to $80. The current penalty in Maryland is $40, among the lowest such fines in the country.\nBeginning January 2025, fines shift to a tiered system ranging from $60 to $500 depending on the driver's speed. Fines will double if workers are present at the time of the violation.\nWhile the law is viewed as a direct response to the I-695 crash, officials said it also acknowledges the dangers that road workers experience every day. In 2023, there were 1,287 work zone crashes across Maryland, an average of 3.5 per day.\nSteven Cook, a field maintenance technician with the Maryland Department of Transportation who attended Tuesday's event, said highway work requires constant vigilance. He has witnessed drivers who ignore signs, take out traffic cones and slip into work zones. \"It happens more often than what people really think about and notice,\" Cook told Capital News Service.\n\"You always got to have your head on a swivel with being out here on the highway … We're sitting ducks when we're out here on the job,\" Cook added.\nThe new law is part of a larger effort to change driver behavior in work zones by strengthening enforcement methods and increasing education. Distracted driving, aggressive driving and speeding are the leading causes of work zone crashes, according to the State Highway Administration.\n\"Most crashes are not accidents,\" State Highway Administrator William Pines told Capital News Service. \"In reality, they're very preventable. The majority of crashes that occur happen because of behaviors with drivers. So if we want to stop the root cause of most crashes, we've got to deal with driver behavior.\"\nBut the law offers no safety solutions for incidents like the collapse of the Key Bridge, which was unrelated to driver behavior. Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld told Capital News Service on Tuesday that officials may consider structural solutions to bolster bridge safety but are awaiting the results of an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board before making any specific policy proposals.\nInstead, lawmakers responded to the bridge collapse by recognizing the toll that work zone crashes leave on workers' families.\nIn the final hours of the legislative session, the General Assembly passed the Protecting Opportunities and Regional Trade (PORT) Act, primarily aimed at providing emergency aid to workers and businesses affected by the closure of the Port of Baltimore. Moore's administration offered a successful amendment to the bill creating the Fallen Transportation Workers Scholarship Program, providing tuition assistance for five years of full-time study or eight-years of part-time study to children and spouses of workers who have died on the job since 2022.\n\"What happened on the bridge is horrifically traumatic, and I think one of the things that we wanted to do is protect others who are in a similarly dangerous situation,\" said Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore city), who co-sponsored the PORT Act.\n\"Certainly, we wish there were no one participating in that fund, but sadly, we know how dangerous this work is,\" he continued.\nThe scholarship reflected efforts by the state's Latino Caucus, which met with members of Moore's administration in the days after the bridge collapse and sought financial support for families of the victims. The six men who died were all immigrant construction workers from Latin America. Three of the workers killed in the I-695 crash were also of Latino origin.\n\"When someone passes, particularly as the breadwinner or primary breadwinner of their family, it trickles down,\" said Del. Ashanti Martinez (D-Prince George's), chair of the Latino Caucus. \"It's not just about their immediate family, but those that they support in the community or back home.\"\nDel. Deni Taveras (D-Prince George's), a member of the caucus' executive board, said she was pleased to see the scholarship included in the PORT Act but expressed concern about how families would meet immediate needs for rent, food and clothing.\n\"Something is definitely better than nothing,\" Taveras said. \"I'm happy that they can have a secure future for themselves through access to college.\"\nAnother executive board member, Del. Joe Vogel (D-Montgomery), said he hopes the state will continue to acknowledge the workers' sacrifices and support their families' needs over the long term.\n\"I want the families to feel like the lives lost were not in vain and that the state appreciates and recognizes the immense value of those six individuals,\" Vogel said.\nBeyond the legislative remedies, state officials have called the two work zone tragedies an opportunity for awareness. They've said the workers' deaths, as well as countless other close calls that happen each day, are a reminder that road workers take on labor that is essential and difficult but also overlooked. And that many are sacrificing their lives to do so.\n\"Our work zones are filled with mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, close friends and your neighbors,\" Pines said, standing atop an overpass for Tuesday's National Work Zone Awareness Week event as cars and trucks zipped underneath. \"They're building a better, safer, world-class highway system to provide access and opportunity to every single user. The highway is their office. Protecting them must be a priority for us.\"\nAngelique Gingras contributed reporting for this story. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Legal gray areas hinder police watchdogs\n\n April 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: PAUL KIEFER Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1464\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Three years after state lawmakers celebrated the passage of the Maryland Police Accountability Act, the rollout of the new police oversight systems has proven slow, inconsistent and rife with disagreements about how to implement the new oversight process — challenges that frustrate critics and administrators alike.But the Maryland General Assembly has shown little appetite for revisiting the law, leaving many of the unresolved questions about the new police oversight systems in the hands of local governments.\nA Capital News Service investigation revealed that roughly a quarter of Maryland jurisdictions did not get their police oversight systems up and running before the July 2022 deadlines set by state lawmakers. The new oversight bodies in Baltimore City, along with Dorchester, Cecil and Kent Counties, did not meet until 2023.\nEven in jurisdictions that did meet the deadline, some administrators have struggled to navigate ambiguities in the law. In one county, three people who submitted misconduct complaints later had to defend themselves in court against counter-accusations that they had submitted false reports and wasted police resources.\nThe 2021 Maryland Police Accountability Act outlined a three-tiered police oversight system that theoretically overhauled the state's long-standing rules for police misconduct investigations and gave civilian bodies the authority to receive misconduct complaints, review police internal investigations and issue discipline. The reforms were the most prominent contribution by Maryland lawmakers to a wave of police oversight reforms nationwide in the wake of the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer a year earlier.\nMaryland House Majority Leader David Moon, D-Montgomery County, was a member of the Maryland General Assembly's police reform and accountability work group and a leading voice of support for the Police Accountability Act in 2021. He says state lawmakers generally expect local governments to be proactive in making the new police oversight systems work, though he doesn't always endorse that approach.\n\"If there are real issues, of course, the state can step in for clarification, but we are essentially still in the early stages of allowing the implementation to flow through local governments,\" Moon said.\nPolice Accountability Boards, or PABs, form the foundation of the new system. The boards are responsible for receiving civilian complaints and passing them to the appropriate law enforcement agency for an internal investigation.\nState lawmakers set an unenforced timeline for the creation of new county-level police oversight agencies: each jurisdiction, including Baltimore City, would establish a PAB by July 2022, and each PAB would release an annual report on its activities that year.\nBut a half-dozen counties struggled to stand up their PABs and to refer complaints for investigation before that deadline, generally because of administrative barriers, a shortage of volunteers, or simply the scale of the task.\nMoon says that state lawmakers anticipated those setbacks, but opted to set a shorter timeline to establish the new oversight bodies rather than stalling the process on behalf of smaller jurisdictions. \"We ultimately decided to force the implementation process along, even if there were delays and hiccups,\" he said.\nIn many counties, a lack of outreach and preparation meant that positions on the boards \"often went to people who were already in the loop,\" said Yanet Amanuel, the Director of Public Policy for the ACLU of Maryland.\nThose delays have come with consequences. Joshua Harris, the chair of Baltimore City's PAB, says administrative red tape pushed back the board's first meeting to February of last year, during which the city's Office of Equity and Civil Rights accepted more than 300 complaints on the board's behalf; the city did not form its ACC until July 2023.\n\"[By the time of its first meeting], our ACC already had a backlog of cases,\" Harris said. \"If cases are not reviewed within a year and a day [after they are submitted], whatever the police department's integrity bureau decides is basically final. That could mean there are problematic officers that remain on the streets.\"\nHarris adds that the committee also continues to receive cases for review with little time to spare before the 366-day deadline, forcing them to rush their review or risk leaving the discipline to the discretion of the police department.\nMeanwhile, county attorneys and PAB administrators elsewhere in the state have raised concerns that the rules for reviewing police misconduct and issuing discipline are riddled with ambiguities.\nThe Worcester County State's Attorney's Office's decision to bring criminal charges against three people whose police misconduct complaints were deemed to be unfounded offers a prime example.\n\"The law does not currently provide protections for people who file complaints,\" says Amanuel of the ACLU.\nWorcester County has charged three people — including the first person to submit a complaint through the county's PAB in 2022 — with filing a false report after submitting complaints about Ocean City police officers.\nThe Ocean City District Court has yet to side with the State's Attorney's Office on the matter; judges dismissed all three cases, arguing that while the complaints themselves were unfounded, they did not rise to the level of criminality.\n\"I have never seen a case where police bring a criminal charge against a person that wanted to be heard on their view of police conduct,\" said Judge Richard Collins, who presided over the first trial, during his closing remarks. \"I believe that it would have the effect of telling people, 'don't complain against the police because they might decide to make a criminal investigation of your differing opinions as to the conduct of these officers.\"\nMessiah Burrell, a Pennsylvania resident and the second person to face charges after filing a misconduct report in Worcester County, believes his experience calls into question the value of the new oversight system itself.\n\"I might have known what I was getting into,\" he said. \"I never got to talk to anyone on that [Police Accountability] Board. I only spoke with Ocean City Police.\"\nThe Worcester County State's Attorney's Office did not respond to inquiries about the cases.\nWorcester County Attorney Roscoe Leslie, however, identified other glaring ambiguities in the Maryland Police Accountability Act, including the definition of \"police misconduct\" itself.\nThe law defines misconduct as \"depriving persons of rights protected by the Constitution, violation of criminal statute and violation of law enforcement agency standards or policies.\"\n\"The way that it's written leaves it open to the interpretation that you need all three — depriving persons of constitutional rights, violating criminal statutes and violating agency policy — to constitute misconduct,\" Leslie argues. \"I haven't taken that interpretation, but it's still possible.\" The Prince George's County PAB raised similar concerns, and the Maryland Attorney General's office stepped in last April to clarify that counties should use the broader definition of police misconduct.\nLawmakers in Annapolis considered one proposed change to the new police oversight system this year: a bill introduced by Baltimore delegate Malcolm Ruff (D-41) that would have granted the boards subpoena powers to conduct investigations concurrently with law enforcement agencies' internal reviews.\nJim Gormley, a former member of Howard County's PAB and a founder of the Howard County Police Accountability Task Force, argues that granting subpoena power would encourage boards to take a more active role in police oversight. At the moment, he said, most boards serve as a \"mail box,\" in part because of uncertainty about the extent of their role in recommending reforms.\n\"The state law says the PABs should work to 'improve matters of policing,'\" Gormley said. \"What does working to improve policing actually mean? It doesn't mean nothing, but until we have a statutory mandate to take an active role, we're going to have a lack of clarity, lack of energy, and lack of drive towards accountability.\"\nLaw enforcement advocates, however, countered that the ACCs already have subpoena power — whether or not they use it — and that adding another investigative step would over-complicate an already convoluted process.\n\"Across the state, we're talking about hundreds of cases,\" Maryland Fraternal Order of Police President Clyde Boatwright told the Maryland House Judiciary Committee. \"We still have found the one case that says the internal investigation should have been done differently. How many bites on the apple do we need to have?\"\nRuff's bill ultimately failed to advance beyond the state's Judiciary Committee, ending consideration of changes to Maryland's police accountability system this year.\nWithout an appetite in the General Assembly for revisiting the Maryland Police Accountability Act — or, in some counties, confidence to expand upon the state law independent of the General Assembly — Howard County's Gormley says that those seeking to improve the new system are \"a little bit stuck.\"\nBut Moon maintains that state lawmakers designed the Maryland Police Accountability Act to leave much of the decision-making to the state's 23 counties and Baltimore City.\nDuring the drafting of the bill, \"I think everybody accepted that a lot of the decisions would be made locally,\" Moon said. \"We were standing up a framework, and local governments would have to fill in the gaps.\"\nTommy Tucker contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Woolford, 18, of Cambridge, was arrested Monday by the Talbot County Sheriff's Office Criminal Investigations Division and charged with home invasion, kidnapping, first-degree assault, armed robbery, reckless endangerment, use of a firearm in a violent crime, conspiracy to commit the crimes and other related charges.\nOn Thursday, Talbot County Sheriff's Office Criminal Investigations Division arrested Yahjay N. Greene, 22, of Easton, for his alleged involvement in the incident and charged with the same charges as Woolford.\nPolice said investigators identified Greene as being involved in the incident. They contacted the United States Marshal's Capital Area Regional Fugitive Task Force for help with locating Greene.\nUpon investigation, Greene was located and arrested without incident in Sykesville on Thursday, police said. He was transported to Talbot County Central Booking Facility and had an initial appearance before a district court commissioner.\nHe is being held at the Talbot County Detention Center without bond.\nPolice said investigators identified Woolford as being involved in the incident and obtained an arrest warrant for him. According to the news release, Maryland State Police stopped a vehicle on eastbound Route 50 in Queen Anne's County that Woolford was a passenger in. After the trooper determined Woolford was wanted by the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, Woolford was arrested without incident, police said.\nWoolford was taken to the Talbot County Central Booking Facility for an initial appearance before a district court commissioner.\nOn March 23, residents south of Trappe were told to shelter in place while police searched for four people suspected in gunshots being fired.\nDespite an hourslong search, the suspects in the incident were not found. Police were hindered by a steady downpour throughout the morning.\nDeputies responding to the shots fired call found a lone subject walking on Howell Point Road. The individual reported being forced into the vehicle in an apparent armed robbery attempt.\nAs deputies and troopers spoke with the individual, a vehicle approached, stopped and then put the car in reverse and attempted to flee when a deputy ordered the occupants to show their hands. The car drove into a ditch, and four people got out and fled into the surrounding woods, according to a report from the sheriff's office.\nDeputies — with assistance from Maryland State Police, Natural Resources Police, Dorchester County Sheriff's Office and police from Easton and Cambridge — conducted \"exhaustive searches\" in the area with about 30 officers and police dogs.\n\"The rain made things a mess, but nothing that couldn't be worked through,\" sheriff's Lt. Steve Hall said.\nThe Sheriff's Office said it was assisted by Maryland State Police and the Cambridge Police Department for this investigation, which is ongoing. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The discarded smoking material was from a third-floor balcony, the release stated.\nIt took 20 firefighters 35 minutes to control the one alarm fire.\nThe fire activated sprinklers on the second- and third-floor balconies. The Office of the State Fire Marshal said the activated sprinklers contained the fire and kept it from spreading into the apartments. The office said an alarm pull station was also activated by a tenant of the third-floor apartment above where the fire started.\n\"Residential fire sprinklers are proven to save lives, prevent injuries and protect property and valuables,\" Acting State Fire Marshal Jason M. Mowbray said. \"This is yet another example of how the presence of an automatic fire sprinkler system protected occupants and prevented substantial fire damage to residential property.\"\nThere were no injuries or deaths reported from the fire, which caused an estimated loss of $5,500, according to the Office of the State Fire Marshal.\nRescue Fire Company was the primary responding fire department. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This year, it was in Kent County and had a turnout of about 30 people.\nDuring the service, McMath was honored for her time and dedication.\n\"She's an angel,\" one of her clients said.\nAnother client and survivor of domestic assault, Abby Joiner, said McMath was instrumental in her healing process.\n\"I am thankful to the village of people who helped me heal,\" Joyner said.\nDuring this somber ceremony to remember victims of crime and their families, Kent County professionals who work in the crime field all had a role to play.\nFollowing some emotional lyrics and skilled keyboard play by musician Marion Saunders, Rock Hall Police Chief William Dempsey read \"Say Their Names,\" adapted from a book by Don Hackett, \"Say Olin to Say Goodbye.\"\nGuests called out the names of the victims they wished to memorialize.\nAlong that same spirit, Kent County Clerk of Courts Sherise Kennard read the poem \"Don't Quit\" by Edgar Albert Guest.\nIt's a reminder that in the most trying of times, sunnier skies are ahead.\nCommissioner Albert Nickerson was the guest speaker for the day. He grew emotional when talking about his brother, Michael Scott Nickerson, who was killed in the line of duty in the 300 block of Hammond Street in Centreville on Feb. 13, 2001.\nHis message was that through adversity, it's vital to seek out a support system, family and friends, and to turn personal pain into productivity — a way to help others.\nThose survivors who stepped up to talk next exemplified that determination. They spoke of their traumatizing ordeals but also about the strength to live on, thrive and prosper.\nCelestine Heath's 15-year-old niece, I'kea Nicole Jackson, was murdered Dec. 5, 2016, in Glenn Burnie, she told attendees. As horrific as that was, she said God got the family through. Now she sees reflections of Jackson's personality in her 7-year-old granddaughter.\nFighting back tears, Heath said the two are so much alike that \"her and I'kea would have had a ball together.\"\nLorena Batson dealt with her ex-husband's domestic violence for eight years before having the courage to break free. Now, she's remarried, healed, and has a great relationship with her husband and children.\nOne of McMath's first victim-survivors, Amy Mitchell, was attacked in Rock Hall in 2007, when a person she knew for several years became \"increasingly diabolical.\" McMath's guidance connected Mitchell to the Whitsitt Center, where she got sober, and because her abuser violated his protective order, the system put him away.\nShe's thankful for the services and thankful for Kent County as a supportive place to live.\nReflecting back, Mitchell said she's amazed at the life she has now.\nMany more victim-survivors stepped up to tell their story.\nAll were different, but the drive to overcome despite the circumstances was a common theme.\nSue Nickerson, the commissioner's mother, added to her son's story, reliving those moments of riding to the hospital after hearing that her son was shot.\nLooking back, she said she's grateful for the huge amount of support she received from family and friends, especially during the two-year period between the incident and the trial of her son's killer.\nNow she helps others through their pain as the president and executive director of the Maryland Concerns of Police Survivors.\nShe found a way to still see her son in the profession he loved.\n\"I was told a long time ago that if I were to look into the center of every officer's badge, I would see Michael,\" she said.\nMcMath said talking about these experiences encourages others to step up.\nEven Kennard walked up to the podium to speak, not as Clerk of Courts, but as a victim survivor.\nFor the first time publicly she told the tragic story of her mother, Joyce Henson, who was set on fire by her husband while Kennard was in school at 16 years of age.\nKennard drew strength from that, seeing the way her mother was able to embrace life after being burned on 80% of her body.\n\"She is a survivor, thank God. She is so strong. She's physically burned, but when I look at her I see beauty and faith,\" Kennard said.\nBeth Anne Dorman, president For All Seasons, spoke close to last, and was also closely acquainted with domestic violence. Not only did she work with victims everyday, as a clinician, she witnessed it through her husband, whose sister was killed at the hands of an ex-boyfriend.\nDorman said she sees how it affected him and his journey to come to terms with it.\nShe encouraged survivors to do everything they can to care for their well-being, taking the time and space they need to heal.\nAfter a responsive reading of \"We Remember Them\" written by Marilyn Gilbert and read by Chief Ron Dixon of the Chestertown Police Department, McMath was honored.\nShe accepted two proclamations from the Governor's Office and the State's Attorney's Office of Kent County with gratitude, recalling later how she started working with the police as a dispatcher right out of high school.\nShe said she loves what she does, helping people through tough times and getting them the services they need.\nMaster of Ceremonies, Kent State's Attorney Bryan DiGregory, said, \"I have been fortunate enough to work with Shelly. Her intelligence is only surpassed by her compassion. And I think many of you in this room know her compassion. It's extraordinary.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Everybody was mindful.\"\nBut as the years went by, Johnson said she started to notice a change. Work orders wouldn't get filled. In 2020, Johnson and other residents organized a protest in front of the building.\n\"Bradford House matters,\" she remembers chanting. \"We were all out front. The horns were honking.\"\nAt that time, Preservation Management was managing the apartment complex.\nFour years later, problems have bubbled to the surface again.\n\"Same thing, new name,\" Johnson said. \"Millennia.\"\nMillennia Housing Management, a Cleveland-based company with properties across the nation, manages the 122-unit building located at 701 Race St.\nThe company is in the process of selling the majority of its affordable multifamily housing properties, which Millennia said will likely include Bradford House.\nBradford House offers multifamily, subsidized housing for low-income individuals who are elderly or have special needs, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees management of the building.\nThe four-floor apartment building has only one of its two elevators working. Other problems on the property, listed in a September HUD inspection report, include inoperable call-for-aid systems for residents to reach help in an emergency and insect or cockroach infestations in some units.\nIn December, Shore Legal Access, an Easton-based group that provides free and reduced-fee access to legal services, discovered that Millennia filed lawsuits against multiple tenants for failure to pay rent.\nShore Legal Access Executive Director Meredith Girard said there are residents who didn't pay rent because Millennia wasn't providing appropriate property conditions.\nShore Legal Access has been representing the tenants involved in the lawsuits and working with tenants to get apartment conditions improved.\nIn an April statement to the Star Democrat, Millennia said, \"The management team had worked with these residents to address their outstanding balances, but rent had not been paid in more than two years.\"\nRecently, these cases were dismissed in court. But Girard said there are still 13 active rent escrow cases, where tenants pay their rent to a court, rather than to their landlord, until property issues are addressed.\n\"Now Millennia has to report back to the court each time they get called for a hearing to update the court on what progress they've made,\" Girard said.\nTENANT ASSOCIATION\nFrustrated, fed up and worried about their health and safety, a small group of Bradford House residents is taking matters into their own hands.\n\"At the end of the day, as tenants, we have rights,\" Johnson said at a meeting in the community room of Bradford House the morning of Feb. 8.\nThe small group — five residents on Feb. 8, with some more in attendance at a Feb. 22 meeting — has formed a tenant association with some guidance from Shore Legal Access.\nGirard said in a late April interview that the association has sent a letter to Millennia and HUD with a list of building issues they would like addressed.\nTenants' concerns range from appliances in apartments not working properly to safety issues, like non-residents getting into the building.\nResident Lesley Stull, who has lived at the Bradford House for about three years, said she has had the same problem since she moved in: she is unable to take a hot bath in her apartment.\nSince moving to Bradford House, she has been unable to get more than drips of hot water to come out of the faucet for a bath.\n\"By the time the tub gets filled up, the hot water's cold,\" she said. \"It comes out (in) a trickle.\"\nAlthough the shower works better, Stull said the hot water pressure still isn't great.\nStull said she has talked with every Bradford House property manager and maintenance person since moving into the apartment complex. They always tell her the parts are on order, she said.\n\"I think what happens is we keep going through maintenance men and management that I get lost somewhere,\" she said.\nWhen the Star Democrat visited some residents' homes in late February, residents pointed out things like possible mold and problems with their stoves.\nResident Delores Diaz showed a hole in the ceiling above her shower, along with water damage in her bathroom. She said nothing has fallen on her ... yet.\n\"I'm waiting on it,\" she said.\nIN VIOLATION\nSept. 12, the Bradford House property received a HUD inspection score of 30c*, indicating health and safety deficiencies and other problems identified with building systems, the building's exterior and individual apartments. The highest score a building could receive for an inspection is 100a.\nThe asterisk in the score indicates that health and safety deficiencies with smoke detectors were observed. The \"c\" in the score indicates that there are one or more exigent or fire safety deficiencies observed. It is the lowest letter that a building can receive on the scoring rubric.\nThe September report, which broke down what and where deficiencies on the property were, includes points taken off for damaged locks; mold, mildew, water stains or water damage; an inoperable elevator; inoperable call-for-aid systems; leaking faucets and pipes; electrical hazards, such as exposed wires, and more.\nIn its April statement, Millennia said it has completed more than 200 work orders at Bradford House since the last HUD inspection, and it is confident that will result in an improved score on the next inspection.\nA total of 68 health and safety deficiencies were observed during the September HUD inspection. According to the report, if all Bradford House units had been inspected, HUD estimates it would have found 345 health and safety deficiencies on the property.\nHUD has not responded to a February Freedom of Information Act request from the Star Democrat for the most recent physical inspection summary report for Bradford House, which may include a more recent report with a new score.\nIn its statement, Millennia said it has invested more than $300,000 into the maintenance and enhancement of the \"severely distressed\" property since taking over in 2022. The statement says the property had been neglected by previous management.\nMillennia said that since taking over, it has addressed or is in the process of repairing \"uninhabitable units,\" the roof, elevators, generator, nurse call stations and key fob system.\nMillennia said it has made investments that include new air conditioning units, new appliances, fire and sprinkler repairs, plumbing repairs, painting and landscaping. It said the management team is conducting daily building inspections and quarterly unit inspections.\nCambridge Assistant City Manager Brandon Hesson said code enforcement is a priority for him and the city. He said the city has taken a collaborative approach in the last year and a half in an effort to get these problems at Bradford House resolved.\nCambridge Code Enforcement is on site at Bradford House at least once a week, Hesson said. He said he speaks with Millennia's attorneys roughly once a month about specific, more serious concerns. He speaks with HUD every two weeks or so about Bradford House.\n\"These are super unique issues, and they're going to require super unique solutions,\" he said. \"We're not done, but we've gotten to something that appears to be producing results.\"\nHesson said that every Friday, Millennia gives the city updates on the 40 or 50 things that it has fixed that week.\n\"I don't want to paint them to be saints,\" Hesson said about Millennia. \"But I do feel there's a lot more effort now than there really ever has been.\"\nFEELING SAFE AT HOME\nAlong with concerns with the building itself, residents have concerns related to non-residents coming into the building.\nIn March, resident Tena Cheaton said there was a need for better, more consistent security at Bradford House.\n\"People come in here acting like they run this place that don't even live here,\" Cheaton said.\nUntil a few weeks ago, Bradford House only had a building attendant. Now, they have security, a company called Public Security LLC, which is based in Chester.\nJohnson is hopeful this will address the security and safety issues that Bradford House residents have been experiencing.\nBetween Aug. 1, 2021, and Feb. 21, 2024, the Cambridge Police Department received 1,099 calls for service to Bradford House, according to a calls for service report requested by the Star Democrat.\nOf the 1,099 calls, 93 were for trespassing, 57 were for thefts, 43 were for assaults and 19 were for drug complaints. The top three categories of calls for service were non-criminal miscellaneous reports, welfare checks and trespassing reports.\nPolice Chief Justin Todd said Cambridge Police considers Bradford House a high-crime area. He said that last year alone, the number of calls for service to Bradford House averaged more than two calls per day.\n\"Which creates a problem for the community and the neighborhoods (and) businesses that surround the Bradford House,\" he said.\nTodd said apartment management should be responsible for what happens on their property and should make sure that all safety precautions are taken for tenants. He is hopeful about the new addition of security.\nTodd said police have made efforts to reduce crime at Bradford House. He said the department is using community policing to try to build communication and help prevent crime.\nThe department has assigned two officers to make regular contact with Bradford House management. Todd said these efforts have increased communication, including with tenants.\nThe list of security concerns voiced by tenants is long.\nCheaton said she has been held at knifepoint, threatened and assaulted on Bradford House property. The instances led Cheaton to move out for about a month to live with her daughter.\n\"Nothing was being done,\" she said.\nCheaton isn't the only resident who has security concerns. When there was just a building attendant, resident Dinah Hunt said the attendant would only come for a little while and then leave.\n\"It's 6 o'clock, I'm looking for him, … but he was nowhere to be (found),\" she said.\nIn a statement, Millennia said the property's night attendant patrols the halls and checks visitors in and out.\nGirard from Shore Legal Access said there was a time when the front door had no lock on it, allowing easy access into the building. She said Millennia has fixed that.\n\"So that is one step in the right direction,\" she said. \"However, there are many other ways for people to get inside the building.\"\nShe said people who don't live in the building have easy access and are using the common areas and open areas in the hallways \"as a bathroom.\" Todd mentioned instances of prostitution and people sleeping in the stairwells.\nGirard pointed out that in the HUD inspection report, there are multiple units that have doors with damaged hardware or locks. According to the report, this includes entry doors to apartments that don't latch or can't be locked.\nIn its April statement, Millennia said that \"despite repeated damage to the doors by residents and visitors, the building doors are working.\" It said the company has spent more than $12,000 on door repairs in the last six months.\nMillennia said the management team works to provide residents with a safe and secure environment. The statement said the property manager and staff have a relationship with the Cambridge Police, and security camera footage is shared with law enforcement when a crime occurs. It said the property management team sends violations to anyone residing at the property that is the cause of an assault or theft.\nMORE THAN MILLENNIA\nIn December, Millennia was barred by HUD from participating in any new business with HUD for five years.\nIn a statement to the Star Democrat, Ethan Handelman, HUD deputy assistant secretary for multifamily housing programs, said the action doesn't affect Millennia's existing properties or contracts with HUD, and he said that HUD is \"pursuing separate enforcement actions and will take further action as appropriate and necessary.\"\nHandelman said the department expects Millennia to continue to perform any needed repairs or maintenance at its properties, and HUD will continue to monitor Millennia properties. He did not say why the debarment had been issued.\nAccording to a February Vice article, which details the dangerous conditions that Millennia tenants have faced, Bradford House is not the only Millennia-managed apartment where tenants have had concerns. The article mentions incidents in Mississippi, Arkansas, Georgia and other states.\nIn statements to the Star Democrat, Millennia said that in January 2023, the company decided to sell the majority of its affordable multifamily housing properties. This will likely include Bradford House, it said.\n\"The Millennia Companies is thankful for its decades of partnership with HUD and looks forward to facilitating a smooth transition in partnership with HUD and the future buyer,\" Millennia said. \"While The Millennia Companies is in the process of addressing all issues raised by HUD, the company will satisfy all obligations and issues with the completion of the sale.\"\nAccording to its website, Millennia owns and operates more than 280 apartment developments in 26 states.\nGirard has concerns about what this news will mean for Bradford House and its residents. She said it's unclear to her how much Millennia will invest in Bradford House and whether they will fix the problems.\n\"It really creates a lot of uncertainty for the tenants and for the community about what's going to happen to this building,\" she said.\nMAKING CHANGE HAPPEN\nJohnson said that Bradford House residents just want to live in a clean environment where management does what it's supposed to.\n\"(We) need real management,\" she said.\nIn February, Stull said the formation of the tenant association made her more hopeful that Bradford House will change for the better, but she said it's hard for her to look on the bright side of things.\n\"If something gets done, it'll be great,\" she said.\nMultiple residents, including Stull, Cheaton and Johnson are considering moving.\nAnd although Johnson is looking to move out of Bradford House, she doesn't see the move closing that chapter in her life.\n\"Even when I do move, I'm still coming back and helping them,\" she said about her neighbors. \"I am not going to leave them hanging. I will come back every day.\"\nJohnson has been instrumental in getting residents together to start a tenant association for Bradford House residents. She sees herself as a leader in the building.\n\"A lot of people don't like to speak up,\" she said. \"But somebody's got to give them a voice. And you know me, I'm their voice.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Diving into National Water Safety Month\n\n May 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: CAROLINE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT | Section: Life \n \n 506\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n May is not just about blooming flowers and warmer weather; it's also National Water Safety Month, a crucial time to raise awareness about the importance of water safety, particularly for children.As families gear up for pool parties, beach vacations and lazy days on the river, it's essential for parents to prioritize safety to ensure that every aquatic adventure remains a fun experience.\nSupervision is Key\nFirst and foremost, maintaining constant supervision is paramount when children are around water. Whether it's a backyard pool, a nearby river or the ocean, a watchful eye can make all the difference.\nTake turns designating a specific adult in your family or group as the assigned water watcher, and ensure they are not distracted by phones or other activities. Being present and attentive can be the most effective preventive measure against potential accidents.\nSwim Lessons\nEnrolling children in swim lessons early on is an investment in their safety and confidence around water.\nProfessional instructors can teach essential water skills, instill proper techniques and build a foundation for a lifetime of safe swimming. Caroline County Recreation and Parks, the YMCA and private swim instruction companies in the region offer classes suitable for different age groups, making it convenient for parents to get their kids started on this crucial life skill. Scholarships may also be available to help make lessons affordable for all families.\nKnow Your Limits\nUnderstanding the swimming abilities of your children is crucial when selecting water environments. Whether it's a calm neighborhood pool or a more dynamic beach setting, choose locations that match the swimming proficiency of your kids.\nInexperienced swimmers may benefit more from controlled environments with lifeguards and clear safety guidelines.\nWater Safety Gear\nEquip your children with appropriate safety gear. For non-swimmers or those still building their skills, life jackets and floatation devices are essential.\nEnsure that the gear fits properly and is Coast Guard-approved. These tools not only provide an added layer of protection but also boost confidence, allowing kids to enjoy the water with a sense of security.\nEstablish and Enforce Pool Rules\nIf you have a pool at home or if your children visit family or friends with pools, establish and enforce a set of safety rules.\nMake sure your children understand the importance of following these rules, such as no running around the pool, no diving in shallow water and always entering the water feet first. Consistent reinforcement of these guidelines will create a safe and responsible pool environment.\nEmergency Preparedness\nLastly, be prepared for emergencies. Ensure that you and your children know basic water rescue skills, CPR and how to call for help in case of an emergency. Quick response time is often crucial in water-related incidents, and having the knowledge and ability to act promptly can be lifesaving.\nIn conclusion, as we celebrate National Water Safety Month, let's pledge to keep our families safe, happy and splashing responsibly.\nBy prioritizing supervision, investing in swim lessons, choosing appropriate environments, using safety gear, establishing and enforcing pool rules and being prepared for emergencies, parents can ensure that their kids develop a love for water activities while staying safe in the process. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Commissioners approve extended MOU with sheriff's office for Ridgely policing\n\n May 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Life \n \n 655\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Building on a temporary agreement forged in the weeks following the March suspension of Ridgely's entire police force, the Town of Ridgely and the Caroline County Sheriff's Office have agreed to a more permanent plan for ensuring law enforcement coverage in the town.At their May 6 meeting, the Ridgely commissioners approved a memorandum of understanding for fiscal year 2025 that will ensure the sheriff's office provides law enforcement services to Ridgely in the absence of the Ridgely Police Department.\nThis is a longer term arrangement than originally conceived.\nOn March 13, the commissioners of Ridgely suspended the entire Ridgely police department with pay, effective immediately, pending an investigation by the Office of the Maryland State Prosecutor. No reason for the investigation has been indicated publicly.\n\"To guarantee uninterrupted public safety services, the Commissioners initiated a temporary agreement with the Caroline County Sheriff's Office,\" said Ridgely in a press release. \"Now, building upon this temporary arrangement, Ridgely and the Caroline County Sheriff's Office have established a long-term partnership through an updated Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). This MOU will provide the Town of Ridgely with complete law enforcement coverage, by the Caroline County Sheriff's Office, for the fiscal year 2025, with the option to renew service annually. This agreement includes a provision for maintaining 480 hours of coverage per month.\"\nAccording to the first amendment to agreement for law enforcement services, a document between the town of Ridgely, the Caroline County Commissioners and Caroline County Sheriff Donald L. Baker, the estimated annual cost of this service is $474,971.44.\nAccording to two versions of the town's proposed FY2025 budget, one with the town's police department and the other with the sheriff's office providing policing, posted to the town website Tuesday, the MOU with the sheriff's office cheaper the cost of maintaining a town police force.\n\"This partnership underscores our shared commitment to safety and community well-being,\" Baker said in the press release. \"By working closely with the Ridgely community, we aim to build trust and ensure seamless law enforcement services to all residents. The updated MOU will take effect July 1, 2024, with the current MOU remaining in effect until then.\"\nThis matter was also addressed during the May 7 Caroline County Commissioners meeting.\n\"At this point in time, I plan on signing it if the County Commissioners sign it, and the (Ridgely) commissioners signed it last night,\" Baker said about the agreement at that meeting. \"Frank Bartz was there. There was a lot of heated discussion, but that is to be expected. I look forward to the continued efforts by the county, the town and the sheriff's office. So I think that only good things are on the horizon.\"\nMany Ridgely residents, like Lakia Harris-Pierce, who went to the meeting, are concerned about what they feel is a lack of transparency. Harris-Pierce said she is still wondering who gave the orders to suspend the police force in the first place.\nCommissioner Larry Porter said, \"I know there has been a lot of social media discussion about this, but basically this is going to provide 120 hours per week.\"\nThen he asked the sheriff, \"Just for clarification, how much coverage was the Ridgely Police Department providing when they were there?\"\nBaker said originally they were supposed to cover the town 140 hours a week. Vacancies and sickness kept them from reaching that number. The sheriff's office will cover the town as much as the police department had under the new agreement.\n\"Just so everybody knows, the sheriff's department is constitutionally obligated to handle and provide law enforcement services in Caroline County,\" Baker said. \"Even if we back up the towns of Federalsburg, Greensboro or Denton, who have their own police departments… we are obligated to go in there… I do that in cooperation with the commissioners and your staff.\"\nBaker said he takes the responsibility seriously and that he wants to give the citizens of Ridgely some peace of mind.\nThe county commissioners' motion unanimously passed to approve the MOU. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Maryland State Police and EMS units were dispatched to the multi-vehicle crash involving a tractor trailer shortly after 7 a.m.According to a press release from MSP, the cause of the crash, which closed down a segment of Route 50 for more than three hours, is under investigation.\nIn a preliminary investigation, MSP reported that crash occurred when a Ford pickup truck traveling west on the bridge hit a tractor-trailer that had become disabled in the roadway. This caused the Ford to enter the travel lanes and get struck by oncoming traffic.\nMSP said the driver of the Ford was flown to the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore by Maryland State Police Helicopter Trooper 6 for treatment of injuries. Another person involved in the crash was taken to the University of Maryland Medical Center at Easton via ambulance for treatment of injuries.\nNo other injuries were reported.\nUnits responding to the scene included Cambridge Rescue Fire Company, Linkwood-Salem Volunteer Fire Company, Trappe Volunteer Fire Company, East New Market Volunteer Fire Department and Church Creek Volunteer Fire Department.\nThe bridge was fully reopened to traffic shortly after 10:30 a.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She knew the man. He drugged her before raping her, she said.\nAfter a few weeks of \"throwing up constantly\" and \"crying uncontrollably,\" Cheaton went to rehab to get treatment.\nShe said it was her therapist that told her she didn't have to face her assaulter in the Bradford House halls everyday, and there were resources that could keep him out of the building.\nAlthough Cheaton said she didn't call the police after she was raped, she did get restraining order against her rapist later on.\nBut despite the restraining order, Cheaton said she would still see her rapist in the halls at Bradford House.\nUnder the Violence Against Women Act, a housing provider may evict or terminate the assistance of a perpetrator of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Notice of Occupancy Rights under the Violence Against Women Act.\nAccording to the notice, those who have experienced domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking must have the option to stay in their subsidized housing and can request an emergency transfer from the housing provider for safety reasons.\nIn a statement to the Star Democrat, Millennia Housing Management — which manages Bradford House — said the Bradford House property management team sends violations to anyone residing at the property that is the cause of an assault or theft.\nCheaton said she is not the only tenant that has been raped in the building. And this is not the only time Cheaton said she has been put in danger at Bradford House. She said she has also been held at knifepoint, threatened and assaulted on the property.\nIn one instance, Cheaton remembers taking her dog outside a few hours after midnight.\n\"I had just shut that door,\" she said. \"And somebody standing way down there at the end of the building was hollering at me.\"\nCheaton, who said she doesn't leave the door to the building open for anyone, said the person was telling her to leave the door open.\nShe said the man got in her face and threatened to shoot her. By the time police arrived, he was gone, Cheaton said.\nAccording to a Cambridge Police Department calls for service report requested by the Star Democrat, of the 1,099 calls for service to Bradford House made between Aug. 1, 2021, and Feb. 21, 2024, 18 were for reports of threats.\nAfter being threatened outside the building, Cheaton — who has had experiences with substance abuse — said she moved out of Bradford House for about a month to live with her daughter.\n\"To stay sober in a building like this is very, very difficult,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The event raises money for the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Their motto is \"We ride for those who died.\"\nAnyone on any level of law enforcement can make the ride. Although Denton is a nice spot in the middle of their ride, there were no law enforcement officers from Caroline County in the ride.\n\"The Denton Fire Chief and Town Manager have all been great to us, opening doors. The vo-tech kids cooked lunch for us. The Culinary Center fed us,\" said Marlboro, New Jersey, Police Department Lt. Nicholas Szymanski.\n\"In 16 years, we have ridden through Denton every year. We had 650 on bicycles and another 150 or so on support. We started in Lewes, Delaware, and stopped just short of the bridge in Kent Island,\" Szymanski said.\nThese men and women have lots of visible support, not just from massive American flags hoisted between two fire truck ladders, but mini flag waving children who offer high fives along the way.\n\"We have chapter trucks and trailers that bring Gatorade, waters, snacks. We have a full mechanic's truck, ambulances and motor units. Believe it or not, we had the commissioner of Highway Patrol in California ride with us this year. We had about 50 motorcycles in our group alone. They will stop intersections for us. Once we start pedaling we don't stop,\" Szymanski said.\nTheir efforts have raised a lot of money over the years.\n\"Our chapter had 440 riders, and we raised over $400,000. We raised over $2 million overall. It is for fallen police officers. Our responsibility it to make sure that the names of the former police officers aren't forgotten,\" Szymanski said.\nAll the money goes to the National Law Enforcement Museum and the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.\n\"All the names of the fallen officers are enshrined on (the memorial). There are 25,000 names on there at least. We did an expansion last year for more stones to have room for more names. We add five or 10 names to that wall every year,\" Szymanski said.\nThe names are important. But supporting the families who have lost loved ones is essential, he said.\n\"The most important of it — the reason we do this is we bring survivors along with us. That is somebody's family member that was killed in the line of duty. We have their wives, their kids, their family members, fathers, mothers ride with us. We had 50 survivors ride with us this year,\" he said.\nWhat started with 18 riders in 1997 has grown exponentially. Since then, the Unity Tour has raised $35 million.\nTo learn more, go to policeunitytourchapterten.com \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It accuses Instacart of engaging in negligent hiring, supervision, retention and misrepresentation. The suit seeks monetary damages, to be determined at trial.\nInstacart says the shopper has since been permanently banned from its platform.\nHarmon is known for her work on TV shows including \"Law & Order\" and \"Rizolli & Isles.\" She told ABC News that it was \"so unfathomable to think that there is somebody in your front driveway that just fired a gun.\"\n\"I think Instacart is beyond responsible for all of this. This didn't have to happen,\" Harmon said in the interview that aired earlier this month on \"Good Morning America.\" ABC News described the dog as a \"beagle mix.\"\nAccording to the complaint, Harmon ordered an Instacart groceries delivery from a Charlotte store on March 30. The Instacart app showed a shopper named Merle with a profile photo of an older woman, with whom Harmon believed she was exchanging text messages about her order, the lawsuit says.\nLater that day, Harmon was upstairs filling her squirrel feeders when a \"tall and intimidating younger man,\" not an older woman, showed up to deliver the groceries, the lawsuit says.\nHarmon said she heard a gunshot sound and rushed outside. She found her dog, Oliver, had been shot, and saw the delivery person putting a gun into the front of his pants, according to the suit. Her teenage daughters, who had already been outside, were \"in distress,\" it says. The dog died at the veterinarian's office.\nThe shopper told police that he shot the dog after it attacked him, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department told news outlets, adding that they did not pursue criminal charges.\nIn an Instagram post last month about the encounter, Harmon wrote that the shopper \"did not have a scratch or bite on him nor were his pants torn.\"\nInstacart says it immediately suspended the shopper after receiving the report about the shooting, then later removed him permanently. The company says it runs comprehensive background checks on shoppers, prohibits them from carrying weapons and has anti-fraud measures that include periodically requiring them to take a photo of themselves to ensure the person shopping matches their photo on file.\n\"Our hearts continue to be with Ms. Harmon and her family following this disturbing incident,\" Instacart said in a statement. \"While we cannot comment on pending litigation, we have no tolerance for violence of any kind, and the shopper account has been permanently deactivated from our platform.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He traveled into Dorchester County, where the Talbot deputies were joined in the pursuit by Dorchester County Sheriff's Office deputies.\nIn Cambridge, Jenkins lost control of his vehicle, hitting a retaining wall and disabling his vehicle on Academy Street near Cedar Street, police said.\nPolice said upon taking Jenkins into custody, they discovered through a records check that he was wanted for attempted murder and assault stemming from charges in September of 2023. At the time of those charges, Jenkins was on probation for a second degree assault conviction in 2022.\nJenkins was taken to the Talbot County Central Booking Center. Police said he was held pending further court action.\nJenkins is scheduled for a hearing in Talbot County for traffic violations and drug possession, and on a subsequent date for violation of probation.

On Monday, he pled guilty to the count of first-degree murder.\nAt the plea hearing Monday, Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said that on the night of the shooting, Chase arrived at the Easton bar around 12 a.m. with friends, and Smith arrived around 1 a.m.\nCoale said that Smith, who did not have a weapon, approached Chase outside the bar, and Chase pointed a handgun at Smith's face.\nCoale said this led to a fist fight between the two. He said that during the fist fight, Chadnee Harris, 33, of Hurlock — who faces charges of acting as an accessory after the fact of first- and second-degree murder and acting as an accessory after a felony for the same incident — was in possession of the handgun.\nCoale said Chase then took the handgun back from Harris and fired a shot into the air before pistol-whipping Smith several times. At around 1:52 a.m., Chase walked toward Smith in the parking lot and fired a shot, striking Smith in the left side of the head, Coale said.\nCoale said Chase then left the scene and drove to Cambridge, where he disposed of the handgun in the Choptank River.\nChase's attorney Kisha Petticolas, who is with the Talbot County Public Defender's Office, said Chase did not know Smith would be at the bar and believed Smith didn't know Chase would be at the bar. She said that Smith was aggressive in his initial approach to Chase, and the two had a history. Petticolas said Chase had a reason to be fearful of Smith.\nAccording to charging documents, in interviews with Cambridge police, Chase told officers that the physical fight began over Smith trying to rob him several months before.\nPetticolas also said Chase heard Smith say \"Give me the gun.\"\nCoale said the State's Attorney's Office would be sticking to its facts and objected to the additions Petticolas mentioned.\nJudge Charles C. Deeley, Jr. said he was satisfied with what was said and found Chase guilty of first-degree murder. He did not hand down a sentence.\nDeeley said the reason he did not want to hand down a sentence at the hearing was because he wanted to see a pre-sentence investigation report first. Deeley, who had not presided on the case until the plea hearing, said it would be best for him to have more information before handing down a sentence.\nA sentencing hearing has yet to be scheduled. The state is recommending that Chase be served a life sentence with 55 years in prison followed by 5 years of probation, with the remainder of the life sentence suspended.\nHarris' trial is set to begin Friday. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Deeley, Jr., who handed down the sentence, would like Ray to receive a mental health evaluation and a drug and alcohol evaluation and treatment as soon as possible once incarcerated.\nThe attempted first-degree murder charge stems from the Aug. 6 shooting of a 39-year-old man in Unionville.\nAccording to previous Star Democrat reporting, Talbot County Sheriff's Office deputies responded to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton around 9 p.m. that night for a report of a shooting victim.\nThe victim told police he was driving near Unionville when he noticed a car following him at a high rate of speed. The car, which the victim said belonged to Ray, passed the victim and pulled off to the side of the road.\nPolice said the victim reported that as they drove past Ray's vehicle, a man shot at him multiple times. The victim said he was shot in the hand and his car was struck. The victim reported that he then drove himself to the hospital for treatment, police said.\nAt a preliminary hearing on Nov. 21, a detective from the Sheriff's Office said the victim's girlfriend, who was previously with Ray, said Ray had made threats against the victim's life.\nPolice said that after the shooting, Ray fled the area in his car and struck a parked vehicle, disabling his car. From there, Ray fled on foot into nearby woods, which prompted a 24-hour manhunt. Ray was located in Alexandria, Virginia on Aug. 8 by a U.S. Marshals task force.\nPolice said that when the task force attempted to apprehend him, Ray was shot. He was taken to a local hospital with life-threatening injuries. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Chadnee Harris, 33, will serve 236 days followed by one year of probation, with the remainder of the sentence suspended.\nHarris originally faced charges of of acting as an accessory after the fact of first- and second-degree murder and acting as an accessory after a felony for the same incident. The charges were amended to one count of altering physical evidence.\nThe charge stems from a shooting in the parking lot of Sidetracked Saloon in Easton on Sept. 30. Officers who responded to the incident just before 2 a.m. found Smith in the parking lot suffering from a gunshot wound to the head. Smith was transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton, where he was pronounced dead.\nOn May 20, Kevron Chase, 35, of Cambridge, pled guilty to first-degree murder for Smith's death. A sentencing hearing for Chase is set for July 19.\nAccording to previous Star Democrat reporting, in charging documents, police said the bar's security camera footage showed Chase and Harris standing between two cars near the entrance of the bar and Smith approaching the two.\nAccording to the documents, Chase pulled a handgun from his waistband area and pointed it at Smith. Chase put the handgun back toward his waistband area and then appeared to hand the gun to Harris, police said.\nAfter a fight broke out, Harris reportedly walked toward the men. A crowd that had gathered quickly dispersed. According to the charging documents, Smith appeared to duck behind a car and Chase walked toward Smith, pointing a handgun at him. The officer who reviewed the footage wrote in charging documents that they saw a muzzle flash from the gun and Smith collapse in between two cars.\nAt Chase's plea hearing on May 20, Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said Chase then left the scene and drove to Cambridge, where he disposed of the handgun in the Choptank River.\nChase and Harris were later found during a traffic stop on Race Street in Cambridge. They were both detained by police. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Police said there were also vehicles parked in \"no parking\" zones, which resulted in citations being issued and vehicles getting towed.\nAs officers tried to get the crowds to disperse, police said a majority of groups were \"very defiant, belligerent and hostile towards law enforcement,\" which included the Cambridge Police Department, Maryland State Police and the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office.\nPolice said that bottles were thrown at officers \"on several occasions.\" They said one glass bottle hit an MSP vehicle, causing damage to the vehicle.\nPolice said officers deployed oleoresin capsicum spray, or pepper spray, and departmental-issued tasers \"to affect arrest and to keep hostile crowds back from officers.\" They said officers were assaulted by attendees.\nJymaree Meekins, who attended the event said that the event was good for the community. He said the promoters gave out free food and drinks and people had a good time.\n\"I don't think any of the people that got arrested really did anything to get arrested,\" he said. \"I think the cops were really harassing them.\"\nMeekins said he didn't think anyone got into altercations other than with the cops.\n\"When the cops went up to people, I wasn't really around,\" he said. \"But from afar, I could see them just chasing innocent people. Pepper spraying them, tackling people that weren't really doing anything.\"\nAccording to the news release, CPD was made aware of the event that took place in the 500 and 600 blocks of Greenwood Avenue and the 1000 block of Cosby Avenue through social media.\nPolice said that CPD officers were assigned to the Greenwood Avenue area that afternoon \"to show a police presence\" in an effort to stop potential violence or illegal activities.\nThe eight people arrested include:\nA 17-year-old from Cambridge who was charged, via a juvenile referral, with disorderly conduct, failure to obey a lawful order and trespassing.Princess La'Niya Justine Demby, 20, of Cambridge, who was charged with disorderly conduct, failure to obey a lawful order and resisting arrest.Velouse Richele'ne Georges, 20, of Salisbury, who was charged with second-degree assault, trespassing, obstructing and hindering and resisting arrest.Shaqueelah Shante Smith, 32 years, of Cambridge, who was charged with disorderly conduct.Camren Dajour Lake, 22, of Cambridge, who was charged with trespassing, disorderly conduct and failure to obey a lawful order.Ronald George Ricketts III, 24, of Cambridge, who was charged with disorderly conduct.Ja'nya Amara Sherwood, 19, of Salisbury, who was charged with disorderly conduct and possession of a dangerous weapon with intent to injure.Tei'Sha Na'Sha Simms, 22, of Cambridge, who was charged with failure to obey a lawful order.\nPolice said that all of the adults arrested were released on personal recognizance or on criminal citation.\nCPD's investigation is on-going.

Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) to the crowd. Mautz thanked everyone for showing their support to the first responders in their area and congratulated local first responders for the work they did during the weekend, including an incident that happened Saturday night when a boat crashed, resulting in the injury of several people.\n\"This is a day to remember, reflect and celebrate our first responders,\" Mautz said. \"You all are here in attendance. I want to salute you on behalf of your state delegation … You are on call 24/7. For us, you have served us. You should be saluted and remembered every day, and it's an honor to be able to do that today.\"\nThe keynote speaker, U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD), began his speech by sharing his love for the region and the joy he experiences coming to the Eastern Shore.\nCardin said that as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he has been involved with what is going on around the world and the fight for the \"preservation of democracy and democratic values.\" Though the fight abroad is important, everything starts with \"protecting the rule of law,\" and that starts with public safety, he said.\n\"I've been there on Sept. 11 and saw what happened, as being in the capital when planes were in the air,\" Cardin said. \"I saw what happened on Jan. 6, and our Capitol police officers keeping us safe. I know how important our first responders are through all circumstances. They literally put their life on the line by wearing the uniform. And we can never say thank you enough.\"\nCardin said people have to do more than show gratitude through words. He told the crowd that the federal delegation is \"laser-focused\" on getting first responders the help they need through firefighter assistance and Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response and burn assistant grants.\nBut most importantly, Cardin said, it is essential for members of the public to support first responders and the work they do every day.\n\"We're here today to express, collectively, this community's support for what you do every day,\" Cardin said. \"It's not easy. We know what you have to go through today. Not only on getting the support you need through the budget process but the support you need through the community. And we tell you, we are with you every step of the way, doing everything we can to make sure you are kept safe so you can keep us safe.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A caller told responders that he shot his mother and brother. A couple and five children were evacuated from the residence, and local police determined it was a swatting call.\nOne day later, reports of an active shooter on Lehigh University's campus were made. Local and university police searched and cleared the area, eventually determining it was a case of swatting.\nSwatting involves making a prank call to emergency services in an attempt to bring about the dispatch of a large number of armed police officers to a particular address.\nThe FBI determined the Preston teenager, who has not been publicly identified, was involved in the incidents. Caroline County authorities worked alongside the FBI to search the teen's home April 2 of this year.\nCounty police say the FBI \"seized numerous pieces of electronic equipment\" during the search. The teen was \"cooperative and admitted to his involvement.\"\nOn May 16, he was referred to the Department of Juvenile Justice for two counts of serious injury and false report of an emergency/crime, a felony. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Last week, Talbot County Council members introduced the same resolution to appear on the 2024 general election ballot.During a May 28 meeting, the council unanimously introduced a resolution to place a question on the ballot at the 2024 general election to amend section 614 of the charter of Talbot County to allow the council to add up to one cent per $100 of assessed value above the revenue cap for an additional five years beginning July 1, 2026.\nAccording to the resolution document, the original resolution was adopted by a 5-0 vote of the Talbot County Council on July 21, 2020. The resolution was approved by the majority of Talbot County voters at the 2020 general election.\nThis resolution would \"allow but not require\" the Talbot County Council to add up to one cent per one hundred dollars of assessed value above the revenue cap for an additional five years.\nTalbot County Attorney Patrick Thomas said that as of July 1, 2021, revenues derived from property taxes included in the constant yield tax rate certification shall not increase more than 2% from the previous year.\nThis increase has helped offset the county's costs of maintaining public safety, officials said.\nClay Stamp, the county manager of Talbot County, said he was a public supporter of the resolution when it was initially introduced because it would assist in providing quicker services for the residents of Talbot County.\nOver the last fiscal year, the one-cent initiative has provided about $200,000 for the county to offset the public safety budget, which includes law enforcement, fire departments and other emergency services.\nWhen reintroduced in May, Council Member Dave Stepp said over half of Talbot County voters supported this resolution in 2020. The funds generated from this resolution have solved many problems Stepp has seen in neighboring counties, he said.\n\"It would benefit our public services here in Talbot County,\" Stepp said. \"The names of the departments that would make it to the ballot question would be the Sheriff's department, Department of Emergency Services as well as the Department of Corrections. We've seen a lot of positive things that have happened in those departments over the years.\"\nStepp asked his fellow council members to support the resolution and allow residents to decide whether or not they would like to see it implemented for the following five years.\nThe council unanimously voted to introduce the resolution. A public hearing will be on Tuesday, June 25. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Responding officers quickly cleared the building to ensure that the building was empty,\" outlined Perryville Police Department Chief Robert Nitz.\nAssisted by a Maryland Transportation Authority Police officers, PPD officers canvassed the area and spoke to a witness, police said. Within moments after starting the canvass, officers found Caparella and noticed that she had a \"significant injury to her right hand, which was consistent with being cut by a sharp object or glass,\" and that she appeared to be \"extremely intoxicated,\" police added.\n\"She made statements that she just wanted to get her mail from the post office box,\" Nitz said.\nOfficers dispatched an ambulance crew, which drove Caparella to Upper Chesapeake Aberdeen for treatment to her wounded hand, police reported.\nCaparella is charged with second-degree burglary, fourth-degree storehouse burglary and malicious destruction of property valued at less than $1,000, according to Cecil County District Court records.\nCaparella spent three nights in the Cecil County Detention Center on no bond, before she was released on an unsecured $5,000 bond on May 30 after her bail review hearing earlier that day, court records show. Cecil County District Court Judge Clara E. Campbell presided over that bail review proceeding, according to court records. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Most of the headstones were tipped over; however, several were damaged, Yates said. Additionally, some of the commemorative vases placed alongside the headstones were crushed.\n\"Some people just don't have any respect for things,\" Yates remarked.\nDeidre Taylor came from Charlestown to find the headstones of her siblings tipped over.\n\"I feel for the families who have lost more today,\" Taylor said. \"I hope they figure out who did this.\"\nNicholas Grove was angry as he worked with other family members to repair the damage done to stones in their family plot.\n\"Why can't they just let people rest in peace?\" Grove said as he worked to clean the top of the foundation and the bottom of the headstone on one gravesite in preparation for setting it aright. \"This is disrespecting everybody.\"\nLike so many others, Karen Haines saw a post of Facebook about the vandalism and came to North East Cemetery to see if her parent's gravestones had been included in the attack. It was.\n\"I was expecting it to be worse,\" Haines said. \"I was expecting it to be in pieces.\"\nLaw enforcement officials reported that they are investigating a number of different leads. To avoid compromising the ongoing investigation, police officials declined to elaborate.\nWhen bystanders asked what would happen if the vandals turn out to be minors, Yates explained that the ages of the vandals would determine the next steps.\nFamily members spent Friday afternoon cleaning up some of their loved ones' damaged and tipped-over headstones. Yates said the cemetery association has learned its insurance will cover the cost to reset and repair all the headstones.\nMichael Kline Jr, whose father, Michael Kline Sr. is among the graves that were vandalized, is offering a reward for information leading to a conviction of the guilty.\n\"I'm offering a $1,000 cash reward,\" Kline said Friday. \"But I do have a lot of people reaching out to contribute to it.\"\nThe investigation is ongoing and anyone with knowledge of the incident is encouraged to reach out to NEPD at 410-287-5996. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

With eight years of his prison sentence suspended, Jeter will have to serve two years in prison and will get credit for 310 days already served.\nIsrael Labastida Jr., 19, of Glen Burnie, pleaded guilty on Friday to one count of first-degree assault, use of a firearm during a felony or violent crime and first-degree conspiracy to escape. Maryland Circuit Court Judge Karen Dean granted Labastida's request to defer his sentencing approximately 90 days so that his family could be present.\nAt Labastida's hearing, Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard said the state is recommending Labastida be handed a sentence of a five-year mandatory minimum without parole, followed by five years of probation. Leonard said the state also recommends Labastida be required to stay away from the Eastern Shore Hospital Center and the facility's staff.\nCharges against Jeter and Labastida stem from Jeter's August 2023 escape from the Eastern Shore Hospital Center, a psychiatric facility located on Woods Road in Cambridge. At that time, Jeter, who has schizophrenia, had been committed to the hospital center.\nAt both the Thursday hearing for Jeter and the Friday hearing for Labastida, Leonard said that Labastida approached the facility on Aug. 1 and shot into a window several times. She said Labastida and Jeter kicked out the broken window so that Jeter could exit the building, and the two fled the area in a black vehicle.\nJeter was located by the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office the following day and has remained in custody since.\nDuring Jeter's plea hearing, Leonard said that through an investigation, evidence of an escape plan between Jeter and Labastida was discovered. She said that if the case had gone to trial, the state would have presented evidence that proves Jeter knew where to go during the escape.\nAt Labastida's plea hearing, Leonard said Labastida was identified as a suspect through investigation, and she said Bay Bridge records show Labastida's car crossing the bridge to and from the Eastern Shore before and after the Aug. 1 incident.\nLeonard said that through a search warrant, texts between Labastida and Jeter's girlfriend were discovered. Leonard said that in the text chain, Jeter's girlfriend told Labastida that Jeter had been apprehended, and Labastida replied that she should tell Jeter to keep quiet about him helping Jeter escape.\nLeonard said a handgun was found in Labastida's bedroom. She said that ballistics testing found the spent shell casings discovered at the hospital center consistent with the handgun found in Labastida's room.\nJeter, who's sentence was handed down by Dorchester County Circuit Court Judge William Jones on Thursday, was ordered to seek substance abuse treatment, mental health treatment with medication compliance and not make contact with Labastida.\nBefore handing down the sentence, Jones called the set of facts presented during the hearing \"very troubling.\" He said that the people working in the hospital center that day should not have had to experience that.\nJeter's attorney Archibald McFadden said Jeter has a detailed track record of mental health struggles. He said Jeter has had those struggles since childhood.\nMcFadden also said he has spoken with Jeter's father regularly since taking on the case, and Jeter has a supportive family behind him. McFadden said that if Jeter takes the steps to manage his mental health struggles now, it will benefit him as he gets older. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A joint investigation was conducted with the Caroline County Sheriff's Office, Caroline County Department of Social Services, Caroline County Children's Advocacy Center and Caroline County State's Attorney's Office.\nThe Caroline County Sheriff's Office conducted a thorough investigation, including a consensual phone call between the survivor and Whetstone where he stated, \"... want to know what bothers me about the whole situation, is that you said I raped you. Do you know what rape is? Rape is when you don't want it, and I forced myself on you…\"\nThe Sheriff's Office said it was clear from the evidence that the sexual abuse occurred and went on for some time.\n\"He took her innocence away, that she can never get back,\" Franklin said. \"Child sex cases are very difficult, and it takes a team to bring justice. Hopefully, the minor child can now start the healing process, knowing Whetstone will be behind bars for a very long time.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ross scheduled a plea hearing for Aug. 19, the first day of when Rider's trial was supposed to begin, and a sentencing hearing for October.\nRider is accused of setting his house on fire in November 2022.\nThrough investigation, officials identified the fire as an act of human intervention with an open flame, classifying the cause of fire as incendiary. According to court documents, Rider's reckless conduct in igniting the house on fire \"clearly\" put more than 45 firefighters who responded in danger as they suppressed the fire.\nAt the status hearing Tuesday, Talbot County Assistant State's Attorney Jennifer Wilson said Rider plans to plead guilty to first-degree arson and five counts of reckless endangerment. She said the state plans to enter nolle prosequi for Rider's remaining nine charges, meaning the state will not prosecute for those charges.\nRider's attorney Christine DuFour, who took over from attorney Stephanie Shipley in April, said Rider's divorce proceedings with Kari Rider are happening parallel to this case. She said it would be helpful to know the outcome of the divorce before Rider is handed a sentence because the divorce will have an affect on the sentencing.\nThe sentencing was scheduled for Oct. 4, a little over a week after the final hearing in Rider's divorce process.\nWilson said the state is not opposed to Rider being handed suspended consecutive sentences for the reckless endangerment counts. DuFour said the state could seek restitution in the plea agreement, but that has not been determined.\nRider was supposed to stand trial March 4, but at a status hearing that morning, Ross said Rider had been voluntarily admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital and issued a bench warrant for Rider's failure to appear in court that morning. After getting discharged, Rider was granted a request to be transferred to an alcohol and drug rehab facility for 60 days, with the condition that he return to the Talbot County Detention Center upon completing the program.\nOn May 14, the detention center was ordered to release Rider on a previously posted $20,000 unsecured bond. Rider was released on conditions including that he surrender his passport, he reside in a sober living home in Pasadena, he attend Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings and he enroll in mental health services.\nThis report has been updated from an earlier version to clarify the state's opinion on Rider potentially receiving suspended consecutive sentences. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Snyder replied, 'Yeah',\" according to the charging document.\nAt the scene, troopers spoke to Snyder and his 46-year-old girlfriend, Michelle McCarthy, before driving them to the North East Barrack, where MSP Homicide Unit investigators interviewed them, police said. Investigators secured Snyder's weapon, which had been placed in the bed of a pickup truck on the premises before first responders arrived, police added.\nParamedics pronounced Cimorose dead at the scene, police reported.\nDuring the on-scene investigation, MSP detectives confiscated external security cameras on Snyder's property, after obtaining a warrant to do so, court records show.\nInvestigators note in court documents that \"a few of the cameras\" faced the driveway \"where the intentional killing of Cimorose took place,\" and that they produced a video showing the fatal shooting and the events leading up to it.\nInvestigators had sent the confiscated DVR security system to MSP's Digital Forensic Lab on Wednesday, and technicians there extricated a 19-minute-long, motion-activated video clip of what occurred outside Snyder's residence on Monday night, court records show.\nThe video first shows Snyder and McCarthy exit the Locust Point Road residence and then get into McCarthy's vehicle in the driveway at approximately 9 p.m. Monday, with McCarthy sliding into the driver's seat and Snyder getting into the seat directly behind her, police reported.\nAbout two minutes later, the video shows Cimorose pulling into that driveway in a red Nissan Versa, according to court records, which indicate that Cimorose was there to pick up McCarthy. The document does not provide a reason why Cimorose was there to pick up McCarthy.\nThe video then shows McCarthy exit her vehicle and walk to the front passenger's seat of Cimorose's Nissan and Snyder walk directly to the open window of the Nissan's driver's side door, police reported.\n\"Snyder almost immediately punches Cimorose in the head/face area, as he was still in the vehicle. As a response to being punched, Cimorose's vehicle lunged forward, dragging Snyder for a few feet,\" according to the charging document.\nBefore the Nissan came to a stop, Snyder armed himself, based on the footage, police reported.\n\"Snynder removes 9mm handgun from his waistband and points it at Cimorose. Cimorose places his vehicle in park, opens his door (and) attempts to get out of his vehicle — at which time Snyder fired three (3) times, striking Cimorose in the neck and chest area. Cimorose is observed falling to the ground next to his vehicle. Lying next to him was wooden table leg,\" court records allege.\nDuring his police interview at the MSP barrack later that night, Snyder maintained that Cimorose was the aggressor, court records show.\n\"Snyder stated 'As far as I can see, the man grabbed a pipe and came at me.' Snyder also stated, 'I never wanted to do this',\" according to the charging document.\nMSP investigators consulted with the Cecil County State's Attorney's Office before filing criminal charges against Snyder on Thursday, court records indicate.\nSnyder is charged with second-degree murder, a felony that is punishable by up to 40 years in prison if convicted, and five other offenses, including first-degree assault, use of a firearm in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence and reckless endangerment, court records show.\nHe remained in the Cecil County Detention Center on no bond Friday, after his bail review hearing earlier that day, according to court records, which show that Cecil County District Court Administrative Judge Bonnie G. Schneider presided over that proceeding. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Speed cameras coming to stretch of I-95 starting July 8\n\n June 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 567\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Starting July 8, police in Delaware will use electronic speed cameras to help enforce speed limits in the Interstate 95 construction zone near Del. 896 in Newark.The first three weeks will be a warning period. After the warning period, registered vehicle owners receiving a first offense will receive a base violation of $20, plus an additional amount for each mile per hour over the posted work zone speed limit of 55 mph.\nFor example, if the captured violation occurs at a speed of 66 mph, the speed violation is $20 plus an additional $11, which accounts for $1 for each mile per hour over the speed limit. Additional fees and court costs that are tacked on to all speeding tickets in Delaware will bring the total cost up to $118.\nSecond and subsequent offenses are higher. These violations are civil penalties only, and no points will be assessed to drivers' licenses.\nState officials first announced the program in April, saying the cameras are an important tool to make work zones safer.\n\"Even though we've reduced the speed limits out here in the work zone, we're still seeing people speeding through there,\" Delaware Department of Transportation Secretary Nicole Majeski said at the time. \"It is a tight configuration, so law enforcement has difficulty pulling people over. We've also seen a spike in crashes, so we're hoping the cameras will help.\"\nSimilar to the red light cameras common throughout the state, speed cameras will take pictures of violators' license plates, and those drivers will receive a ticket in the mail. The driver must exceed the speed limit by at least 11 mph in order to receive a ticket via a speed camera.\nDelDOT first used speed cameras in 2022 when the state legislature authorized a pilot program focused on an I-95 project in Wilmington.\n\"We saw speeds reduced significantly, both northbound and southbound, and accidents were cut in half,\" Majeski said. \"We saw as a direct result of having those cameras that people slow down, and it really paid off.\"\nLast year, after lobbying from Newark officials and others, the legislature expanded the program to allow cameras in work zones and residential areas throughout the state. After developing regulations and choosing a vendor, DelDOT is ready to install the first new cameras in the work zone at the I-95/Del. 896 interchange, which is in the midst of a two-year reconstruction project.\nBrandon Zerilla, who is leading the project for DelDOT contractor Wagman, said earlier this year that the cameras will be a welcomed safety tool for his workers.\n\"These cameras have proven to reduce the speeds in the work zone, reduce crashes and increase awareness in the work zone,\" Zerilla said, adding that far too many drivers do not slow down while passing through the I-95 construction site.\nThe interchange project, which is the largest work zone in Delaware, involves building new flyover ramps from southbound Del. 896 to northbound I-95 and from southbound I-95 to southbound Del. 896. The flyovers will increase the distance between exit and entrance ramps, reducing the traffic weaving that causes crashes at the current interchange.\nThe project also includes widening a one-mile stretch of the interstate to provide for longer acceleration and deceleration lanes, as well as upgraded lighting, rehabilitation of 10 existing bridges, the construction of six new bridges for the flyovers, and the construction of a walking and biking bridge over the interstate.\nWork began last spring and will continue through fall 2025. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Gas grills and propane stoves are allowed.\nSonny Jones, fire chief for Easton Volunteer Fire Department, has seen increased calls in the county during this spell of hot and dry weather.\n\"Right now it's so dry, just something as simple as a spark coming from a vehicle … or an ember that flies from someone who has a burn that they're watching, … can spread very, very rapidly,\" Jones said.\nAs the Fourth of July holiday approaches, Chris Robertson, state fire supervisor for the Maryland Forest Service, recommends all residents wait for rain before burning. He said county burn bans will help reduce dangerous usage of fireworks and sparklers.\n\"In Maryland, fireworks are pretty much limited to ground-based fireworks,\" Robertson said. \"So hopefully there won't be too much of that. We do usually have some issues with fireworks, but not a great deal.\"\nSomerset County and Wicomico County both enacted burn bans Thursday. In Talbot, public officers may enter private or public property to put out a fire and confiscate fireworks or sparklers during the ban. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Fire departments see uptick in activity as temperatures rise\n\n June 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 651\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — As the summer's first major heat wave impacts Maryland this week, fire departments up and down the Eastern Shore are seeing increased activity.Sonny Jones, fire chief of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, says that hot and dry conditions, along with a lack of rain, create higher risks for fires to catch and spread.\n\"The common theme we're seeing this time of year is the lack of moisture content in the ground and vegetation,\" Jones said. \"When you lower the moisture content of vegetation, it doesn't take as much for it to catch fire. Especially on dry, windy days, it spreads very rapidly.\"\nJones said the department has received multiple calls in recent days for farm-related incidents in which a tractor or combine has caught fire. Wednesday, a fire on Cordova Road began when a combine burned internally, Jones said, adding it was a \"very fortunate\" outcome.\n\"Some of them are as a result of farming operations where you have an equipment malfunction and the piece of farm equipment — because of the product that it's picking — is very, very dry,\" he said.\nThe Easton department has put together an unofficial \"farmer's task force\" to help combat fires. Jones said farmers throughout Talbot County have tractors ready to \"disc\" around a field fire to the blaze from spreading.\n\"You're creating a groundbreak between what's burning and not burning,\" he said. It also is important in saving the farmer's crop, Jones said.\nPreston Volunteer Fire Company Fire Chief Robbie Phillips said his team encourages farmers to always have such tractors on hand.\nPhillips was on call for a combine fire in Hurlock Thursday afternoon. While he said there were no injuries, the frequency of calls is increasing.\n\"Along the Mid-Shore area, it's common to get a couple here and there,\" Phillips said. \"But it's something you're seeing on a daily basis (now).\"\nEVFD also responded to a call at the Walgreens on the corner of U.S. Route 50 and Dover Road Wednesday. Jones said it was a mulch fire started by a cigarette.\nResidentially, charcoal or wood-fire grills and bonfires are susceptible to starting a fire. Jones said just a spark or an ember can be the onset. The fire chief recommends against outdoor fires due to weather conditions.\n\"As far as burn pits or outdoor campfires, at this point, until we get some rain, I would discourage it,\" Jones said. Phillips and Jones both encouraged people to have a garden hose nearby for any open burning.\nRescue Fire Company Fire Chief Adam Pritchett hasn't seen an uptick in Dorchester County calls yet, but did offer advice for residents with the Fourth of July season approaching.\n\"Watch for dry grasses, woods, so forth,\" Pritchett said about setting off fireworks. \"They want to always be away from any type of wood line. And definitely keep a distance from a house.\"\nRescue Fire Company reported to a house fire Thursday afternoon on Robbins Street in Cambridge that displaced eight people. Pritchett said it took about 30 firefighters from Talbot and Dorchester volunteer units around one hour to control the fire.\nThe dangers don't just extend to farmers and residents. Jones said there is an \"increased danger to our personnel\" due to the excessive temperatures. His team is working shorter shifts than normal as they often overheat in protective clothing.\nThe Talbot County Department of Emergency Services has a medical ambulance bus on site that can hold firefighters in air conditioning for relief from the heat. \"It requires more manpower, more personnel to respond,\" Jones said.\nAccording to Jones, all volunteer fire companies in Talbot County are currently accepting donations of bottled water and Gatorade as the heat wave worsens through this weekend.\nThe Talbot County Council will hold a special meeting to discuss a burn ban Friday at 1 p.m. If enacted, the ban would prohibit all open burning, such as fireworks and sparklers.\nBoth Somerset County and Wicomico County enacted burn bans Thursday.\nReporter Maggie Trovato contributed to this story. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Crankshaw-Quimby noted that the shelter has yet to reach its busiest time of the year for kitten, which is in the later summer months and early fall.\n\"This is a trend we are seeing across the country,\" Crankshaw-Quimby said. \"I am the president of Professional Animal Workers of Maryland, the state association of shelters and animal control agencies, and we are seeing crisis level intake in our larger municipalities.\"\nA similar trend is being seen in Caroline County.\nKaren Culotta, director of the Caroline County Humane Society, said the number of dogs at the animal shelter has increased significantly over the past four years.\nThe shelter is currently at 95% capacity. Though Culotta said they spend all their efforts caring for all the animals they can, the influx has overwhelmed the shelter.\nCulotta acknowledged that it is difficult to determine the exact reason for the influx. She said it seems to go beyond issues of pets going without being spayed or neutered. She speculates that it could be economically driven.\n\"For some people, with the cost of vet care going up, with the cost of everything going up, or, since the pandemic, sometimes (people) can't afford to feed their animals or can't afford to get vaccinations, which is required of every cat and dog in the state of Maryland,\" Culotta said. \"It's very challenging for everybody here.\"\nCrankshaw-Quimby said that the Talbot County Shelter has embedded essential programs to help address the large number of animals the shelter is facing.\n\"We work very hard to keep animals out of the shelter with our robust assortment of programs; however, being an open admission shelter that turns no county resident in need of surrendering their pet away, as well as performing the role of animal control, one large animal control seizure or a wave of animal surrenders could put us over the top,\" Crankshaw-Quimby said. \"This is why the foster, spay/neuter and intervention programs are so very important.\"\nCulotta said she has contacted directors of other local shelters, and they have noted the \"odd\" rise in intake.\n\"It's definitely a crisis here on the Eastern Shore,\" Culotta said.\nCulotta and Crankshaw-Quimby encouraged residents to partake in spray/neuter programs and to sign-up to take in foster animals, particularly dogs, at a local shelter. Participating in these programs can assist shelters as they go through high animal intake, they said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Campbell is in his 70s and took up the hobby late in life. He is an active member of Queen Anne's County RACES (Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service, pronounced RAY-seas). He is also a part of the QAC Amateur Radio Club (QAARC). The Queen Anne's Amateur Radio Club (QAARC) is a growing group of amateur radio operators who are passionate about the hobby. The club was formed in the spring of 2010 because of a need to support amateur activity and communication in the Queen Anne's County area.Several members of the club endured the heat and set up their kit in a field at Tuckahoe State Park to participate in the 2024 American Radio Relay League Amateur Radio Field Day exercise and contest June 22-23.\nThis event is the largest on-the-air operation in the amateur radio community and occurs annually on the fourth full weekend of June. It began at 1800 UTC on Saturday and ended at 2059 UTC on Sunday. Field Day is part educational event, part operational contest, and serves as an emergency preparedness exercise. Radio amateurs across the globe set up temporary radio stations in public locations to demonstrate the science, skill, and service that amateur radio provides to the community. It is an opportunity for experienced hams to mentor newcomers and showcase their abilities in operational techniques under emergency conditions or with temporary setups.\nAccording to Corey Ruth, president of QAARC, \"This was the hottest Field Day at least in recent memory, but the show must go on. It's actually good practice setting up and operating in adverse conditions like this, since it's highly unlikely to be sunny and 72 degrees in the event we get called upon to assist during an emergency.\"\nClub members ended up making over 400 contacts by the end, using a combination of voice, CW (Morse Code), and digital modes. They hit every corner of the Continental USA, plus Puerto Rico and some up in Canada too. Ruth continued, \"It's amazing how far these radios reach with some simple wire and 100 watts or less of power. That's only the equivalent power of a single old incandescent light bulb!\" What makes these radios so powerful in an emergency situation — they can be set-up and operated with just a car battery or a simple solar panel for power.\n\"What most people don't understand is the critical service we provide in an emergency situation — when all the other forms of communications fail due to power loss, widespread outage in the cellular infrastructure, we can still operate and establish comms across a vast distance,\"\nshared Danielle Wilson of FEMA who was also on hand for the Field Day activities. \"When Hurricane Maria, a deadly Category 5 hurricane devastated the northeastern Caribbean in September 2017, particularly the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, some of the first people FEMA sent were HAM Radio operators who established reliable communications back to the mainland.\" A critical aspect to getting Puerto Rico back on the way to recovery, she noted.\nHAM radio, also known as amateur radio, is a popular hobby and service in which participants use various types of radio equipment to communicate with other radio amateurs across the globe, for the purpose of self-education, civic service, and recreation. HAM operators communicate by transmitting voice, data, and Morse code on designated radio frequencies, which are allocated specifically for amateur use.\nOne of the primary appeals of HAM radio is its ability to connect people during emergencies or natural disasters when other communication infrastructures are unavailable. Operators often participate in emergency networks and provide critical communications support. To become a HAM radio operator, individuals must pass an examination that tests their knowledge of electronics theory, operating practices, and regulations enforced by national authorities like the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States.\nRACES is an all-volunteer group of licensed amateur radio operators, vetted by the county and authorized to operate under and with the Queen Anne's County Department of Emergency Services (DES). They meet monthly at the county's Emergency Operations Center (EOC — the 911 center) in coordination with Lori Morris, assistant chief of the DES Special Operations Division, and her staff. Emergency Services can call upon the group to activate in an actual or anticipated emergency to deploy to locations across the county, including the EOC, fire stations, medical center, and emergency shelters.\n\"We provide a backup voice and data communications link between those sites, and to our counterparts in other counties across the state in case regular systems are disrupted. In our capacity as RACES members, we also provide the county DES with backup communications for the annual Bay Bridge Run/Walk,\" Ruth said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Road should be community street\n\n June 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 390\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In April of 2024, the Maryland State Highway Administration presented proposed options for redesigning the Matthewstown Road corridor from Black Dog Alley to U.S. Route 50. We, the board of Talbot Thrive, a non-profit advocating for all road users, have thoroughly reviewed these plans and believe it is imperative to voice our concerns to ensure the needs of all current and future road users are addressed.The SHA study aims to address transportation needs, including traffic operations, safety and accommodations for pedestrians and bicyclists. Unfortunately, the current redesign proposals fall short of these objectives.\nEaston's eastern entrance via Matthewstown Road offers a unique opportunity to create a welcoming and safe environment for residents and visitors alike. Our rural communities often lack essential infrastructure like sidewalks, public transportation and multi-use paths. This project could serve as a forward-thinking model, prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist needs over car traffic, but instead it continues to favor vehicular movement, missing the chance to address the broader needs of our growing community.\nWe advocate for a redesign that transforms this route into a true community street.\nConcerns about potential delays for commuters due to comprehensive road design changes are understandable but often exaggerated. Evidence from transportation engineering studies shows that reallocating road space for pedestrians and cyclists typically does not lead to significant increases in travel times. In fact, redesigned streets can maintain comparable traffic volumes while enhancing safety and promoting active transportation.\nSpecifically, we recommend eliminating center and designated turn lanes in favor of continuous pedestrian and bicycle facilities extending to the U.S. Route 50 interchange. Roundabouts should replace traditional intersections wherever feasible, as they offer smoother traffic flow and greater safety compared to traffic lights. Research demonstrates that road reallocations can increase bicyclist activity and economic benefits without major disruptions to vehicle travel times.\nAdditionally, a road redesign that prioritizes pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure over vehicle traffic can reduce carbon emissions, promote cleaner air and contribute to environmental sustainability.\nIn conclusion, as Easton expands and new developments are approved, it is crucial to anticipate increased usage of Matthewstown Road by all types of users. The SHA must consider the broader implications of their redesign, prioritizing the safety and convenience of pedestrians and people on bikes. By adopting a complete streets approach, we can create a more inclusive and equitable transportation corridor that serves the needs of our entire community.\nHEATHER GRANT\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The building's engine bay doors only provide \"inches\" of clearance, requiring custom sizing for new equipment. Structurally, the engine bay doors could not be expanded to accommodate larger fire vehicles.\nAbout a year ago, the company began planning to fix the firehouse's problems. The estimated cost for the reconstruction, house fire equipment, training facilities, administrative space and housing quarters for a Talbot County Emergency Services Advanced Life Support unit would be $6 million, they discovered.\nJohn Foster, president of the Trappe Volunteer Fire Company, said the company's leaders have contacted federal officials for assistance in the next budget cycle and have committed to raising 25% as matching funds.\nThe company's leaders are launching a \"Raise a New Firehouse\" fundraising campaign this summer, with a goal of $1.5 million over the next year.\nThe company set aside $450,000 to help accomplish the goal and is appealing to the community for help raising the remaining $1.05 million.\nAlong with the campaign, the company is seeking assistance from the community in developing fundraising efforts to achieve the annual goal.\n\"Right now, Volunteer Fire Companies are struggling in all aspects,\" Newnam said. \"We need more community members to sign up to be a part of the fire service. We count on our current members to help get the equipment out, keep up with training, and help fundraise, and they are still expected to go to their jobs every day and balance family life.\"\nFoster said the company receives operational funding from Trappe and Talbot County annually and conducts fundraisers year-round to support operations. Foster also said the company sets aside the necessary funding to maintain and acquire fire apparatus.\nBut the necessary funds to construct a new firehouse \"far (exceed) the financial abilities of this small community,\" he said.\n\"We are a 100% volunteer fire company operating as a non-profit organization, and we are dependent on the support of our community to continue to provide the exceptional response that our community expects and deserves,\" Foster said.\n\"... Support for a new facility is absolutely necessary to allow this small-town organization to continue to provide life-saving services to the larger rural community on the Eastern Shore.\"\nThe company provides services to Trappe and surrounding communities during emergencies and life-threatening situations. It currently has a satellite county ambulance within the firehouse with a 24-hour crew for emergencies. With the construction of a new building, the firehouse will be able to provide housing quarters for a Talbot County Emergency Services Advanced Life Support unit.\nNewnam said because volunteers operate the fire company, the services provided continue due to the firefighters' connection to the community. He believes that it will be through the community that the company will be able to reach its goal.\n\"Our members truly do it for the betterment of our community,\" Newnam said. \"Having help with fundraising is huge for small companies like ours; without it, we have a long road ahead that we hope our building can withstand until we get to our goal.\"\nTo learn more about the fundraising efforts by the Trappe Volunteer Fire Company, residents can contact Cheryl Lewis at cheryllewis.trappe@gmail.com, Nick Newnam at 443-786-2035 or John Foster at 410-829-9073. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was not sentenced at the hearing Monday. Judge Brett Wilson said this was because a life sentence is being considered for the murder charge.\nThe Caroline County State's Attorney's Office is recommending Wilson hand Winder a life sentence with all but 50 years suspended for the murder charge. The maximum sentence for first-degree murder is a life sentence without parole.\nAlthough Winder received 10 charges relating to Brown's death, the remaining eight charges — including manslaughter, assault and additional firearm charges — were abandoned by the state.\nAt the hearing, Caroline County State's Attorney Sloane Franklin spoke about what happened the night Brown was found dead in front of an apartment complex in the 700 block of Gardens Court in Federalsburg.\nFranklin named multiple witnesses of the events leading up to Brown's death. He said Winder had a handgun on him and had been arguing with Brown before Brown was killed. Franklin said Winder was seen shooting Brown multiple times.\nShortly after midnight on Sept. 4, officers who were responding to a report of shots fired found Brown on the ground with gunshot wounds to the head and chest. Emergency medical services personnel from Caroline County pronounced Brown dead on the scene.\nBrown and Winder were in a \"volatile relationship,\" which Brown had ended due to domestic violence, Franklin said.\nHe said that an autopsy report found that Brown died from multiple gunshot wounds.\nIn the courtroom on Monday morning, more than 10 people donned #Justiceforfaye T-shirts in support of Brown.\nBrown's younger sister Emily Foster was one of those wearing the black shirt with purple letters. Foster, who traveled from Oklahoma for the hearing, said that for the sake of her sister, she was glad to see that Winder will be put in prison and that he has pleaded guilty. She said she wished Winder had received a life sentence without parole.\nAccording to court documents, a condition of the plea agreement between Winder and the state is that the state withdraws its recommendation for sentencing Winder to life without parole.\nAs of Monday afternoon, a sentencing hearing had not been scheduled for Winder. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

His incarceration will be followed by five years of supervised probation.\nMendez-Tomas was also ordered to pay restitution to the victim, who was represented by Kathleen Callan from the Maryland Crime Victims' Resource Center.\nAt the sentencing hearing July 2, the victim said the incident made her scared to be alone, prevented her from working and resulted in a permanent scar on her face, among other traumas, according to the news release.\nAccording to previous Star Democrat reporting, police said officers from the Easton Police Department were dispatched to the John Ford Park on the evening of Sept. 21 for an assault. Upon arrival, the officers found a 46-year-old woman who was bleeding heavily from a laceration on her forehead sitting on a bench in the park.\nThe woman reported that she was walking the Rails to Trails when she saw Mendez-Tomas urinating in the woods. Police said the woman told them she did not pay attention to the teen and continued walking. But as the woman was walking, she heard footsteps coming from behind her. When she turned around, she was repeatedly struck in the head with a rock by Mendez-Tomas, police said.\nPolice said Mendez-Tomas took the woman to the ground when she started to scream for help. The woman told police that as she screamed, Mendez-Tomas ran down the trail traveling south.\nMendez-Tomas was found later that day by police on the trail at South Street. According to the news release, Mendez-Tomas matched the description of the suspect and had blood on his shirt and hands.\nFollowing the sentencing, Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said his office is happy with the outcome of the case.\n\"We are thankful for the efforts of the Easton Police Department, EMS, the Maryland Crime Victims' Resource Center and, above all, the victim for her bravery and strength in providing police with the details needed to arrest and prosecute Mendez-Tomas in the immediate aftermath of such a brutal attack,\" Coale said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

West was sentenced to 30 years, with all but 20 of those years suspended, followed by five years of supervised probation.\nAn Alford plea allows a person to maintain their innocence while acknowledging the state had enough evidence to obtain a conviction.\nAccording to a news release from the Talbot County Office of the State's Attorney, West was prohibited from possessing a firearm because of prior convictions that include a 2005 reckless endangerment charge and three drug-related charges from 2004, 2007 and 2015. The Office of the State's Attorney said West had a warrant for his arrest in Worcester County at the time of the July incident.\nOn July 16, 2023, Easton police officers responded to Lynnbrook Court for a reported carjacking and shooting, according to previous Star Democrat reporting. Upon arrival, the officers met a female victim, who had bullet holes in the driver side door of her vehicle.\nAccording to the news release from the Office of the State's Attorney, the victim and her son told officers that West was trying to steal the victim's Mercedes-Benz.\nThe news release states as West was trying to steal the vehicle, the victim was inside of another vehicle trying to position the car in a way to prevent West from stealing the Mercedes-Benz. At that time, West pulled out a handgun, pointing it at the vehicle the victim was inside and yelling at her, the news release states.\nAs the victim called 911, West proceeded to shoot the vehicle she was in multiple times while the victim's son stood between the cars, according to the release.\nPolice said West fled the scene in the vehicle he had been trying to steal.\nWest was served with an arrest warrant on Jan. 22, according to previous Star Democrat reporting. That same day, he was taken into custody after being stopped by the Virginia State Police in Accomack County. He was extradited to Talbot County.\nThe Office of the State's Attorney said the victim and her son did not suffer any serious physical injuries, but the incident had a \"lasting impact\" on them.\nThe news release says that West's plea and sentencing \"followed an extensive investigation\" by the Easton Police Department. The department was assisted by the Talbot County Department of Emergency Services, Virginia State Police and the Accomack County Sheriff's Office in Virginia. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She is one of three delegates from the Eastern Shore who will be attending the convention.\nGiordano will be flying to Wisconsin Sunday.\n\"I know that I'll be safe, I know that there's a lot of police presence at the RNC,\" Giordano said in an interview with The Star Democrat. \"But yeah, it does make you sort of hesitate.\n\"I'm getting ready to hop on a plane and go to a place where you know there's going to be protests, you know there's going to be people that aren't in favor of President Trump and the RNC,\" she continued. \"It does make you think, and you just have to be cautious.\"\nGiordano said Saturday's events will likely raise her vigilance and caution at the convention.\n\"I think everything becomes so much more real,\" Giordano said. \"When somebody says, 'Hey we got to look out for protesters,' or you need to make sure that you're paying attention and that you're staying with the group. ... I think today made it really real on how important and imperative that is.\"\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook was shocked and saddened by the news of political violence in Pennsylvania against Donald Trump.\n\"The headline came across on my watch. It's horrible. It is very sad. No one should be (a victim) of political violence. It is not worth it,\" Cook said.\nGiordano described her initial feelings as \"shock and horror\" when she learned of the news. She provided a similar sentiment to Cook, saying that \"political violence is never acceptable,\" and offered prayers for Trump and those affected at the rally.\n\"It's obviously inexcusable, no reason for it at all,\" Giordano said. \"And today, someone who traveled to the rally to support President Trump has lost their life.\"\nU.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), who represents the Eastern Shore, also offered prayers for the former president in a press statement issued Saturday night.\n\"Tonight, I am praying for President Trump, his family, the victims and those injured at the rally, and for the future of our country,\" Harris said. \"President Trump showed incredible bravery in the face of evil today, and his courage deserves the utmost respect. May God bless America.\"\nThe Dorchester County Republican Central Committee released a statement on Facebook Saturday night signed by Michael Dodd, its chairman.\n\"Rest assured, this incident will not diminish President Trump's resolve to save America from the evil that seeks to destroy us,\" the statement read, in part. \"To the contrary, this cowardly act will serve to further strengthen President Trump's fight to restore America.\"\nThe Maryland Republican Party shared support for Trump in wake of the shooting.\n\"The Maryland Republican Party stands with President Trump and pray for his quick recovery and safety,\" Chairwoman Nicole Beus Harris said in a statement. \"We trust that the Secret Service and all law enforcement involved will do a thorough job and provide answers when they can. We support them and thank them for the difficult job they do.\"\nGov. Moore also weighed in on political violence in a statement released Saturday night.\n\"Political violence is unacceptable and against what our country stands for,\" Moore's statement read. \"This kind of cowardice must be roundly condemned by all Americans.

The closure restricts all movements through the median and will remain in effect until further notice.According to Charlie Gischlar, deputy director with the SHA Office of Communications, between January 2019 and December 2023, 76 crashes were reported at this location. Most of those crashes (62) occurred along southbound US 301 and were attributed to driver inattention or failure to yield.\nThe State Highway Administration has implemented numerous safety-driven changes in the 500-foot wide median over the past several years including restriping/realignment, audible pavement \"rumble strip\" warnings and additional signage. These measures have not significantly reduced crash rates, Rager reported.\nDrivers are encouraged to plan alternate routes suitable for their travel and vehicle type. Nearby US 301 median crossovers are available at MD 19 (Roberts Station Road, two miles north) and Hayden Clark Road, 1.7 miles south.\nA list of all major State Highway Administration projects, can be found by visiting the Project Portal at https://mdot-sha-project-portal-maryland.hub.arcgis.com or the homepage at roads.maryland.gov.\nFor a look at real-time traffic conditions, go to md511.maryland.gov. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The pilot was the only person on board.\nMerlini was doing work with the Maryland Advanced Development Laboratory's University Research Foundation, according to officials at the scene.\n\"It's a sad day for not only the aviation community, but for the scientific community,\" said David Abrams, the communication director for the Maryland Department of the Environment.\nThe FAA said the aircraft is a twin-engine Cessna 402. The plane was 30 years old, according to MSP.\nAccording to David Heidhausen, president at the University Research Foundation, the plane was used for advanced research and development. Heidhausen said the projects included enhanced flight vision systems, cameras in the nose and helmet-mounted displays.\nHeidhausen said Merlini was not developing research but relocating the plane in a \"ferry flight\" when he crashed.\nAccording to a preliminary investigation, the aircraft took off shortly before 9 a.m. from Tipton Airport at Fort Meade before crashing into the Tred Avon River, MSP said. Police believe the pilot was headed toward the Easton Airport when the crash occurred.\nThe Easton air traffic control tower reported the incident to the emergency dispatch center, as did witnesses who observed the crash.\nThe FAA said it will work with the National Transportation Safety Board to conduct an investigation.\nMerlini's identity was released following the notification of his next of kin. Merlini was recovered from the water and transported to the shore, where EMS personnel declared him deceased at the scene.

The pilot was the only person on board.\nMerlini was doing work with the Maryland Advanced Development Laboratory's University Research Foundation, according to officials at the scene.\n\"It's a sad day for not only the aviation community, but for the scientific community,\" said David Abrams, the communication director for the Maryland Department of the Environment.\nThe FAA said the aircraft is a twin-engine Cessna 402. The plane was 30 years old, according to MSP.\nAccording to David Heidhausen, president at the University Research Foundation, the plane was used for advanced research and development. Heidhausen said the projects included enhanced flight vision systems, cameras in the nose and helmet-mounted displays.\nHeidhausen said Merlini was not developing research but relocating the plane in a \"ferry flight\" when he crashed.\nAccording to a preliminary investigation, the aircraft took off shortly before 9 a.m. from Tipton Airport at Fort Meade before crashing into the Tred Avon River, MSP said. Police believe the pilot was headed toward the Easton Airport when the crash occurred.\nThe Easton air traffic control tower reported the incident to the emergency dispatch center, as did witnesses who observed the crash.\nThe FAA said it will work with the National Transportation Safety Board to conduct an investigation.\nMerlini's identity was released following the notification of his next of kin. Merlini was recovered from the water and transported to the shore, where EMS personnel declared him deceased at the scene. He will be transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for autopsy.\nLiz Underhill, who lives along the Tred Avon, received a call from a neighbor who had seen the plane in the water.

    "content": "Easton traffic dashboard gives residents detailed look at crash trends\n\n July 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 537\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Residents can now easily access traffic statistics online thanks to a new traffic dashboard released by the town last week.The Easton Interactive Traffic Dashboard allows users to view up-to-date vehicle, pedestrian and bicycle data from 2018 to the present.\nIt includes maps, charts and filters that allow users to see crash information based on time of day, where the crash took place and the weather circumstances. Residents can find specific information on categories such as drunk driving, Route 50 and distracted driving incidents.\nEaston Police Chief Alan Lowrey said it will be a valuable resource for the community to better understand where an alarming number of accidents or traffic citations may happen.\n\"We are focusing on making transportation safety in Easton better,\" Lowrey said. \"We're trying to take a methodical approach, a thoughtful approach to it. … Here is a resource, here's a transparent resource to see what is going on in the town where you live.\"\nRon Engle, a former town council member, helped spearhead the project, along with the Washington College Geographic Information Systems Program and the Maryland Highway Safety Office. Engle has a background in law enforcement and with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nSean Lynn, the GIS program manager at Washington College, presented the tool to the Easton Town Council on Monday.\n\"Hopefully it allows the folks here in the town to be able to get the information quickly,\" Lynn said.\nEver since the pandemic in 2020, Lowrey said it's been hard to recruit officers. With limited human resources but a need to improve traffic safety, Lowrey began to think about solutions from an \"engineering\" standpoint.\n\"An officer sitting at a location, the impact ends soon after the officer leaves,\" he said. \"Engineering (and) other means are more of a 24-hour solution.\"\nLowrey added that it'll help not just residents, but his team of officers as well. The department will be better-equipped to answer questions such as, \"How many of these are left turn-related? How many of these are red light-related?,\" Lowrey said.\nThe dashboard is a step in completing a Strategic Highway Safety Plan for the town. Engle, Lowrey and Mayor Megan Cook have been working to develop the plan.\nLowrey said a Strategic Highway Safety Plan will open up the ability for the town to acquire grant funding. He pointed to Salisbury as a local jurisdiction that has embraced the state's \"Vision Zero' initiative that was passed by the state legislature in 2019.\n\"Behind it is the notion that you try to reduce fatalities and serious injury accidents down to zero,\" Lowrey said. \"It's a pretty big goal, a really difficult one.\"\nAccording to Lowrey, a plan outline for Easton will be completed in about a month. Engle told council members on Monday that a lack of data was perhaps the \"biggest problem\" for the town in terms of developing a highway safety plan.\nEngle said the dashboard will be a \"strong compliment\" to developing the plan in line with the Vision Zero initiative.\n\"I would hope by fall that we're at a place where we can present a finalized plan before the council with a pretty good idea that they're going to approve it,\" Lowrey said.\nThe interactive traffic dashboard can be accessed by visiting https://eastonmd.gov/196/Police and clicking on the dashboard image. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — Cars were backed up for miles along St. Michaels Road Wednesday morning as emergency crews responded to a hazmat incident.The incident, which occurred shortly before 9 a.m. at the intersection of St. Michaels Road and Aveley Farm Road stalled traffic for upwards of three hours Wednesday morning, according to Talbot County emergency officials.\nThe Maryland Department of the Environment confirmed the incident involved a chemical spill, which created a vapor cloud across the road.\nEaston Volunteer Fire Department chief Sonny Jones, who was on site, said the incident occurred when a one-gallon container of muriatic acid in a pool company's van tipped over. When this acid touched the metal of the van, a toxic vapor cloud arose.\n\"He was treated on site and transported to the hospital,\" Jones said of the driver.\n\"With a vapor cloud going across the road, we can't drive traffic through it, so we had to shut the road down until the situation was mitigated,\" Jones said.\nCars were lined up almost all the way from St. Michaels to Easton because of the spill. People on their way to the Bay Hundred area were standing outside of their parked cars wondering what was going on.\nAn alternate way to and from St. Michaels, the Oxford Ferry, reported wait times of more than two hours Wednesday morning, Jones said.\nHazmat teams were called in from Anne Arundel and Salisbury fire departments to assist with cleanup efforts. The Easton, St. Michaels, Oxford, Trappe and Tilghman volunteer fire departments also responded to the incident.\n\"The Department of Emergency Services has a drone. It was invaluable because we were able to provide photographic information to the hazardous materials team as to what they were going to encounter before their personnel even suited up and be ready to mitigate the hazard,\" Jones said.\nTraffic started moving through the intersection again around 12:30 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The crimes occurred on Cross Street, Cannon Street, Greenwood Avenue, Water Street and High Street in Chestertown. The loss to the victims is estimated by police at approximately $1,400.\nAccording to police, through investigation, a suspect vehicle was identified and using that information, seven suspects were identified. After additional evidence and information was collected, each suspect was charged for their involvement in these crimes, three adults and four juveniles.\nHearings are scheduled for Aug. 16 in the District Court of Kent County.\nThe three adult males were charged with 40 counts, all misdemeanors: multiple counts of theft; malicious destruction of property; contributing to the condition of a child; burglary, fourth-degree theft; and a hate crime.\nChief Ron Dixon said they referred the four male youths, aged 16 and 17, to the Department of Juvenile Services.\nAdults charged were Mahlon Luke Fisher, 20, of Newburg; Jason Duane Smucker, 19, of Lykens; and John Caleb Stoltzfus, 18, of Gratz. Their summons was issued July 17.\nThe investigation was headed up by Pfc. Meera Srinivasan.\nDixon said there isn't need for the community to be on high alert, just to be aware of their surroundings, and assist police when necessary.\n\"This appears to be a crime of opportunity, but it was certainly directed at the LGTBQ community, which generated the hate crime charges,\" he said. \"With the suspects all being from out of the area, there should be no cause for alarm with this group, but we ask that everyone stay vigilant and aware of their surroundings.

    "content": "Easton air traffic tower celebrates one million operations\n\n July 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 724\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — In its 17th year, the Easton air traffic control tower reached a monumental mark: one million operations.A Cessna Skyhawk piloted by Preston Hull and flight instructor Nyck Shirkey tallied the milestone number when it flew out of the airport Saturday afternoon.\nThe aircraft is owned by Michele Anstatt, who was the first pilot to receive service when the tower opened in 2007.\nThe milestone is less about the number and more about the tower's impact on the Easton community, Easton Airport Manager Micah Risher said.\n\"Having the air traffic control tower be the veil that increases safety, it's huge,\" said Risher, who delivered the tower's first transmission on Nov. 14, 2007. \"It multiplies everything we do. Safety is our highest priority. Every decision we make has to be viewed through the lens of safety.\"\nOn Wednesday, air traffic controllers Jacob Hacker and Lars Hugle manned the tower with less than 600 operations to go until the millionth. Risher said the two work \"in tandem,\" with one responsible for aircraft coming in and the other controlling what happens on the ground below.\nScott Stiefel, the airport's air traffic manager, said the tower's biggest challenge is communication with pilots. Many of the pilots that come through Easton Airport are trainees or not used to flying into an airport with a control tower.\n\"They're used to working at airports without an active control tower, so the procedures are entirely different,\" Stiefel said. \"And they're just not used to having someone issue instructions and then complying.\"\nThe work of those in the tower boosts the local economy, Risher added. \"You have a safe airport, people want to fly here, businesses want to relocate here, jets will come here,\" he said.\nThe tower, which is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day, is one of 264 towers under the Federal Aviation Administration Contract Tower Program. It means the tower is a federal operation, with its employees contracted from the Midwest Air Traffic Control Service.\n'EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED'Constructing the FAA-approved tower in 2007 took the vision of Mike Henry, the airport's manager from 2003 to 2018. Risher said Henry led the airport's \"lightning quick\" construction of the tower with the FAA, which was the fastest ever seen in the contract tower program.\nRisher noted that changes in the Easton Airport's usual traffic count stemmed from industry changes after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\"There was something that was called an air defense identification zone that was put around D.C., a lot of restricted airspace,\" Risher said. \"That ended about 10 miles north of Easton, which meant all of a sudden, planes started coming to Easton instead of the other airports closer to D.C.\"\nNational figures such as then-Vice President Dick Cheney and then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld were flying into the airport. Henry recognized the need to adjust and build an air traffic tower.\nAt its outset, the Easton tower was analog-based. Almost 17 years later, Risher says \"everything has changed,\" with computers providing radar and weather data that improves the tower's ability to provide information and help flights depart and arrive safely.\nA dearth of air traffic control employees is another area of change, one that Stiefel sees as particularly challenging. Stiefel, who has been an air traffic controller since 1976 and managing the Easton tower since 2018, said the air traffic control industry is \"losing people left and right.\"\n\"Until we figure out some way to get more people interested and trained, we're going to be short handed,\" Stiefel said. \"And that's across the board, that's every air traffic control facility in the country.\"\nDespite state-of-the-art technology and a changing workforce, a lot has remained, Risher said. As Hacker picked up a pair of binoculars to locate an aircraft preparing for landing, Risher pointed out the process of the job isn't much different.\n\"If you see how Jacob is doing his job right now, this is the same way we did it in 1950,\" Risher said. \"This is literally, grab the binoculars, look out the window, see the aircraft, track them on paper flight progress strips.\"\nIt's become a balance of \"traditional methods of control,\" and enhanced data tools to complete the job more effectively, Risher said.\n\"These guys do an amazing job day in and day out to keep the airport safe and keep the community safe,\" Risher said. \"There's things they do all the time that people don't even realize.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The release stated the Caroline County Sheriff's Office is conducting a criminal investigation.\nThe discovery follows resident concerns about the smell and drinkability of the town's water. On Saturday, Greensboro's public works department contacted its water and wastewater contractor, Susquehanna Operational Services, to test chlorine levels.\nResident Jose Miranda said \"the smell is still really strong.\" He said there's no discoloration of the water, but that the chlorine smell is obvious.\nIn the release, the town stated that the chlorine levels were as high as 2.2 milligrams per liter over the weekend. Typical readings are around 0.56 milligrams per liter.\nThat mark dropped to 1.0 milligrams per liter on Monday, the town said. The Environmental Protection Agency's standard is that anything above the 4.0 milligram per level mark is not healthy to drink and could pose long-term health effects such as eye irritation and stomach problems.\nOn Sunday, a Facebook post by the town told residents the water is safe to drink and within Maryland Department of the Environment regulations. Multiple residents, though, commented that the chlorine-like smell and taste were still noticeable.\nOn July 19, the town issued a boil water notice, advising residents to boil water before drinking due to high chlorine levels.\nResident Chris Mason said the water quality issue has been recurring in the last few weeks. He said poor drinking water will especially effect those without refrigerator filters and mothers who need it for baby formula.\nTown Manager Tammy Kelledes said the town changed its locks to prevent further tampering with the regulators.\nResidents who would like their water tested can call 410-482-6222 or email greensboro@greensboromd.com. Anyone with information regarding the criminal investigation can call the Caroline County Sheriff's Office at 410-479-2515. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Federal Aviation Administration said the 30-year-old aircraft was a twin-engine Cessna 402.\nRobert Eugene Merlini, 56, of Annapolis was identified as the victim and pilot of the crash by Maryland State Police on July 16.\nAccording to the preliminary investigation, two days before the accident, ground engine runs were performed by maintenance personnel at the conclusion of an annual inspection.\nFollowing the ground engine runs, Merlini stated to his manager that 12 gallons of fuel remained in each main fuel tank. Merlini said he was going to add 20 more gallons to each main fuel tank so he did not have to switch tanks during the upcoming flight.\nAirport security video showed the pilot added 20 gallons of fuel to each auxiliary fuel tank, rather than the main fuel tanks. The airplane was not flown between that fueling and the flight resulting in the accident.\nThe aircraft took off shortly before 9 a.m. July 16 from Tipton Airport at Fort Meade before crashing into the Tred Avon River.\nAccording to the preliminary investigation, at about 9:28 a.m., Merlini contacted the Easton Airport air traffic control tower and reported a \"pretty significant engine problem.\"\nThe controller instructed the pilot to enter a right base leg, the transitional part of the traffic pattern between the downwind leg and the final approach leg when landing, for Runway 15.\nAbout a minute later, the pilot reported the airplane was at 2,400 feel above sea level and setting up for a right base leg, with a \"pretty bad right engine.\" About 30 seconds later, the pilot declared an emergency and stated both engines were losing power.\nThe controller cleared the airplane to land on Runway 15 via an approach from any direction. However, the pilot replied that he was not going to reach the airport and was going to try to land in a field. The airplane subsequently impacted the Tred Avon River about four miles southwest of the Easton Airport.\nAccording to the report, the left wing, including the left engine, separated about 1 foot outboard of the wing root and was not located.\nMerlini's identity was released following the notification of his next of kin. Merlini was recovered from the water and transported to the shore, where EMS personnel declared him deceased at the scene. He was transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for autopsy.\nAccording to the report, Merlini's most recent FAA first-class medical certificate was issued on March 27, 2024. At that time, he reported a total flight experience of 4,100 hours, with no hours accrued during the preceding six months. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The April 3, 2023, accident occurred shortly after 8 a.m. in the area of Rolling Bridge Road. South was en route to help care for her 2-year-old granddaughter and Alallaq, in his words, was rushing to get to school.\nA student at Delaware State University, Alallaq was training as an aviation student with the goal of becoming a military pilot. He was an officer candidate for the U.S. Coast Guard.\nAccording to the investigation reports, South was traveling northbound in a Subaru Outback on Route 301 in the second lane when Alallaq crossed the line separating lane 1 from lane 2, striking the driver side rear of the Outback with his Chevrolet Sonic traveling a recorded speed of about 96 mile per hour.\nThe Outback rolled three times before coming to rest, police said. South was transported to Shock Trauma Center, where she remained in a coma for two weeks before succumbing to her injuries. Alallaq was treated for superficial injuries. No other conditions, including drugs or alcohol contributed to the crash, according to the investigation.\nSouth's family members spoke at length, sharing how she was \"a good person who had a wide circle of family and friends who loved her.\"\nSpeaking through tears in a barely controlled voice, South's son Jonathan repeated how frequently he thinks \"she should be here.\"\n\"There are no words to describe this loss,\" said Lance Richardson, state's attorney for Queen Anne's County.\n\"It is one of the most tragic cases I have seen in 30 years,\" he said.\nIn requesting the sentence, Richardson said, it was not lost on him the adversity the defendant had overcome, nor his character — to which many spoke on his behalf as being concerned, diligent, responsible and displaying a \"high level of integrity.\"\nRichardson requested 18 months of time to be served and 100 hours of community service. He said he took no joy in asking for incarceration but could not ignore the defendant had a history of traffic violations involving speed.\n\"There is no fair outcome to any involved,\" Richardson said.\nSpeaking to the court, Alallq professed a \"heavy heart, deep remorse ... profound sadness and guilt\" pledging his commitment to ensure his \"actions honor the memory of Mrs. South.\" Without the court's direction, Alallq has booked speaking engagements talking to other youth about the finality of his actions.\nKnight said she recognized no actions taken by the court could bring back the victim. However, it was her duty to consider \"punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation,\" she said. As to rehabilitation, Knight gave credit to the young man for being on that path already and taking initiative on his own.\nKnight's sentencing included 100 hours of community service for Alallq to continue efforts he had begun and five years supervised probation, in which she ordered drug and alcohol testing and mental health evaluation. Knight reasoned, though there was no history of substance abuse, individuals in such a situation may be inclined to turn to those as a resource, and she hoped to not see that as an unintended negative consequence. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

With the lack of after-action reports from any chief of Waldorf, it is not known why this occurred,\" the report reads. \"In addition, Truck 1 was removed from the structure and was told to report to the Alpha Side for not following directions. Once again, without any reports from any chief of Waldorf it is not known why this occurred.\"\nThe report used inflammatory language, calling it a \"miracle\" that firefighters had not been seriously injured or died yet.\nSouthern Maryland News attempted to reach the Waldorf chief through phone calls to the firehouse earlier in the week but did not get a response.\n\"Out of respect for and commitment to the [Waldorf Volunteer Fire Department]'s mission, I have decided to resign as the chief of the [Waldorf department]. The men and women of the [Waldorf department] deserve to have absolute support of and focus on the fulfillment of their critical mission, which is to serve and protect the citizens of Charles County,\" Durrer stated in the release. \"I am extremely proud of the dedicated [Waldorf department] members and thank them for the opportunity to serve.\"\nJames W. King, the president of the Waldorf Volunteer Fire Department, thanked Durrer for serving as chief over the past four years and as a volunteer firefighter for 47 years.\n\"Being the chief is an immense and difficult responsibility. I commend Chief Durrer for his service and for putting first the needs and mission of the [Waldorf Volunteer Fire Department],\" King said in the release. \"I want to assure the citizens of Charles County, that the [Waldorf department] will continue to operate and serve the community with the highest level of professionalism and integrity.\"\nKing said that the department will continue to review and monitor its performance and take steps that improve the effectiveness of their emergency response.\nThere will be a special election for a new chief within the next 30 days, according to the release. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Greensboro adds security measures, hears resident feedback after water system 'sabotage'\n\n August 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 549\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n GREENSBORO — Town employees discussed an apparent \"sabotage\" of Greensboro's water system and heard feedback from residents during a Thursday evening Town Council meeting.On July 29, the town announced that the its water and wastewater contract operator, Susquehanna Operational Services, conducted tests throughout town, finding higher than normal chlorine levels. It came after a bevy of complaints from concerned residents, who said the water had a chlorine-like taste and smell the weekend prior.\nThe town concluded that \"one of the chlorine regulators had been tampered with\" in the tower wells. In a press release, it was deemed \"deliberate sabotage,\" and the town stated the Caroline County Sheriff's Office would conduct an investigation.\nBrandon Cunningham, the town's public works supervisor, provided an update Thursday on security measures put in place in days since. Cunningham said \"the locks have all been changed to all the well houses.\"\nKeys were given to members of Susquehanna Operational Services, and himself and the town manager in case of emergency, he said.\nHe also said he's been in contact with SafeHouse, a security system company, to potentially procure security cameras and keypads. Cunningham said SafeHouse security measures, including adding cameras, would cost $15,865.54.\nCouncilmember Joe Noon said he'd \"like a couple more bids\" for the cameras and security additions. Carly Landolfi, assistant to the town attorney, told councilmembers they could vote on a \"contingent\" motion to purchase the SafeHouse services, depending on whether she finds the town must legally seek out other bids or not.\nMayor David Spencer said he's visited the wells and vouched for security services to be adopted as soon as possible.\n\"I really don't want to push this off,\" Spencer said. Councilmember Pete Breila made a motion to pass the \"contingent\" motion, which was seconded by Councilmember Bob Harrison.\nPUBLIC COMMENTMultiple residents expressed concerns about the water quality and the town's response to councilmembers Thursday.\n\"The word sabotage, that's a pretty extensive word,\" resident Chris Mason said. \"It means a lot, and it puts fear in the community.\"\nMason continued, questioning why the investigation is being conducted by Caroline County Sheriff's Office and not the Greensboro Police Department. He added that he wished the town had passed out water to residents during the days in which the chlorine-like taste and smell was apparent.\n\"Who has access to sabotage?\" resident Melissa Knight asked. \"Where'd that information come from? We're not getting any forthcoming information.\"\nKnight said that \"the entire bedroom (smelled) like chlorine\" after flushing the toilet in her house last weekend. She also asked about the process of testing the chlorine levels.\nGeorge Smith, president of Susquehanna Operational Services, said his team tested multiple locations when notified by the town of the complaints. Smith and a Susquehanna employee confirmed there were readings of 2.2, 0.6 and 0.54 milligrams per liter. The Environmental Protection Agency's standard is that anything above the 4.0 milligram per liter mark is not healthy to drink and could pose long-term health effects such as eye irritation and stomach problems.\nSmith declined to comment on the investigation since it's active. Spencer also declined.\n\"There's a lot that we'd all like to say,\" Spencer said. \"But since there is an investigation ongoing, when that is concluded, then we will try to give you as much information as we possibly can.\"\nThe Caroline County Sheriff's Office declined to comment on the investigation for this article. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

At Monday's meeting, residents raised that the department and its officers had been exonerated by investigators surfaced.\nMultiple people asked for the department to be reinstated. Resident James Romph questioned the commissioners and town employees on the investigation.\n\"What is the update on the Ridgely Police Department investigation?\" Romph asked.\n\"Sir, I'd love to answer that but I was told to keep my mouth shut,\" David Crist, the town's director of public works, responded.\n\"I'm going to answer it for you, for the public,\" Romph said. \"The entire police department has been exonerated. The state has concluded their investigation and found no fault with the police department or the police chief, criminally or administratively. They're exonerated.\"\nAs of Tuesday, town employees and the Office of the State Prosecutor did not immediately respond to requests regarding the report and whether or not it cleared the department and its officers.\nRomph claimed the commissioners had \"known for over two weeks and didn't share that with you,\" speaking to the standing-room-only crowd, which included members of the police department.\n\"No we have not, we have not been notified,\" Commissioner John Hurley said. Crist backed the commissioners up, saying they hadn't been notified but confirming that he had been. Romph questioned why Crist did not inform the commissioners or the public.\n\"From my counsel, I was told this is a personnel matter, you cannot speak,\" Crist said. \"I'm not a lawyer, I don't know law. But if the town attorney tells me to zip it, I'm zipping it.\"\nSince the initial suspension, the town has not provided clear reasoning for the investigation. Nor has the Office of the State Prosecutor.\nThe town came to a temporary memorandum of understanding with the Caroline County Sheriff's Office, agreeing that the Sheriff's Office and Maryland State Police would split duties to cover the suspended department.\nIn May, the town agreed to a new memorandum of understanding with the Caroline County Sheriff's Office, this one providing a \"long-term partnership\" for fiscal year 2025. It included \"a provision for maintaining 480 hours of coverage per month,\" per a town release, and took effect on July 1.\nCaroline County Chief Deputy Rodney Helmer told The Star Democrat on Tuesday that the updated MOU is still in effect. As of Tuesday, the county had not heard from the town requesting to cease the MOU. Such a request would require 30 days of notice, Helmer said.\nResidents have brought concerns about the county's law enforcement coverage compared to what town police provided. Resident and business owner Holly Justice says it hasn't been the same.\n\"When you deal with a big giant, you lose a lot of those small-town things,\" Justice said in an interview. \"The county, they have a lot of area to cover, and although we have officers that they did dedicate to this territory, it's just not the same.\"\nJustice created a petition Tuesday, asking the town to reinstate the officers. As of Tuesday evening, it had over 30 signatures.\n\"People's lives were jeopardized with this,\" Justice said. \" … These people have families. My heart goes out to them. But I also understand the town's side, being told by their counsel that they can not speak about this matter.\n\"Instead of joining in with the brigade and yelling and fussing, I said, 'What's a better way to come at this? What's a better way to be heard and be seen?'\"\nResident Lakia Harris-Pierce said she believes residents should be informed on the investigation's results. \"They need to make the investigation public, we have the right to know,\" she said.\nTown commissioners are meeting in closed session Wednesday afternoon to discuss personnel matters, according to an agenda posted to the town's website.\nVeronica Fernandez-Alvarado and Tom McCall contributed reporting to this story. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Man sentenced to life without parole for 2023 murder of Jasmine Hicks\n\n August 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Matt Wynn mwynn@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 579\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On Aug. 6, Deanthony Lamont Warrick, 35, was sentenced to life without parole for the April 2023 murder of Jasmine Hicks.Hicks was stabbed to death in the overnight hours of April 12, 2023 after an argument with Warrick. She was 29 at the time.\nA video captured by a security camera system on a nearby house was presented during the trial.\nThe video depicted Hicks and Warrick leaving a red Chrysler vehicle in the 2300 block of Woodberry Drive in Bryans Road, when Warrick realized that PCP, a handgun and an assault rifle were missing from the vehicle, according to testimony.\nWarrick argued with Hicks and got progressively louder until Warrick grabbed a knife and repeatedly stabbed Hicks. Police said lacerations were found on her head, neck, hands and upper arms.\nHicks could be heard on tape, from across the street, saying, \"You've already killed me. I'm already dead.\"\nWarrick tried to move Hicks, who was still alive at the time, into his car. He gave up and fled the scene.\nHicks' family attended en masse for the sentencing, with Assistant State's Attorney Laura Caspar presenting the case to give Warrick life without parole.\nCaspar told Judge William R. Greer that the State's Attorney's Office does not seek this sentence in every case, but that the murder of Jasmine Hicks was \"vile, malicious and vengeful.\"\nWarrick claimed at one point that Hicks had a gun and that the killing was in self-defense, but the footage from the camera that caught the murder showed otherwise.\n\"Where's my s—,\" Warrick could be heard screaming on the footage, looking for PCP and a firearm that Hicks' brother took in fear that he would use the firearm on his sister after he had pointed the firearm at a vehicle Hicks was in.\n\"There was no fear there,\" Caspar said. \"There was no gun and he knew it.\"\nAfter the argument escalated, Warrick stabbed Hicks a number of times before saying, \"Don't make me kill you.\"\nHicks replied, \"You already did.\"\nCaspar could only speculate the horror that Hicks had to endure after Warrick left the scene of the murder, where Hicks was alive for another hour and a half.\nMembers of Hicks' family came forward to ask that Greer impose the maximum sentence.\nArthur Lancaster, Hicks' uncle, told the judge that Hicks was the type of person that would \"brighten your day\" and that she was a loving mother to her three children.\n\"Today, your honor, we are looking for closure,\" Lancaster said. \"Deanthony Warrick is an atrocious, cruel, heinous, cold-blooded murderer.\"\nLancaster called Warrick a \"wild animal\" before saying, \"Wild animals need to be caged.\"\nMary Lawson — Hicks' mother — fought tears to say, \"She went too soon.\"\nLawson recalled how Hicks' children came home from school and were looking for their mother, but she had to tell them that she would not be there.\n\"I'll be there every time,\" Lawson said.\nAndre Mahasa, Warrick's attorney, said that while he and Warrick respected the jury's verdict, they still believed that there was no premeditation in the murder and that it should have been second-degree murder at most.\nWarrick had nothing to say to the judge after being informed of his right to speak.\nDuring the sentencing, Greer dismissed Warrick's claim that Hicks had a firearm, saying that at some point during the stabbing, he had to realize that there was no gun.\nGreer said that Warrick's actions after the attack showed a lack of empathy.\n\"Jasmine Hicks died alone in the night on the cold ground,\" Greer said before imposing a life sentence on Warrick. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The goal is to prevent crime and have people know the officers and emergency services personnel who serve their area.\nMegan Coxon, a sergeant with the Easton Police Department, has been a primary force in organizing the event.\n\"We are here for First Night Out, which is a nationwide event. It happens the first Tuesday in August. I probably know half the folks here just because we interact on a daily anyway,\" Coxon said. \"It is like a mini reunion. We get to hang out for a night, and of course you get to meet new people. If I don't know you, I will come talk to you and if I have seen you before, we will reconnect.\"\nShe said she got a lot of help from Jill Garvey, an EPD management assistant, and Lorraine Gould, director of Easton Parks and Recreation.\nCoxon pointed out the law enforcement representatives in attendance.\n\"We have at least ten from EPD. We have sheriff's office, fire marshall's office, Natural Resources Police, Talbot Sheriff's office and MSP. There are about 40 people,\" she said.\nOver a smoking hot grill with about 50 burgers were members of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department.\n\"We are cooking some good burgers. We got some good hot dogs. We got a decent crowd of people, it is its a good time,\" Aiden Lowery, a firefighter and EMT said.\nMayor Megan Cook was also present, immersed in community.\n\"Talking to people? That is the best part of my job,\" Cook said. \"The sense of community is what is important tonight. I think to see the police department as partners and to get them visible in the community so our neighbors know that they are a resource and they are there to help.\"\nJohn Grothe of the state's fire marshal office had a full kevlar and ballistic shield bomb squad suit and special helmet on display. He is a bomb tech and said the suit weighs 100 pounds.\n\"In the event that there is a device or suspicious package, we try to stay as remote as possible. We try to utilize our bomb robot, but every once in a while, we have to put on the suit and go downrange in person. Night Out is a great opportunity to meet people and have them come up and touch the equipment. We get to explain what we do. It puts a face to the agency,\" Grothe said.\nThere were over 100 community members wandering around, getting food, visiting with friends and getting information from the community service booths.\nJessica Carter, who was sharing an shaved ice with her daughter, said the National Night Out event gives her family an opportunity to see what resources are available to them.\n\"We come every year. The resources. Giving back to the community. Some people may not know what resources are available to them. So it is good. I like the health department and Chesapeake Voyagers,\" Carter said.\nGarvey said she has been working on this event for over a month. She had two massive sheet cakes from Cordova Bakery in her air conditioned vehicle.\n\"It falls into place. I have been planning these for 18 years. It is a free fun family event. The pool is open. Come out and enjoy. There is free food. It is a good community event,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But that determination \"won't finalize\" until the state investigation is complete, he said.\nThe state's preliminary investigation into the incident revealed that just after 7 p.m. on July 22, deputies from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, in marked police cruisers, encountered a car in the area of westbound Route 50 and Dutchmans Lane, where they attempted to initiate a traffic stop.\nAccording to the preliminary investigation, the front seat passenger, identified as 18-year old Yemaya Wilson, and the driver were transported to a local hospital for treatment of serious injuries. Wilson was later pronounced dead at the hospital.\nThe driver of the car, an unidentified juvenile male, did not stop and continued to drive on Route 50. The deputies pursued the vehicle for several minutes, with officers from the Easton Police Department assisting, before it crashed into a tree in the 8300 block of Black Dog Alley.\nThe two rear passengers, an unidentified juvenile male and adult woman, were transported to an area hospital for treatment of serious injuries.\nGamble said after the crash, police learned the vehicle had been stolen from Montgomery County.\nThe involved officers were equipped with body-worn cameras.\nThe attorney general's office identified the officers involved in the pursuit: Talbot County deputies Brittanie DiMichele, William Barnett and Owen Joseph, and Easton Police Department officer Nicholas Lange.\nThe Independent Investigations Division is continuing its investigation with assistance from the Maryland State Police Crash Team.\nBoth the Talbot County Sheriff's Office and Easton Police Department have standards for vehicle pursuits in their department policies, many of which are identical.\nWritten in both policies are factors to consider when initiating a police pursuit. These include the seriousness of the alleged crime, public safety, officers' familiarity with the area, weather or traffic patterns, if the suspect has been identified and if other people are in the vehicle that's being pursued.\nBoth departments' policies state that a pursuit should be halted when \"present risks of continuing the pursuit reasonably appear to outweigh the risks resulting from the suspect's escape.\"\nAn administrative review by the Talbot County Sheriff's Office is underway, Gamble said. That review will not be completed until the state's investigation is complete. The three county deputies are still working, Gamble added.\nIn a statement to The Star Democrat, Attorney General Anthony Brown vouched for the creation state standards of police pursuits, which currently do not exist.\n\"I would like (to) see statewide standards for police-involved vehicle pursuits, but the rules should consider different population densities and take geography into account,\" Brown said in the statement. \"The goal should be to make our communities safer for all, reduce fatalities and help law enforcement do their jobs effectively.\"\nWhen asked about the potential of statewide standards, Gamble said \"one size does not fit all,\" emphasizing that pursuits in populated areas like Baltimore City are different to pursuits in rural areas like Talbot County.\nGamble expressed concerns of such legislative efforts to create what he calls \"one size fits all\" statewide police policies. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

CCSO deputies rushed to that address after someone called 911 from that location and then hung up the phone, police added.\nInvestigators learned that two tenants — William Winford Abbott, 59, and Mark Alvin Vincent, 58, both of whom reside at 241 Smith Road — had gotten into a property dispute, police reported.\nAbbott allegedly struck Vincent's back and side with a fishing pole, according to Lt. Michael Zack, a CCSO spokesman. Then Vincent allegedly hit Abbott in his right leg with a fishing gaff hook, puncturing Abbott's leg, Zack reported.\nAn ambulance crew drove Abbott to Christiana Hospital in Delaware, where he was treated for his non-life-threatening puncture wound to his leg, police said.\nArrested at the scene, Vincent is charged with first-degree assault, second-degree assault and reckless endangerment, court records show. First-degree assault is a felony that is punishable by up to 25 years in prison if convicted while second-degree assault and reckless endangerment are misdemeanors that carry maximum sentences of 10 years and five years respectively.\nVincent remained in the Cecil County Detention Center in lieu of $5,000 bond on Thursday, one day after a bail review hearing in which his no-bond status was reduced to that sum, according to court records, which indicate that Cecil County District Court Administrative Judge Bonnie G. Schneider presided over that proceeding.\nAbbott, meanwhile, is charged with second-degree assault and reckless endangerment for his alleged role in the incident, court records show. Abbott was not arrested but, rather, was served a criminal summons, court records indicate. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

With a 4.5-foot tide, the Causeway area will be impassable for a period of time.\"\nDebby was downgraded to a tropical depression late Thursday afternoon, and was a post-tropical cyclone on Friday, the National Hurricane Center said.

He was subsequently charged and convicted of second-degree escape.\n\"While the defendant was on supervised probation in several other counties for disturbingly similar crimes, he fled to our county and initiated a one-man crime spree. His deliberate actions victimized multiple community members, each suffering from the impact of his criminal conduct,\" Sterling (R) said in the release. \"This sentence serves as a critical step toward safeguarding the public and ensuring that this Defendant can no longer target the citizens in our community.\"\nDuring his arrest in 2022, Sater had been shot by Sgt. Timothy Wesner, a 10-year veteran of the agency, who fired his weapon, striking the suspect twice.\nSt. Mary's deputies responded to a Wawa gas station in California in regard to a vehicle theft on Dec. 19, 2022, according to a sheriff's office press release at the time.\nDeputies located the stolen vehicle minutes later at a hotel in the 23400 block of Three Notch Road and the suspect fled on foot toward the Wildewood shopping center. Deputies pursued the Sater, who allegedly was armed with a knife, and attempted less lethal means by using a Taser on him multiple times. They also used a sheriff's office canine, the press release states.\nSater attempted to carjack an occupied vehicle at a restaurant, but the victim fled. Sater continued to flee through the shopping center and entered a separate vehicle which was running, but he was then shot by the deputy who fired three rounds, according to the release.\nSater was transported by helicopter to an area trauma center, the release states. No injuries to deputies were reported.\nJudge Michael Stamm presided over the case. Senior Assistant State's Attorney Alena Mosier prosecuted the case.\nDetective Warren Forinash, Detective Daniel Sidorowicz and Detective Taylore Nauman of the St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office were the lead investigators. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It states the investigation found no \"sufficient evidence of criminal activity warranting further investigation or prosecution.\"\nEckrich, along with the entire Ridgely Police Department, was suspended in March by the Commissioners of Ridgely and has not been reinstated.\n\"Chief Eckrich is gratified that an independent investigation conducted by the Office of the State Prosecutor culminated in repudiation of the allegations of misconduct and his full exoneration,\" read a statement from Bruce Marcus, an attorney representing Eckrich. \"He is grateful to that Office for their work in clearing his good name.\"\nThe investigation began in February following claims that Eckrich \"knowingly withheld a disclosure (referred to as the Brady list) related to a former out-of-state police officer from an application to the MD Police and Correctional Training Commission,\" the investigation report states.\nThe report notes that on March 11, the town held a closed session meeting, during which these allegations were presented. Specific allegations claimed that Eckrich falsified documents, such as payroll documents and firearms and field training requirements.\nAllegations against the chief also included that he \"sold a vehicle owned by the town under value and without permission, was under the influence of medications while on duty, and had poor management,\" according to the state's report.\nOn March 12, the Caroline County Sheriff's Office obtained a search warrant for the police department in relation to the \"alleged misconduct.\"\nThat same day, the report adds, was when commissioners suspended the entire police department and its officers. That decision came \"without guidance\" from the state prosecutor, according to the report.\nInvestigators conducted interviews with both town and police department employees, along with obtaining documents and revenue reports related to the police department.\nThe town has not made clear whether the police department will be reinstated. Ridgely is currently operating under an agreement with the Caroline County Sheriff's Office for law enforcement coverage.\nAt a closed-session meeting in April, town commissioners laid off the dismissed officers and support staff. This took effect July 1 with the beginning of the new fiscal year.\nIn May, the town agreed to a new memorandum of understanding with the Caroline County Sheriff's Office, providing a \"long-term partnership\" for fiscal year 2025. It included \"a provision for maintaining 480 hours of coverage per month,\" per a town release.\nPUBLIC OUTCRYA heated public comment section at an Aug. 5 town meeting brought Ridgely under scrutiny for not making an announcement about the state's completed investigation.\nTown commissioners said during the meeting they were not notified of the report, though David Crist, director of public works, said he was. Crist said he \"was told this is a personnel matter,\" adding that he couldn't provide further details based on guidance from legal counsel.\nAt that meeting, some residents asked for the police department to be reinstated. In the following days, a petition to reinstate the officers gained traction. It had nearly 100 signatures as of Tuesday.\n\"I absolutely think that they should be brought back, rightfully so,\" resident Holly Justice, who began the online petition, said in an interview. \"They were not guilty of what they were accused of. So everything taken from them should be given back to them and more.\"\nJustice added that she understands the town's position. \"I think they were very hasty in the way that they moved about removing our police officers,\" she said, \" ... so I think moving forward, people are just a little more cautious with the decisions that they are making.\"\nIn a Town of Ridgely statement released on Aug. 8, the town said it is aware of the Office of the State Prosecutor's report.\n\"The Commissioners wish to remind the public that there are limitations on the information that it can publicly share regarding confidential personnel matters,\" the statement reads. \"Additionally, the investigation was initiated and conducted by the OSP, not the Town, and the OSP provides very little information regarding its investigations. Thus, there is limited information that the Town can publicly disclose.\"\nThe town said \"a more detailed statement\" will be provided at the town's next meeting on Sept. 9. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It was all smiles.\"\nBetween 800 and 900 people showed up to the Dorchester County Pool on Aug. 6 for National Night Out on, compared to around 600 people last year, Cambridge Police Captain Antoine Patton said.\nPatton said all of the feedback he received about the evening was positive. He said multiple children came up to him to thank him and tell him they had a great time.\nTodd said all of the positive feedback is why the police department continues to hold the event at the pool year after year.\n\"I think there's just something about being at the county pool and the kids being able to have the opportunity to swim for a couple hours, not worry about any prices or charges and just enjoy time with their friends and family,\" he said.\nAttendees were able to talk with a variety of vendors, from the Dorchester County Health Department to the Department of Juvenile Services to the Boys and Girls Club. The different vendors offered pamphlets and information about the resources they have available to residents.\nSimilar to the number of attendees, Patton said there were more vendors at this year's event than in years past. Todd said that number has increased every year.\n\"And it's good because you get those necessary resources and information that people may not otherwise see or get,\" Todd said. \"It actually gets handed to them. And they can talk to one another and start forming those bonds.\"\nAlong with swimming in the pool, listening to the music played by DJ Doc Lane and eating hotdogs courtesy of the police department, a handful of lucky attendees won prizes that had been donated by Paul Davis Restoration. Prizes ranged from a TV, to a Minnie Mouse kitchen set, to a gas grill, to baskets filled with household goods.\n\"The lady who won a TV actually cried,\" Patton said.\nNot only did attendees get served the 700 hotdogs the police station cooked up, but MidShore Meals til Monday — a nonprofit that provides food for food-insecure children and families in Dorchester County — handed out bags of food, Patton said.\nTodd said National Night Out represents what Cambridge police have been trying to do for the last two years: community-oriented policing.\n\"It's building relationships between the police and the community,\" he said. \"But also (building) other relationships such as (with) Juvenile Services, the health department, the Dorchester County school system. ... Us all working together to build a stronger community for tomorrow.\"\nAccording to National Night Out's website, the event was first held in 1984. It aims to promote partnerships between the police and community nationwide, as well as make neighborhoods safer. Patton said the event was created with the intention of having a night without crime in every community.\n\"And what it does is it brings community together and it gives them a live interaction with law enforcement officers to let the community know that we're working together and we support them just like they support us,\" he said about the event.\nPatton thanked Dorchester County Recreation and Parks for allowing Cambridge police to hold the event at the county pool.\n\"It was a great event and we look forward to doing it again,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

His incarceration will be followed by five years of probation.\nIn May, Chase, 35, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder for Smith's death.\nAccording to the news release, Easton Police officers responded to Sidetracked Saloon around 2 a.m. on Sept. 30, 2023. Upon arrival, officers located Smith, with a gunshot wound to the head, surrounded by a crowd of people in the parking lot. Smith was later pronounced dead at the hospital, the news release says.\nSmith was born and raised in St. Michaels and was a 2018 graduate of St. Michaels Middle High School, the news release says.\nAccording to previous Star Democrat reporting, in charging documents, police said the bar's security camera footage the night of the shooting showed Chase and Chadnee Harris, 33, of Cambridge, standing between two cars near the entrance of the bar and Smith approaching the two.\nAccording to the documents, Chase pulled a handgun from his waistband area and pointed it at Smith. Chase put the handgun back toward his waistband area and then appeared to hand the gun to Harris, police said.\nAfter a fight broke out, Harris reportedly walked toward the men. A crowd that had gathered quickly dispersed. According to the charging documents, Smith appeared to duck behind a car and Chase walked toward Smith, pointing a handgun at him. The officer who reviewed the footage wrote in charging documents that they saw a muzzle flash from the gun and Smith collapse in between two cars.\nAt Chase's plea hearing on May 20, Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said Chase then left the scene and drove to Cambridge, where he disposed of the handgun in the Choptank River.\nChase and Harris were later found during a traffic stop on Race Street in Cambridge. They were both detained by police.\nOn May 22, Harris was handed a three-year sentence, with all but 236 days suspended, after pleading guilty to altering physical evidence in the incident. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the document, in the video Perry is seen picking up the crying toddler and walking him over to a changing table. When Perry puts the boy on the changing table, he cries even louder, the document says.\nIn the video, Perry can be heard telling the boy, \"You better not kick me, young man,\" and \"Stop,\" as she changes his diaper. According to the document, Perry then lifts both of the toddler's legs and audibly smacks him on the butt, causing other teachers in the room to take notice.\nAt this point, the toddler is \"crying and screaming,\" the document says.\nPerry then takes the boy's left arm, lifting him up off the table. She grabs his other arm and \"quickly\" puts him on the floor, letting him fall onto his back, the document says. She leaves him on the ground crying and tells another teacher in the room that is what the boy does, according to the document.\nIn an interview, the parents of the child told Hanson the child might have autism, and they were meeting with doctors to make that determination, the document says.\nTwo teachers in the room at the time of the incident provided witness statements. One of those witnesses described Perry as \"overly aggressive\" with the two year old, the document says. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "New training center will provide cross-training, easier commute for first responders\n\n August 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 731\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — First responders are excited about the benefits a new Emergency Services Training Campus will bring to Talbot County.Construction of a 7,200-square-foot campus at 9095 Mistletoe Drive in Easton is nearing, according to Easton Volunteer Fire Department Chief Sonny Jones. Once completed, the training campus will be run by the Easton Volunteer Fire Department.\nThe department will coordinate training with the University of Maryland Fire and Rescue Institue, which provides training statewide for firefighters and EMS technicians, including advanced cardiac life support, medical training and emergency vehicle operation training.\nJones and Brian LeCates, director of the Talbot County Department of Emergency Services, are looking forward to cross-training with public safety partners, including town and county police.\n\"They're great to work with, but it would be awesome to train with them before the emergency happens,\" Jones said. \"I've always said, the first time I meet one of my public safety partners, I don't want it to be at the scene of an emergency. I want to interact with them beforehand so we have a smooth, unified response to an emergency.\"\n\"This will ultimately improve the way we are able to respond to our day-to-day emergencies and our large-scale emergencies because we'll be able to train with our partners,\" LeCates said.\nA drive to Centreville, the location of the closest training facility of this type, is difficult for Talbot County firefighters who may live an hour or more away to schedule, Jones said. With a shorter commute, he expects them to take more training.\n\"Having this facility here, the University of Maryland and their adjunct instructors can host classes right at this facility,\" Jones said. \"So that someone in Tilghman, instead of having to drive 60 miles, may only have to drive 20 or 25 miles.\"\nAt an Aug. 5 Easton Town Council meeting, Jones said the construction contract has been awarded to Willow Construction. The goal is to break ground this September or October on the classroom portion of the building. The fire chief hopes to see the entire project completed before the end of 2025.\n\"We have, what we feel is an attainable goal that probably … fall to winter of next year … you may see the majority if not all of this campus done,\" Jones said.\nWard 2 Easton Town Council Member and fire department volunteer Don Abbatiello emphasized that the project is \"not being built with town money,\" but instead through fundraising. He commended the \"hard work\" from those involved in fundraising efforts.\nThe Friends of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, a nonprofit fundraising arm of the department, has around $2 million left to raise. President Brett Whitehead said all donations through the end of September are being matched by the A. James and Alice B. Clark Foundation.\nA key feature of the facility will be a burn building, which Jones said will be made out of \"steel with special materials inside that are heat- and flame-resistant\" and allow for repeated burning that will help firefighters train in real-life scenarios.\nJones said he used to train in \"acquired structures\" that were a \"one-time deal\" for firefighter training, such as farm houses that were meant to be burned down. The burn building is designed for repeated training.\nLeCates also said the larger training center will help his department experience \"more real-world scenarios.\" \"Now we can bring in wrecked cars … and put simulated patients in them or some of our rescue mannequins in there,\" he said.\nLeCates added that prospective employees may take notice of the facility, a trend that the fire department hopes to see as well. While Jones said his priority is to \"make it easier\" on current volunteer firefighters, he acknowledges the high costs and packed work schedules that make it difficult for younger, prospective volunteers to commit to training at facilities in Centreville or Princess Anne.\n\"Now it's harder to get the younger generation,\" Jones said of the department's recruiting efforts. \"We don't have as many that want to volunteer, and the ones we do are awesome, they're absolutely awesome. They come in, they take all the required training, and they're participating just as well as anybody else.\"\n\" … We just don't have as much of an infill of younger people as we used to have.\"\nA previous version of this story incorrectly stated which entity is responsible for managing the training campus. The Easton Volunteer Fire Department will be responsible for the management and operation of the facility. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Violence is everywhere, so are those fighting it\n\n August 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RIVERA SUN | Section: Columns \n \n 688\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I'm tired of the violence. Aren't you?Some days, it seems relentless. A mass shooting at a school. Another youth killed by gun violence. A family on the street after fleeing an abusive partner. A genocide halfway around the world. Brutal wars displacing millions.\nWhen will the violence stop?\nThe answer is: When we take action to stop it, together.\nIt's not impossible. Communities across the country and around the world are showing us how. Violence may be everywhere, but so are the people trying to stop it. And many of them have powerful antidotes to the violence we face.\nDuring the Campaign Nonviolence Action Days, Sept 21-Oct 2, tens of thousands of people will show everyone that another world is possible.\nWhat does a nonviolent world look like? It's not all roses. Conflict happens — but we have better ways to respond without resorting to violence. Many of these strategies will be on display during the upcoming Action Days: Neighborhood safety patrols to prevent gun violence. Unarmed peace teams de-escalating tension in hot conflict zones worldwide. Anti-bullying programs aimed at preventing the next school shooter. Centers that help mothers and families get back on their feet after leaving abusive situations. Protests pushing banks to divest from weapons.\nMore than 4,438 actions and events are planned across the United States and around the world to \"build a culture of peace and active nonviolence, free from war, poverty, racism, and environmental destruction.\"\nAn 11-year-old movement, Campaign Nonviolence aims to end violence in its many forms. This includes direct or physical violence (fights, bullying, war, gun violence) and it also includes systemic violence (houselessness, hunger, mass incarceration and the climate crisis). Going even further, the effort seeks to transform cultural violence as well, the beliefs, attitudes and values that lead to harm and destruction, such as militarism, racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia.\nInstead, Campaign Nonviolence rallies hundreds of groups and organizations who use nonviolent action and promote nonviolent solutions. Sandy Hook Promise trains thousands of schoolchildren in how to counter social isolation — a factor in mass shootings — with Start With Hello Week. The Nobel Prize-winning International Campaign Against Nuclear Weapons coordinates hundreds of actions to move money out of nukes. The Global Silent Minute synchronizes thousands of people for a moment of prayerful silence for peace on the International Day of Peace, Sept 21. Nonviolent Peaceforce and Cure Violence use de-escalation techniques in conflict zones worldwide to prevent attacks.\nLocal community groups take powerful action in their neighborhoods. Nonviolent Opelika, Alabama, (part of the nationwide Nonviolent Cities Project) offers trainings and talks on their neighborhood patrols to prevent gun violence. Groups in Honolulu reaffirm their Zone of Peace and Nonviolence in a low-income public housing complex. An elementary school in Little Rock, Arkansas, holds a peace march with all the children. In Detroit, Meta Peace Team trains an entire high school in de-escalation skills.\nThere are street theater protests at military bases and teach-ins on nonviolent history, such as M.K. Gandhi or Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers. There are peace art contests and concerts in public parks. There are marches for ceasefires in Gaza and Ukraine. There are actions to stop environmental destruction and the climate crisis.\nCampaign Nonviolence is gearing up for its largest-ever Action Days stretching between the International Day of Peace Sept 21 to the International Day of Nonviolence on Oct 2. In 2023, more than 5,000 actions were held. With weeks to go, there are already 4,438 actions planned for 2024, and hundreds more expected to be added. The campaign calls for a range of nonviolent actions to be used during the 12 days, including labor strike solidarity, divestment from fossil fuels and weapons, racial healing circles, nonviolence teach-ins, peace demonstrations, and violence de-escalation trainings.\nWhen the violence of our world weighs on your heart, connect to the people working to change it. They bring practical solutions and real-life experience. They persist in showing that something else is possible. They invite you to be part of the solution.\nRivera Sun has written numerous books. She is the editor of Nonviolence News, program coordinator for Campaign Nonviolence, and a nationwide trainer in strategy for nonviolent campaigns. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Because freedom, when exercised without restraint, is no longer freedom but license, ultimately replacing order with chaos.Incorporating abortion into the Maryland Constitution through the Reproductive Freedom Amendment will make it impossible for lawmakers to attempt to put limits on abortion, allowing for the continuation of the gruesome practice of late-term abortion in our state. It will also allow the government to bypass parental rights to make medical decisions for minor children where birth control, pregnancy and abortion are concerned.\nThe new amendment may also prevent parents from making medical decisions for their children in the case of transgender surgery and puberty blockers. Such a matter transcends political parties for it threatens the freedoms of all of our families.\nAccording to the Maryland Right to Life website:\n\"The Maryland General Assembly has passed a bill that seeks to amend the Maryland Constitution and create a state fundamental right to 'reproductive freedom.' The state will ask voters to approve the amendment language on the fall 2024 general election ballot. While the term 'reproductive freedom' is yet undefined, there is no question that the amendment would be used to create a fundamental right to late-term abortion for any reason and to suppress pro-life speech and action across Maryland. … It is important to note that while the term \"reproductive freedom\" is not defined in Maryland law, the bill sponsors say it would include new rights broader than abortion rights. Some of these new rights may include commercial uses of human embryos and the use of puberty blocking drugs and surgical mutilation of reproductive anatomy — even among children without their parents' consent.\"\nPlease vote against the new amendment.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After hearing the blast and receiving a 911 call, paramedics from the Church Hill Volunteer Fire Company responded to the home of Amanda Unkart at Laysan Teal Court where a boy was critically injured as a result of the blast.Paramedics arrived to find the boy suffering with injuries to his left hand and eyes. Anthony Sturgill, a close family friend, had tied a piece of a sheet around the boy's arm as a tourniquet while they waited for help to arrive.\nSturgill reported that paramedics were on scene less than 7 minutes after the 911 call. After the initial assessment of the boy's condition, the team worked to prepare him for transport via Maryland State Police helicopter to Johns Hopkins trauma center.\nThe boy was stabilized by the paramedics onboard the flight and continued to be treated after arriving at the hospital, where he was rushed into surgery.\nHe is currently in stable condition with non-life threatening injuries, Sturgill said.\nThe Maryland State Fire Marshal's Office worked with the Queen Anne's County Sheriff's Office and the Maryland State Patrol to preserve the scene and determine the cause of the explosion.\nWhat officials know at this point is that two boys were experimenting with black powder, marbles and a section of electrical conduit, trying to construct a device capable of shooting the marbles at a target set up in the backyard.\nAs the one boy who was injured held the device, the second boy lit the powder with a lighter. The resulting blast was heard miles away.\nBoth of the youths involved in the incident have grown up around firearms in the rural neighborhood and are well acquainted with firearms safety measures, Sturgill said. Family members are still trying to understand what led them to attempt such a dangerous stunt. While there are firearms kept in the home which are typically under lock and key, there were no firearms involved in this incident. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

At some point during the event, he got into an argument with another attendee, and that attendee threatened to shoot him.\nA few minutes later, a second person approached the teen and fired a handgun at him. The teen suffered multiple gunshot wounds to his legs and was treated and released at a hospital, police said.\nThe man who argued with the teen was described as a Middle-Eastern man wearing a white hooded sweatshirt. The shooter was described as a light-skinned Black male with dreadlocks wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and a mask covering his face.\nBoth suspects drove away in a silver sedan.\nDetectives are asking anyone who has information regarding this incident to contact Det. M. Conway at 302-365-8411. Information can also be provided by contacting Delaware Crime Stoppers at 1-800-847-3333 or delaware.crimestoppers.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Rider pleads guilty to first-degree arson, reckless endangerment for house fire\n\n August 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Crime \n \n 762\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Fred \"Trey\" Rider III pleaded guilty to first-degree arson and five counts of reckless endangerment at a hearing on Monday for starting a fire at his home in Easton in November 2022.Rider had also been charged with second-degree arson, first-degree malicious burning, two counts of arson threat, two counts of malicious destruction of property, obstruction of emergency assistance and two additional counts of reckless endangerment. As part of a plea deal, the state will not prosecute Rider for those remaining nine charges.\nRider's plea comes five months after he was supposed to stand trial, but failed to appear in court that morning.\nAt the hearing, Judge Thomas G. Ross said Rider could receive up to 30 years in prison and $50,000 in fines for first-degree arson. He could receive up to 25 years in prison and $25,000 in fines for the five counts of reckless endangerment.\nRider told Ross the state had put pressure on him to plead guilty, but he was making the decision freely. Rider said he was pleading guilty to the six charges because he is guilty and he believes it is in his best interest.\nOn Nov. 24, 2022, just after 8 p.m., 45 firefighters responded to a fire in Rider's two-story, single-family home at 27930 Peach Orchard Road in Easton.\nAt the hearing on Monday, Talbot County Deputy State's Attorney Joyce Jones said that on that night, Rider had been angry with his wife for taking their sons to see relatives for Thanksgiving, and he began threatening her.\nAccording to court documents, Rider reportedly blamed his wife for all of his troubles and stated he was going to burn the house down.\nThat night, according to charging documents, the two driveways to Rider's home were blocked with vehicles: Rider's truck and a golf cart. Jones said Rider did this before intentionally setting fire to his family's home. Several people on the scene were able to push the golf cart out of the way so fire engines could begin suppression efforts, according to the charging documents.\nIt took the responding firefighters over 30 minutes to control the fire with a tanker task force.\nA person connected to Rider told officials Rider had clearly indicated to him that he was attempting suicide and wanted to be left alone, according to charging documents. Rider also reportedly told the person that he lit the house on fire.\nJones said Rider hid within sight of the house after setting fire to it and watched it burn down. She said Rider let firefighters search for him in the house rather than tell them he wasn't inside it. She said some firefighter gear had to be decommissioned because it had been burned so badly.\nThat night, Rider was located a short distance away from his home and transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton for emergency care. Rider's attorney Christine DuFour said Rider was under the influence of alcohol during the incident and had slit his wrists.\nThrough investigation, officials identified the fire as an act of human intervention with an open flame, classifying the cause of the fire as incendiary. According to court documents, Rider's reckless conduct in igniting the house on fire \"clearly\" put the firefighters who responded in danger.\nThe day after the fire, Rider's wife filed a petition for a protective order against him, citing verbal threats of abuse, mental abuse and property destruction from Rider in the months leading up to the fire.\nA sentencing hearing for Rider is set for Oct. 4, following Rider's ongoing divorce proceedings.\nAt a June status hearing for the case, DuFour said it would be helpful to know the outcome of the divorce before Rider is handed a sentence because the divorce will have an affect on the sentencing.\nRider was supposed to stand trial March 4, but at a status hearing that morning, Ross said Rider had been voluntarily admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital and issued a bench warrant for Rider's failure to appear in court that morning. After getting discharged, Rider was granted a request to be transferred to an alcohol and drug rehab facility for 60 days, with the condition that he return to the Talbot County Detention Center upon completing the program.\nOn May 14, the detention center was ordered to release Rider on a previously posted $20,000 unsecured bond. Rider was released on conditions including that he surrender his passport, he reside in a sober living home in Pasadena, he attend Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings and he enroll in mental health services.\nRider will remain at the sober living facility until his sentencing, DuFour said on Monday. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said those charges include \"quite a few\" traffic-related charges, but did not want to share the criminal charges against Biggs because they are pending.\nHinson said that after Biggs drove into the hotel, he fled the scene in his vehicle, leaving a significant portion of the vehicle's front bumper on the scene. Hinson said the bumper was helpful in identifying the suspect.\nThere were no reported injuries from the incident, but there was \"somewhat extensive damage\" to the hotel, Hinson said.\n\"The building was occupied, but luckily no one was injured,\" he said.\nHinson did not know if the room that the vehicle crashed into had been occupied or not.\nCambridge Rescue Fire Company also responded to the incident. Rescue Fire Company Chief Adam Pritchett said the fire company investigated the damage and shared that information with Cambridge code enforcement.\nHinson said it was a good thing that no one was injured.\n\"Even though there was significant damage to the building, there were no injuries,\" he said. \"We were very lucky with that.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard said the state made this decision because it felt there was insufficient evidence to prove that Robinson is guilty of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\nAccording to previous Star Democrat reporting, police said officers met with a victim at the Cambridge Police Department on Aug. 16 in reference to a shooting. The victim told police that as they came to the intersection, there was another vehicle there. As the victim passed by, the subject in the other vehicle fired multiple shots at the victim, who was not struck, police said.\nRobinson was identified as the shooter by the victim, police said. When officers responded to Maces Lane and Bayly Road, where the shooting was alleged to have occurred, they located multiple rounds of spent .45 caliber ammunition as well as a live round of ammunition, police said.\nRobinson was arrested two days later at the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Cambridge.\nRobinson's attorney Brad MacFee said Robinson was \"extremely relieved\" and \"beyond excited\" when he learned the state would not be prosecuting the case. MacFee said Robinson had been dealing with this \"nightmare\" situation for about a year and had been concerned about potentially having to be away from his children.\nMacFee said Leonard made the right decision. He said there would be credibility issues associated with the alleged victim and that, at the end of the day, there was not enough evidence to convict Robinson. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Disposal of biohazardous waste, including human bodily fluids and waste and drug paraphernalia is also covered in the contract.\n\"The site must be restored to a condition without obvious evidence of previous human habitation,\" the contract states.\nA spokesperson for Charles County government said that due to the area in question being along two state roads, the encampment is largely a state situation.\nThe issue itself may not be new, according to Corae Young, the chief operating officer of Lifestyles of Maryland, which assists people who are homeless in Charles County.\nShe told Southern Maryland News that there was another camp in the area roughly a year ago that Lifestyles had helped the State Highway Administration in delivering notices to clear out.\n\"I believe what occurred is people moved close by,\" Young said.\nA site visit was conducted the morning of Aug. 21, where a reporter with Southern Maryland News was in attendance.\nWhile there was an ample amount of debris and trash strewn about the wooded site, there were also multiple lived-in tents in the encampment.\nOne individual who is homeless emerged from his tent to see contractors walking around.\nBikes, shopping carts, bags, mattresses, cardboard, propane tanks and bottles littered the area. To get the area to the \"condition without obvious evidence of previous human habitation\" specified in the contract will likely be an uphill battle.\nIn light of there still being inhabitants in the camp, Southern Maryland News reached out to the State Highway Administration at the conclusion of the site tour.\n\"SHA works in partnership with local agencies, including support and outreach services and law enforcement, to assist those residing on state rights-of-way. Connecting them with agencies that can provide relocation assistance, housing or other support services has proven to be a successful approach,\" Daniel Allman of the agency's communications office said in an email.\nState workers inform those residing on state rights-of-way that they are on state property before cleaning an area, he said, adding that there is a 30- to 60-day timeframe for them to relocate. Despite the contract seeking bids, Allman said, \"At this time, there is no work scheduled for this location.\"\nBids on the contract are due Aug. 28. The contract sets no exact start date for the work, and relocation efforts were uncertain as of this week. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A community of motorcycle enthusiasts advocate for each other\n\n August 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 678\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On Thursday evening, a man with a long beard lead a group of motorcycle enthusiasts in a meeting of the American Bikers Against Totalitarian Enactments. Ken Eaton, executive director for ABATE, has devoted his life to the open road, freedom of choice, and his bike.This group is part of a national organization dedicated to \"Freedom of the Road and Responsible Motorcycle Legislation,\" according to the ABATE website.\nEaton said he has been riding a motorcycle for decades.\n\"For me, it's kind of a release and a sense of freedom,\" Eaton said. \"There's a lot of things that may or may not go on during the day in people's jobs or lives. Sometimes you get on a motorcycle and you can just leave that behind and enjoy the sounds and the sights on the road and relax.\"\nThe organization is pushing for changes to already existing Maryland law around fatal accidents, advocating that drivers who cause a death should face mandatory court appearances rather than just paying a fine.\n\"Happened to our director in 2006 right here in Easton,\" Eaton said. \"He got hit by a driver that ran a stop sign and killed him, and they didn't have to appear in court. Paid a fine for running a stop sign and never had to show up. That very same person that died in that accident was the person who got me involved in ABATE.\"\nAccording to Eaton, ABATE members are all pushed to be politically active at the local, state and national level for these very reasons.\nEaton said ABATE has a long history of legislation, such as opposing excessive noise bills that target motorcycles.\n\"One of the bills that has come up in the last several years, and we've been able to defeat is an excessive noise bill,\" Eaton said. \"It seems like it probably has a good intention ... (But) there are a lot of motorcycles out there that are pretty loud.\"\nHilton Thomas, a member of ABATE, said he has been a member for three years and has been riding a motorcycle for over 50 years. For Hilton, the work that ABATE does for the safety of riders is what he admires the most about the organization.\n\"They do a lot of things for motorcyclists,\" Thomas said. \"We have a lot of issues that we try to solve. When people cut grass, they throw grass on the road. We try to get that against the law. It's hazardous to motorcycles.\"\nFor other members, it is ABATE's focus on community that drew them in.\nTammy Lenske said it is the community building that she loves about the organization. Lenske began riding less than five years ago. Her boyfriend is an avid rider, and she said she would ride with him on his bike, but now she has her own bike and rides beside him.\nLenske said she loves the community work that ABATE does, including toy drives during Christmas, fundraisers and a memorial ride, which she is the lead planner for. The memorial ride gathers motorcyclists to honor passed members by stopping at several cemeteries and putting flowers and flags down on their graves.\n\"We help each other out,\" Lenske said. \"If there's someone in our group with a problem. We're all there. We have this one guy in our group who had a massive stroke, and he used to ride all the time, and he had a big American flag, and his bike's all decked out in American flags, and he can't ride right now, but we're behind him, and we go visit him.\"\nFor Eaton, ABATE had made riding a motorcycle less of a hobby and a more central part of his life. It is important to him that the safety of motorcyclists is not forgotten.\n\"We want people to look for motorcycles but the other side of that is I also want motorcyclists to be aware of their surroundings and be ready before they jump on the bike and hit the road,\" Eaton said. \"... Cars need to watch out for us, but we also need to be prepared and to watch out for them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The combined loss of both buildings was estimated at $600,000. The contents within were valued at $250,000.\nIt took 75 firefighters three hours to control the fire, according to a release from the office of the State Fire Marshal. The Tanker Task Force was called in for additional water.\nAccording to the fire marshal's report, \"The fire originated inside the butcher shop shortly after the owner had been doing work inside. Embers from this fire landed on the cedar shingles of the vacant nearby 100+ year old home eventually spreading to the remainder of the house. Both structures are considered a total loss.\"\nThere were no smoke alarms present. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Generational trauma': Man sentenced to life in prison for 1979 murder\n\n August 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Matt Wynn mwynn@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 756\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Andre Taylor was sentenced last week to life in prison for a murder he committed 45 years ago.Taylor, 63, was convicted of the first-degree murder of Vickie Lynn Belk by a Charles County jury on July 18. Circuit Court Judge H. James West handed down the sentence on Aug. 23.\nOn Aug. 28, 1979, Belk's then-boyfriend reported her missing to the Prince George's County Police Department after last seeing her on Aug. 27 at their shared place of work in Washington, D.C.\nBelk had not returned to her apartment in Suitland, a release from the Charles County State Attorney's Office said.\nOn Aug. 29, 1979, a local teenager called 911 after noticing a body on the ground in a wooded location in the area of Metropolitan Church Road and Route 227 in Bryans Road.\nOfficers with the Charles County Sheriff's Office responded to the location and discovered the body of a woman with a gunshot wound to the right side of her head and undressed from the waist down, the release said.\nBelk was identified the following day as the woman. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore ruled her cause of death to be from the gunshot wound, the release said.\nInvestigators recovered, processed and maintained evidence during the initial investigation. However, the case went cold.\nIn the following years, several detectives worked on the case. In more recent years, Detective Sgt. John Elliott of the Charles County Sheriff's Office's Criminal Investigations Division continued the investigation and worked with various agencies to pursue leads.\nAs forensic technology advanced, the evidence of the murder continued to be re-examined. In 2022, the Charles sheriff's office's Forensic Science Section re-evaluated the evidence and submitted Belk's clothing for testing with newer technology. A profile was developed and entered into the Combined DNA Index System, a national DNA database.\nOn Nov. 1, 2022, Noelle Gehrman, the deputy director of the county sheriff's office's Forensic Science Section, was notified of a DNA match between the profiles developed from the evidence and Taylor, the release said.\nWhile investigating Taylor's background, detectives learned that he was arrested for violent crimes that occurred in Washington, D.C. It was also discovered that Taylor lived at a residence in Bryans Road around the time of the murder.\nThe address was less than four miles from where Belk's body was discovered. Taylor also had connections to the area of Washington, D.C., where it is believed that Belk was abducted.\nDetectives began trying to locate Taylor, but he had no known address since 2019. In collaboration with the U.S. Homeland Security Investigations, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department and the U.S. Secret Service Baltimore Field Office, detectives of the Charles sheriff's office were able to locate Taylor in Washington, D.C., where he resided.\nOn June 22, 2023, Taylor was arrested by the Charles County Sheriff's Office, the U.S. Marshals Service, Capital Area Regional Fugitive Task Force and members of the Metropolitan Police Department.\nIn an interview with detectives, Taylor admitted to actions that amounted to the rape of Belk, but he denied having any part in her murder, the release said.\nAt the time of the murder, Belk was 28 years old, and Taylor was 18 years old. There is no evidence that indicates that Belk and Taylor knew each other before the incident, according to the release.\nDuring sentencing, Assistant State's Attorney John Stackhouse told the judge that the incident caused \"generational trauma because it went on for 45 years. [Belk's] son grew up without a mother. Her parents had to bury their daughter. Her parents had to lay on their deathbed not knowing who killed their daughter. Her grandchildren never got a chance to meet their grandmother. Yet all throughout this case, I've never seen a family with so much grit, determination and grace.\"\nStackhouse added, \"When you victimize someone like this and then murder them, it really doesn't get more horrific than that.\"\nEchoing the word of Belk's son, he asked the judge to \"use the power you have to get justice, and justice in this case is life [in prison].\"\nBefore sentencing Taylor to life in prison, West said that Belk \"had a presence or spirit that has endured in ways that I've honestly never seen before,\" furthering that the \"victim leaves a tremendous legacy, and the family carries on a tremendous legacy.\"\nThe judge also stated that \"the crime is a horrific loss of a life — the violence was extreme. The amount of fear and terror that preceded the violence doesn't exist in most cases. [The incident was] so heinous, I can't think of a lesser sentence that would be appropriate.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In an interview with The Star Democrat Monday, Sheriff Donald Baker said the investigation into the shooting is ongoing.\nBaker said county police were aware of a gathering that night and increased their presence in the area, along with other safety measures. He said police responded \"within seconds\" to the incident.\nResident Lakia Pierce-Harris brought concerns to the Caroline County Commissioners that future gatherings at the complex could bring forth a similar incident.\n\"I'm scared somebody's going to get killed this time that's going to be an innocent bystander,\" Pierce-Harris said at an Aug. 20 meeting.\nCommission Vice President Larry Porter said his understanding was \"the majority of the people in attendance at that (Aug. 10) function did not live in Daysprings (and) did not live in Ridgely,\" to which Pierce-Harris concurred.\n\"All I'm asking is, I feel our community, our police force and our leadership have another opportunity if this happens again in two weeks, to be proactive instead of reactive,\" Pierce-Harris said, citing rumors of future gatherings at the complex as Labor Day nears.\nWhile Baker said the Aug. 10 shooting was an \"isolated incident,\" he noted his department has been performing checks on the area to be safe.\nEmma Freeman lives in the Daysprings Townhomes and is worried for her safety. She was at her residence during the shooting earlier this month.\n\"I had just come in from work, and I was walking on my porch,\" Freeman said in an interview. \"(I) put my hand on my doorknob, and I heard this, 'Bang, bang, bang.'\"\n\"My family is afraid to come here,\" she continued. \"I have a very large family. They're afraid to come here to visit me. They're afraid to come and have dinner.\"\nFreeman, who is blind in one eye and a senior citizen, said the number one failure at the complex has been management. She wants to see cameras installed as well as light improvements.\n\"We have one pole light sitting right in front of my apartment,\" Freeman said. \"And that's the only light that we have. When I come up at night or anybody comes up at night, the neighbors, they're afraid.\"\nAttempts by The Star Democrat to reach the property manager or the company, East Coast Property Management, were unsuccessful. Caroline County Commission President Travis Breeding said in an interview that the county has been in contact with the company to improve security.\n\"We have expedited that and put a little pressure on the property management company to get those cameras upgraded,\" Breeding said.\nBaker says the residents in and around the Daysprings Townhomes are a priority to police, and he encourages anyone who sees criminal activity to contact 911 if it's an emergency or the Caroline County Sheriff's Office otherwise.\n\"I have a lot of faith in the sheriff's department that they're addressing the safety concerns,\" Breeding said. \"Ultimately, it's not ownership or the county's role to provide the law enforcement aspects, and I think the sheriff's department is addressing that as best they can.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to court documents, the State filed charges this week against Gwendolyn Persina, age 48 of Chester.Those charges include causing life threatening injuries while operating a vehicle, driving under the influence of alcohol, driving while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance and driving on a suspended license.\nThe multi-vehicle incident on the westbound span of the bridge had travel shut down for several hours.\nThrough the course of investigation, the Maryland Department of Transportation Authority Police Collision Reconstruction Unit determined Persina was driving at high speeds and erratically, contributing to the crash.\nQueen Anne's County State's Attorney Lance Richardson said he requested the court to hold Persina in the detention center during the Aug. 29 bail review because she was on probation for a DWI at the time of the accident.\nIn 2022, Persina had been found guilty in Queen Anne's County Circuit Court of driving while impaired by alcohol. Her 18 month probation was still in effect at the time of the January incident.\nRichardson said he made the request because he believed Persina is \"a threat to public safety with her potential to drive in a dangerous manner again if she were to be released on pre trial supervision.\"\n\"The chain reaction collision also ultimately caused an innocent man to lose his arm in the accident,\" Richardson said.\nAn arrest warrant was issued for Persina on Aug. 27. During a bail hearing on Aug. 29, Persina was ordered to be held pending trial. A jury trial has been set for February. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Cambridge man found not guilty in murder trial\n\n August 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Crime \n \n 734\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — A Cambridge man was acquitted of charges relating to the November 2021 fatal shooting of 16-year-old Ja'Len Woolford.Key'Marion Ennals, 19, was found not guilty on 12 charges — including first-degree murder, reckless endangerment charges and assault charges. Ennals' attorney Larry Greenberg said Ennals is relieved that justice was served.\nOn Nov. 18, 2021, Cambridge Police Department officers responded to the 900 block of Camelia Street shortly before 8:15 p.m. for a shooting involving multiple victims. Woolford was declared dead on the scene. Two others were shot, including a 14-year-old who was wounded under his right arm.\nDuring the trial, witnesses testified to the scene being chaotic, with hundreds of people outside when paramedics and police arrived. One paramedic testified to observing fighting on the hood of the ambulance.\nDuring closing arguments in Ennals' trial, prosecutor Jonathon Church, who is from the Prince George's County State's Attorney's Office, played the 911 call that 14-year-old Nasir Pope made after getting shot. In the audio recording, Pope says that he saw the two assailants, who were wearing all black, going down the street.\nChurch also played footage from the city's camera system with a spotlight on two people alleged to be Ennals and Daeveon Johnson, 19, who entered an Alford plea for first-degree murder in the death of Woolford in November 2022. Johnson was 17 at the time of the plea hearing. His sentencing hearing is set for Sept. 6.\nIn the footage, the firing of gunshots is heard and the suspects are seen running down Camelia Street, where Woolford was found dead.\nAlthough Johnson — who testified during Ennals' trial — entered into a plea for Woolford's death, Church said it didn't matter whose aim was better. He said a person can be guilty of murder by being an accomplice.\nChurch said that the two got out of a car with firearms and ski masks, and Johnson asked Ennals, \"Are you ready?\"\n\"He was ready,\" Church said. \"Guns out and blazing.\"\nGreenberg, Ennals' attorney, reminded the jury during closing arguments that testimony revealed Maryland State Police's investigation into the shooting is still open, meaning that someone else could be charged with the murder of Woolford.\n\"It causes shivers down my spine,\" he said about finding that out earlier that day.\nGreenberg also questioned the use of the city's video footage and Johnson's testimony as main evidence of Ennals' involvement in the shooting.\nHe said the video footage was \"grainy\" and he did not see the two people spotlighted in the video wearing all black. He cautioned the jury of considering Johnson's testimony because Johnson took a plea deal.\nGreenberg said a case should rely on scientific evidence, not blurry videos, and he said there was zero credible evidence given in the trial.\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat, Greenberg and Brice Baker, both attorneys for Ennals, talked about concerns with how the case was handled leading up to and during the trial.\nIn September, the Dorchester County State's Attorney's Office was disqualified from prosecuting the case after Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard told Greenberg she met with Johnson to prepare for the trial and learned that two other people were involved in the shooting, according to Greenberg and documented in court papers.\nAccording to previous Star Democrat reporting, in a Sept. 27 hearing, Greenberg asserted that the information shared in the interview was exculpatory. Not disclosing exculpatory information to defense attorneys is a violation of the Brady rule, which requires prosecutors to turn over information that could exonerate a defendant.\nEnnals' trial has been postponed five times in the past two years. In that time, Ennals' defense attorneys filed multiple motions to dismiss the case.\nGreenberg said the defense learned things they hadn't known during the trial, including that the case is still open with MSP.\n\"It is such an abuse of the legal system,\" he said. \"And that's why there are innocent people in jail.\"\nBaker said she was thankful the jury made the decision that it did.\n\"This really could have been another Adnan Syed situation where there's evidence that we don't have (and) evidence that was (given) late,\" she said.\nAfter the verdict was read, Church told the Star Democrat, \"I just have to respect the jury's decision.\"\nGreenberg said that Ennals — who he said has been shot at multiple times since being charged — has become \"afraid\" of the country's legal process.\n\"This was his first ever experience,\" Baker said. \"He's had no priors, and his first experience is this.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Delaware freshman killed by speeding motorcyclist on her first day of classes\n\n August 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 731\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Sitting on a curb handcuffed, smelling of alcohol with his face bloodied and his right eye swollen, motorcyclist Brian Briddle claimed to have no memory of the high-speed crash that killed a University of Delaware freshman and injured four other pedestrians.But as he rode in an ambulance to Christiana Hospital, Briddle appeared to have one moment of clarity. \"I screwed up,\" he told the police officer riding in the ambulance with him, according to court documents.\nThe court records released Friday provide the most complete picture yet of the crash that killed 18-year-old Noelia Gomez, of Clark, N.J. just hours after she attended her first day of college classes. Briddle was arrested Thursday – on his 27th birthday – and remains behind bars, charged with second-degree murder and a bevy of related offenses.\nThe incident began shortly before midnight Tuesday, Aug. 29, when a UD police officer saw Briddle riding a 2008 Yamaha motorcycle on Main Street near the intersection of South Chapel Street. He was riding in a \"normal manner\" but did not have a license plate on the motorcycle, court documents indicate.\nThe officer activated his emergency lights in an attempt to pull over the motorcycle. Briddle changed lanes, revved his engine and began speeding away as he passed the Haines Street intersection. The officer did not pursue the motorcycle for safety reasons and turned off his lights in the area of Haines Street.\nBriddle continued down Main Street, driving at excessive speeds, making unsafe lane changes and blowing through red lights at Academy Street, South College Avenue and North College Avenue, according to court records, which indicate Briddle's reckless driving was captured on the officer's dash camera and by several surveillance cameras along Main Street.\n\"Main Street was full of vehicular traffic and pedestrians at the time of the incident,\" Master Cpl. Wayne Aston wrote in court documents. \"Earlier that day was the first day of classes for the fall semester at the University of Delaware. There were vehicles parked along the roadway, vehicles traveling the roadway and vehicles stopped at red lights. There were many pedestrians walking along the adjacent sidewalks and crossing the roadway. The businesses along the roadway were still open as this occurred just before midnight, and the bars were beginning to let out.\"\nGomez was crossing Main Street in a crosswalk in front of Trabant University Center when Briddle's motorcycle hit her. Passersby attempted live-saving measures, but Gomez went into cardiac arrest and died at the scene.\nBriddle fell off the motorcycle, which then hit a pole and four other pedestrians on a nearby sidewalk. One of the pedestrians was hospitalized for injuries, as was Briddle.\nBoth the officer that rode in the ambulance with Briddle and nurses at the hospital detected a faint smell of alcohol coming from Briddle, but officers were unable to perform field sobriety tests due to his injuries, court records indicate.\nAt the hospital, Briddle continued to insist he didn't remember the crash or the officer trying to pull him over.\n\"Briddle did state that he would have run from police because his motorcycle was not registered and he did not like the way that police officers treat motorcyclists,\" Aston wrote.\nA records check showed that Briddle has a valid driver's license but does not have the required motorcycle endorsement. The motorcycle is not registered in Delaware. It was last registered by a previous owner in Virginia and was reported as having been sold.\nTwo days after the crash, Briddle was taken into custody at his home in the Aspen Run apartment complex near Bear. He was charged with second-degree murder, possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony, disregarding a police officer's signal, driving a special vehicle without a special license, operation of an unregistered motor vehicle and three counts of failure to stop at a red light.\nTraffic crashes rarely result in murder charges. However, Delaware law specifies that a person is guilty of second-degree murder if he causes the death of another person while engaged in a felony or while fleeing after committing a felony. Fleeing from the police is a Class G felony, thus triggering the murder charge against Briddle.\n\"Briddle drove, used and possessed a motor vehicle, a dangerous instrument used as a deadly weapon, during the commission of this felony,\" Aston wrote.\nBriddle was jailed after failing to post $362,005 cash bail. If convicted, he would face 15 years to life in prison. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Following a bail review, Miles was held at the Kent County Detention Center without bond.

Zahedi-Mullis, was issued a court summons. A preliminary inquiry regarding the charges is scheduled for Oct. 7 in district court.\nAccording to court papers filed by Calvert County Animal Control Officer H. Neel, four members of the division along with the county's director of animal services, a state's attorney's office investigator, a local sheriff's office deputy and staff members from the Linda L. Kelley Animal Shelter went to Zahedi-Mullis' residence on Breezy Point Road to investigate a report of possible animal cruelty and neglect.\nNeel stated in court documents that staff from Calvert Well Pet Clinic in Huntingtown also assisted.\nNeel documented what investigators saw when they examined the residence. Several different breeds of dogs of various ages were found, some confined to crates, many isolated in piles of excrement and pools of urine.\nThe investigation team seized 76 dogs, three cats and one guinea pig from the residence.\nThe rescue of dozens of dogs on May 8 prompted the five-day closure to the animal shelter off Route 231 in Prince Frederick. During the closure period, veterinarian care and health assessments were provided to the rescued dogs.\nThe added burden of having a larger than usual dog population this summer has resulted in rumors that were spread on social media and addressed by staff on Aug. 23.\n\"We want to address misinformation circulating online that more than 10 dogs will be euthanized today for shelter space at the Linda L. Kelley Animal Shelter,\" staff wrote on the facility's Facebook page that day. \"This information is false. In May 2024, the shelter had to unexpectedly close its doors in response to a rescue operation involving more than 70 dogs. Many of the dogs saved from that rescue operation have been adopted to loving homes, sent to other rescues or are being fostered.\"\nThe statement continued, \"We are unable to comment at this time on this ongoing cruelty case; we appreciate your understanding and patience as we work through this situation. If you're interested in visiting the shelter to support our efforts and make a positive impact, please consider volunteering. Reach out to the shelter at 410-535-7387 for more information on how you can get involved.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Body-worn camera footage from fatal officer-involved car crash released\n\n September 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Crime \n \n 677\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BALTIMORE — On Wednesday, the Independent Investigations Division of the Maryland Office of the Attorney General released the body-worn camera footage from the fatal officer-involved vehicle pursuit that occurred on July 22 in Easton.The preliminary investigation revealed deputies from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, in marked police cruisers, encountered a car in the area of westbound Route 50 and Dutchmans Lane, where they attempted to initiate a traffic stop. The car did not stop, and a pursuit ensued.\nBody-worn camera footage was released from four officers: Talbot County Deputies Brittanie DiMichele, William Barnett and Owen Joseph, and Easton Police Department Officer Nicholas Lange.\nDiMichele led the pursuit as Joseph drove a second county police vehicle with Barnett in the passenger's seat. The driver of the car being pursued did not stop and continued to drive on Route 50. Officers pursued the vehicle for several minutes, sometimes reaching speeds over 100 MPH.\n\"We looked at our policy and we looked at the body-worn camera footage,\" Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said in an interview. \"We listened to the dispatch record of our deputies as well as the communication behind the deputies, and our deputies followed proper procedure and policies.\"\nIn the video, officers can be seen taking a left turn onto Black Dog Alley just before stopping and exiting to approach the crashed vehicle at the 8300 block at 7:14 p.m.\n\"Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands,\" DiMichele shouted. The armed deputies asked for the people in the car to put their hands out the window.\nDiMichele approached the rear passenger door on the left side, slightly opening it as repeated asks for \"help\" can be heard from inside the car. The rear passenger pressed his hands on the window, as Barnett repeatedly asked the driver, a juvenile male, to stick his hands out the window.\n\"If you keep reaching, you're going to get shot if you pull something out, you understand me?\" Barnett said.\nGamble said it is \"totally appropriate\" for the officers to draw their weapons while approaching the vehicle.\n\"For their safety, they drew their weapons, ordered the people out,\" Gamble said. \"Once they realized the injuries and there was entrapment, then they holstered their weapons and tried to assist.\"\nBarnett asked the driver if he had any weapons, then began to attempt to help the driver exit the car at 7:16 p.m.\n\"We're here to help you now, okay, I need you to climb out this window,\" Barnett said.\nThe two rear passengers, a juvenile male and an adult woman, exited the car with assistance from the officers.\nOfficers were unable to extract the adult woman from the front passenger seat. \"She's just agonal,\" an officer said of her breathing. One officer noted she \"definitely wasn't wearing a seatbelt.\" EMS arrived on the scene at 7:22 p.m., the video shows.\nThe driver and the front seat passenger were transported to a local hospital for treatment of serious injuries. The front seat passenger was later pronounced dead at the hospital, the attorney general's office said.\nThe decedent was previously identified as 18-year-old Yemaya Wilson.\nThe two rear passengers were transported to an area hospital for treatment of serious injuries.\nIn an August interview, Gamble said after the crash, police learned the vehicle had been stolen from Montgomery County.\n\"We suspect the criminal charges will be brought at some point in the case, against, at the very least, the driver of the stolen vehicle, if not more,\" Gamble said on Wednesday. \"But that's going to be in the hands of the (Maryland) State Police and the Talbot County State's Attorney's Office.\"\nThe Independent Investigations Division will generally release body-worn camera and dashboard camera footage within 20 business days of an incident. The release of body-worn camera footage in this incident was delayed to allow additional time to conduct witness interviews, the Attorney General's Office said in a press release.\nThe Independent Investigations Division continues to investigate the circumstances of the fatal pursuit.\nThis report has been updated from an earlier version to include comment from the Talbot County Sheriff and more details about the event.{iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9msnyhxgddI?si=ryU7ae89GJOWvceC\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"}{/iframe} \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The new system, which is from software company Samsara, will save the county a little over $2,000.\nDorchester County EMS Division Chief Debbie Wheedleton said the cameras only show the front of the ambulance, including the driver and passenger as well as out the front window. The video footage is live streamed, she said.\nThe Samsara system not only notifies via email if there is a problem with a camera, but also if a crash is detected or if a driver isn't wearing their seatbelt or is texting and driving.\n\"It takes a picture and sends it to you,\" she said. \"This old system will tell you they don't have a seatbelt on, but it doesn't have a picture. You don't know who's driving.\"\nCouncil President Lenny Pfeffer said the new system sounds beneficial for the safety and security of the providers and the people they are taking care of in the back of the ambulance.\n\"And also help in the unfortunate event of a possible accident or something where we have data as well as visual to show whether or not we were at fault or what happened,\" he said. \"So it sounds like this could be very useful to help minimize our risk involved with our employees.\"\nWheedleton also talked about the new system's maintenance alerts. She said that while the current system gives some maintenance information, the new system will send codes to let the department know what is wrong with a vehicle so that maintenance can be scheduled.\n\"Well that sounds like that could save us a lot of money too,\" Pfeffer said in response.\nThe new system will cost a little over $13,500 and come out of fiscal year 2025 operating budget funds. No further charges will be incurred, according to the request from EMS. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

School officials noted that EHS football games average roughly 1,200 attendees, and other fall sports games can bring in 300 to 400.\n\"We are introducing the CEIA OPENGATE weapons detection system to enhance the security measures and safety for our students, staff, and community alike,\" Elkton High School Principal Dr. James Leitgeb wrote in a letter to EHS parents and guardians. \"This advanced security technology is a walk-through detection system designed to identify and prevent unauthorized or potentially harmful items from being brought onto our campus.\"\nThe new system is consistent with Elkton High School's strict policy banning weapons on school grounds for any reason.\nLeitgeb noted that the system is portable, and the school plans to make use of it beyond the fall sports season.\n\"We are doing this for our fall events, and eventually we do plan on using [the system] for our indoor winter games,\" said Leitgeb.\nThe OPENGATE system is comprised of two upright detectors that will be placed at the entrance to the stadium, which will likely look familiar to those who have gone to a professional sports game or concert recently. CEIA, an Ohio-based metal detector manufacturer, touts that the system scans bags and backpacks automatically, allowing lines to proceed through the gates faster.\n\"This system is highly effective yet minimally intrusive, allowing students, staff, and visitors to enter school premises without significant delays or disruptions,\" Leitgeb said.\nThe implementation of the system is part of a partnership between EHS and Elkton Police Department. According to Leitgeb, EHS staff will man the gates and, in the event of any alerts from the system, EPD officers and the School Resource Officer will be on hand to help handle the situation.\n\"One of my highest priorities as principal is the safety of our students and guests,\" Leitgeb said. \"This is true not only during the school day, but at night time events as well.\"\nLeitgeb also noted that the purchase of the system is part of a grant-funded pilot program and, if successful, other schools in Cecil County will make use of similar systems.\nThe detection system was slated to make its debut at Elkton's home football opener on Sept. 6 at the school's stadium. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Spencer said Greensboro has been paying a $75-per-hour rate for county deputies to cover the town, which will continue \"in the meantime.\"\n\"When they come in here, they're staying here,\" Spencer said. \"They're not patrolling the county, they're only patrolling the town.\"\nA person recently hired by the town did not complete police academy training, Spencer said in response to a resident question.\nSpencer said the town has asked Trams to continue going through officer applications on file in hopes that an applicant who is already certified can be brought on board. Otherwise, certification and training can take up to a full year.\n\"If you put somebody through the academy, it takes about a year,\" Trams said. \"When you hire them after you do the background, for the nine months that they really aren't much good to you, you are paying their salary and their health insurance.\"\nDuring his department update, Trams urged those with non-emergencies to call the county at 410-479-2515 since the Greensboro department is limited. \"If (we're) working, they will certainly send us. If we're not working, then they will send the next agency that is in rotation,\" he said.\nPUBLIC FEEDBACKAfter Spencer read the four options aloud, resident Paula Turner pushed for more details and asked for the town to host a special meeting.\n\"Of those options, where is the breakdown of cost, of savings?\" Turner asked \"If No. 4 is voted in, if that's what the town wants, show us how … (the) money that's budgeted will be allocated back into our town. I want numbers.\"\nKevin Parks spoke in support of the police department remaining. He referenced the struggle to attract police officers due to Maryland's repeal of the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights back in 2021.\n\"I don't want to see the police department closed up,\" Parks said. \"The chief's doing the best he can. If you want to fuss about the police department, call your legislators and your senators for the state of Maryland and tell them to give them their bill of rights back.\"\nSpencer said the town's budget has room for three officers. Public Works Supervisor Brandon Cunningham asked if the town would continue paying for county assistance if it hired a second officer only.\n\"Those decisions have not yet been made,\" Spencer said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Emergency call centers utilizing Convey911 for translation services\n\n September 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 665\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Public safety agencies up and down the Shore are reaping the benefits of a new translation service called Convey911.The service has been added to the arsenal of many emergency call centers, including in Talbot and Dorchester counties. With a network of around 10,000 on-demand human interpreters, the service runs 24/7 and can connect callers in just seconds.\nConvey911 CEO Jeff Bruns said the service allows emergency call specialists to quickly bring an interpreter after detecting the language of the caller.\n\"The technology is listening to that person's voice, is making a determination around what language they speak, and is transcribing and translating their voice in real time, and putting it on the screen so the 911 call taker is able to read and understand what you're saying,\" Bruns said.\nOver 180 languages are supported by Convey911's text translation services, Bruns said.\nThe service has around 110 languages on demand for human interpreters and around 120 using artificial intelligence.\nArtificial intelligence helps at the beginning of a call, Bruns said, detecting the language spoken by the caller. But the service doesn't rely on AI.\n\"The call taker always has control,\" Bruns said. \"They have the ability to hit a button and pull in a real, live human. But what we're doing in the background is understanding how accurately, or lack thereof, we're transcribing. And if we find that the accuracy is not within a certain level of expectation, for example 80% accuracy, then we're going to prompt the call taker on the screen (to bring in an interpreter).\"\nHolley Guschke, the chief of Talbot County's 911 communications division, said the department is fully trained on Convey911's services. It is the department's hope that the service will assist residents in Talbot and surrounding counties.\n\"When you do need to translate, it is important to be able to do that as quickly as possible in order to send police, fire or medical personnel,\" Guschke said.\n\"Working with Convey911 translation services will be invaluable to 911 operations by enabling clear and immediate communication with non-English speakers, reducing response times, and ensuring that all individuals receive the critical help they need during emergencies,\" said Brian LeCates, Talbot County's emergency services director, in an emailed statement.\nIn Dorchester County, Emergency Communications Chief Robbie Larimer says the county's call center receives one to two calls per day from non-English speakers. Partnering with Convey911 has helped the department quicken its translation times since June, he said.\n\"They've been very willing to work with us,\" Larimer said. He added that the company \"embraces the understanding\" of the need for public safety.\nLarimer said Eastern Shore agencies embraced the service at the Maryland Association of Counties' conference last year. Convey911 was at the conference, and representatives from different counties took notice.\n\"We saw what they had to offer,\" Larimer said.\nBruns emphasized the service helps not just public safety agencies, but other departments as well. The Caroline County Health Department has been using the service since June.\nHolly Trice, the health department's director of nursing, lauded the Convey911 service as an \"everyday\" tool to communicate with residents.\n\"Our previous platform did not have an interpreter immediately available, so there were times we would sit on the phone for 15 minutes or so trying to find an appropriate interpreter,\" Trice said. \"We don't have that with Convey911. As soon as we initiate the call, we immediately assign an interpreter, and everyone has been extremely professional.\"\nBruns said feedback has been \"exceptional\" so far. He noted two \"pain points\" that the service addresses: quality of interpretation and the time it takes to get an interpreter on the line.\nWhile Convey911 serves around 50 departments in around 14 states, its Maryland roots as a Baltimore-based company are important to Bruns.\n\"It's very important for us to ensure that we're doing everything we can to canvass Maryland, and really support Gov. (Wes) Moore's platform of leave no one behind,\" Bruns said. \"We had a huge advocate in (Larimer) … in bringing all of the counties together so that we could do this as a group.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In just a week we have had one large sign near Trappe stolen, replaced and stolen again, and last night (Saturday, Aug. 31) had two signs spray-painted on St Michaels Road just outside of St Michaels. These signs cost an average of $100 each plus $15 for lumber and sweat equity to dig post holes and erect the signs.Vandalism of political signs is against the law and is punishable by jail time and hefty fines. Complaints have been filed with the Sheriff's Office. Many signs are now monitored by trail cameras. If we catch the responsible parties, we will prosecute vigorously. TCRCC will pay a $500 reward to anyone whose testimony leads to conviction.\nWhile spending two hours cleaning the paint off of the signs, I was cursed at twice … \"F--k You\" and \"F--k Trump\" by people driving by. (It was offset by some dozen or more friendly honks and thumbs-up, and two people who stopped to ask if they could help.)\nThis behavior is typical of people who have no respect for the Constitution, and specifically the First Amendment or of the election process in which we all express our opinions by peaceful, respectful means.\nSadly, the Democratic Party has encouraged behavior that stifles freedom of expression for several years (witness Obama's \"get in their face\" remarks), and seems to have little regard for the First Amendment (as shown by the pressuring of Facebook and Twitter by the Biden/Harris Administration to censor conservative thought).\nIf we are to have a democracy of, by and for the people, we must respect each other's right to think and say what we will. I hope that Democrats who are put off by this behavior will chastise their brethren for acting this way. It isn't pretty.\nTo be silent is to condone this behavior.\nKENT ROBERTSON\nRoyal Oak \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Project 2025 is a project of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that only a Marxist would describe as \"fascist\" or \"bourgeois.\" Project 2025 has as its goals such things as securing the border, making federal bureaucrats accountable to Congress, cutting government spending and other policies which I have heard both Democrats and Republicans defend.\nMore of a matter of concern is the Reproductive Freedom Amendment or Ballot Question No. 1 for Maryland voters in the upcoming November general election. All you have to do is think for a minute about why we would need such an amendment. What reproductive freedoms do Marylanders lack?\nUnder current Maryland laws, adults are free to reproduce with other consenting adults, except blood relatives. They are even free not to reproduce by engaging in same sex relationships, dignified by the laws of Maryland as marriage. Those who engage in reproductive activity are free, according to the law, to terminate a pregnancy any time before the moment of birth.\nMinors once required the permission of a parent or guardian in most circumstances but under the new laws parents may lose their rights. If parents object to gender reassignment surgery, the state is already empowered to remove the child from the home. If the Question No. 1 passes, then legal action in favor of parents will be almost impossible as will be repealing the unjust laws. It already is happening in other states. So the news is: they are coming for the kids.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Bradford House residents share concerns with community, management\n\n September 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 656\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Bradford House Apartments residents, community members, and service providers gathered at Anchor Point on Monday afternoon to talk about unsafe conditions at the apartment complex on Race Street and what is needed to remedy the situation.The community conversation, which was facilitated by Mid Shore Mediation, was born out of a concern from Dorchester County District Court Judge Melvin Jews. Jews is presiding over multiple rent escrow cases filed against Bradford House residents by Millennia Housing Management, the Cleveland-based company that manages Bradford House.\nResidents have expressed concerns about safety in the building.\nIn September 2023, the property — which offers multifamily, subsidized housing for low-income individuals who are elderly or have special needs — received a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development inspection score of 30c*. The score indicated health and safety deficiencies and other problems identified with building systems, the building's exterior and individual apartments.\nWendy Schneider, alternative dispute resolution programs manager for Eastern Shore district courts, said Jews was concerned residents who don't have a case in court or who are not comfortable appearing in court weren't getting heard.\n\"And there also might have been people outside of those that were actually in the courtroom that might need to hear what's going on,\" Schneider said. \"So that's why we came up with the idea of hosting this meeting. Just to give everyone an open and safe space to have conversation and just say whatever they feel comfortable saying without that pressure of court.\"\nRepresentatives from Millennia, including the chief operating officer, regional manager and Bradford House property manager, listened in on the meeting virtually. At the end of the meeting, one representative said they appreciated the residents taking the time to voice their concerns.\nDuring the conversation, residents talked about a variety of concerns from bed bug infestations, to frequent changes in management, to elevators not working, to a lack of security.\nResidents Anna Walker and Stephanie Robinson talked about the in-unit call-for-aid systems, many of which were found inoperable during the September 2023 HUD inspection.\nWalker said that she learned her call-for-aid chord didn't work in December when no one came to help her on the floor of her bathroom. Walker said she had to crawl down the hallway of the building to get a neighbor to call 911.\nRobinson, who has epilepsy, recalled falling in the bathtub and having to yell for help \"for the longest time.\" She said more than two pull chords are needed in each apartment.\nWalker said her grandchildren can't visit her because of safety and security concerns, and she hasn't been able to get a home health care provider because no one wants to come to the Bradford House.\n\"The worst part is the isolation,\" she said.\nResident Jerome Jones, who is on dialysis, said he has also had a difficult time getting services because people don't want to come to the apartment complex.\nJones talked about being scared to bring furniture into his home because he doesn't want to draw bed bugs, which multiple residents at the meeting talked about experiencing.\nLa-Shon Foster, who is running for mayor of Cambridge, said during the conversation that these problems have existed for more than four years and residents aren't getting the help they need.\n\"The mediation is good,\" she said. \"But if nothing is done to follow it in six months from now, we're right back at this table (and) it does no good.\"\nLocal psychiatrist Gene Bautista, who serves Bradford House residents, suggested that the Health Department open a station in the Bradford House and that everyone who serves the apartment receive sensitivity training.\n\"Just a little bit more sensitivity would go a long, long way,\" he said.\nResident Linda Johnson, who is a member of the apartment's tenant association, said she just wants management to respect residents, talk with residents and know what's happening on the property.\n\"At the end of the day, I'm just glad that we had this mediation, and I'm glad that Millennia finally heard us,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Johnson entered an Alford plea for the charge in November 2022.\nAs part of the plea deal, Johnson will serve 25 years at the Patuxent Youthful Offenders Program. Once 50% of the sentence is served, Johnson will be eligible for parole.\nJohnson's sentence will begin dating back to Jan. 4, 2022, the day he was arrested by Cambridge police. He will also serve five years probation.\nThe sentence orders Johnson to have no contact with Key'Marion Ennals. Ennals, 19, was found not guilty on 12 charges relation to the fatal shooting, including first-degree murder, at a trial this August.\nJohnson's sentencing was delayed as part of his plea agreement, which included Johnson testifying during Ennals' trial last month.\nIn his initial interview with police, Johnson admitted to carrying a .40 caliber firearm. An autopsy revealed that Woolford died from a single gunshot wound from a .40 caliber firearm.\nDorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard provided a statement following the sentencing of Johnson.\n\"The State recommended a sentence of life imprisonment, suspending all but forty years of active incarceration,\" the statement read. \"The Court heard heartfelt victim impact statements from three members of the victim's family, each expressing their choice to forgive Mr. Johnson, and each requesting the Court consider a lesser period of active incarceration for Mr. Johnson given his cooperation and remorse.\n\"The State continues to offer condolences to all family and loved ones impacted by the loss of Ja'Len Woolford, and thanks the Court for its mindful consideration of all circumstances at sentencing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is required to be backed up and restored in order to provide for public health.\nHe pointed out, Everbridge is used widely throughout the state right now making communicating between counties convenient.\n\"We can coordinate better as far as resource needs,\" Pearsall said.\nEverbridge can target specific areas within the county as well.\nIn a simulation, a test, on his cell phone, Pearsall uses the map on the Everbridge application to send out a storm warning to just Kennedyville residents.\nNarrowing it down even further, if needed, he could send notifications to just a specific housing community within Kennedyville.\nThese alerts are available to residents who have phones in a contract with Everbridge. But also residents can receive specific notifications by signing up to receive alerts at https://www.kentcounty.com/oes.\nThose who sign up get alerts for weather conditions, tornados, flash floods, and even water line repairs and other infrastructure information.\nSo far, the new software has gone off without a hitch as they've sent out 10 alerts since the time of the interview in late August.\nAlong with other administrators, Director Pete Landon and Chief of Communications Brad Russum, Pearsall meets regularly over Zoom with the Everbridge team to increase their knowledge of technology which always seems to be adapting.\nThe emergency team is always looking to learn as much as they can to increase the public's awareness and safety.\nLike for example, in a few months time they will be able to provide IPAUS, Integrated Public Alert and Warning System.\n\"When you receive an amber alert on your phone, you can't stop that from coming through. So soon I'll be able to provide this to our residents and visitors,\" Pearsall remarked.\nIn the case of an impending tornado for example, he can interrupt every phone in Kent County warning residents.\nHe's been taking FEMA courses online, and when the time comes, will take an exam for certification along with quarterly tests.\nThe team's also looking to expand public's awareness like the recent Maryland Mesonet Weather Station, set up at the back of the A.F. Whitsitt Center. It's one of 70 weather stations in the state in partnership with the University of Maryland, Maryland Department of Emergency Management, Maryland Environmental Service and Maryland Department of Health.\nThese stations are spaced about 10 miles apart and solar powered, measuring rainfall, snow, even the temperature of the top soil.\n\"It has all manner of capabilities and allows us to be more effective in predicting and forecasting weather events,\" Pearsall added.\nLike the Everbridge program, the station provides opportunities to cooperate with various local, state and federal entities.\nAll these expansions are part of an effort, \"To create a safer Kent County by getting the resources to the community, residents and visitors.\"\nPearsall noted, \"We're doing everything we can to ensure the public is safe as possible.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Sgt. Jason Dyott, 38, was convicted of two separate instances of engaging in physical sexual conduct with two different teenage girls while on duty.Judge C. Carey Deeley Jr. found Easton Police Department Dyott guilty on two counts of misconduct in office. Dyott — who had served as an Easton police officer since approximately June 2008 — was found guilty under three theories of misconduct: malfeasance, misfeasance and nonfeasance.\nThe charges stem from allegations that Dyott used his departmental cell phone to communicate in a sexual manner with several teenagers and students at local high schools and met up with them while on duty. Two teenage girls are mentioned in a charging document from the Office of the State Prosecutor.\nDuring opening statements of the trial, Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Mary Setzer said that in the fall of 2022, Dyott engaged in physical acts with two teenage girls in separate instances. She said that on Nov. 11, Dyott picked up an 18-year-old from her friend's house in his police vehicle and had sex with her in the vehicle while on duty.\nSetzer said that two days later, Dyott met with a 17-year-old in the Target parking lot while he was on duty and made out with her. According to the charging document, Dyott leveraged his position as a police officer to engage in this sexual relationship and sent her multiple photographs of him in his police uniform with sexually provocative language attached.\nDyott's defense attorney Shaun Owens said during opening statements that Dyott is not denying the relationships with the teenagers. Owens said the conduct was not criminal, however, and that he does not believe there is evidence to support that Dyott's actions constituted misconduct.\nOwens said the state would need to prove that Dyott engaged in the acts because he was a police officer or because he had been afforded that privilege as a police officer. Owens said that in any profession, Dyott could have engaged in the exact same behavior.\nDuring the trial, both of the then-teenagers mentioned in the charging document testified. The then-17-year-old said that when the investigation into Dyott began, Dyott told her to deny what happened, and he said they didn't do anything wrong because she was old enough to consent.\nThe then-18-year-old recounted the night she met up with Dyott. She said that while in the police vehicle, the police radio was on, and after she heard a badge number spoken over the radio, Dyott turned the radio down. She said that she and Dyott didn't have any conversations about Dyott's job during their interaction, and Dyott didn't respond to work during that time.\nDuring closing arguments, Owens brought up that the radio call, which the then-18-year-old talked about during testimony. He said that it was not clear what the call was about, if it was for Dyott specifically or if it required Dyott's response.\nDeputy State Prosecutor Sarah David said that in the two incidents, Dyott acted in his official capacity. Not only was he on duty, she said, but he was presenting himself to the public and to the teenage girls as an officer.\nA sentencing hearing is set for Nov. 1.\nAccording to a news release from the Office of the State Prosecutor, State Prosecutor Charlton T. Howard III said, \"Law enforcement officers who abuse the power of their position, and betray the trust of the community, must be held accountable.\"\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat Wednesday, Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey said Dyott is suspended with pay. He has been suspended with pay since the beginning stages of the investigation in 2023.\nIn 2014, Dyott was named the Easton's department's officer of the year.\nAccording to a Wednesday press release, \"upon this conviction, the Easton Police Department will now seek to impose the appropriate administrative penalties upon Mr. Dyott.\"\nLowery said he could not say at this time when those administrative penalties will be imposed.\nThis article may be updated. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They described him as \"a flirt, a charmer, always cracking jokes and tearing up the dance floor.\"Jimenez, a native of the Bronx, a resident of Great Mills and an electrician by trade, was 50 years old when he died on Dec. 4, 2023, while in custody at the Calvert County Detention Center in Barstow.\n\"What led him there is not important,\" Elena Jimenez, one of Angel's sisters, said of the fact her brother was in jail, adding the real question is, \"What led up to his death?\"\nA certificate issued by the state department of health's division of vital records lists Jimenez's cause of death as \"restraint complicated by hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\" The document cites his manner of death as \"homicide.\"\n\"He was just detained at the time,\" Elena Jimenez told Southern Maryland News. \"No medical attention was given to him. He died at the detention center. What occurred during the last hours? We don't have anything. It's already been nine months and we don't have any answers.\"\nAccording to documents on file in the Maryland Judiciary system, Jimenez was the defendant in an ongoing paternity case, which dated back to December 2008. He was served a warrant last Dec. 1, just days before his death.\nOn Aug. 16, after other local media outlets reported on the family's call for answers from authorities, the Calvert County Sheriff's Office, which oversees the detention center, issued a statement about the Jimenez case.\n\"As soon as we became aware of the incident, we immediately contacted the independent investigations division of the [state] attorney general's office,\" the sheriff's office statement reads. \"However, they determined this case would not fall under their purview and declined to investigate it. Determined to ensure an impartial investigation, we reached out to the Maryland State Police, who agreed to handle the case from start to finish.\"\nSouthern Maryland News contacted the state police's Pikesville office headquarters, which advised to \"contact the Calvert County State's Attorney's Office as they are handling all media inquiries for the Jimenez case.\"\n\"Our office is reviewing the entire case,\" Calvert County State's Attorney Robert H. Harvey Jr. (R) told Southern Maryland News. \"We are going to be following up with the state medical examiner's office. We will then prepare a written report.\"\nHarvey said he was hopeful the report would be completed by the end of September. He added that the case may or may not be reviewed by a grand jury.\nThe Jimenez family and members of the Calvert community received some surprising news during the Aug. 28 meeting of the county's police accountability board.\nWhile reviewing the year-to-date complaints the panel has received, chairman Wilson H. Parran said the detention center and the correctional deputies are \"not an area of responsibility\" for the accountability board, adding that those officers \"have their own bill of rights.\"\nJohn Norris, county attorney who provided council to the board at the August meeting, explained that correctional deputies are \"disciplined through their internal structure.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The incident involved three students and one staff member and ended with a student being transported to a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.According to a press release released by the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, the assault happened on Tuesday afternoon. The videos paint a picture of the incident, though no further official statement has been released by law enforcement on the assault.\nIn the videos, a group of students are circling around the three students involved in the assault. Seconds into the video, one student in a black hoodie moves toward a student in a red hoodie and assaults him. The student in red falls to the floor. Immediately following, an additional student in a gray hoodie proceeds to join in the assault.\nIn the video, a male staff member in a white shirt attempts to protect the student that is being assaulted and physically puts his body on top of the student, seemingly to act as a barrier between the students.\nThe other two students seemingly continue to assault the student in red and begin to also assault the staff member. Soon after, other staff members intervene and separate the students and defuse the situation. The incident lasted around 30 seconds.\nDeputies were able to identify two victims of the assault, one was an Easton High School staff member and the second was a student of the school. No identities have been released, and the incident is currently under investigation.\nThe assault resulted in one student being transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton via Talbot County Department of Emergency Services to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries, police said.\nThe two other students in the video were identified and arrested in relation to the assault.\nAccording to a statement from Debbie Gardner, director of communications for Talbot County Public Schools, the event is being evaluated and those involved will face appropriate disciplinary action.\n\"The safety of our students and staff is always our top priority. We are grateful for our partnership with the Talbot County Sheriff's Office and the presence of School Resource Officers in our schools,\" the statement said. \"Deputy Horseman, along with several other Sheriff's deputies and members of the Easton High staff responded quickly to contain the incident. The students involved will face appropriate disciplinary action, and we are continuously evaluating safety measures to prevent or mitigate incidents of this nature.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Although Winder received 10 charges relating to Brown's death, the remaining eight charges — including manslaughter, assault and additional firearm charges — were abandoned by the state.\nShortly after midnight on Sept. 4, 2023, Brown was found dead in front of an apartment complex in the 700 block of Gardens Court in Federalsburg. Officers from the Federalsburg Police Department were called to the scene and found her lying in the grass with apparent gunshot wounds to the head and chest.\nAt a plea hearing on July 8, Caroline County State's Attorney Sloane Franklin said Winder, who had a handgun on him and had been arguing with Brown before she was killed, was seen shooting Brown multiple times. Franklin said the two were in a \"volatile relationship,\" which Brown had ended due to domestic violence.\nDuring the sentencing hearing on Wednesday, Franklin said the system had failed Brown, who had cases against Winder for domestic violence.\nBrown's siblings, mother and eight-year-old son all provided statements at the sentencing hearing. Brown's son Dominic's statement read, \"My mommy was a beautiful person, and you took her away from me.\"\nBrown's mother, Nancy Geeslin, recounted the night she got the call that her daughter had been killed. She spoke about how Brown's death has affected each of Brown's children.\nBrown's younger sister, Tyrah Banks, said she didn't know if Winder would every fully grasp what he did to their families.\n\"This will never not hurt,\" she said.\nBanks said she has found peace in the fact that her sister can't be hurt again and peace in the fact that Brown lives on through her children.\nWinder's attorney Dana Boston, who is with the Maryland Office of the Public Defender, said Winder committed a terrible act that shouldn't have happened. Boston said Winder had a rough upbringing and developed a drug addiction. He said Winder was on Percocet and Xanax the night of Brown's death.\nBoston said Winder expressed \"heartfelt remorse\" for his actions and is dealing with the psychological repercussions of those actions.\nBefore handing down Winder's sentence, Wilson said it wasn't the system, but the nature of law that failed Brown. He said when it comes to domestic violence, peace orders are just pieces of paper.\n\"They're not bullet-proof vests,\" he said.\nWilson said Winder's criminal history, including firearm and assault charges, show a pattern of disregard for law, authority and others.\nWilson said he is sorry anybody has to grow up in imperfect conditions. But he said this \"senseless\" act should not have happened.\nAfter the hearing, Jennifer Roberts, Brown's aunt, said in an interview with the Star Democrat that their family is happy to have closure after this has hung over their heads for a year. She said they have no choice but to be satisfied with the outcome, and they have to put their faith in the court system. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said the threat is a photo of a \"clearly\" photoshopped Instagram message that includes the 410 area code.\n\"We're taking it very seriously, as we do every threat,\" Gamble said, adding that, through investigation, the Sheriff's Office doesn't think there is \"any viable threat to the safety\" of TCPS students.\nAccording to a letter from the district addressed to TCPS families, the district is \"closely monitoring the situation\" and working with local authorities. The letter says that school operations will continue as normal.\nGamble said a criminal investigation by the Sheriff's Office is underway. He said all school resource officers in the district are aware of the threat, and extra deputies are patrolling.\nOn Friday, TCPS students were put in a modified lockdown following a threatening social media post made that morning. According to the Sheriff's Office, the threat originated outside of the United States and similar threats were made to schools in Easton, Pennsylvania.\nGamble said the Sheriff's officer is aware of jurisdictions in other states that \"have had 40 or 50 of these types of threats.\"\n\"It's happening all over our country where, for whatever reason, somebody is trying to disrupt school operations and put our kids in fear,\" he said.\nGamble said that a few years back, the district experienced something similar where about half a dozen non-specific threats were made during the course of the school year. He said he would expect to see more of these threats this year.\n\"This just seems like the thing to do these days for some reason,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Fire trucks lined Dunleer Road in the early hours of Wednesday, Sept. 4, but didn't turn on their sirens.Had he not gotten up to feed his newborn, he said, he would have missed the house fire across the street from him at 3220 Dunleer Road. The Baltimore County Fire Department ruled that an electrical malfunction caused the fire.\nAccording to a fire department press release, fire engines arrived at the house at 3:44 a.m.\nOwner Kevin Mars' 8-year-old son Nolan was hiding on the second floor of the house. Firefighters found and rescued him by 4 a.m., radio traffic indicates. Richardson said Nolan's body was \"limp\" as he was carried out of the burning house.\nNolan was taken to a local hospital. He died Sept. 9, according to a fire department press release. Only one pet survived, owner Kevin Mars said. Nine cats died in the blaze, according to the fire department.\nMars and four other children in the house escaped with minor injuries, the fire department said.\nDespite the dramatic scene, few signs of tragedy remained just a few hours later. The only hints were charred grass, boarded up windows, small pieces of glass strewn around the outside of the house and the back of packaging for an oxygen mask. A faint smell of burning lingered if you got close enough. Even closer, burned wood was visible.\nThe birds in the tree next to the house kept chirping.\nBy Sept. 10, the oxygen mask packaging had been removed. In addition to a sign directing people to drop off packages at Richardson's house, a sign warning people that \"any alteration or removal of items in this area\" would be punished because an ongoing fire investigation was taking place.\nRichardson, the neighbor, started a GoFundMe campaign to help the family. As of Tuesday, it had already raised over $23,000 out of the $30,000 goal. His wife set up a clothing drive for the family.\n\"The support has been amazing and unexpected but sometimes uncomfortable,\" Mars wrote in a text to the Eagle, \"being we're usually quiet people.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Everybody has skeletons in their closet.\"\nRaley's contract with St. Mary's County government was terminated on July 23.\n\"Ensuring the safety and well-being of our patients is our top priority,\" Jennifer Utz, emergency services department director, said. \"We are evaluating and updating our internal processes and will continue working closely with the state medical director, jurisdictional medical director and local health officer to address this issue and protect our community.\"\nIn mid-August, she said in an interview with Southern Maryland News that emergency services were using the non-narcotic ketamine for pain management.\n\"Right now we still have the ability to treat pain, we just don't have the option for both right now,\" Utz said. \"We will be restricted on how much [fentanyl] we can order.\"\nA total of 18 patients received fentanyl around that time and emergency services staff is trying to contact each of them, and is reimbursing them for the emergency calls.\nQuestions regarding public health concerns about the case should be directed to the Department of Emergency Services. Representatives from the department contacted any individual whose care may have been impacted by this incident. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In that claim, the companies asked that their liability be limited to $43.67 million for the damage to the ship and its cargo.\nIn the 53-page filing Wednesday, the Justice Department detailed a litany of mechanical and electrical flaws in the Dali that led to collision with the bridge. The suit alleges that Grace Ocean and Synergy were aware of these issues and that Dali's crew mishandled the ship's approach to the bridge after two power outages occurred in the early hours of March 26.\n\"This was an entirely avoidable catastrophe, resulting from a series of eminently foreseeable errors made by the owner and operator of the Dali,\" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton said in a statement.\nOn Tuesday, families of the victims of the bridge collapse announced at a press conference they will be filing their own legal claim to hold the owner of the Dali liable. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Scammers look to lure voters to get information\n\n September 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MORGAN LEASON Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 549\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Scammers posing as election workers are trying to mislead Maryland voters with fraudulent text messages, prompting concerns at the State Board of Elections.The scammers are telling voters they're not registered to vote in November and then urging them to click a false link to remedy that, according to Jared DeMarinis, the board's state administrator of elections.\n\"They're capitalizing on the hypertension involving this election,\" DeMarinis said in an interview with Capital News Service. \"The text message is urgent, and they're playing on a fear that an individual is not registered to vote when they really are.\"\nHe said he worries that texting scams of this nature could have a sweeping impact on the election, especially if they mislead voters about whether they're registered and eligible to vote.\n\"The impact of this is to create a new narrative and foster disinformation about voter roles,\" DeMarinis said.\nSimilar incidents of text scams have been reported in Illinois, Georgia and Pennsylvania already this year. In Peoria County, for example, text scammers also meant to deceive voters into registering to vote by mail through a false link.\nEnsuring the integrity of elections and maintaining public trust are critical issues for Maryland election officials and the nation, especially as the 2024 election nears and texting scams become more prevalent.\nAs the state elections administrator, DeMarinis is tasked with administering and conducting elections and creating consistent policy and application of the laws in Maryland.\nThe Maryland board was already working to recruit election judges, track mail-in ballots and secure the local elections. Now, they must also battle continuous threats to undermine public trust in elections.\nAccording to the board, the text scam informs recipients that public records show they are not registered at their address. The matter is \"URGENT,\" the text says. The text then invites the recipient to click a fake link to register before the deadline.\nThe board's website lists the valid sources for voter registration, polling locations, mail-in ballot status and ways to vote. The board is also reminding voters that trusted information will come from a .gov web address.\nDeMarinis told CNS he is determined to combat the spread of disinformation by being proactive on social media. He also encouraged people to contact him or the state board to verify information.\n\"You don't wait until things hit critical mass,\" he said, \"you combat this information and correct the record immediately.\"\nThe board created a portal on its website where people can report instances of scamming and disinformation. DeMarinis said he plans to work with social media platforms to help correct false information.\nHe said that if scam efforts rise to the level of voter disenfranchisement or suppression, the board will work with law enforcement to ensure that Marylanders are \"free to vote, without any sort of undue influence.\"\nAs the general election approaches with only 48 days left and early voting starting on Sept. 23, the threat of these scammers remains high. The public must remain vigilant and in the meantime, the board will continue its efforts to combat scams and safeguard the integrity of the election, he said.\n\"These scams are a direct threat to the legitimacy of the electoral process, because, at best, they're just trying to steal identities,\" DeMarinis said. \"But at worst, they're there to kind of sow distrust in an election administration and undermine confidence in the system.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Motorists encouraged to watch for deer as breeding season approaches\n\n September 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 505\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — As deer breeding season nears, motorists are encouraged to keep their eyes peeled for white tails on the road.Local auto repair businesses say they are busier fixing collisions this time of year. Hitting a deer can cause thousands of dollars worth of damage, bending front fenders, crumpling hoods and cracking front windshields.\n\"It is about 20% to 30% more this time of year,\" said TJ Jefferson of Grants Automotive in Easton. \"I get more calls early in the morning, 'Can you come get my car? I just struck a deer or a deer just struck me.'\"\nWith increased volume during deer season, he says they just get it done with the available manpower that they have.\nAccording to data from State Farm, \"U.S. drivers had an estimated 1.8 million animal collision insurance claims in the U.S. between July 2022 and June 2023.\"\nAbout 1.5 million deer-car accidents happen every year. More than $1 billion in annual insured losses are due to damages caused by deer-car accidents. According to State Farm, Maryland drivers have a one-in-116-vehicle likelihood risk for animal collisions. The highest risk state for deer-car collisions is West Virginia at one in 37 vehicles.\nDeer breeding season begins in October and runs through mid-December. During these months, bucks become more active, seeking out female deer. The females move around more to avoid the bucks. All this motion means more deer are on the roads.\nDeer are most active between the hours of 5 and 8 a.m. and again from 5 to 8 p.m., which are also hours that many drivers are on the road commuting to or from work.\nTrooper Ian Rola of the Easton Barracks of the Maryland State Police said, \"The incidents that rise this time of year are car accidents. (Deer) are in rut and are running all over and crossing the roadway. It is usually up this time of year — in the November time frame.\"\nRola and fellow law enforcement officers work to help keep roadways clear of hazards during these peak months.\n\"It is between law enforcement and SHA. We try to keep the roads clear. We rely on the public. If you see a carcass, give us a call, and we will come out. If it is a mess, we call SHA (State Highway Administration) to help,\" Rola said.\nRola emphasized the importance of drivers slowing down and wearing seat belts, especially as deer breeding season approaches.\n\"You have got to imagine, you hit a dear, you slam on the brakes and you are going forward at the same time. The seat belt will stop that forward momentum. This saves a lot of injuries from deer accidents,\" he said.\nRepresentatives from the State Highway Administration encouraged drivers to avoid making sudden turns or movements to avoid hitting deer.\n\"Making sudden, sharp turns is dangerous as it could place the driver in the path of oncoming traffic or cause your vehicle to strike a fixed object such as a tree or utility pole,\" wrote Charlie Gischlar of the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration in an email. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The shipment, which was heading to an address in Newark, consisted of 26 handbags bearing luxury brand names, such as Chanel, Goyard, Gucci, Hermes, Loewe and Louis Vuitton.\nOfficers suspected that the handbags may be counterfeit and detained the shipment to verify the authenticity of the handbags' trademarks. CBP's trade experts verified that the handbags were counterfeit and subject to seizure pursuant to the agency's statutory and regulatory authorities.\nHad the handbags been genuine, they would have been worth more than $150,000.\nThe international trade in counterfeit consumer goods is illegal, CBP spokesman Steve Sapp said.\n\"It steals revenues from trademark holders, steals tax revenues from the government, funds transnational criminal organizations, and the unregulated products potentially threaten the health and safety of American consumers,\" Sapp added.\nCounterfeiters often manufacture consumer goods using substandard materials and parts that either break prematurely or that could hurt consumers. Counterfeit consumer goods may also be sourced or manufactured in facilities that employ forced labor.\n\"Unscrupulous vendors that peddle counterfeit consumer goods continue to place their profits over your health and safety. Customs and Border Protection urges you to protect your families by purchasing authentic consumer products from reputable retailers,\" said Erik Kelling, CBP's port director for the Port of Wilmington.\nThe most recent incidents came two weeks after CBP officers in Wilmington seized 277 counterfeit Lululemon Everywhere Belt Bags, valued at nearly $13,000 had they been authentic. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After that, the K-9 units were invited to the Kent County Middle School to receive something special.\nIn a gesture of police support, the Kent Puppy Pals 4-H Dog Club donated a Line of fire Defense Street Fighter vest to Addy, a German Shepherd, handled by Dfc. Craig Lewis of the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office.\nGoing through Kent County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Scott Lockerman's organization, the Maryland Police K9 Foundation, the Puppy Pals donated a check for $300 in June.\nClub Leader of Puppy Pals Kim Montooth explained each year they do a service project. Last year, for instance, they raised money for the Humane Society. This year was exciting for the kids and something different, Montooth said.\nMolly's Place also donated $1,000 in a vest for Waylon, a K-9 black lab handled by Pfc. Nick Lang of the Easton Police Department.\nIn front of about 20 people, the dogs modeled the vests, which are lightweight enough yet specially designed to protect their vital organs.\nThen the Puppy Pals kids and their families gathered around to pet the dogs.\nAfter the children met with the dogs and 4-H mom Karri Bryant had a playful tug of war with Addy, they were invited into the school where they witnessed a live demonstration of how Addy sniffs out controlled substances.\nControlled substances were stashed in two classrooms. Led by Lewis, sniffing desks and drawers, Addy alerted to the controlled substance in both rooms in about 30 seconds.\nTrainer Mark Carr of Tidewater Strategic Services said the dog doesn't go right to the spot because of the nature of scent itself. The K-9 moves around the perimeter of the room, getting the entire scent. Once she gets a complete picture, she can hone in.\nPresident of the club Trenton Montooth was impressed. At 14 years of age, he has decided he wants to be a K-9 officer.\nLockerman thanked the Puppy Pals and Molly's Place, expressing the importance of their giving by showing the positive impact K-9 dogs make.\n\"K-9's make the community safer with their presence. Crime rates go down. Schools are much safer. Even the town's property values go up,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Police said the father is cooperating with investigators.\nCecil County Department of Emergency Services paramedics pronounced Berry dead at the scene of the incident, which occurred at approximately 2 p.m. Tuesday on a residential property in the 200 block of Mt. Zoar Road — where a fire damaged an adjacent home at about the same time, police reported.\nA 78-year-old woman, whom investigators believe to be Berry's mother, suffered injuries during the incident and an ambulance crew transported her to Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air for treatment, according to police. Although they did not specify the woman's injuries, MSP officials qualified that her injuries \"were not from gunfire.\"\nMSP troopers assigned to the agency's North East Barrack rushed to scene shortly before 2 p.m. Tuesday in response to a reported shooting, police reported.\nTroopers found Berry outside the residence and noticed that he had \"apparent gunshot wounds,\" police said. They also located Berry's father at the scene, police added. Berry's father declined medical treatment, according to MSP officials, who did not specify if the 80-year-old man had been injured during the incident or if he had experienced a medical episode.\n\"Investigators believe an argument between Berry and his father led to the shooting. The preliminary investigation indicates that Berry attempted to break into the residence before his father retrieved a firearm and shot Berry,\" an MSP spokesperson outlined, noting that the father is \"currently cooperating with investigators.\"\nFirefighters responded to that Mt. Zoar Road property, too, and extinguished a blaze at an adjacent home, police said. As of Wednesday night, detectives with the Maryland Office of the State Fire Marshal continued their investigation to determine the cause of that fire, police added. Although it appears to be so, MSP and MOSFM officials have not indicated if that house fire is related to the fatal shooting.\nDetectives with MSP's Homicide Unit are leading the fatal shooting investigation, according to the spokesperson.\n\"Investigators are working to determine a motive,\" the spokesperson reported, noting, \"No charges have been filed at this time.

When the officers arrived, they found one man sitting down and two men standing next to him. Police said one of the men standing was holding a hammer and the man sitting was bleeding from his hand.\nThe man with the bleeding hand was taken to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Cambridge, police said. According to the news release, while he was at the hospital, the man told officers he had been stopped from leaving Génesis Food Market and was told to sit down. Police said the man reported that Perez had a hammer in his hand and told an employee to grab a machete.\nAccording to the news release, the man told police that Perez put the machete up to his neck and made statements about wanting him to die before swinging the machete and striking his hand.\nA petition created on change.org on Sept. 27 is calling for justice for Perez. According to the petition — which had 356 signatures as of Monday afternoon — Perez was arrested for defending his business. It calls on law enforcement and courts to review Perez's case, drop the charges and re-examine the law when it comes to small businesses defending themselves.\nPerez's niece Cindy Chun said in an interview with the Star Democrat that the charges should be dropped because there were no cameras, so it is one person's word against another, and the news release doesn't share Perez's side.\nChun said Perez — who also owns three businesses in Easton and one in St. Michaels — is a loving father and husband and a great boss.\n\"He is the most caring and loving person you'll ever meet,\" she said.\nChun said the Wednesday incident was the third time in a week that someone had come in to rob the market. She said that after Perez was arrested, a family member of the person Perez is charged with assaulting came into the store and threatened Perez, his business and his family.\n\"That's why we want justice for this case because trust me, so far no one is listening to us,\" Chun said. \"The whole police department, they are not listening to us. That's why we're taking matters into our own hands and making all these petitions for him because the whole community knows who Alex is.\"\nAfter getting arrested, Perez was turned over to the Dorchester County Department of Corrections on no bond.\nThe petition mentioned in the article was translated from Spanish using Google Translate. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After the man declined, Gibbs allegedly started yelling aggressively as she accused the alleged victim of \"being smart with\" her and then ordered Hand, who was standing nearby, to kill him, police added.\nAt that point, Hand allegedly started beating the man with a \"metal blunt object,\" prompting the alleged victim to hold up a mattress to deflect the blows, according to the charging document.\nThen Gibbs and Hand cut open the man's tent with their knives, court records allege.\nThe man told investigators that Gibbs yelled, \"Stop,\" to Hand and, at that point, the suspects got into white 2019 Dodge Ram and sped away, police reported.\nAfter the suspects had fled, the man realized that his bicycle and $150 were missing, police said, noting that his bike is valued at $150. During the incident, the man's tent and mattress were destroyed, translating to a $500 loss, police added.\nCourt records indicate that the man told investigators that he was \"longtime friends\" with Gibbs, whom he described to police as \"an older white female of medium build with no teeth.\" He, however, did not know her last name — only that it started with a \"G,\" police noted.\nThe alleged victim described Hand as a \"middle aged\" white man of \"skinny build with face tattoos,\" police reported.\n\"Due to the suspect descriptions, officers believed the suspect description provided matched those of Brandy Gibbs and Justin Hand, who(m) officers are familiar with through prior contact,\" according to the charging document.\nWhen an investigator displayed photos of Hand and Gibbs, the alleged victim identified them as the suspects, court records show. Investigators were able to track down Hand and Gibbs and arrest them, police reported.\nHand and Gibbs are each facing numerous criminal charges, including home invasion, first-degree assault, robbery, theft, malicious destruction of property and related conspiracy counts, court records show. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

C. Lynn Knight of the Queen Anne's County Circuit Court to 20 years, execution of the sentence suspended as to all but 18 years to serve for the drug offense and one year, suspended, consecutive, for the traffic offense. Upon his release from incarceration, Todd will be on 36 months of supervised probation.\nThe conviction was based on an April 13 incident in which Maryland State Police and Queen Anne's County Sheriff's deputies were on the look-out for a stolen vehicle, Richardson said. During attempts to make a stop on this vehicle, the driver fled. The vehicle pursuit ended in a foot chase behind a residence on Wye Mills Road in Wye Mills.\nRichardson said when Todd was apprehended, he was in possession of suspected cocaine, which was submitted for analysis at the Maryland State Police Crime Lab. The lab confirmed 11,892.2 grams of cocaine, a schedule II controlled dangerous substance. Further investigation by the Queen Anne's County Drug Task Force revealed Todd possessed this cocaine with the intent to distribute it. Members of the Task Force estimated the street value of this cocaine to be over one million dollars.\nTodd also had a 2019 conviction from Talbot County for Possession with Intent to Distribute. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There have been multiple reports since last Friday.\n\"This is a trend that usually occurs every election cycle,\" Wright said. \"We've had two reported to us. One (sign) at the beginning of September and two (signs) over last weekend.\"\nEaston police have not yet identified any of those involved in the recent vandalism, Wright said.\nTalbot County Republican Central Committee Chair Robert Osborne said signs have been vandalized on Dover Street recently. Some have been spray painted, while others have been stolen.\nSigns stolen or vandalized include not just those for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, but also candidates for the Talbot Board of Education. Osborne said, \"it's very frustrating that people don't want a different view.\"\n\"It's a shame that people have hate in their heart,\" Osborne said. \" … Everybody's in our prayers, we just want the election to be fair.\"\nPatrick Firth, chair of the Talbot County Democratic Central Committee, said there has been sign vandalism against Democratic candidates in Oxford, Trappe and Cordova. Firth said the Talbot County Democratic Party condemns all vandalism.\n\"These acts of vandalism are not just about signs; they are about the erosion of the democratic process and the suppression of free speech,\" Firth said in a statement. \"We must hold ourselves to a higher standard, respecting the political views of all citizens, regardless of party affiliation.\"\nWright encourages residents to not place signs too close to their houses in case someone tries to damage or steal them.\nHe said while \"there's no doubt\" some acts of political sign vandalism go unreported, it's best to report them to police for documentation.\n\"Be vigilant. Report it if it happens to them. If for any reason, it gives us an idea if we need to concentrate on a certain area, or just so we know what's going on,\" Wright said. \"Because people are entering your property to commit a crime, and that should be concerning.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Instead, the program keys on the behavior aspect.\n\"We really want to make sure that we're giving these clear (messages) to children to focus on the behavior and how somebody makes us feel or what they're asking us to do, as opposed to the relationship,\" Quillet said.\nIn the children's portion of the program, children were encouraged to identify five trusted adults. Quillet encouraged parents and guardians to \"be comfortable that (they) might not be the person that (children) come to for everything.\"\nHaving trusted adults in different spaces is important not just for young children but also teenagers, Quillet noted. With the dangers of technology and the internet, she said the 12- to 17-year-old age range is \"more vulnerable than ever.\"\n\"We see a lot of things locally that revolve around technology and often used as a grooming practice,\" she said.\nAt the end of the hourlong presentation, Quillet said parents should stay involved in their children's activities and choose caregivers carefully.\n\"There should never be a time where I'm not allowed to have access to my children or I'm not allowed to watch them,\" she said. \"… Screen all your caregivers carefully.

Those items include, but are not limited to, diapers, baby formula, non-perishable food, feminine care products, hand sanitizer, and toothbrushes and toothpaste.\nDetmer said he is surprised by the vast amount of support the initiative has received from the Eastern Shore.\n\"In the face of such a terrible disaster, it's been really encouraging to see the volume of response, and I'm thankful for it, and I hope to be able to work with all of our neighbors here to send it to people who need help,\" Detmer said.\nLindsay Wheatley, an organizer for the donation drive, said on Monday she and Detmer were casually talking about the devastation in North Carolina and felt the urge to find ways they could help.\nWheatley said they contacted Eddie James, an owner of Koski Trucking in Dorchester County, and the company generously donated a truck and driver to take desperately needed items to the Statesville staging area. According to Wheatley, James, who previously has worked in disaster relief, was eager to do his part.\nWheatley said through social media they were able to quickly gather community resources together.\nAdditionally, Wheatley said her husband and one of the owners of Koski Trucking will be heading down to North Carolina in their private vehicles with chainsaws, materials and tools to try to help out in anyway they can.\n\"At the end of the day, community, family, that's really all that you have,\" Wheatley said. \"And in times of need, you just hope that others show up and help, and that's what we're trying to do.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Those worries intensified after a non-fatal shooting outside of the apartment complex in August.\nBridge Maryland Inc., a nonprofit organization based in Baltimore County, organized a public meeting Saturday to facilitate discussion of housing justice, water equity and safety in the area of the complex. More than 50 people were in attendance.\nTrina Ewell, a resident of the Dayspring Apartments for five years, outlined her concerns, ranging from safety, to management, to mold found in bedrooms and bathrooms.\n\"I feel outraged that nothing has been done,\" Ewell said, \"that all families that live back here in the neighborhood are ignored, and we have been ignored for long.\"\nEwell said property management has been largely unresponsive to tenants. Attempts by The Star Democrat to reach the property manager or the management company, East Coast Property Management, were unsuccessful.\nCaroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker attended the meeting, emphasizing his commitment to work with property management and the local neighborhood association that Bridge Maryland is assisting.\n\"I met with the management group about a year ago and was promised that a lot of these things would be fixed,\" Baker said on Saturday. \"And we're still waiting on it now. But to my knowledge, the county commissioners have been working, and they have gotten the cameras up and running. They are working on the lighting. They are working on the shrubbery and the other things that affect our job in law enforcement.\"\nAs Baker described efforts to improve safety in the area, he was met with applause from the crowd.\n\"It has to be a working relationship,\" Baker said. \"It has to be law enforcement and the management group to make sure that citizens are safe in that community. And I am absolutely, 100% behind helping and making that community a much better and safer place.\"\nCounty police responded to a shooting on Aug. 10 outside of the complex in which one man was injured. Residents such as Ewell have expressed lasting effects from the shooting.\n\"My son's bedroom faces the street,\" Ewell said. \"He could feel the vibration of the gunshots in which brought on (a) panic attack for my son that night. … It has brought ongoing panic attacks for him.\"\nSandra Pitts lives on School Street, near the apartment complex. She has worked with Bridge Maryland in recent months and spoke at Saturday's meeting, noting flooding concerns on School Street.\nPitts says those who live in Dayspring are often afraid to speak up, a role she doesn't mind taking. She said the work of Bridge Maryland has been critical in advancing efforts of the local residents.\n\"I think they're doing a good job and I think things have really grown,\" Pitts said in an interview.\nAs president of Bridge Maryland and pastor of Allen AME Church, the Rev. Angelique Mason spoke during Saturday's meeting. She thanked attendees and explained that Bridge Maryland's water equity team assembled environmental leaders to focus \"on the failing waste system that sits on Daysprings.\"\n\"This is what community looks like,\" Mason said. \"This is what real power looks like.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Davis questioned the prison agency's decision to settle instead of heading to trial.\n\"If somebody has been wronged, we should be paying that person and the employees should be retrained or released, but we can't have strip searches that were done properly cost the state $50,000 each,\" Lierman said.\nThe request stems from a lawsuit alleging misconduct by employees during a strip search, but the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services did not detail the case at the public meeting.\nJoseph Sedtal, the agency's deputy secretary of administration, told the board that the employees involved in the suit followed proper procedures regarding strip searches.\nBut, Sedtal said, it's difficult to go to trial and prove this because, due to privacy concerns, there are no cameras allowed in the strip search room.\nOften, he said a case is the defendant's word against that of the facility.\nEven though the board voted to approve the settlement, Lierman asked that the agency come back with more information.\nShe asked for follow-up on how many such cases are filed, how often the state fully litigates them and how many result in complete dismissals.\nState Treasurer Dereck E. Davis questioned the logic, asking whether juries would be more inclined to believe the defendants over the correctional officers if the officers proceeded with proper protocol.\n\"I would like to think settlements are more of a rarity as opposed to a regularity,\" Davis said. \"It bothers me because this is money, public dollars that I know could be put to good use.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trey Rider sentenced to 15 months at detention center for house fire\n\n October 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 590\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Fred \"Trey\" Rider III has been ordered to turn himself into the Talbot County Detention Center on Monday morning to serve 15 months for reckless endangerment. His charges stem from a fire he started at his home in November 2022.At a sentencing hearing Friday, Judge Thomas G. Ross also handed Rider a 20-year sentence for first-degree arson with all but the time he's already served suspended. Rider was given five years of probation with conditions that include attending Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings and completing an abuser intervention program.\nIn August, Rider pleaded guilty to first-degree arson and five counts of reckless endangerment for a fire started at his home in Easton on Nov. 24, 2022. He faced up to 30 years in prison and $50,000 in fines for first-degree arson and up to 25 years in prison and $25,000 in fines for the five counts of reckless endangerment.\nRider had also been charged with second-degree arson, first-degree malicious burning, two counts of arson threat, two counts of malicious destruction of property, obstruction of emergency assistance and two additional counts of reckless endangerment. As part of a plea deal, the state did not prosecute Rider for those nine additional charges.\nForty-five firefighters responded to the fire in Rider's two-story, single-family home at 27930 Peach Orchard Road in Easton. Through investigation, officials classified the fire as incendiary.\nAccording to court documents, Rider's reckless conduct in igniting the house on fire \"clearly\" put the firefighters who responded in danger.\nAt Rider's plea hearing, Talbot County Deputy State's Attorney Joyce Jones said Rider blocked his two driveways with vehicles before setting fire to the house.\nThat night, Rider was located a short distance from his home and transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton for emergency care. Rider's attorney Christine DuFour said at the plea hearing that Rider was under the influence of alcohol during the incident and had slit his wrists.\nAt the sentencing hearing Friday, Jones asked that Rider's sentencing include incarceration. She said the fire was a planned event, citing threatening texts he sent his wife, Kari Rider, who is currently in the midst of a divorce from Trey Rider.\nAt the sentencing, Kari Rider said the night of the fire has caused her and their two sons lasting emotional and psychological effects. She said she and Trey Rider had been in a \"horribly abusive relationship\" and he had been destroying her things for years.\nA restitution hearing, which Kari Rider asked for Friday, is set to be scheduled after the divorce proceedings.\nDuFour, Trey Rider's attorney, said that over the past seven months, Trey Rider has put in hard work at a recovery center and a sober living home. She said that while he has a ways to go, Rider's goal is to become a sponsor for others struggling with addiction. DuFour said Rider also hopes to participate in reunification therapy with his sons.\nA variety of people gave statements on Rider's character during the sentencing, including friends, family and counselors.\nRider said he was ashamed of his conduct, which has \"caused immense harm and pain\" in the lives of his wife and children. Before apologizing to his family, he said he has \"fallen very far\" and has reached out to get as much support as possible so he can continue down a road of recovery.\nBefore handing down the sentence, Ross called Rider's actions the night of the fire \"calculated,\" \"planned\" and \"self-serving.\" He said Rider has been given opportunities that most people don't get, including getting to begin rehab before being sentenced. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester County unveils restructuring plan for emergency services, corrections\n\n October 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 591\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Dorchester County is moving forward with a plan to restructure parts of its 911 Center, Emergency Medical Services Division and Department of Corrections in an effort to improve recruitment and retention.At a Dorchester County Council meeting Tuesday, County Manager Jerry Jones said there are 35 vacancies in these three departments.\n\"We have had difficulty being competitive with surrounding counties,\" Jones said. \"That attrition has created a number of public safety-related issues (within) the county.\"\nJones said half the positions in the 911 Center are currently vacant, which makes it more difficult to get calls out to first responders efficiently.\nThe restructuring plan will essentially create career ladders within each of the three departments to create opportunity for employees.\n\"You're not going into one position and stuck there forever,\" Jones said about the plan in an interview with the Star Democrat, later adding, \"It's just giving more of a career ladder for our employees, which is more attractive to them.\"\nDuring the meeting, Jones said that in the EMS division, the plan is to create four supervisor positions to oversee EMTs and paramedics. He said the plan also includes having two levels of EMT and paramedic positions. Currently, EMS Chief Debbie Wheedleton is overseeing everything without help, he said.\n\"So we're putting some structural pieces in there that make us more efficient and, at the same time, improve opportunities for retention and recruitment,\" Jones said.\nAlong with restructuring the three departments, the plan addresses a \"substantial pay disparity\" for directors.\nJones said the county looked at pay in surrounding counties and determined equitable salaries for Dorchester County employees. The county believes this will stop employees from taking jobs in other counties.\nJones warned that pay isn't the only concern when it comes to reasons why employees leave the county for other jobs. He said retirement systems in neighboring counties are another factor. Jones said they are looking into this.\n\"But we've got to be competitive in salary as well,\" he said, later adding, \"And these proposals that you have before you make those salaries competitive.\"\nIn an interview, Jones said the plan is not expected to increase county budget expenses. He said filling positions will mean less spending in overtime pay.\nBefore the council took a vote, Council member Ricky Travers commended 911 Center, EMS and Department of Corrections staff for working short-staffed. He said that while overtime puts extra money in an employee's pocket, it also takes them away from home and, for these employees, puts them in stressful situations.\n\"I want each and every employee to know that we understand this, and we're very sorry you've had to deal with this, but we are truly working on this,\" he said.\nTravers also commended Jones for finding the resources to make this plan possible in a county where money has been a concern. He said the county is still looking at retirement options, but it's much costlier.\nCouncil Vice President Mike Detmer said county employees aren't paid what the council wishes they could be paid.\n\"We're working here on this side, and we appreciate the efforts of our staff to help magnify what we're trying to do as a council,\" he said.\nAt the end of the meeting, Department of Corrections Director Don Satterfield said he applauded these efforts and acknowledged there is still more work to be done.\n\"I would be remiss if I did not share with you my deep gratitude for the county manager and for the HR Department,\" he said. \"They have been a dream in getting us from where we were to where we thought we needed to be and beyond.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "‘Ticking time bombs’: Lithium-ion batteries blamed for Hurricane Helene fires, continued danger\n\n October 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG Newspapers | Section: State News \n \n 875\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Hurricane Helene's cataclysmic path brought historic storm surges, record rainfall and destructive flooding from Florida to the Carolinas and Appalachia.But all the storm's wind and rain were accompanied by a surge of fires across multiple states that officials said appear to be caused by overheating and sometimes exploding lithium-ion batteries in electric cars, golf carts, electric bikes and scooters as well as other devices.\nLithium-ion batteries can catch fire if they are exposed to salt or freshwater, said Chad Hawkins, assistant chief deputy with the Oregon State Fire Marshal's Office.\n\"It doesn't matter. It shorts them out,\" Hawkins said of the batteries, noting that it takes \"copious amounts\" of water to put out lithium battery fires.\n\"It takes a lot of water to extinguish them,\" he said.\nFlorida State Fire Marshal Jimmy Patronis on Tuesday said there have been 16 fires during and after Hurricane Helene attributed to lithium-ion batteries used in Tesla and other electric vehicles, golf carts and other vehicles and devices.\nFlorida officials are investigating more structure and vehicle fires to see if more in storm-impacted areas were caused by electric batteries.\nPatronis is worried that more lithium batteries could catch fire or explode after being exposed to floodwaters from the hurricane.\nHe urged owners to remove, properly dispose of or have towed away electric vehicle golf carts and other devices that have been exposed to floodwaters after record storm surges deluged communities and neighborhoods along Florida's west coast.\nPatronis, who serves as Florida's CFO, said the hurricane's flooding can make \"EV's a dangerous fire threat\" and called storm surge-exposed lithium-ion batteries \"ticking time bombs.\"\nHe stressed that electric batteries should not be put in the trash and to move EVs outdoors and roll down their windows and open doors to allow potentially flammable gas to escape.\nOther hurricane fires may have been caused by downed power lines and flooded electrical systems.\nNorth Carolina Fire Marshal Brian Taylor encourages residents and businesses to stay away from downed power lines and to unplug appliances to safeguard against power surges.\nFire and public safety officials in states hit by Helene are also encouraging residents and businesses to have electrical systems inspected before rebooting power after the storm and its outages.\nThe fires added to emergency workloads of fire and other public safety departments already responding to water rescues from historic storm surges and dangerous flooding.\n\"We responded to over 1,100 calls for service from the start of the storm until 4 p.m. yesterday,\" said John Klinefelter, division chief for Clearwater Fire Rescue in Florida on Wednesday. The popular tourist destination saw record storm surge from Helene, which was a Category 4 hurricane when it stormed ashore in Florida.\nKlinefelter said his department responded to 37 structure fires with at least two involved lithium batteries with more incidents being reviewed for their causes.\n\"This information is based on the person who called 911 because we could not send fire inspectors out. One of the structure fires was an electric bicycle store located on the beach,\" he said.\nOther communities in Florida and other states hit by the hurricane also saw fire during and after the storm.\nSt. Petersburg Fire Rescue responded to 47 vehicle fires and 7 structure fires from Sept. 26 to 28 on top of 86 water rescues and 1,744 emergency 911 calls, said spokeswoman Ashlie Handy.\nShe had some tips for avoiding electric fires — including those involving lithium batteries and electrical systems.\n\"When a storm is on its way, we encourage residents to prepare their homes by unplugging appliances from electrical outlets and moving them to a higher location. We recommend moving electric vehicles and other lithium-ion battery-powered devices away from areas that may see storm surge associated with the storm. We see most of our structure fires after the storm has passed. That is because when salt water comes in contact with exposed electrical systems, it becomes a fire hazard. The best thing someone can do to avoid an electrical fire is to turn off the main circuit breaker to their home,\" she said.\nNorth of Tampa, Hernando County Fire Rescue responded to 7 structure fires, 4 of which involved lithium batteries, said Nick Brandt, communications manager for the agency.\n\"Tips for future storms would be to remove lithium batteries from flood prone locations and if batteries are submerged in salt water, move them to a location at least 50 feet away from any structures or vehicles to prevent further damage in the event they fail and cause a fire,\" Brandt said.\nHandy and Hawkins also said lithium batteries should be moved away from potential flooding and unplugged from charging sources.\nThat might be possible with some golf carts and other devices but not with Teslas and other electric vehicles, Hawkins said.\nHe said overcharging lithium batteries in all types of devices — large and small — can cause them to catch fire.\n\"They can overcharge. They can overheat, they can pressurize and can explode,\" Hawkins said.\nHawkins also said consumers should make sure they are buying legitimately tested batteries and charges, warning that some overseas products can be faulty and cause fires.\nHe also said not to charge electric batteries in extreme cold (under 32 degrees Fahrenheit) or extreme heat (above 105 degrees Fahrenheit), not to just let devices always charge over long periods of time and to be at home when recharging vehicles or devices. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Vote 'yes' on Question A — support public safety\n\n October 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: PETE LESHER | Section: Columns \n \n 478\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Four years ago, Talbot County voters overwhelmingly approved a temporary increase in the property tax revenue cap by an \"extra penny.\" Our public safety operations were facing a recruitment and retention crisis because of low pay and inferior benefits compared to surrounding jurisdictions.Talbot County has made enormous progress with the \"extra penny\" on the property tax since 2022. Sheriff's deputies' pay is competitive and sheriff's deputies now are on the state-sponsored LEOPS retirement program, allowing them to retire after 25 years. These benefits, in conjunction with solid leadership, means the Sheriff's Office can fill open positions. Deputies now retire from the department – a once-rare circumstance – rather than leaving to work in other jurisdictions.\nLikewise, our Emergency Services compensation has increased.\nPay for paramedics, emergency medical technicians and 911 dispatchers is more competitive than in 2020 — though we need to monitor this against surrounding counties, and paramedics are now eligible for the LEOPS retirement program, a popular benefit. The county has stepped its sixth advanced life aupport ambulance crew to a seven-day, round-the-clock unit, helping us keep response times within the critical 8-minute standard.\nThe county is planning a new ambulance station near the Chapel District Elementary School, which will help reduce response times in the northeast corner of Talbot County, where we have struggled to meet the 8-minute standard.\nOur County Detention Center has faced staffing shortages, forcing mandatory overtime to operate the facility safely. The County has responded by boosting correctional officer salaries and budgeted to convert their retirement plan to the more robust state-sponsored CORS program.\nThe state of Maryland mandates what we spend on our court system and the minimum that we must spend on public schools. While the state allows the county to exceed its property tax cap to fund schools, there is no state mandate to fund the sheriff's department or ambulance services or road repairs. And so these critical county services may suffer if the property tax cap restricts revenues and forces cuts.\nAll of the funds raised by the \"extra penny\" on the property tax since 2022 — and more — has gone to boosting public safety. The \"extra penny\" runs out in 2026. The Talbot County Council unanimously authorized a ballot question to renew the \"extra penny\" for seven more years, out of concern public safety costs will continue to rise faster than the 2% property tax cap.\nVoting for Question A allows the County Council the option to levy the \"extra penny\" for seven more years — through fiscal year 2033. Even with this \"extra penny,\" over the last four years or for the next seven years, Talbot County maintains the lowest property tax rate in the state of Maryland.\nIf you support public safety and emergency services, vote for Question A. Do it for your family's safety. Do it for your neighbors. Do it for your own good. Vote for Question A. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Everyone has been more than willing to donate, and helpful,\" Davis said.\nOne thousand donated canned goods were received from Cambridge, he said.\nRight now donations are focused on essential needs of first aid, food, bug spray, toiletries, diapers, wipes, cleaning supplies, according to Davis.\nThe hurricane relief is expected to be an ongoing effort for some time, he said, and donations will soon be switching over to seeking winter gear of blankets, sleeping bags and thermal wear.\nParticipating counties include Anne Arundel, Caroline, Kent, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico, Worcester and parts of Delaware.\nQueen Anne's County drop-off locations include Britt's Barber Shop, Bella Rose, Mamma Mia Italian Bistro & Bar, Kent Island Methodist Church, Custom Canvas Coverings Inc., Parks Tire & Auto Service, Inc., Ten Eyck Brewing Company, Queenstown Collision Center, Duty's Service Center, and The Edge Training Academy.\nThe list of donation drop off sites continues to grow as of press time. Davis urged would be helpers to check the updated lists of donation items and current drop-off locations at the First Light For First Responders Facebook page. Those who would like to make monetary donations to aid the relief effort can do so care of the Kent Island Lions Club, he said.\nMore information about First Light for First Responders can be found at flffr.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 211\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Gov. Wes Moore is canceling outstanding debts owed to the state by those on parole and probation, calling it the \"equitable and just\" thing to do.The action will forgive the debt for more than 6,700 people who owe supervision fees as part of their parole or release arrangement with the Department of Public Safety and Correctional services.\n\"Marylanders who serve their time deserve a second chance without bearing the financial burden of recurring administrative fees,\" Moore said in a release. \"This action will create paths to work, wages and wealth for Marylanders; grow our economy; and build a state that is more equitable and just.\"\nThe decision forgives more than $13 million in debt. It applies only to current parolees on active supervision, not to those whose debts are already in collection proceedings.\nIndividuals under court-ordered supervision — whether through parole, probation or release — pay monthly fees to the state. The rate ranges from $40 to $50 a month depending on the date the supervision began.\n\"The decision to waive parole and drug testing fees aligns with Gov. Moore's vision for a more supportive reintegration process,\" said Carolyn Scruggs, secretary of the correctional agency. \"This decision eases financial burden, promotes successful reintegration and will ultimately help reduce recidivism among returning citizens.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bus driver likely to face charges after abandoning students at the wrong stop\n\n October 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 733\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A bus driver for Newark Charter School in Delaware is expected to face charges after 10 elementary school students were abandoned at the wrong bus stop.The incident happened Tuesday afternoon as Bus #28 was driving the students home for the day. School officials called police at approximately 4:15 p.m. to report the incident, according to Sgt. Joseph Conover, a spokesman for the Newark Police Department.\nThe driver made the students — ranging from kindergarten to fifth grade — get off the bus at a stop in Robscott Manor, which is not their normal stop, Conover said.\nA parent waiting for her child at that stop realized that extra students exited the bus and called the school and police to report the incident.\nSchool officials and officers from the Newark and New Castle County police departments all rushed to Robscott Manor, where they found the students safe.\n\"The cooperative efforts between Newark Charter School, the Newark Police Department and its law enforcement partners ensured the safe reunification of all of the students with their guardians,\" Conover said.\nState troopers tracked down the bus and confirmed that there were no more students aboard.\nConover said Newark's school resource officers are still interviewing students and families but he expects the driver to be arrested and charged with multiple offenses.\nPolice are still trying to figure out exactly why the students were told to get out in Robscott Manor. The neighborhood is on the bus route, but some of those students live a significant distance away from where they were dropped off, Conover said.\nThe mother of one of the affected students told the Newark Post she was waiting for her child to come home and was tracking the bus via an app that parents have access to. She began to get concerned when the bus was late and she saw on the GPS tracking app that the bus was going in the wrong direction.\nShe then got a call from the parent who witnessed the kids get kicked off the bus, and she went to Robscott to pick up her child.\nShe started to piece together what happened by talking to her son.\n\"He said they were at a stop, and the bus driver said 'Everybody get off the bus. Get your stuff and get off,'\" recounted the mother, who asked not to be identified out of concern for her child's safety.\nSome of the children were confused and scared and refused to get off, she added. At the next stop on the same street, the driver again told them it's the last stop and they had to get off, and the remaining students eventually complied.\nShe said she told her son she was proud of him for helping his younger classmates.\n\"It's just a crazy thing, but I do feel like the kids really stuck together and they kind of took care of each other,\" she said. \"I think that made a lot of the parents feel better.\"\nShe also praised school officials for reacting quickly to ensure the students were safe.\nThe mother said she has decided to let her child continue to ride the bus, but she will be more alert about knowing who is driving her child.\n\"You don't really think about who is it that's driving the bus,\" she said. \"You don't really see them a whole lot. You just kind of let your kid get on, and there they are.\"\nThe incident has taught her to be more vigilant about talking to her child about what happens during bus rides.\n\"A big takeaway with all the parents is just to kind of watch out a little bit more and try to notice if things do seem strange and having your kid be able to tell you if things seem off,\" she said.\nThe driver, whose name has not yet been made public, is an employee of Advanced Student Transportation, the bus company Newark Charter has contracted with since the school opened 23 years ago.\n\"Yesterday's incident was unfortunate and we are tremendously disappointed that it occurred,\" Head of School Sam Golder wrote in a letter to parents. \"The bus driver will no longer be driving for Newark Charter School.\"\nGolder assured parents the school is fully cooperating with the police investigation.\n\"Student safety is, and will continue to be, our number one priority at Newark Charter School,\" he said. \"I personally have three children of my own and I would not have tolerated yesterday's behavior, had my children been riding this bus.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Police: Man, 63, took inappropriate photos of girls at volleyball games\n\n October 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 840\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESAPEAKE CITY — A 63-year-old man is charged with disturbing school operation and disorderly conduct after he allegedly took numerous inappropriate photos and videos of girls playing volleyball matches inside the Bohemia Manor High School gymnasium, according to Cecil County District Court records.Investigators identified the suspect as Michael Cornell Griffin of Townsend, Del.\nMaryland State Police Master Trooper Jason Proctor conducted an on-scene investigation during the incident, which occurred shortly before 8 p.m. on Thursday, and he was able to view the photographic content of the suspect's cell phone after Griffin had given verbal consent to do so, police reported.\n\"I reviewed the photo album and observed that it contained several photographs and videos of the junior varsity teams and varsity teams from both schools: Bohemia Manor High School and Perryville High School . . . The photographs observed in the photo album were of the buttock areas of the juvenile aged female players,\" Proctor summarized in his written statement of probable cause.\nThe investigator noted, \"The uniform shorts that are worn by all the volleyball players are tight in nature; however, the photographs that were taken were zoomed in by Griffin revealing inappropriate detail, as certain curvature of the female players body parts could be clearly observed.\"\nCourt records indicate that the investigation leading to the two criminal charges against Griffin started after spectators noticed the suspect acting suspiciously in the bleachers during the volleyball game, police said. The initial complainant was a 41-year-old woman, court records show. (It is not clear if Griffin had direct ties to the volleyball competition, such as a relative who was one of the players.)\nThe complainants had seen the suspect \"deliberately zoom in on the players' buttock areas\" while he was taking digital photos with his cell phone, court records allege.\nGriffin's alleged actions caused nearby parents and other spectators to ask him why he was taking pictures, creating a scene that diverted some of the spectators' attention away from the volleyball game, according to the charging document.\n\"This was actively causing disturbance within the stands,\" court records allege.\nAfter spectators complained and pointed to the suspect, the trooper escorted Griffin from the gymnasium into the lobby, police said. Bohemia Manor Middle School Assistant Principal Stacy Rahnama was in the lobby and was present during the on-scene investigation, police added.\nProctor informed Griffin that he had been accused of taking inappropriate photos of female volleyball players, court records show. Griffin denied taking pictures of the players and started opening and closing the photo album on his phone, according to court records.\n\"It appeared as if he was trying to hide the photographs. Griffin appeared to be extremely nervous while speaking with me. I observed his right hand and fingers shake multiple times as he was scrolling through his phone,\" Proctor outlined in court records.\nAt that point, the trooper asked Griffin if he would be willing to show him the photos that he had taken and Griffin gave verbal consent, court records show. During that viewing of the photographic content of Griffin's cell phone, Proctor and Rahnama saw numerous inappropriate photos and videos of the female volleyball players, court records allege.\n\"While reviewing the photo albums, the initial complainant entered the lobby and made inquiries as to whether or not her daughter's photograph was on his phone and was making comments that she wanted the photographs deleted,\" according to the charging document.\nProctor then escorted Griffin out of the building and into the breezeway, where — with the suspect's consent — he and Rahnama deleted all of the questionable pictures and videos found in the phone's photo library and then from the phone's trash bin file, court records show.\n\"While this was taking place, a group of patrons had gathered in the lobby and were actively observing my interactions with Griffin. Another patron had to tell that group of people to remain inside and not to interfere, as they were making threats to assault Griffin due to his actions,\" according to the charging document, which indicates that the group obeyed and returned to the gymnasium.\nAfter the deletion of the photos and videos, Rahnama requested that Griffin leave the school property, police said. The trooper then escorted Griffin to his 2014 Chrysler 200 that was parked in the school lot and ordered him to leave the premises, which Griffin did, police added.\nAt the end of his written statement of probable cause, Proctor summarized, \"Griffin's direct actions of being visible while he was taking inappropriate and offensive photographs (by way of zooming in) caused direct disturbance within the stands of the sporting event which is also disruption of school activities.\"\nGriffin was not arrested but, instead, was charged through a criminal summons that was issued on Monday, court records show. Griffin is charged with disturbing school operation, a misdemeanor that carries a maximum six-month penalty and a $2,500 fine if convicted; and disorderly conduct, which is punishable by up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine if convicted, according to court records.\nGriffin is scheduled to appear for a preliminary inquiry on Nov. 25, court records show. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Thousands of troops, hundreds of out-of-state police in Florida after Hurricane Milton\n\n October 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG Newspapers | Section: National \n \n 658\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Thousands of National Guard troops are being deployed and the Pentagon is also sending military personnel to Florida after Hurricane Milton slammed into the gulf coast and swept through much of the state causing significant damage from extreme winds, relentless rains and hundred-year floods.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has activated more than 6,500 National Guard troops and another 200 soldiers from the Florida State Guard (a state defense force that has been in place since World War II) to help with emergency and public safety responses to the hurricane.\nDeSantis and state officials said the Milton response includes Blackhawk helicopters and drones.\nPentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday there are another 3,000 National Guard troops from 19 other states are also at the ready to help with search and rescue, relief and security efforts after the storm.\nRyder said the response includes 26 helicopters and more than 500 high-water vehicles are part of the response.\nThe Pentagon is also sending U.S. military assets to Florida as part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's response to Milton — which knocked power to more than 3 million Florida households and resulted in wind damage and widespread flooding in southwest Florida, the Tampa Bay area, Orlando and other parts of the state.\nFEMA has already been in the state after Hurricane Helene cause substantial storm surge damage along Florida's west coast.\n\"The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has approximately 250 people supporting the response with temporary roof support, debris control, flood control, waterway clearance and more,\" Ryder said during a press briefing Thursday.\n\"U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Army North have also have active duty forces and capabilities postured and ready to support FEMA when requested, to include up to 60 high water vehicles from Fort Stewart, Georgia, up to 100 U.S. Marines from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina to provide support for urban search and rescue, search and rescue helicopters plus light and medium rotary wing airlift aircraft from the 3rd Infantry Division, as well as command and control support capabilities.\"\nThose two military commands focus on domestic security.\nRyder said U.S. military bases in Florida and nearby southern states will serve as staging areas for Hurricane Milton responses. Tampa is home to MacDill Air Force Base and the U.S. Central Command (which runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East including the current Holy Land war zone involving Israel, Iran and its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah). Officials at Central Command have not responded to questions about the impact of Milton on operations and whether any commanders or assets were moved ahead of the Category 3 storm. Ryder also did not provide details when asked about the hurricane's impact on the Tampa-baed command Thursday.\nFlorida police agencies restricted access to beach areas after the storm surge damage of Hurricane Helene for safety and security reasons — in part, because of their concerns about looting and criminal activity. The Helene response has included National Guard troops patrolling beach areas.\nThey will likely do the same for areas after Milton which brought widespread flooding and wind damage to southwest Florida and Tampa Bay. Deployed troops will also be part of search and rescue and cleanup efforts in response to Milton, according to state officials.\nWhile the Florida governor has promised as quick as possible access to their homes for Floridians who evacuated before Milton's arrival, some local officials are less keen on that approach.\nA number of local police and fire departments pulled back on responses during Milton which brought intense winds and hours-long torrential rains Wednesday night and early Thursday morning.\nDeSantis said 500 out-of-state police are coming to Florida to add to state law enforcement responses to Milton.\nLocal sheriffs, in particular, along with DeSantis and state officials have promised aggressive response to any post-hurricane looting or burglaries of wealthy homes or businesses impacted by Milton or Helene.\n\"We are going to come down hard on you,\" said DeSantis at a press briefing Wednesday before Milton's treacherous arrival. \"We need to maintain law and order.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Marilyn Neal, executive director of the Neighborhood Service Center, told council members that a \"drastic change\" in funding will limit the assistance provided by the organization to residents in the form of kerosene, heating oil, propane and electric.\n\"I fear we are going to have a crisis,\" Neal said. \" … I'm worried that our seniors and some low-income individuals in Talbot County, as well as the town of Easton, may not be able to keep warm this winter, and it keeps me up at night.\"\nNeal said the nonprofit provides financial assistance to local residents and is then reimbursed by the Maryland Energy Assistance Program, a state program under the Department of Housing and Community Development that is federally funded.\nCardeaner Robinson, the Maryland Energy Assistance Program director, said the number of customers for the energy assistance program statewide has doubled. She said Gov. Wes Moore \"wanted to see more people use the program,\" which led to changes in eligibility requirements.\nIncreased eligibility and funding cuts for the Maryland Energy Assistance Program will impact how much financial assistance the Neighborhood Service Center can provide to county residents, Neal and Robinson said.\n\"It sounds like really, really bad policy making and planning on the part of the state,\" Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery said.\nNeal said it happens \"with every administration,\" but that she's \"not seen a crisis as large\" as what may come this winter.\nNeal asked for \"at least $50,000\" from the town to aid the center's energy assistance efforts. Ward 4 Councilmember the Rev. Elmer Davis and Montgomery each asked for Neal to bring a breakdown of how many Easton residents are served by those efforts.\nWard 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello asked that the council and town employees take a look at where the money may come from if the town contributes to the Neighborhood Service Center's program.\nFollowing the presentation and questions from councilmembers, Council President Frank Gunsallus said the council will put follow-up questions together requesting further information and details from the Neighborhood Service Center.\n\"I don't see how our seniors living on a fixed income will be able to sustain,\" Neal said. \"Normally, the subsidy would take them through the winter. Well this year, it won't fill their propane tanks up, it won't give them a full tank of kerosene.\n\"And the Neighborhood Service Center has expended 85% of our funding. … By December, all the funding will be gone.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

No one was injured and it took ten minutes to control with 18 firefighters on-site.\nThe primary responding company was Chestertown Volunteer Fire Department that later issued their press release.\nAccording to their report, at 1:22 pm on Sunday, Oct. 6, Chestertown Volunteer Fire Company with multiple other companies, was dispatched for the Structure Fire at the Dollar General store in Worton.\nA deputy from Kent County Sheriff's Office arrived first on the scene and used a fire extinguisher inside but due to the excessive smoke was forced out of the building.\nFirst arriving was Command 6 with Chief John \"Otis\" Darling and Engine 68. According to reports, they laid a 5\" Large Diameter Hose down that acted like an above-ground water and main supply hose.\nThey continued into the parking lot deploying a single 1-3/4 fire attack hose, entering the building. Officials knew which way to go from the deputy's instructions, and faced with heavy smoke, were able to do a quick \"knock down.\"\nThe fire was controlled through those actions even though other precautionary measures were deployed. The report said that they had an additional supply line and Tower 6 was up on the roof, but no action needed to be taken.\nWith no fire, their efforts turned to clearing the building of smoke, taking more than 45 minutes.\nConducting an Origin and Cause investigation, a representative from the Maryland State's Fire Marshal's Office strongly believed the cause to be electrical. As a result Delmarva Power arrived on-site, however service was left on after determining it was safe.\nAdditionally, a representative from the Kent County Health Department arrived due to the the amount of food in the store. Their decision was to condemn and dispose of all food material.\nThe store is temporarily closed until further notice. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

More than 200 deaths have been confirmed in six states.\nMilton tore through Florida late Wednesday night, leaving millions without power and causing at least five confirmed deaths as of Thursday afternoon. It made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane.\nEaston Town Council President Frank Gunsallus, who is active with Disaster Aid USA, a nonprofit that delivers disaster relief worldwide, has made two trips to North Carolina to assist Hurricane Helene victims.\nThis past weekend, Gunsallus drove down and delivered 20 cases of water, food, medicine, first aid supplies, diapers, hygiene products and more to Skyland United Methodist Church in Asheville, North Carolina.\nHe spent the weekend delivering aid and driving in Asheville and surrounding areas in western North Carolina. On Sunday, he drove through Swannanoa, North Carolina, among other ravaged towns.\n\"The devastation that I witnessed is moving,\" Gunsallus said at Monday's Easton Town Council meeting. \"It doesn't really matter how well you think you have your life planned out. Sometimes the Earth just has plans of its own, and everything you know and love can just be gone. There are still people stranded, (who) cannot get out of their properties.\"\nGunsallus and Barc Upchurch, members of the Easton Rotary Club, drove down on Tuesday to the small community of Green Mountain, North Carolina. They took a generator to the Double Island Fire Department on behalf of the Rotary Club.\nThere, they also delivered an off-road, all-terrain vehicle to the local fire department, which was needed for search and rescue efforts. Gunsallus said the ATV was donated by Dave Wilson, president of Preston Automotive Group and Preston Powersports.\nGunsallus described the sights of devastation during his two trips, from houses and buildings destroyed to trees blocking roads and railroad tracks broken.\n\"I can't not do anything. … I've got to do something,\" Gunsallus said in an interview.\nDonations to Disaster Aid USA can be made by visiting disasteraidusa.org or mailing a check. Checks can be mailed to: Disaster Aid USA 700 Port Street #538, Easton, MD 21601.\nOn Wednesday, 12 lineworkers and additional individuals from Delmarva Power arrived in St. Petersburg, Florida, to assist the electric company Duke Energy amid impacts from Hurricane Milton.\nCandice Womer, senior communications specialist for Exelon, the parent company of Delmarva Power, said more crews will be heading down to Florida later this week.\n\"By the end of this week, Delmarva Power will have close to 50 field crews and additional personnel assisting Florida,\" Womer wrote.\nDelmarva Power crews just wrapped up providing aid in Georgia following last month's Hurricane Helene. Womer said those crews and personnel departed Sept. 26, finished their work on Wednesday and will be heading home. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Those sentences will run consecutively, along with a three-year sentence for fleeing and eluding. Several other counts will run concurrently with the other charges.\nCombined, Turner's sentence is for over 60 years and due to the violent nature of the crimes he must serve at least half of that time behind bars before becoming eligible for parole.\nCalvert County State's Attorney Robert H. Harvey Jr. (R) called the sentence \"fair and appropriate, given the magnitude of the crime.\"\nDuring Friday's sentencing hearing, Flynt addressed the court, reading a prepared statement.\n\"Mr. Turner is a coward,\" Flynt said, adding that his fellow deputies responding to the shooting scene in the Walnut Creek subdivision saved his life with their quick actions.\n\"This would have been a murder trial,\" Flynt said, adding that the leg injuries he sustained in the shooting still hamper his ability today.\n\"My life is changed forever,\" Flynt said. \"I've fought like hell to get back to full duty.\"\nNoting that he has undergone about 10 surgeries due to his wounds, Flynt told the court he will be on medication for the rest of his life.\n\"I will never be able to run like I used to,\" Flynt said. The deputy asked Rappaport to impose the maximum sentence on Turner.\nThe other two deputies involved in the shootout also told the court their lives were changed by the incident.\nDeputy Tyler Bowen also read a statement, calling the incident a \"traumatic, stressful event.\"\nIn a letter read into the record during the hearing, Deputy Anthony Aranda stated the incident has impacted his career and personal life.\n\"The sole focus must be on public safety,\" Harvey said of the sentence, adding that Turner's \"conduct was reprehensible. He has shown no remorse. He blames everyone else. He has been a disciplinary problem since his incarceration.\"\nThe defendant's attorney, Michelle Harewood, said her client suffers from a bipolar disorder for which he was not taking his medication.\nHarewood asked that Turner be sent to Patuxent Institute in Jessup so that his behavioral health issues can be addressed.\n\"If he had kept on his medication we wouldn't be here today,\" Shelton Turner, the defendant's father, told the court. The elder Turner added that his family and church \"prayed earnestly\" for Flynt after the shooting incident.\n\"I hope you will find it in your heart to forgive me,\" Brandon Turner said in a written statement he read to the court prior to sentencing.\nThe Dec. 17, 2022, incident began in the Dunkirk area when the vehicle Turner and his wife were in was pulled over on the side of Route 4. Deputies had stopped and were about to search the vehicle when Turner fled. He led the deputies on a high-speed chase on Route 4 and several times fired a weapon out the driver's side window.\nFlynt, operating a patrol vehicle, disabled Turner's Kia with a precision immobilization technique. That's when the defendant reportedly began shooting at the deputies, who returned fire.\n\"You could have stopped at any time but you chose not to,\" Rappaport told the defendant before the sentence was imposed. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Resource officers already serving the school district fall under the direction and budget of the county sheriff's office.\nThe statewide grant funding assists in supplementing law enforcement coverage for public schools with $10 to 15 million in FY26 and $20 million in FY27 and each year thereafter, he said.\nAs school security is considered a top state priority, a minimum three years of funding following this year is secured, according to Saboury.\n\"So really that's putting additional eyes and ears in our schools, which is a wonderful thing,\" he said.\nAs a member of the district, the SSE works more closely with school leaders on safety measures, often outside law enforcement scopes, and are more closely involved with student behavior, support and providing intervention to mitigate and prevent harm, he said.\nAs district employees, QACPS has the flexibility to utilize SSEs for after school sporting events or field trips Saboury said.\n\"It's a great resource that the school district has never had before,\" he said.\nSSEs are held to the same standards and certification programs through the Maryland for School Safety Model training as SROs.\nTraining, uniforms, equipment and overtime are all budgeted into the grant with no cost the district, he said.\nWith the potential for increased funding down the road, Saboury was hopeful to be able to build the program and continually create a safe learning environment for students. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the Queen Anne's County Office of the Sheriff, Brian Sykes, 48, also of Millington, was apprehended during a traffic stop in Philadelphia on Oct. 13, shortly before midnight.Deputies from the Sheriff's Office were dispatched to a residence on Pfalzgroff Road in Millington, just after 6 p.m. on Oct. 11, for a report of a medical emergency. Upon arrival, deputies discovered that 67-year-old David Teat of Millington had been involved in a serious altercation, which ultimately led to his death.\nPolice said through investigative efforts, including interviews with witnesses and family members, the suspect was identified as Sykes, the victim's stepson. Investigators quickly determined that Sykes had fled and was no longer in the area. The victim's vehicle was noted missing. Police issued a stolen vehicle alert and a person of interest alert. Law enforcement agencies in surrounding states were notified, and a regional search was initiated, police said.\nSykes was located during a traffic stop in North Philadelphia when a felony alert came back on the vehicle's tags. Sykes attempted to flee, striking multiple vehicles in the process, before being apprehended. Minor injuries were sustained as a result of these collisions. Sykes was held on multiple charges related to the incident in Philadelphia. The Queen Anne's County Office of the Sheriff sought and obtained an arrest warrant that Sykes will be extradited for the following charges: murder, first degree; murder, second degree; assault, first degree; assault, second degree; armed robbery; robbery and theft: $1,500 to under $25,000.\nSheriff Gary Hofmann said, \"Our office is grateful for the critical support we received from law enforcement agencies in Delaware and Pennsylvania in the apprehension of this suspect. We are grateful that Brian Sykes will now face the judicial process. This is an important step towards justice for the victim and their family.\"\nThe investigation remains active.

He reminded the council of stories he shared on juvenile crime during previous meetings including children as young as 10 with guns and speeding cars on U.S. Route 50 and state Route 16 by underage drivers.\n\"There are kids that are still kids on paper,\" Detmer said. \"(But) they're not acting like children.\"\nCouncil President George Pfeffer, said the topic is on the list and there's no priority on the list created. Pfeffer described the topics on the list as \"equally important to us\" and said they will emphasize the importance of those topics once there is a legislator in front of them.\nThe list will be discussed with the local contingent of state delegates and senators.\nLater on in the meeting Councilmember Ricky Travers, added that he agreed with Detmer and said he had issue with the way the juvenile justice system functions and said the system is \"setting up a whole group of young kids for failure.\"\nDuring public comment, detention center Warden Don Satterfield shared that over the last two months the detention center has had seven juveniles waiting for adult status.\nSatterfield said because the state of Maryland has passed laws stating that juveniles must be housed separately by \"vision and audio,\" those regulations have created a difficult barrier with the increase of juveniles being sent to adult detention centers.\nSatterfield shared that the current detention center is almost 34 years old and is not designed to accommodate increased numbers of juveniles.\n\"Unfortunately, I'm going to be coming before you to add a wing (to the center),\" Satterfield said. \"That's where we are with this. We are already in violation of the law because of the audio part, and every other facility in the states is pretty much the same way. But this is where we are with the juvenile situation, and I don't see it concluding. And they are, quite frankly, they're a holy terror.\"\nAfter hearing comment from Satterfield, Pfeffers suggested in addition to the rise in juvenile crime, that they discuss the restrictions placed on detention centers could possibly force the county to build another wing to the detention facility.\nThe council unanimously agreed to add the topics to the county's legislative priorities.\nDorchester is not the only county facing questions of outdated detention centers. Earlier this week, Caroline County commissioners discussed plans to join with Queen Anne's and Kent counties to build a new center, in part to deal with the increase in juvenile inmates.\nIn a March article in The Star Democrat, Cambridge Police Chief Justin Todd talked about the growing challenge of juvenile crime in Dorchester County's largest city.\n\"Through investigation and statistical analysis, we have determined that the overwhelming suspect profiles for these crimes are male juveniles under the age of 16,\" according to a Cambridge police report. \"But we have detained suspects as young as 11 for stealing vehicles in Cambridge.\"\nAccording to the report, there is one 12-year-old who has been arrested for vehicle theft 11 times in the past three years. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Eastern Shore fire companies aid areas affected by Hurricane Helene\n\n October 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 591\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — Fire companies throughout the Eastern Shore have stepped up to assist with disaster areas affected by Hurricane Helene. Together they have donated fire and EMS equipment to first responders in need.When Hurricane Helene occurred, some of the members of the Oxford and Tilghman Fire Company felt the need to assist in any way possible. After watching several YouTube and Facebook videos circulating online showing the conditions in the affected areas, members of the fire company came up with the idea to assist first responders in Tennessee by donating some of their equipment.\nGraham Norbury, chief of the Oxford Fire Company, said regardless of location, fire departments seek to help each other and anyone else in need.\n\"We do a lot of mutual aid to other departments in the area and elsewhere,\" Norbury said. \"The Brotherhood of the Fire Services is pretty tight. When we see someone in need, then we want to be able to help any way we can.\"\nAccording to Norbury, most volunteer fire companies replace equipment on a reasonably regular basis. The Oxford Fire Department had several pieces of equipment delivered to them in a short amount of time including a new ambulance and a new fire truck.\nNorbury said they put word out through the Maryland State Firefighters Association that they wanted to help by donating equipment. News traveled fast, and Bill Killan, member from a fire department in Tennessee, contacted Norbury and helped coordinate a drop off with a fire department in Butler, Tennessee.\nTim Kearns, president of Oxford Fire Company, was one of the volunteers to deliver essential equipment to support disaster relief efforts. The drive to Tennessee was over 500 miles and was shared among four different drivers.\n\"It was important because the volunteer system works on mutual aid, so when someone is overwhelmed, we come to help,\" Kearns said. \"And that's what we did, only they're just a little farther away than most.\"\nKearns said they made two stops to deliver equipment. The first was at an agricultural supply in Bristol, Virginia, which is on the border of Tennessee.\nThere they offloaded a skid brush unit, which is a pre-assembled piece of equipment that can fit into the back of a pickup truck and turn that pickup truck into a brush truck for fighting land fires and small house fires.\nAccording to Kearns, the brush skid unit was the most valuable piece of equipment they gave because the roads in the area were so badly destroyed that any vehicle would have a difficult time navigating through.\nWith the brush skid unit the local fire department could use a heavy four-wheel drive pickup truck to help fight fires that occur.\nThe second stop was a campground called Faith Camp. Kearns said the camp was owned by Darren Clark, a member of the Elk Mills Poga Volunteer Fire Company, who had come from Florida to create the beautiful natural area.\nCurrently, Clark has been assisting people who have been displaced by the hurricane. Clark has designated his campground as a satellite fire station.\nAccording to Kearns, everyone is trying to do their part, regardless of location. Contributing Maryland fire companies include Oxford, Tilghman, Cordova, Easton, Queen Anne Hillsboro, Suddlersville and Hollywood.\n\"It took a lot of folks to coordinate and manhandle the transfer of this equipment, from the paperwork, insurances, transfer of titles and tags, to all of the logistics here, there and in between,\" Kearns said. \"Our Chief Engineer Stacy Dulin and Assistant Chief Engineers Mike Greenwak and Tom Bixler assured the equipment was capable of the 500-mile trip. Oxford Ferry loaned the heavy trailer.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Town Manager Tammy Kelledes said in an interview that \"ongoing\" concerns of respiratory issues \"prompted an air study.\"\nAfter the initial closure, further testing confirmed asbestos and \"multiple types of mold\" are in the building, the town release stated.\n\"Laboratory results showed elevated levels of mold throughout the 2nd floor of the building and confirmed there was a risk of exposure and contamination,\" the town wrote.\nTown employees moved out of the Town Hall building on Oct. 8 after the initial finding. They are working out of the town's meeting hall across the street.\nIn July, Greensboro's Town Hall was closed for more than two weeks due to a bat infestation, which cost the town around $12,000 in cleanup costs.\nThe town says an \"abatement plan is being prepared\" for the mold and asbestos. Kelledes said next steps are \"to be determined,\" but that they may be \"fairly extensive.\"\n\"We're functioning right now,\" Kelledes said. \"It's hard to say what will come out of it. … As of right now, we are out of there and fine.\"\nWhile Town Hall is closed, residents can go to the meeting hall at 111 S Main Street for assistance, which is located across the parking lot from Town Hall. They can also reach the town by calling 410-482-6222 or emailing greensboro@greensboromd.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Upon their arrival, they found Merina outside of her home with a gunshot wound. According to prior reporting in the Star Democrat, Merina was located inside a vehicle with multiple bullet holes. She was pronounced dead on the scene.\nFollowing an investigation by the Maryland State Police Homicide Unit and consultation with the Talbot County State's Attorney's Office, a felony arrest warrant was issued for Juarez a few days later.\nJuarez was located by Mexican authorities for an unrelated crime in Oaxaca, Mexico on March 24, 2022. The U.S. Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs worked with Mexican prosecutors to request Juarez's provisional arrest in April 2022. Extradition was granted on Oct. 5, 2022, but was deferred pending completion of Juarez's sentence in Mexico.\nJuarez was extradited to Maryland Tuesday and processed at the Maryland State Police Easton Barracks. He is currently being held at the Talbot County Detention Center without bond.\nInvestigators from the Maryland State Police Homicide Unit led the investigation. Assistance was provided by troopers from the Easton Barrack, the Maryland State Police Criminal Intelligence Section, crime scene technicians from the Forensic Sciences Division, troopers from the Maryland State Apprehension Team, Talbot County Sheriff's Office, Talbot County State's Attorney's Office, the Maryland Coordination and Analysis Center, Salisbury City Police Department and the Fruitland Police Department.\nFederal law enforcement assistance was provided by the United States Marshals Service Baltimore Field Office and the Capital Area Regional Fugitive Task Force, and the United States Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs, who worked with law enforcement partners in Mexico to secure Juarez's arrest and extradition. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore (D) to \"immediately demand the resignation\" of Vincent Schiraldi, secretary of the Department of Juvenile Services.The Dorchester, Talbot and Caroline County sheriffs, along with all but five other Maryland sheriffs, voted Monday to have the Maryland Sheriffs' Association send the governor a letter to this effect.\n\"Since Schiraldi's appointment in 2022, his extreme policies and lack of leadership as the Secretary of the Department of Juvenile Services, have directly made communities less safe in Maryland,\" the letter reads.\n\"Consistently in Maryland, juveniles have been charged with serious violent crimes,\" it later states, \"only to be turned right back over to a parent or guardian, and back out on the streets to commit more crimes.\"\nA statement from Moore's office noted that \"over the past year,\" the governor has made a \"concerted effort\" to hold youth accountable and rehabilitate offenders. The statement highlighted a \"26% decline in juvenile homicide arrests and 46% decline in non-fatal shootings of juveniles\" statewide.\nThe statement did not directly respond to the Maryland Sheriffs' Association's request for Moore to call for Schiraldi's resignation.\n\"The governor is fully committed to working with local elected officials, law enforcement, the judiciary, and community leaders to improve public safety by holding youth accountable and rehabilitating them,\" it reads.\nThe Department of Juvenile Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the sheriffs' letter.\nSchiraldi, who was officially appointed to the position by Moore in March 2023, has indicated in other media interviews that he has the governor's support and is planning to \"stay in his job.\"\n\"Gov. Moore has been extremely supportive,\" Schiraldi told WBAL-TV on Friday afternoon. \"He's gotten us additional funds this year — $17 million to make community safer by expanding programs — and I want those community members who are calling for my resignation to feel safe.\"\nSHERIFFS WEIGH INThe Caroline, Dorchester and Talbot sheriffs said their votes to send the letter to Moore were prompted by negative impacts on local communities during Schiraldi's tenure as Department of Juvenile Services secretary.\nDorchester County Sheriff James Phillips said he \"lost all respect\" for Schiraldi following an in-person community meeting the secretary attended around a year ago.\n\"He had the audacity to tell us, … 'The data that I'm receiving doesn't support your claim of increased juvenile crime,'\" Phillips recalled. \"And our reply to that was, 'Well, obviously the numbers are going to go down because you're not allowing us to charge (them) anymore.'\"\nPhillips said in Dorchester County, \"we're dealing with the same people, the same names, the same age kids.\"\n\"The law-abiding citizens are suffering because of their ignorance and stupidity in protecting these criminals,\" Phillips said. \"And that's all they are. They might only be 15 or 16, but they're thugs.\"\nTalbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble says there's \"no accountability,\" noting that his office was recently involved in a vehicle chase in which a juvenile had an ankle monitor with batteries that hadn't been replaced for two months.\nGamble said the Mid-Shore has \"good\" juvenile services workers, \"but they're being hampered by the secretary.\" He pointed to Talbot Teen Court, a first-time program for juvenile offenders of misdemeanor crimes, as more successful in rehabilitating youth compared to the state's services.\n\"They're getting more community service and stuff out of Teen Court than they would ever get out of DJS,\" Gamble said. \"It's just a failed system. And it's being led by what the Sheriffs' Association believes is a bad pick by the governor.\"\nCaroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker said recent justice reform — particularly Maryland's Child Interrogation Protection Act — has decreased the ability of police to hold juveniles accountable.\nThat act, enacted in 2022, restricts police from questioning a child without first talking to the parent or guardian's attorney or the Office of the Public Defender. Baker said it's a \"shame when parental rights are superseded by the legislature.\"\nBaker, who serves on the state's juvenile justice reform commission, believes the General Assembly has a \"role to play\" in improving juvenile reform moving forward.\n\"Juvenile reform needs to be a high priority to help take the steps needed for them to have accountability for when they step into adulthood,\" Baker said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Greensboro man enters Alford plea in sex abuse of a minor\n\n October 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Crime \n \n 320\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — A Greensboro man entered an Alford plea for sexual abuse of a minor and reckless endangerment at a pre-trial hearing last week in the Caroline County Circuit Court.On Oct. 23, Enemias Simeon Bautista Perez, 37, took the plea for two of 14 counts of criminal charges, which included first-degree rape and first-degree child abuse.\nAn Alford plea allows a person to maintain their innocence while acknowledging the state had enough evidence to obtain a conviction. The other 12 counts will not be prosecuted.\nPerez's jury trial, which was scheduled to begin Oct. 28, is now canceled.\nThe counts that will not be prosecuted included first-degree rape of an 8-year-old child, along with incest, first-degree child abuse, first-degree assault and sexual solicitation of a minor, all allegedly occurring at his residence in Greensboro around March 30.\nOriginally, Perez faced up to 211 years in prison in Caroline County, along with life in prison for the first-degree rape charge. His guilty counts of sexual abuse of a minor and reckless endangerment carry maximum sentences of 30 and five years, respectively.\nPerez's sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 13. Judge Sidney S. Campen requested a full pre-sentence investigation into Perez prior to that date.\nAttorney Eduardo Gonzalez, who represents Perez, did not immediately respond to request for comment.\nCharging documents indicated Perez as the 8-year-old child's parent. Since being charged, he's been held without bond at the Caroline County Detention Center.\nPerez faces an addition 19 counts of criminal charges in Wicomico County, including first-degree rape, sexual abuse of a minor and second-degree assault. All 19 of those charges state the offenses occurred between August 2021 and April 2024 in Wicomico County, according to court records.\nThe Wicomico County charges total a potential 224 years in prison, along with life in prison for the first-degree rape charge.\nA pre-trial conference for that case is scheduled for Nov. 25, with a potential jury trial set to begin Dec. 9 in Wicomico County. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge police, fire chiefs update City Council on departments\n\n October 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 541\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Cambridge Police Chief Justin Todd and Rescue Fire Company Chief Brad Walters both gave updates on their departments at a Cambridge City Council meeting Oct. 28.During the meeting, Walters talked about the fire company's goals and objectives, and Todd talked about the police department's third quarter report, which breaks down data from July through September.\nRESCUE FIRE COMPANYThe Rescue Fire Company Chiefs Office has nine goals for 2024 through 2026:\nProvide an advanced, cost-effective and dependable fleet of apparatuses.Ensure a healthy and safe workplace.Provide an efficient and well-structured training program.Improve response management.Improve internal and external communications.Provide well-structured and accessible standard operating guidelines and procedures.Improve records management.Provide an efficient system for inventory and supplies.Improve recruitment and retention.\nObjectives for the nine goals include developing a health and fitness program for members, developing a standard for response times and staff availability, developing mutual aid agreements with surrounding departments and developing an outreach program for recruitment.\nWalters, who attended the council meeting virtually, said the fire company has always had goals and objectives in place.\n\"Now we're just finally putting them on paper, (putting) them out there,\" he said to the City Council.\nCAMBRIDGE POLICE DEPARTMENTAfter Walters spoke, Todd filled the City Council in on the police department's third quarter report. He said the department has been keeping up with its reporting in an effort to be transparent and keep the public aware of what is happening in Cambridge.\nTodd listed some reductions in crime and said he sees these reductions as a sign of progress. He said there is still \"a lot of work ahead,\" but the department will keep working.\nAccording to the report, compared to last year's third quarter, violent crime is down 31%, stolen vehicle reports are down 114%, simple assault complaints are down 16%, aggravated assault complaints are down 62% and ShotSpotter alerts are down 57%.\nTodd said he believes the percentage of stolen vehicle reports decreased more than 100% this year because many of the vehicle thefts last year were committed by kids after videos came out showing how a person can easily break into Kias and Hyundais.\nTodd said Kia and Hyundai has since fixed this issue. He said the Cambridge Police Department also identified many of those children, and a lot of them were given referrals to the Department of Juvenile Services.\n\"I believe that's the main reason you see that drop that significant,\" Todd said.\nTodd also mentioned some increases in certain crimes. According to the report, sexual crime is up 122% and vandalism and malicious destruction of property complaints are up 27% compared to last year's third quarter.\nTodd said the department will work to address these increases.\n\"We'll get to the point of figuring out why they are up and who is doing those crimes,\" he said.\nAfter Todd spoke, multiple commissioners thanked him and his department for their efforts.\nCommissioner Jameson Harrington said he was impressed with the results from ShotSpotter, a gunshot detection system. The ShotSpotter data within the report broke down the number of gunshot incidents and rounds fired it has detected, as well as the top locations for gunfire.\n\"I was very skeptical at first, and I've seen how it's been misused and mis-deployed in other cities, but it seems like it's working well here,\" Harrington said about the system. \"So thank you.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Election Day looms: How will the counts go and will voters trust the process - and the results?\n\n October 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Belgrade News | Section: News \n \n 1169\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Tuesday's election — which is already seeing significant early voting across the country and could see record turnout spurred by the neck-and-neck White House race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris — will also be a serious test of how much trust the public has in the election system and the government agencies who run it.Right now, those trust levels skew along partisan lines.\nA Pew Research Center Poll released Oct. 24 found 42% of Trump voters are not confident the election will run smoothly compared to 90% of Harris voters who trust the system.\nAccording to a Pew survey, 38% of Trump voters have confidence in the counting of mail-in and absentee votes compared to 85% of Harris voters who trust government agencies and poll workers counting the votes.\nClose to three-quarters of Harris voters (72%) versus less than one-third of Trump backers (32%) are confident the election system is secure against being hacked.\nThere is also plenty of curiosity — and some concerns — over how and when ballots will be counted and when winners might be determined not only in the presidential race but also key congressional contests and state ballot measures.\nTrump has disputed his 2020 loss to President Joe Biden. Trump led in key battleground states on election night, but Biden overcame those deficits via ensuring counts of mail-in and absentee ballots in the election which occurred in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA number of state and local election agencies have increased security protocols and added more transparency to how ballots are tabulated and secured.\nOthers are counting absentee, mail-in and other early ballots early this cycle to help get results quicker and avoid delays that could fuel worries about how votes are being counted and results. .\nStill, barring some unforeseen turnout trends and definitive exit polls, a winner in the presidential race and other key races are not expected on election night or early Wednesday morning.\n'COUNTING DOESN'T STOP'In Pitt County, North Carolina near the Atlantic coast, County Elections Director Dave Davis said approved absentee ballot envelopes are fed into voting machines weekly in the run-up to the election.\nHe said the county has sent out more than 4,100 absentee ballots this year. Close to 87,600 people voted in the 2020 presidential race.\nDavis wouldn't talk about election security measures but said \"counting doesn't stop\" until all ballots are tallied.\nNorth Carolina is one of the key Electoral College battlegrounds between Trump and Harris, and there is some consternation about how long it will take for all votes to be counted in places such as Maricopa County in Arizona. That county, which includes Phoenix and Scottsdale, has a two-page ballot which could add to its already cumbersome counting of early ballots.\nThe Wisconsin State Board of Elections says all ballots — including in-person and absentee votes — are counted on Election Day and matched to voter registration details in poll books.\n\"All ballots are counted on Election Day,\" the state agency says in an explainer on vote counts.\nPennsylvania also does not count absentee ballots until Election Day.\nAnother key battleground, Michigan, has expanded early voting efforts with early voting centers open and is allowing local clerks to count them ahead of time — though results will not be posted until election night.\nSTORED\nIN A VAULT\nIn Montana (where there is a key U.S. Senate race and ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution), Gallatin County — which includes Bozeman, Big Sky and Belgrade — will count some absentee votes on Monday as allowed by state law, according to Eric Semerad, who serves as county clerk and elections administrator.\n\"We will start counting ballots on Monday, Nov. 4. State law allows counties of our size to start counting the day before Election Day, but only until 5 p.m.,\" Semerad said. \"We will then start counting again the morning of Election Day and won't stop until we are finished. Likely this will be sometime late Wednesday.\"\nHe said 63,500 absentee ballots have been sent out for this election. Close to 71,000 people voted in Gallatin County in 2020.\nSemerad did outline some of the procedures and security measures for counting and securing ballots.\n\"We will begin opening the secrecy envelopes and removing the ballots on Thursday, October 31st,\" he said. \"All ballots that are opened are kept in large security bags by ballot style which are sealed every night with numbered seals that are logged every time they are sealed or unsealed. Ballots are stored in our office vault that is monitored by a security camera.\"\nState law requires localities to keep counting voting ballots election night.\nSemerad said the first set of unofficial results won't be posted online until all voters have finished voting. Voting could continue after polls close if there are long lines.\n'CHAIN O\nF CUSTODY'\nIn Florida, there are ballot measures to legalize marijuana for recreational use and to codify abortion rights into the state constitution superseding state restrictions passed after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\nUnder state law, those measures have to get more than 60% of the vote.\nLeah Valenti, supervisor of elections in Charlotte County in southwest Florida, also ran through some of the processes and protocols for counting early mail-in ballots.\nCharlotte County — which includes Punta Gorda and Port Charlotte — has sent out more than 45,000 mall-in ballots, Valenti said. More than 116,500 voters cast ballots in the county in 2020.\nShe said mail-in ballots are date-stamped, voters' identities are confirmed and ballot envelopes are batched and counts are reconciled daily.\nThey are stored in a secured room.\n\"Unlike the other office doors which have key card access (RFID), the mail ballots are stored in a dual authenticated secure room, which is under video surveillance. The ballots are stored there until they are opened and counted during a public meeting of the Canvassing Board,\" Valenti said.\nShe said voting equipment goes through accuracy testing before ballots are tallied, a new auditing system is being deployed this year and there other \"election integrity protocols.\"\n\"For instance, any time election materials are transported, two election workers from opposing political parties are required to sign off on chain of custody forms. This ensures transparency and accountability from all sides,\" Valenti said.\nNOT CONNECTEDIn Oregon (where all ballots are submitted by mail), Rochelle Long, Klamath County Clerk in the southern part of the state, said counts are done daily leading up to the election with results posted starting election night.\nKlamath County has sent out more than 51,500 ballots for the general election. Just over 36,700 voters cast ballots in the 2020 presidential race in the more rural and conservative county, where Trump carried close to 69% of the vote.\nLong said the voting counting process is public and can be seen on livestream in a number of Oregon jurisdictions. There are also safeguards, including multi-party presence during vote counts and transparency for the machine that tallies votes.\n\"The tally machine is not connected to any outside network,\" she said. \"The vote tally machine is in a locked room on camera and can be viewed publicly via live stream.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Former Easton Police officer to serve 6 months after sexual conduct with teenagers\n\n November 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Crime \n \n 711\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — During a hearing Friday morning, a former Easton Police officer was sentenced to four years of incarceration with all but six months suspended.In September, Jason Dyott, 38, was found guilty of misconduct in office for engaging in physical sexual conduct with two different teenage girls while on duty.\nThe former sergeant — who resigned from the police department Thursday — will also have to serve three years of supervised probation upon his release. Judge C. Carey Deeley Jr., who handed down the sentence, said conditions of probation include completing treatment and not having any contact with the victims.\nDuring the hearing Friday, Deeley said Dyott had leveraged his position of trust as a police officer in order to cause young women to \"come under his spell.\"\n\"It was heinous conduct,\" Deeley said.\nOn Sept. 10, Deeley found Dyott guilty on two counts of misconduct in office. The charges stem from allegations that Dyott used his departmental cell phone to communicate in a sexual manner with several teenagers and students at local high schools. Dyott met up with the students while on duty.\nDuring the September trial, Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Mary Setzer said in the fall of 2022, Dyott engaged in physical acts with the two teenage girls in separate instances.\nDeputy State Prosecutor Sarah David said at the trial that in the two incidents, Dyott acted in his official capacity. Not only was he on duty, she said, but he was presenting himself to the public and to the teenage girls as an officer.\nAt the hearing Friday, Dyott apologized to the court, the victims, the Town of Easton and his family. He said he was going through a separation at the time of the incidents and he \"wasn't in (his) right mind.\" He said he should not have used his position of power and said what he did was morally and ethically wrong.\nDyott said he has sought treatment and hopes to continue it. According to Dyott's defense attorney, Shaun Owens, Dyott has been undergoing sex offender treatment.\nDyott's wife, Amber Dyott, said her husband has owned up to his mistakes and grown and learned from them. She said her husband has faced public punishment and asked that the court consider her family, including Jason Dyott's kids, while determining the sentence.\nThe defense requested Dyott be sentenced to three years of supervised probation with no incarceration. The Office of the State Prosecutor asked that Dyott be sentenced to four years of incarceration with all but six months suspended.\nAlthough one of the victims who testified in the trial wrote a statement for the sentencing, it was not read aloud during the hearing.\nUntil Thursday, Dyott — who was named the Easton Police Department's officer of the year in 2014 — had been suspended with pay by the department. He was put on suspension in the beginning stages of the investigation in 2023.\nIn an interview with the Star Democrat, Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey said the department sent a letter to Dyott that if he did not resign, he would be terminated following his sentencing. Lowrey said Dyott resigned from the department Thursday.\nLowrey said Dyott had been served with charges by the Talbot County Administrative Charging Committee and they held off on pursuing a trial in an effort to protect the victims. Lowrey said an additional trial with the Administrative Charging Committee would mean the victims would have to testify twice. He said he didn't want to do that to them and that is why it took as long as it did for the department to separate from Dyott.\nLowrey said he agreed with the court's decision. In a news release he said the department is happy it can continue to serve the community \"without the weight of Mr. Dyott's immoral actions on our shoulders.\"\n\"Being a police officer is more than a job, it is an acceptance of a duty to uphold the laws of our country and a duty to the safety of the members of our community,\" Lowrey said. \"It is also the acceptance of a duty to your fellow law enforcement officers. It is disappointing and maddening to our community, our officers and to me that Mr. Dyott chose to violate these duties and serve his own gratifications at the expense of young people in our community.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble outlined in an interview the security measures the Sheriff's Office has been requested to provide.\nGamble says his deputies and town police departments in Talbot County will be performing patrol checks in parking lots on Election Day. With schools closed, school resource officers will provide assistance, allowing for a \"quicker response time should there be an issue,\" he said.\nLocal police will also be following election judges from polling places to the elections office as ballots are escorted, the sheriff said.\nDespite the added measures, Gamble said he has been in communications with the State Board of Elections ahead of Tuesday's election, and \"(There are) no known issues in Maryland, there are no known threats in Maryland.\"\nElection officials in neighboring counties say there haven't been any incidents to threaten security.\nDorchester County Election Director Gwendolyn Dales said she has not experienced any incidents, adding that there are no current plans to have a police presence when ballots are escorted.\nThe Dorchester County Sheriff's Office and Cambridge Police Department will be performing security checks at polling locations, Dales said.\n\"They'll be going from polling place to polling place (at) various times,\" Dales said, \"meandering through the parking lots and making sure everything's safe and secure.\"\nCaroline County Election Director Allison Murphy said her office has \"security measures in place\" to ensure voters have a safe voting experience.\n\"We're following guidance from the state,\" Murphy said, \"and we have plans in place to ensure voters' ballots are secure.\"\nMurphy said the county will be \"diligent in making sure\" that every ballot is counted.\nThe topic of election security generated a back-and-forth last month between Gamble and Attorney General Anthony Brown. On Oct. 1, Gamble wrote in a letter to the local board of elections that his office will conduct security checks of polling locations \"to ensure we have a safe and fair election.\"\nBrown said in an Oct. 7 letter that sheriff's offices across the state play a limited role in election security.\n\"I understand that local law enforcement agencies do provide assistance to local boards of elections in some jurisdictions, including deploying personnel to provide security and transporting election materials,\" Brown wrote. \"But importantly, this is done at the request and under the direction of the local Board of Elections itself.\"\nGamble wrote a letter in response to Brown on Oct. 15, saying he understood chief election judges \"have authority at the polling places.\" He expanded on his original letter, noting that the Talbot County Board of Elections requested additional police presence.\nBALLOT DROP BOXESEarlier this week, ballot boxes were set on fire in Oregon and Washington, leading to security concerns across the nation.\nElection officials in Washington said hundreds of ballots were damaged Monday in a fire set with an incendiary device, according to The Associated Press. That incident is connected to another ballot box fire in Oregon, according to local police.\nEvery county in Maryland has drop boxes for voters to place their completed mail-in ballots. There are three in Caroline County, and two in both Dorchester and Talbot counties.\nIn an emailed statement to the Star Democrat, Maryland State Board of Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis said \"Marylanders can feel safe and confident in using the drop box.\"\n\"This is always something I'm concerned about,\" DeMarinis wrote. \"This is a crime against democracy. We have taken steps to mitigate any potential problems if it occurs in Maryland. This situation was a scenario in our tabletop exercises prior to the election.\"\nDeMarinis said drop box locations are under \"24/7 video surveillance\" and that local election boards are \"modifying pick up schedules to increase coverage.\" The state board is in contact with state and federal law enforcement for added protections, DeMarinis said.\nDales, the Dorchester election director, said what she's seeing nationally this week is \"very concerning.\"\n\"We just want citizens and voters to feel safe and secure in any situation,\" Dales said. \"But I think the safest thing and most secure thing to do is to come into a polling place and vote your ballot.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The fire was contained to the inside of the chimney.\"\nJones added that there was \"minimal damage\" and that the hotel's roof and its contents were left unharmed. No injuries were reported.\nDon Reedy, director of operations at the Tidewater Inn, said the hotel's chimney is being inspected and there will not be any fires in the lobby fireplace in the meantime.\nReedy said Sunday's fire will not affect the Tidewater Inn's hosting of the Waterfowl Festival opening ceremonies this Thursday evening.\n\"We're back to business this morning,\" Reedy said. \" … The floors and the guest rooms all seem fine.\"\nJones said he's glad the fire departments prevented any major damage to the historic inn the week of Waterfowl. He added that chimney fires are something to watch out for\n\"This time of year, chimney fires are common,\" Jones said. \"A lot of times, chimney fires can be started from burning wood that is green (and) may not be completely seasoned. It's a buildup of basically creosote in the chimney.\n\" … We encourage people to regularly maintain chimneys, have them professionally cleaned (in order to) avoid these types of fires.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The vast majority were supporting Kamala Harris' presidential race and Candace Henry, a candidate for the Talbot County Board of Education.\nChappell reported both incidents to Easton Police.\nEaston Police Department Captain Greg Wright said in September, there had been reports of at least four signs damaged or stolen in the town. More reports have been made in the months following.\nJohn Bollinger, captain for the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, said there has been a noticeable decrease in reported vandalism of political signs and other forms of vandalism compared to previous years. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some stones were completely loose from their bases and others were sent askew, causing damage.\nPeople whose family members had been laid to rest there came quickly as word got out to see if there was damage. One man was visibly angry as he cleaned a head stone from his family plot, preparing to restore it without waiting. Others similarly began efforts to clean up the damages caused by the vandalism.\nThe governing board of North East Cemetery told families its insurance would cover the damages.\nYates said the culprits were identified last month after forensic inspection, they were then arrested and charged.\nAccording to Yates, the estimated damage inside the cemetery was $11,000. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Upon arrival, it was determined this was a large area brush fire and additional resources were requested, according to a release from the Waldorf Volunteer Fire Department.\nAll available brush trucks from all stations in Charles County were requested, as well as units from St. Mary's, Calvert and Prince George's counties.\nRoughly four to five acres of land were involved. A number of units remained on scene throughout the night, the release said.\nThe brush fire was indicative of the larger problem at hand — a drought that brought some of the driest weather that the region has seen within 130 years.\nThe statewide burning ban implemented by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Nov. 1 remains in effect, the state agency said in a Nov. 12 update.\n\"While most of the state experienced varying amounts of rain earlier this week, fuel and drought conditions continue to be well above normal seasonal highs,\" a release from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources said. \"These conditions coupled with low humidity and gusty winds expected in the next several days will once again raise fire danger across the state.\"\nA return to normal seasonal patterns with cooler temperatures and frequent showers will be needed to lift the burn ban, the department said.\n\"We do not make these determinations lightly and understand this may require some people to adjust their plans,\" Department of Natural Resources Secretary Josh Kurtz said. \"However, a ban of this magnitude is necessary to protect the lives and property of Maryland residents and visitors, as well as the state's natural resources.\"\nSince Oct. 1, Maryland Department of Natural Resources units and partner agencies have responded to 50 wildland fires in the state that burned an estimated 117.8 acres of land.\nAs of Nov. 12, five of those fires are contained and actively staffed, 15 are contained and monitored by patrol, and 30 are out.\nAccording to the National Integrated Drought Information System, a program under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 3.1 million residents of Maryland are in areas of drought.\nThat is roughly half the population of the state, according to census data.\nAccording to the National Integrated Drought Information System, each county in the tri-county had a top five driest October within the past 130 years.\nThroughout October, Charles County had 2.6 less inches of rain than normal, Calvert County had 2.83 inches less, and St. Mary's County had 2.9 inches less.\nThat marked St. Mary's County's second driest October in the past 130 years.\nSince 1988, the state of Maryland has enacted full statutory bans in 1988, 1995, 1999 and 2006 and less stringent regulatory bans four times in 1991, 1998, 2001 and 2002. Historically, restrictions have remained in place from one to eight weeks.\nOther states in the mid-Atlantic region are experiencing wildfires, according to DNR. One such blaze near the border of New York and New Jersey has burned roughly 3,500 acres as of Nov. 12, underscoring the importance of Maryland's burn ban.\nMore rain was predicted in the region overnight Thursday into Friday. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Both have 271 days of credit for time served leading up to their plea hearing Monday.\nJudge Karen Dean also sentenced David and Mandy Insley to five years of supervised probation. Conditions of probation include that they cannot bring pets into their home and that they both continue mental health treatment.\nThe parents were originally each charged with first-degree child abuse resulting in death, but the state entered into nolle prosequi on those counts, meaning the state will not prosecute for those charges.\nAs a part of a plea deal, Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard recommended no more than an 18 month active sentence. She said no sentence is more difficult to go through than what David and Mandy Insley have to live with for the rest of their lives.\nLeonard said that on June 26, 2023, police and emergency medical services responded to the Insley home in response to a 14-year-old girl suffering from a cardiac arrest. Paige Insley was found unresponsive in her bed and pronounced dead on the scene.\nLeonard said the teen had been diagnosed at birth with a developmental disability that caused her to suffer from seizures. She said Mandy Insley indicated to police that she had forgotten to give her daughter medication for her seizures the night before but gave them to her in the morning.\nAn autopsy report found that Paige Insley most likely died of a seizure that was due to an underlying condition, Leonard said.\nLeonard also spoke about the condition of the Insley home. She said police noted the house was dirty and cluttered. There was animal feces on the ground. Leonard said mice and mice excrement were found throughout the house.\nLeonard said there were no findings of abuse to the child as a result of the conditions of the home, but she said there were findings that Paige Insley was neglected by parents who were responsible for her wellness, safety and living conditions.\nCambridge Code Enforcement and Dorchester County Animal Control were called to the house following Paige Insley's death, and, according to a news release from the Cambridge Police Department, Cambridge Code Enforcement condemned the house.\nBoth David and Mandy Insley spoke during the hearing Monday. Mandy Insley said she has been attending weekly appointments with a therapist and has started taking medication. David asked the judge that she allow him to rebuild with his wife. He said that leading up to Paige's death, the tapestry of his life had begun to unravel and they weren't able to get help with the house.\n\"We just want a chance to try and function again,\" he said through tears. \"She was my best friend.\"\nMandy Insley's attorney Archibald McFadden said there was no causal link between the conditions of the house and Paige's death. He said the COVID-19 pandemic affected everyone, and the Inselys are one of example of that. The pandemic, he said, resulted in David Insley losing his job as a reporter at the Star Democrat. He said mental health issues exacerbated by isolation resulted in the family's poor living conditions.\nMcFadden said both David and Mandy Insley have gotten treatment and cleaned up their house.\nDavid Insley's attorney Michelle Moodispaw from the Office of the Public Defender said David Insley has struggled with mental health challenges for most of his life and the pandemic and its effects led to a steep decline of mental health. She said letters submitted into evidence show who David Insley is as a father, particularly with Paige.\nLeonard said she didn't think there was a lack of love or care of Paige from David and Mandy Insley, adding, \"I can't explain what was going on in that home.\"\nBefore handing down the sentence, Judge Karen Dean said she was sorry for the Insleys' loss and called the situation \"horrible.\" Dean said it was clear that neglect based on the state of the household and the death of the teen were two separate things. She said the death brought the neglect to light. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Emergency officials offer safety tips for frying turkey\n\n November 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 656\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — There are a few ways to cook a turkey. Deep frying has become a popular, though sometimes treacherous, way to get the job done.Many people like the crispy results deep frying can provide, including Easton Volunteer Fire Department Assistant Chief JR Dobson.\n\"I love deep fried turkey. It is like eating fried chicken. It is always moist in the middle. It tastes pretty good, especially if you season it right,\" Dobson said.\nBut when frying a turkey, especially for the first time, Dobson and other emergency officials warn it's important to research proper safety protocols.\n\"I think they can be dangerous if you don't do your research first,\" Dobson said. \"You don't want to overfill that pot with grease and then the grease comes out of the pot and gets in the flame. We recommend that people who have never done it before, do your research.\"\nGrease fires can happen quickly and are difficult to extinguish, as water cannot be used to put them out.\nAccording to the National Fire Protection Association, Thanksgiving Day is the peak day for fires caused by cooking. About 1,000 home fires occur on that day nationwide.\nOn top of keeping an eye out for splashing grease, those frying turkeys are encouraged to ensure cooking oil doesn't get too hot, fryers are used in outdoor settings away from any structures and turkeys are fully thawed before being dropped in the oil.\n\"Make sure your turkey is thawed out. Make sure not deep frying a turkey inside of your house or inside a shed. Make sure you are outside away from any structure. If there was an event, make sure you are far enough away not to catch your building on fire,\" Dobson said.\nThough it's not his favorite way to cook the bird, Jordon Lloyd, the chef at the Robert Morris Inn, offered some tips for frying turkey.\n\"You have a nice big pot. You want to keep it self-contained like out in a yard. You have kind of a jet propulsion burner is what you need, like what you would steam crabs with. It has a basket inside that you can lift up out of it. It takes about 45 minutes. You don't want the oil to be ripping hot like at 400 degrees. 325 is good. Fry it kind of slow and low,\" Lloyd said.\n\"You can't put stuffing in. It just falls out. Maybe I am not doing it right. Everyone seems to like it, but it just tastes weird to me,\" Lloyd said.\nHe offered his favorite way to cook a turkey.\n\"The best way is to brine it. The classic brine is one gallon of water, one cup of salt, half a cup of sugar. That is your brine. You boil that, and then chill it, and then you let your turkey soak in that,\" Lloyd said. \"... A 12 pound turkey, you leave it overnight for 24 hours. Then I roast in an oven, no basting necessary. The brine is absorbed in the meat, keeps it nice and tender. The sugar you put in the brine activates that gorgeous brown turkey crust. Say 375 for three hours.\"\nThose looking to give frying a turkey a try can find everything they need at local hardware stores.\n\"I sell it all. I have the pot, I have the burner, I have the oil, gloves. We have peanut oil. We sell propane and injectors if you want to put your own seasoning into them. Most of the people that buy know what they are doing and have done it before. But there are some that don't,\" said Mason of Easton Hardware, who did not share his last name.\n\"The bucket of oil pretty much explains it. So many minutes per pound and at such and such a temperature, and you roll on. It is easier than sitting in an oven. Just don't let there be any moisture on the bird before you put it in there. Happy Thanksgiving,\" Mason said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Jury convicts Maryland man of involuntary manslaughter in crossbow killing of girlfriend\n\n November 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1643\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A man who fatally shot his live-in girlfriend with a crossbow inside their Conowingo residence is facing up to 15 years in prison after a Cecil County Circuit Court jury convicted him of two lesser charges at the conclusion of three-day-long murder trial.Jurors deliberated for approximately four hours on Friday, Nov. 22, before finding the defendant — Jeffrey Allen Lander, 41 — guilty of involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment, which carry maximum sentences of 10 years and five years respectively.\nInvoluntary manslaughter applies when the defendant unintentionally kills someone while acting with gross negligence, meaning the defendant should have known the risk of his or her actions. Other elements also can apply under the statute.\nThe jury, however, acquitted Lander of second-degree murder, first-degree assault and second-degree assault. All of those criminal offenses involve an intentional act, to varied degrees. Second-degree murder is punishable by up to 40 years in prison. First-degree assault and second-degree assault carry maximum sentences of 25 years and 10 years respectively.\nLander's sentencing is set for Jan. 28.\nACCIDENTAL OR INTENTIONALProsecutors maintained that Lander intentionally shot 45-year-old Judy Elizabeth Gee in the back with a crossbow arrow inside the couple's residence in the 700 block of Bell Manor Road at approximately 4:40 p.m. on Jan. 14. An ambulance crew transported Gee to Lancaster General Hospital in Lancaster, Pa., where she died on an operating table at 7:13 p.m., about two and half hours later.\nThe defense, however, contended that Lander accidentally shot Gee with the arrow when he tripped seconds after removing his loaded crossbow from a wall rack in the living room while she was seated on a nearby couch, possibly leaning toward an end table to retrieve something.\nAside from Gee, Lander was the only person present when the fatal shooting occurred — and he provided the narrative of the incident to investigators.\nAssistant State's Attorney Robert Sentman asserted in his opening statement and closing arguments that Lander intentionally shot Gee because, during an argument moments earlier, Gee had informed Lander that she was ending their two-year relationship and that she was leaving him.\n\"The safety must be manually moved into the unlocked position,\" Sentman emphasized during his opening statement, telling jurors that a deliberate action must occur before that crossbow owned by Lander can be fired.\nCecil County Sheriff's Office detectives made that same contention on the witness stand and during a recorded police interview with Lander. Those investigators insisted that Lander shot Gee in the \"heat of the moment\" amid the argument and that he immediately experienced regret and emotional aguish, prompting him to call 911.\nAssistant Public Defender Jason Ricke, however, categorized the deadly shooting this way when addressing the jury in his opening statement: \"It was a tragic accident — nothing more. It is not a murder. It is not a crime.\"\nLander elected not to testify in his own defense.\nBut his version of the fatal shooting and the events leading up to it were documented by video gleaned from agency-issued cameras worn by deputies at the shooting scene and by a recording of investigators interviewing Lander at CCSO headquarters on the night of the incident.\nLander's explanation of how the fatal shooting occurred also was recorded on March 14 by detectives during a third-party call — an investigative technique in which police monitor a phone call made to an unwitting suspect by someone the suspect knows.\nDuring that monitored phone call, Lander continued to maintain that the shooting was an accident. Lander, however, denied that he and Gee had been arguing before the shooting — contrasting the information he had given investigators two months earlier on the late afternoon and night of the incident.\nThose recordings were played in the courtroom for the jury during the trial.\nThe defense maintained that Lander never wavered from his explanation — that it was an accidental shooting — but the state contended that he changed minor and even some significant details of his account.\nPolice arrested and charged Lander on June 28, six months after the incident, after an investigation that included consulting with a crossbow expert.\nLANDER'S ACCOUNTLander told investigators that he slept most of the day on Jan. 14 and awoke at about 4 p.m. to an immediate argument with Gee, who was accusing him of \"stealing her stuff.\"\n\"She was kicking me in the knee. It was a rude awakening. I woke up angry,\" Lander told investigators in one of the recordings.\nDuring the dispute, Gee reminded Lander that she was making her own money now and that she was going to leave him.\n\"She was making a move,\" Lander said, before telling investigators, \"I told her, 'Get your (expletive) and go'.\"\nLander maintained that Gee's stated decision to leave did not bother him, telling investigators, \"I'd rather her leave and be happy than stay and be miserable.\"\nAmid that argument or directly after it, Lander decided to go deer hunting, wanting to make use of approximately one hour of remaining daylight.\nAlong those lines, Lander told investigators that he typically would leave the house and take walks in the woods to decompress after confrontations with Gee who, according to Lander, had falsely accused him of cheating on her and of committing other transgressions in the past.\nLander told police that, during deer hunting season, he always kept his crossbow loaded and drawn while stored on a wall mount. \"It's cocked and loaded and ready to go,\" Lander told investigators.\nIn addition, Lander told investigators that he believed the safety on the crossbow was engaged when he pulled the weapon off the wall and turned to maneuver it through a doorway. That is when a pet cat — one of \"12 to 20\" inside that house — cut into his path.\n\"I turned to get through the door and the damn cat tripped me up and the thing (crossbow) went off,\" Lander outlined.\nLander insisted to investigators, \"I did not touch the safety at all. I did not touch the trigger.\"\nHe later theorized to investigators that the cocking rope might have gotten snagged on an object in that cluttered house and caused the crossbow to discharge. Lander also remained adamant that he thought the crossbow's safety was engaged.\n\"I can't describe what happened,\" Lander said, telling investigators that he could explain what caused the crossbow to shoot. \"It's (expletive) up.\"\nHe told police that he immediately called 911, after realizing that the arrow had struck Gee, and then followed the instructions that an emergency dispatcher gave him over the phone while waiting for first responders to arrive.\nTrial testimony indicated that the arrow entered Gee's chest through the side of her upper back and severed her spinal cord, causing instantaneous paralysis, and it lodged inside of her body, with the tip protruding out the front side of her lower chest. The arrow entered Gee's body at a five-degree downward angle.\nA recording of Lander's 911 call was played for jurors. Lander told the dispatcher that he had accidentally shot Gee. Lander cried and uttered exclamations, sounding frantic at times as he urged Gee to remain awake.\nEarly on at the scene, Gee was conscious but not alert, to the point she did not know her name when asked. Experiencing heavy internal bleeding, Gee's condition declined rapidly.\nSUSPECT TIMINGCCSO investigators expressed disbelief that Lander's shooting of Gee was an accident — considering that she had kicked him awake less than one hour before it happened and then accused him of stealing her stuff during an argument in which Gee informed Lander that she was leaving him, ending their two-year-long relationship.\n\"We look at the totality of things,\" one of the CCSO detectives told Lander in recorded police interview, before opining, \"I don't think you're a bad guy. I think you made a mistake in the heat of the moment . . . Because of everything that went on, you snapped.\"\nInvestigators also suggested that, short of that scenario, Lander pointed the crossbow at Gee to scare her and that it discharged.\nLander told investigators that he didn't believe Gee actually was going to leave him. It was Lander's opinion that Gee made that remark only to make him angry and that her effort failed.\nDuring that interview, investigators advised Lander that if he admitted to intentionally shooting Gee, it could mitigate his consequences. They also reminded Lander that Gee could give police an account that might incriminate him. Later in the interview, investigators informed Lander that Gee had died from her wound, causing him to sob. Investigators admittedly withheld news of Gee's death from Lander for a brief period during that interview, as an investigative tactic.\nWhile investigators tried to convince Lander to change his version and admit to intentionally shooting Gee, Lander commented, \"I'm not going to lie about. Lying is not in my (expletive) character . . . My story is not going to change. I did not mean for this to happen. It was not on my agenda.\"\nINCONGRUENT BEHAVIOROn Friday morning, during his closing argument, Ricke listed several things that Lander did and said after the fatal shooting that would be inconsistent with someone who intentionally killed his girlfriend.\nThe list included an emotional Lander calling 911 to report the shooting; positioning himself so close to Gee while urging her to stay awake that Gee's breathing could be heard on the recording of that 911 call; requesting that he be allowed to go to the hospital with Gee; asking investigators for medical updates on Gee during his police interview and breaking down in tears after investigators informed him of Gee's death.\nAddressing one other item on that list, Ricke emphasized that investigators likely would have never known that Lander and Gee had been engaged in argument before the fatal shooting — but for Lander volunteering that information at the outset.\n\"Why did he tell about the argument at all if he is this mastermind? Because he was being honest,\" Ricke asked and answered rhetorically during his closing argument, before stressing to jurors that Lander was telling the whole truth. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Due to a variety of factors including kid's holiday vacation from school and partners' vacation from work, which often \"lends itself to more abusive behaviors.\"\n\"Domestic violence goes up because of the proximity of the abuser and victim in the home due to being off work during the holidays, but the victims are waiting until after the holidays to seek services, and that's what our data shows, and has shown for many years,\" Yeager said.\nAccording to Yeager, calls to the Mid-Shore Hotline show a dip in services during the holiday season and picks up immediately following the holidays. Yeager said it's important to understand that victims often stay longer in abusive relationships due to factors prioritized over their own well-being, mainly children and financial stability.\nYeager said leaving an abusive relationship is difficult and dangerous, which is why Mid-Shore provides crisis housing, legal assistance including help with protective orders, divorce and child custody, financial support and assistance in finding employment, child care and other long-term self-sufficiency resources.\nBut sometimes the most difficult factors have to do with putting others' feelings over their own.\n\"Christmas is a lot about the kids, and (survivors) don't want to disrupt the Christmas routine for the kids,\" Yeager said. \"I think from a victim perspective, that's where they're coming from, not thinking of self. I think they're thinking of their kids and saying, 'Every year we do this, and I'm just going to put up with it so the kids can get through the holidays and then I'll leave.'\"\nAlthough the holidays are a time of potential harm for survivors of domestic abuse, they also bring risk of new harm to vulnerable communities regardless of age.\nHoliday gatherings with family, friends, and coworkers can elevate the risk of harassment or sexual assault. According to a study by the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, 93% of children who suffer sexual abuse are familiar with their perpetrator and 34% are abused by a family member.\nKirsty Mirando, director of the Rape Crisis Center at For All Seasons, said not only can abuse survivors be triggered by past trauma but the likelihood of new abuse increases.\n\"During the holiday season, incidents of sexual assault and child sexual abuse may occur more frequently,\" Mirando said. \"The increased time spent with immediate and extended family, heightened emotions and potential alcohol consumption can create vulnerable situations for those at risk of abuse.\"\nLesa Mulcahy, chief clinical officer for For All Seasons, said she encourages survivors of abuse and parents to create a plan for the holidays that includes identifying potential triggers or stressful situations and having coping mechanisms ready, such as taking breaks, setting boundaries or having a \"mental health first aid kit\" with comforting items.\nAdditionally, Mulcahy said it's important to collaborate with supportive family members and friends to work together to make the holidays more manageable and create a positive experience for everyone.\nKatie Theeke, vice president of marketing and communication at For All Seasons, said that while abuse is not a topic that is easy to talk about, it's something that everyone can work on preventing. If people identify as part of a support network for survivors it is important for them to step up and provide care for the people in need.\n\"I think the most important thing we can do as we approach the holidays and regard to survivors of sexual assault and abuse is just to be supportive, to be a good listener, and to always approach every conversation without judgment,\" Theeke said. \"And we don't always have to have the perfect words to help them through what they're going through if they share something with us, but that we just have to make sure they know that we believe them and that we're there to support them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Rust Jr. Kent County Emergency Medical Services headquarters at 104 Vickers Drive. The site was dedicated to the public servant for his vision almost 30 years ago.Rust, as well as Director of Emergency Services Pete Landon, Chief of Emergency Services Logan Quinn, Kent County Commission President Ron Fithian, Commissioners John Price and Albert Nickerson and County Administrator Shelley Heller tossed out the first shovelfuls of dirt as community members applauded.\nRust reflected on the past, his son, Danny, at his side. Rust said he would have never imagined this building being named after him when he first proposed an idea for a 24-7 Advanced Life System (ALS) to then, Sheriff John Price.\nFithian pointed out that in 1994, Rust approached the County with an idea to pay EMT's to assist with the volunteers.\nAt the time, the County only had one paramedic, part time, and that was deputy John Longest, Fithian said.\nPrice added, \"It was Mr. Rust who started the conversation and the reason the program has grown to this degree.\"\nRust was director of emergency services management in Kent from Oct. 24, 1983 to April 12, 2005, a county employee, a dedicated volunteer and Chief of Kent and Queen Anne's Rescue Squad for 11 consecutive years.\nAccording to Director of Public Works Dan Mattson, they can expect the building project to be finished late spring of next year and will begin moving dirt shortly.\nHeller noted how fast the project has moved since it was introduced at the commissioners meeting in early September.\n\"It has defied the laws of government,\" she said, crediting the Department of Public Works and the Department of Emergency Services on an effective collaborative effort.\nQuinn noted the importance of the site. He said the property is not just a headquarters, but a second home for his crew. Quinn expressed gratitude for all the repairs the County made to preserve the current headquarters in Lynch, but stated it was clear they could not stay in that place longterm.\nThe new site will enable them to expand their programs, Quinn remarked. A place where ideas will be posed and where they can grow as a community.\nLandon told the audience consisting of policemen, EMT's, county employees and concerned citizens, that this is not as much of a groundbreaking ceremony as it is a gathering, of past, present and future.\nThe new building will be designed and constructed by Industrial Engineering Incorporated and will roughly cost $628,000.\nQuinn honored Rust as well as those who followed him.\n\"They were trailblazers of the past, and with this building, myself and others can be trailblazers of the future.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County looking to make security upgrades at courthouse\n\n December 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 481\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Upgraded security measures may soon be installed at the Caroline County Courthouse in Denton.On Nov. 26, the Caroline County Commissioners approved sending out an application letter for state funding to install 16 new bulletproof windows.\nCircuit Court Administrative Judge Heather Price brought the proposed security upgrades to the commissioners at the county's most recent public meeting. She indicated a review from the state noted window and front door security as weak points for the courthouse.\nAs originally presented, if awarded, the county would receive $118,724 from the state to make the improvements to the windows and door. Price's ask was that the commissioners approve a memorandum of understanding between the county court and the county commission.\n\"This is a reimbursably-based grant,\" Price said. \"So the commissioners would hopefully agree to front the money and then be reimbursed for that by the state. We're not guaranteed that we'll be picked for this.\"\nDuring the meeting, Price said she has received death threats due to her job, including multiple that resulted in the person making threats serving jail time.\nWhile the commissioners were on board to apply for funding for the new windows, they did not motion for the Circuit Court to apply for funding for a new door.\nCommission Vice President Larry Porter raised concerns about removing the current door. He emphasized the historical nature of it and said he could foresee the Caroline County Historical Society having similar worries.\nPrice said she had \"anticipated that concern\" and already talked to Kathy Mackel of the Historical Society. Price said Mackel was agreeable to the request for new door funding \"on the basis that we would save the old, historic door that could be reinstalled if the secure door was no longer necessary.\"\nCommissioner Frank Bartz, however, felt if the door was removed and stored, it could become lost or forgotten.\n\"If you take the door out (and) say 'Hey, we're going to save it, we're going to put it back,' it gets stuck in a corner somewhere,\" Bartz said. \"Twenty years from now, 'Where'd this door come from?'\"\nPorter said the photos he's seen of the potential door replacement aren't up to historical standards, likening one photo from a door quote to a Dollar General entrance. Commissioners asked that Price and the county go back and search for door replacements that fit within the courthouse's nature, even if they are more expensive than anticipated.\n\"I'm not saying that I won't support improving the safety of the door, but not with what the design that I've seen so far,\" Porter said. \"It's got to comply more with the historic character of the building.\"\nCommission President Travis Breeding agreed with his fellow commissioners, saying it's best to go \"back to the drawing board\" with the potential door replacement. Commissioners unanimously voted to approve funding 16 new windows with the potential of receiving money from the state's courthouse security application, which closed Dec. 3. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mid-Shore organization pioneers a 'hub' of resources for victims of domestic violence\n\n December 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 557\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — For more than four decades, the Mid-Shore Council on Family Violence has been at the forefront of advocating for victims on the Mid-Shore. With a new program, the organization is now planning to assist far beyond.The nonprofit for victims of domestic violence has taken steps to advance resource access for clients using the Geographic Information System program, a mapping dashboard providing a free one-stop shop for essential resources for victims.\nJeanne Yeager, executive director for Mid-Shore Council on Family Violence, said rural clients face various barriers to receiving care. During the pandemic the barriers to care were more apparent and Mid-Shore Council sought to find alternative solutions to helping their clients.\nThis initiative, she said, revolutionizes the way domestic violence victims access vital resources.\n\"I was really mindful of coming out of COVID, because everything we did at Mid-Shore was very one-on-one, personalized — our case management, our meetings, our support groups, everything — and we would say, 'Oh, well, we'll do an online group sometime.' Well, 'that sometime' became tomorrow,\" Yeager said. \"So it normalized using technology, and I think there's no turning back.\"\nThe barriers faced by victims in rural communities include limited employment opportunities, spotty cell service, transportation, lack of affordable housing, and social and geographic isolation.\nThe GIS program operates with a holistic Chesapeake Crisis-to-Self-Sufficiency model, providing comprehensive services and case management from crisis through transition to self-sufficiency.\nAccording to Yeager, the program initially focused on mapping out housing resources in five counties in Maryland. The data team began working with case managers and staff to compile a list of resources that clients frequently inquire about, such as childcare and pet care.\nFrom there it continued to expand.\nKazeem Anifowoshe, GIS senior data analyst, said the project went from the initial five counties to nine counties, and the team decided to create a website as a \"hub\" for the project. Now, this hub is used by 25 agencies and has expanded resources to include nearby pro bono and legal services across Maryland through a partnership with the Access to Justice organization.\n\"When people kind of think of victim services, there's kind of like a formula that a lot of people have been doing for 20 to 40 plus years at their organization that works for them,\" Anifowoshe said. \"But again, we're just trying to make things easier the best way we know how, by mapping things.\"\nAccording to Yeager, the GIS program has been earning notable recognition, such as the prestigious Domestic Shelters Purple Ribbon Award.\nThe organization's GIS Hub integrates data from various sources, including popular rental property platforms/affordable housing, childcare resources, medical facilities, grocery stores, law enforcement agencies, court houses and local social service organizations.\nPamela Caudill Jordan, program evaluator for the GIS Hub, said she hopes to encourage other organizations to adopt a comprehensive model where the focus is not just on crisis intervention but on helping survivors achieve long-term stability and self-sufficiency. For Caudill Jordan, having access to tools such as the GIS Hub can make the work of advocates for victims easier and more efficient.\nAccording to Yeager and Anifowoshe, the goal is to get the GIS Hub more widely adopted and used by other organizations, going beyond Maryland and, hopefully, one day nationwide.\n\"We know what victims need,\" Yeager said. \"We ought to work with victims, and we're making this available. Let's see where we're going with it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Glen Burnie man sentenced for role in Eastern Shore Hospital Center escape\n\n December 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Crime \n \n 633\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — A Glen Burnie man will serve 12 years for helping a patient escape the Eastern Shore Hospital Center in August 2023.Israel Labastida Jr., 20, was sentenced Friday to 25 years, with all but eight years suspended, for first-degree assault, followed by 10 years, with all but five years suspended, for use of a firearm during a felony or violent crime. Labastida was also sentenced to five years for first-degree conspiracy to escape, with all of those years suspended.\nLabastida will get credit for one year of time served.\nHe will serve five years of supervised probation following his release from prison. Conditions of probation include that he must receive a mental health evaluation and seek treatment, receive a substance abuse and alcohol evaluation and seek related treatment, abstain from alcohol and illegal drugs, stay away from the Eastern Shore Hospital Center, and not contact Darrin Jeter, 20, who was also involved in the incident.\nBefore Dean handed down the sentence, Leonard recommended Labastida be sentenced to five years without parole followed by five years of probation. Dean said she was \"taken aback\" by the state's \"lenient\" sentencing recommendation.\nShe said that although she feels for Labastida's family and the pain they have been going through, she also feels for the people that were at the psychiatric facility on the day of the escape.\nIn June, Labastida pleaded guilty to the three charges. The charges stem from Jeter's escape from the psychiatric facility located on Woods Road in Cambridge last year. At that time, Jeter, who has schizophrenia, had been committed to the hospital center.\nAt the June plea hearings for both Labastida and Jeter, Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard said Labastida approached the facility on Aug. 1, 2023 and shot into a window several times. She said Labastida and Jeter kicked out the broken window so Jeter could exit the building. The two fled the area in a black vehicle.\nJeter was located by the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office the following day. Leonard said Labastida was identified as a suspect through investigation. Evidence of an escape plan between the two was discovered through investigation, Leonard said at Jeter's hearing.\nJeter was sentenced to 10 years in prison for first-degree escape with eight of those years suspended.\nDuring Labastida's sentencing hearing Friday, defense attorney Marvin Ochoa said Labastida is sorry for his actions and is ashamed and embarrassed. He said when Labastida was in middle school, he withdrew from his family and started hanging out with the \"wrong\" crew, making bad decisions.\nOchoa said that when Labastida helped with the escape, his brain wasn't fully developed and didn't realize the consequences of his actions, including the \"pain and suffering\" it would cause his family.\nBefore showing the certificates Labastida was awarded for classes he took in jail, Ochoa said Labastida has \"a lot to give to this world\" and he just needs guidance and support.\nLabastida told Judge Karen Dean that there was no reason for him to do what he did on Aug. 1 2023, but there is also no reason for his life to be \"stunted.\" He said he believes he can be a productive member of society.\nLabastida's family also spoke at the hearing Friday, sharing the toll this incident has taken on their family. His mother Patricia Sanchez said her son \"has learned a lesson.\" She said that she never imagined she would see one of her children standing in front of a judge like this.\n\"We should (have been) getting ready to go to a graduation or something else,\" Sanchez said, \"not to this.\"\nLabastida's older brother, Nicholas Sanchez, said that Labastida is a hard worker and that with the right guidance, he can become a productive member of society.\nThe victim of Labastida's assault charge was not present at the hearing and did not wish to make an impact statement. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Jury acquits man of all charges in fatal shooting\n\n December 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton and Lilly Howard cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 978\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Donald Raymond Snyder Jr. pulled a 9mm handgun from his waistband in the driveway of his Elkton-area residence at approximately 9:20 p.m. on June 17 and, from close range, he fired two shots into the upper torso of his friend, Christopher Cimorose, who was in the driver's seat of a red Nissan Versa.Snyder, 41, and his defense lawyers maintained during the two-day-long trial this week that he shot Cimorose — killing him — in self-defense because Cimorose, 55, had threatened, \"I'm going to kill you, (expletive),\" while a \"metal pipe\" was resting on his lap.\nThe prosecution, however, contended that Snyder gunned down Cimorose \"in cold blood\" because Snyder's 41-year-old girlfriend, Michelle McCarthy, was ending their relationship and that Cimorose — her former boyfriend — had come to Snyder's residence to pick her up at McCarthy's request.\nOn Thursday morning, the jury acquitted Snyder of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and the eight related charges after about four hours of deliberations.\nAs the forelady announced the not guilty verdicts, Snyder lowered his head and appeared emotional while standing beside his Timonium-based lawyer, Joshua Insley, at the defense table. Then they embraced for several seconds. Bruce Saller, who wasn't present, served as Insley's co-counsel at trial.\nSnyder, who reiterated his self-defense account on the witness stand, was released from the Cecil County Detention Center on Thursday after his acquittal, court records indicate. Snyder had been incarcerated on no bond since his June 20 arrest.\nMaryland State Police investigators elected not to charge Snyder after interviewing him in the hours after the shooting because they lacked probable cause and they let him go home.\nBut on June 20, after viewing security-camera footage of the incident in the drivefway of Snyder's Locust Point Road residence, south of Elkton, and re-interviewing the sole eyewitness, McCarthy, detectives charged him with murder and other offenses.\nThe pertinent part of that video was played for jurors.\n\"Thirteen seconds, in real time, you are going to see the intentional, premeditated killing of Mr. Cimorose,\" Cecil County State's Attorney James Dellmyer told jurors Wednesday during his closing argument. \"This is evidence of first-degree murder. Chris (Cimorose) didn't stand a chance. That gun was on him before he got out of the car.\"\nThe footage starts with Snyder \"briskly walking up\" to the driver's side door and punching Cimorose in the face, according to Dellmyer, who prosecuted the case with Deputy State's Attorney Patricia Fitzgerald. State evidence included a photo of Snyder's right hand, which showed bruising on his knuckles, and a picture of an abrasion on Cimorose's forehead.\nAfter the car lurches forward a few feet, Snyder pulls the handgun as he walks forward to the driver's side door, gets into a shooting stance and rapidly fires three shots at Cimorose, including one errant round, Dellmyer reviewed.\nA person cannot be the aggressor and then claim self-defense, Dellmyer said. The video doesn't show Cimorose swinging the object or advancing, nor does it show Snyder retreating because of a perceived threat, he added.\n\"You cannot start a fistfight and then shoot someone to death,\" Dellmyer stressed, before asking, \"Is it reasonable to use deadly force?\"\nMcCarthy testified that Snyder hurled her cell phone, cracking the front, during a heated argument between the two shortly earlier that day and then alleged that Snyder, in anger, had broken five other cell phones of hers that year.\nMcCarthy told Snyder that she was leaving him during that dispute.\n\"I said, 'That's it. I'm done with you . . . I packed all my stuff in the car,\" McCarthy said.\nBut McCarthy could not legally drive her packed car because it lacked valid license plates — so she called Cimorose for a ride.\nMcCarthy testified that she was in the front passenger's seat of Cimorose's car when Snyder wordlessly sucker-punched Cimorose in the face and swiftly fired three shots. \"I saw the punch. I saw everything,\" she said.\nInsley, however, maintained that McCarthy wasn't a credible witness.\nThe defense lawyer proffered that the footage shows McCarthy outside Cimorose's car during the incident. Seconds earlier, McCarthy and Snyder had been inside her vehicle waiting for Cimorose to arrive.\nInsley also reminded jurors that McCarthy admittedly never mentioned Snyder throwing a punch during her first interview with investigators. \"I was covering a little bit for my boyfriend,\" McCarthy confessed on the witness stand.\nGuilt prompted McCarthy to contact police on June 19 and set up a second interview, in which she told investigators that Snyder punched Cimorose without provocation before the shooting, she testified. McCarthy testified that she and Cimorose were no longer romantically involved.\nWhen Insley asked McCarthy if she had asked the prosecution to dismiss two drug cases against her in exchange for her cooperation, she combatively responded, \"Drugs has nothing to to do with this case.\"\nAlso during Insley's cross-examination, McCarthy confirmed that Cimorose was on probation in a criminal case for strangling her.\nInsley reminded the jury during his closing argument Thursday that the autopsy report showed that Cimorose had methadone, cocaine and fentanyl and other drugs in his system at the time of his death.\n\"Ever smoke crack before,\" Ingsley rhetorically asked the jury, before remarking, \"I heard it makes you pretty wacky.\"\nThe defense also took exception to the state's interpretation of what the shadowy footage showed. The state contended that Snyder lunged forward and punched Cimorose, but Insley insisted that a thrown punch is not visible in the video.\nAs for the object Cimorose purportedly possessed, Insley accused investigators of \"sugar-coating\" by using words like stick, pole and a table leg to describe it, so it wouldn't be associated with a weapon. Insley referred to the object as a club. It looked like a wooden cane with a section of metal where the handle should have been.\nSnyder called 911; identified himself as the shooter; told the dispatcher he acted in self-defense and turned himself in after learning about the charges against him — all actions of an innocent man, according to Insley. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He lived in Honolulu, Hawaii, until recently.\nMangione, a high school valedictorian from the Gilman School in Baltimore, earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer science in 2020 from the University of Pennsylvania, a spokesman told The Associated Press on Monday.\nHe had learned to code in high school and helped start a club at Penn for people interested in gaming and game design, according to a 2018 story in Penn Today, a campus publication.\nHis posts suggest that he belonged to the fraternity Phi Kappa Psi. They also show him taking part in a 2019 program at Stanford University, and in photos with family and friends in Hawaii, San Diego, Puerto Rico, the New Jersey shore and other destinations.\nHe is a scion of a prominent Baltimore-area family whose interests reach from development to politics and civic life.\nIn his valedictory speech at Gilman School, he praised the school for instilling in him the \"incredible courage to explore the unknown and try new things,\" according to an excerpt from his speech on the school website. That same year, Mangione was featured in a Baltimore Fishbowl article spotlighting local valedictorians, where he outlined his ambition to study artificial intelligence.\nThe headmaster of Gilman School issued a statement Monday, calling the revelation \"deeply distressing.\"\n\"We recently became aware that the person arrested in connection with the killing of the United Healthcare CEO is a Gilman alumnus, Luigi Mangione, Class of 2016,\" Henry P.A. Smyth said. \"This is deeply distressing news on top of an already awful situation. Our hearts go out to everyone affected.\"\nMangione had writings that appeared to be critical of the health insurance industry, a law enforcement official told the Associated Press.\nHe had a gun thought to be similar to the one used in the killing, the official said. Along with the gun, police found a silencer and fake IDs, according to the official.\nPolice apprehended Mangione after receiving a tip that he had been spotted at a McDonald's near Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 233 miles west of New York City, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss details of the investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\nHis late grandfather, Nicholas Mangione Sr., was a self-made real estate developer who owned country clubs, nursing homes and a radio station. And his grandmother Mary, who died in 2023 from Parkinson's disease, was described in an obituary as a hospital benefactor and a music patron.\nThey purchased Turf Valley Country Club in 1978, establishing it as a golf course resort and residential community, and later Hayfields Country Club in 1986.\nFamily businesses also include the Lorien Health Services nursing homes and radio station WCBM-AM. Mary Mangione was a supporter of the Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore, Greater Baltimore Medical Center, the old Baltimore Opera Company and the Walters Art Museum, eventually becoming a Walters trustee. Del. Nino Mangione, a Baltimore County Republican, is a cousin, his office confirmed to WBAL.\nThompson, 50, was killed last Wednesday in what police said was a \"brazen, targeted\" attack as he walked alone to the Hilton from a nearby hotel, where UnitedHealthcare's parent company, UnitedHealth Group, was holding its annual investor conference, police said.\nThe shooter appeared to be \"lying in wait for several minutes\" before approaching the executive from behind and opening fire, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. He used a 9 mm pistol that police said resembled the guns farmers use to put down animals without causing a loud noise.\nIn the days since the shooting, police turned to the public for help by releasing a collection of photos and video — including footage of the attack, as well as images of the suspect at a Starbucks beforehand.\nPhotos taken in the lobby of a hostel on Manhattan's Upper West Side showed the suspect grinning after removing his mask, police said.\nAmmunition found near Thompson's body bore the words \"delay,\" \"deny\" and \"depose,\" mimicking a phrase used by insurance industry critics.\nMonday's development came as dogs and divers returned to New York's Central Park while the dragnet for Thompson's killer stretched into a sixth day.\nInvestigators have been combing the park since the Wednesday shooting and have been searching at least one of its ponds for three days, looking for evidence that may have been thrown into it.\nOn Friday, police found a backpack in the park that they say the killer discarded as he fled from the crime scene to an uptown bus station, where they believe he left the city on a bus.\nOn Monday, K-9 units sniffed leaf-covered planters between walking paths in Central Park near where police found the shooter's backpack. Farther along the path that police believe the suspect took through the park after the shooting, scuba divers geared up and began searching a pond for the third straight day.\nRetracing the gunman's steps using surveillance video, investigators say the shooter fled into Central Park on a bicycle, emerged from park without his backpack and then ditched the bicycle.\nHe then walked a couple blocks and got into a taxi, arriving at at the George Washington Bridge Bus Station, which is near the northern tip of Manhattan and offers commuter service to New Jersey and Greyhound routes to Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, D.C., NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said.\nThe FBI announced late Friday that it was offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction, adding to a reward of up to $10,000 that the NYPD has offered. Police say they believe the suspect acted alone.\nLate Saturday, police released two additional photos of the suspect that appeared to be from a camera mounted inside a taxi. The first shows him outside the vehicle and the second shows him looking through the partition between the back seat and the front of the cab. In both, his face is partially obscured by a blue mask.\nThrough the park search, the NYPD has taken steps to minimize disruption to visitors, leading to an odd juxtaposition of joggers, tourists and an active crime scene.\nOn Monday, a small section of the park was cordoned off with blue and white police tape, giving divers an area to change and enter the water.\nAt one point, a group of about 30 French-speaking tourists followed a guide down a path, but they couldn't go any farther because of the police tape. Before turning back, many of them whipped out their phones to snap photos of the diver crew. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Ground broken for state-of-the-art first responder training facility in Easton\n\n December 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 649\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — First responders, along with local and state officials, broke ground Monday on a state-of-the-art emergency services training facility in Easton.The A. James Clark Emergency Services Training Campus is being constructed on Mistletoe Drive. The 7,200-square-foot facility is intended to allow for cross-training between emergency responders and reduce long commutes for first responders in training.\nBrett Whitehead, president of the Friends of Easton Volunteer Fire Department, co-led the fundraising campaign for the facility with his partner, Ed Forte. Whitehead said on Monday that the campus will be in a world of its own as far as allowing firefighters, police officers, EMS workers and others to train together.\n\"There's no place that I know of … in the Mid-Shore where three of the legs, if you will, of emergency services can practice together,\" Whitehead said.\nThe closest training facilities are in Princess Anne and Centreville, Whitehead noted. Whitehead believes the Easton facility can be the premier cross-training facility in the region.\n\"We want to be the Taj Mahal,\" he said. \"We want to be the mecca of education for all emergency services as it relates to what we do.\"\nThe campus will have a public safety building and an educational building with classrooms, as well as a 1,500-square-foot concrete pad for car fire and extrication training. Hostage rescues, ladder climbs and traffic safety situations are other ways in which the facilities will be used.\nLeaders from across public safety agencies attended Monday's groundbreaking, including Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble, Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey and Talbot County Director of Emergency Services Brian LeCates.\nLeCates said the facility will be a \"more professional setting\" for collaborating and training to take place. That setting could end up saving lives, he said.\n\"We all know that every second counts,\" LeCates said. \"In real emergencies, lives are at stake, and the difference between success and failure often comes to how we train before the disaster occurs.\"\n\"At least 90% of the calls that we go on involve all three groups,\" Whitehead said. \" … It allows us to all hone our skills together. And that's the magic of what we're trying to get done. Hopefully in 12 months, we'll have this facility built.\"\nFUNDRAISINGThus far, around $4 million of the $5 million goal has been raised for the A. James Clark Emergency Services Training Campus.\nAs the name indicates, the A. James & Alice B. Clark Foundation and its Board Chair Courtney Clark Pastrick were fundamental in that fundraising success. Last September, the foundation gave $1 million to the fundraising efforts for the training campus. In total, the foundation has contributed $1.9 million to the project.\n\"I don't think I've ever encountered someone as professional and, as my wife reminds me, gracious, as Courtney Clark Pastrick,\" Whitehead said.\nClark Pastrick said she knew the project was a \"perfect fit,\" something her late father, A. James Clark, would be immensely proud of. She thanked all the community members and sponsors who donated to the project in tandem with the foundation.\nSen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said the state House and Senate chambers each contributed $150,000 to the project, a charge led by Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio, a former Republican legislator and Department of Natural Resources secretary.\nFormer Easton Mayor Bob Willey attended the groundbreaking event, adorned with his fellow firefighters in Easton Volunteer Fire Department gear. Mautz, Whitehead and Mayor Megan Cook each thanked Willey for having the original vision to bring a project like this to life.\n\"This is going to go so far as to improving our fire service, but most importantly, to make it safer, so more people will join the fire service,\" Mautz said.\n\"And it is no surprise to me that our very own 62-year veteran of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, Mayor Willey, was the one who sparked this idea. Mayor Willey, we owe you an incredible debt of gratitude,\" he said.\nThis report has been updated to correct the name of the training facility. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gallatin County Sheriff's Office welcomes public to tour new building at Four Corners\n\n December 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Laurenz Busch Chronicle Staff Writer | Section: News \n \n 623\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Sheriff Dan Springer hosted a public tour of the new Gallatin County Sheriff's Office building in Four Corners on Wednesday, formally ushering in the next step in modernizing county law enforcement.Having moved in over the summer, the 25,000-square-foot building offers expanded office and training space and a more strategic location to respond to calls for service.\nThe building, off Laura Louise Lane near Jackrabbit Lane, has three shooting ranges, space for patrol units, detectives, and the Missouri River Drug Task Force. It is a welcomed development that has been in the works since 2020.\nSpringer said the location is ideal as most of his office's calls for service are within a nine-mile radius. It also prevents deputies from having to navigate traffic along 19th Avenue and Huffine Lane, as was the case with the old location at the Gallatin County Detention Center.\n\"Seventy percent of our calls occurring within that radius is pretty significant,\" Springer said. \"Getting our calls from here has been excellent and puts us right to where we need to be.\"\nOn Wednesday, Springer welcomed the public in the main conference room as fireplaces crackled on dual TVs, and cookies and coffee were provided. He then gave a tour of the facility, which the county purchased for $5.4 million in 2020. Springer described it as relatively affordable, considering the building's sheer size and the site's 6.48 acres.\n\"There wasn't enough money to build a facility, which had been the plan to build our Sheriff's Office up by the jail,\" Springer said. \"Since we couldn't do that, there wasn't that kind of money available, so we ended up remodeling this to make it more fiscally responsible.\"\nNewly appointed county auditor Jill Therrien was along for the tour, and county CFO Justine Swanson was seen later.\nThe first stop was in the hallway past the main entrance waiting area, where a dedication to deputies lost in the line of service hung from the wall. Over some 160 years, the Gallatin County Sheriff's Office has lost five deputies, the most recent being Jake Allmendinger in 2019 due to an accident with his patrol vehicle.\nIn May, a stretch of Bridger Canyon Road, near where Allmendinger's accident occurred, was dedicated to the deputy.\nBefore that, two deputies were killed in 1917 as they went to look for a suspect who had allegedly shot a farmer, a Sheriff's Office chaplain told the tour group.\nBeyond desk space, such as in the large gold and blue room where county detectives are based, the facility offers the three shooting ranges, one of 100 yards.\nSpringer said the ranges can handle up to a .50-caliber rifle, although the Chronicle was not provided a demonstration.\n\"We do most of our training here, this is by far the most active bay,\" Springer said while showing the 25-yard range. \"You can do movements and cover and all that type of stuff but the only thing I would do differently is try and figure out a way to get a car down here (to train with).\"\nThe facility was previously a private gun range, Springer said, hence the three ranges, and although it provides deputies with shooting practice, more space is needed for comprehensive training.\n\"We train a lot in shooting, but when you look at the big picture, it's (mostly) traffic stops and domestic responses,\" Springer said. \"(Ranges were) the bonus to the facility. The primary objective when we purchased this was the fact that it's 6.48 acres, in the middle of Four Corners, which is where we're growing and where our primary routes are.\"\nBeyond the building's gold and black exterior, a new search and rescue building remains under construction across the street. Springer also keeps his eyes on a future training facility, as a county law enforcement and emergency response campus slowly emerges. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Since the Covid pandemic, the increased need has been steadily rising, but this year the need has grown at an unsettling rate,\" said Laurie Loveless of Good Neighbor Fund in a November press release.\n\"Both organizations have observed a significant increase in demand for outreach services over the last three years, with the average amount spent from 2022-2023 doubling from the average spent in 2019-2021. The Samaritan Group annual budget dedicated a little over $35,000 for outreach services in 2024 and as of the end of September over $40,000 has been spent to support community members. The Good Neighbor Fund spent $31,665 in 2023 and spent over $40,000 so far in 2024.\"\n\"Combined, over $80,000 was spent so far this year between the Samaritan Group and the Good Neighbor Fund helping over 200 households in Kent County with 247 adults and 166 children.\"\nUnfortunately these two organizations have exhausted their funds.\nWith three months left in the year, 2024 surpassed the budgeted dollars for the \"outreach services\" that are provided by the Samaritan Group of Kent County and Good Neighbor Fund. Both were forced to temporarily suspend their outreach until more funds can be raised.\nDiggs said, \"An assessment that seeks to better understand our community's need for low-income housing, short-term financial assistance, permanent supportive housing for senior and differently abled community members, and other solutions for people who are unhoused, is the necessary next step for homelessness action in Kent County.\"\nBut, Diggs, doing this ministry and work for as long as he has, knows the homeless are as varied as any other resident, each situation requiring a variety of different services a shelter does not always address.\nFor the ones who need the cold weather shelter, they welcome them with wide open arms. Often times the police have brought people to the shelter, entrusting them to their care, Diggs noted.\nThe January shelter will be located at the Chestertown Church of the Nazarene. In February, the shelter will be at First United Methodist Church. It will be at the Presbyterian Church of Chestertown in March.\nStarting in January, those who need it get a home-cooked meal around 6 p.m., a place to shower, clean sheets, a bed, and all-night supervision by paid overnight staff and one sleeper (a person on-site in case of any emergencies).\nAt 8 a.m., they awake and are given a breakfast and a lunch to-go. In those morning hours they are encouraged to go to the various warming stations in town like the Kent County Public Library. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the nonprofit, reasons a child might be under court protection include abuse, neglect and abandonment.\nThose advocates are tasked with identifying a child's needs and advocating for the necessary services so their needs can be met. CASAs share their recommendations with the judge assigned to that child's case.\nCASA of the Mid-Shore Executive Director Robin Davenport said the work that the organization's volunteers do is \"heroic.\"\n\"In a nutshell, we're saying, 'Be a sponge,'\" she said about a CASA's role. \"Just go around and soak up every bit of information you can about the child. Wring the sponge out. Figure out what is important for us to be paying attention to and bringing to the court's attention.\"\nThough it can be considered rewarding, the volunteer gig — open to residents who are at least 21 years old — is a commitment.\nFollowing a lengthy application process and in-depth interview, those interested in volunteering with CASA of the Mid-Shore must complete eight training sessions. Once those trainings are complete and the volunteers have been sworn into the courthouses as officers of the court, they are assigned to a case.\nGenerally, CASAs are assigned to one case at a time. The length of a case can vary. And although the children are from one of the four counties served by CASA of the Mid-Shore, a lot of the time they are living in placements outside the four counties, Davenport said.\nCrawford said the decision to become a CASA volunteer isn't always an easy one to make.\n\"Once people learn about the program and what's required, sometimes they need to think about it too because of that commitment,\" she said.\nJanet Healy, a Talbot County resident, has been a CASA volunteer since 2008. After a career as an educator, Healy wanted to find a volunteer opportunity where she could work with kids in a less \"intensive\" way, she said.\n\"And it just seemed like the right fit,\" she said about volunteering with CASA of the Mid-Shore.\nFor Healy, one of the most rewarding aspects of the job is building relationships.\n\"(Building relationships) with kids, with foster parents, with social workers,\" she said, later adding, \"It's hard when things don't work out the way you think they should, but it's also, on the other hand, very rewarding.\"\nHealy said one adoptive mother still sends her photos of the sibling group that she was a CASA for about four years ago.\n\"That's very rewarding to get some of that feedback,\" she said. \"To see how well some of these kids are doing.\"\nBut there are challenging aspects of the job, too. Davenport said it's important for CASAs to take things slow and be consistent when building relationships with the children. She said they tell volunteers not to take things personally.\nA child might be dealing with trauma, she said, \"and so there are a lot of things that we have to just keep track of and measure things in very small victories.\"\nHealy said making recommendations to judges is a big responsibility. She said taking on the role of a CASA means becoming invested and emotionally involved.\n\"Because you do get very invested in these kids, but you know it really is temporary,\" she said. \"You have to keep that in the back of your mind all the time.\"\nBECOMING TOUCHSTONESCASA of the Mid-Shore is celebrating 35 years of service in 2025. Davenport has been there since the beginning. She has seen the organization grow not only in staff, but in the number of counties it serves.\n\"It was a very tiny, tiny organization,\" she said about the nonprofit's start. \"We, at that point, were only Talbot County.\"\nOn May 17, the nonprofit will host a special fundraiser called \"Voices of Hope.\" The celebration is, in part, to celebrate CASA of the Mid-Shore's successful 35 years and kick off its next 35.\nDavenport said that over the years, she's seen CASAs become \"incredible touchstones\" for the children they advocate for.\n\"The CASA volunteers end up kind of being the one consistent adult in these children's lives,\" she said. \"Foster care is not a short turnaround usually. So it's been really exciting for us to see that the CASAs themselves are not only helping the judge, but they're actually really giving messages to the children that stick with them for years.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In January 2020 (just before the pandemic), Maryland's homeless county totaled 4,430 persons. That's a 37% increase since 2020.\nIn Delaware, there were 1,358 homeless persons counted statewide in HUD's 2024 report. In 2020, there were 1,165 homeless persons counted in Delaware. That translates into a 16.6 % increase since 2020\nPost-pandemic waves of migrants into the U.S. along with higher costs and behavioral and mental health crises during and since COVID have also contributed to the rise.\nIn 2019, HUD estimated New York's homeless population at 42,113. In 2024, that figure is 158,019. The Empire State's homeless population grew by 115,906 since before COVID and 54,819 since 2023.\nThe record counts alarm advocates and groups looking to address homelessness in the U.S.\n\"The answer to ending homelessness is ensuring everyone has access to safe, stable, and affordable housing. Our leaders must immediately expand the resources to rehouse people without homes and assist the rapidly growing number of people who cannot afford skyrocketing rents,\" said Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. \"This record-setting increase in homelessness should sound the alarm for federal, state, and local lawmakers to advance evidence-based solutions to this crisis.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This U.S. investment has strategic implications for U.S.-China economic competition.\nAnother example is the sale of excess border wall materials that was required by Congress in 2023 (The Texas Tribune, Dec. 20, 2024). Most of that material was given to the Customs and Border Protection and to the states of Texas and California. The material that is being auctioned off is mostly junk and not worth the cost of shipping, according to a Texas official.\nThen there's Ukraine where Russia launched an invasion in 2022 to try to claim the land. Russia, under Putin, is a bad actor, and it seems clearly in U.S. interests to prevent Russia from gaining international influence.\nAnd the suggestion that no money for our citizens who lost everything due to a hurricane appears contrary to real experience. My good friend in St. Petersburg, Florida, lost part of the roof on his house, and he reports that \"FEMA was surprisingly polite and efficient and came through with $5,000 of the $9,000 we needed.\"\nAmerica is great partly because the federal government — as imperfect as it is — is trying to do the right things and has produced better economic results than any other country in the world (The Economist, Oct. 19, 2024). This track record suggests that we should try to improve the government we have rather than start all over.\nRALPH MEYER\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge man found guilty of child abuse, assault\n\n December 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Crime \n \n 519\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — A Cambridge man has been found guilty of first-degree assault and first-degree child abuse relating to an incident with his infant.Marcus Peak, 28, was arrested in April 2023 after his five-week-old child was seriously injured with a traumatic brain injury. He was charged with attempted first- and second-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault, first- and second-degree child abuse, neglect of a minor and reckless endangerment.\nThe state later decided it would not prosecute for the murder charges. Peak was found guilty by Dorchester County Circuit Court Judge William Jones of the other six counts.\nThe charges against Peak stem from an incident on April 21, 2023, when Cambridge Police officers responded to assist Dorchester County Emergency Medical Services with an infant who was unconscious and not breathing. EMS treated the infant and transported her to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Cambridge. The baby was then transported to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.\nAccording to police, Peak told detectives he had just fed the baby a bottle and placed her in a bassinet for a nap. He said the baby was asleep. He said that when he returned to check on the her later, he noticed the baby's head was tilted to the side with fluid coming from her nose and mouth. He said the baby's eyes were partially opened.\nAt that time, Peak denied any traumatic event that could have caused injury to the baby.\nDetectives were told Peak had lied and did not inform them that the baby had fallen to the floor striking her head. Peak allegedly then picked the baby up and shook the baby to wake it, according to a report from the Cambridge Police Department.\nDuring the trial, Jones heard a variety of testimony, including testimony from doctors and the child's mother.\nThe mother, Paris Keene, testified that she had left the house that day to pick up their older child from daycare. She said Peak had stayed with the their five-week-old. She said that when she came back, Peak told her the infant had choked on her spit up.\nWhen Keene took the baby from Peak, she realized that the baby's eyes were rolling back, and Peak called 911.\nDr. Eric Klotz, an emergency medicine physician who treated the child that day, said her injuries were consistent with a high mechanism of injury. He said it was one of the more severe head injuries he's seen in his career.\nDr. Joseph Scheller, a pediatric neurologist who was asked by Peak's defense to testify, said it is possible the child's injuries were caused by an accidental fall. He said that while it is rare, short falls can sometimes cause serious injury.\n\"I am thankful for the judge's consideration,\" Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard told the Star Democrat. \"He gave a very well thought out explanation citing case law and it was obvious that he took significant time to consider the evidence put forth by the state, including expert testimony and other evidence.\"\nLeonard said that a \"long form\" pre-sentence investigation will be conducted, which may take multiple months. As of Friday afternoon, no sentencing date for Peak was scheduled. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Maryland police officer retires at 40 years of service\n\n January 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 694\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Dennis Wood fought back tears Thursday morning during his retirement ceremony in front of the North East Police Department station. His emotion was understandable, considering that Wood was saying goodbye to his beloved career after spending nearly a half-century serving as a law enforcement officer.\"Forty-six years, all I ever wanted to do was serve the people of Cecil County and the people of North East, and I think I did that to the best of my ability,\" Wood summarized during his brief speech to a crowd of family, friends and law enforcement officers representing various police agencies.\nMoments earlier, Wood and his wife, Lou, trailed a bagpipe player as they walked out the front door of the NEPD station on Cecil Avenue and made their way between two rows of saluting police officers in the parking lot.\nThen Wood slid into the driver's seat of a patrol vehicle, raised a radio transmitter to his mouth and uttered, \"I'm off duty — and retired.\"\nAfter the new retiree stepped out of the vehicle and said a few words to the ceremony attendees, Cecil County Executive Adam Streight presented a proclamation to Wood on behalf of himself and the Cecil County Council.\nStreight certainly can appreciate the emotions evoked by Wood's retirement day. Less than two months earlier, Streight made that same ceremonial walk and intoned a similar sign-off over the police radio waves when he retired from the Cecil County Sheriff's Office, after serving 25 years with that agency.\nIn his case, Streight retired so he could assume his elected position as county executive — but even so, walking away from law enforcement work was bittersweet for him.\n\"There is no other job like police work. It is who you are,\" Streight emphasized shortly after his own retirement ceremony.\nWood expressed similar sentiments when asked why he became a police officer. It was more of a calling than a career choice, according to Wood, who could not point to a particular person or a specific event that led him on this path. It was like the career chose him, not the other way around.\n\"Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be a police officer. That's all I ever wanted to be. I wanted to be able to help people,\" explained Wood, his eyes still moist moments after the ceremony.\nMarking the end of his second excursion into Cecil County law enforcement, Wood retired Thursday from the North East Police Department at the rank of corporal after serving as a patrol officer with that agency for 25 years.\nIn addition, Wood served as the department's firearms instructor for several years. Wood also served on many homeowner associations as the North East Police Department liaison.\n\"You could count on Cpl. Wood to take extra shifts and to do whatever needed to be done. He also was great as a community liaison for the department, working with the homeowners associations,\" NEPD Chief Stephen Yates said.\nWood joined the North East Police Department in June 1999 — one month after leaving the Cecil County Sheriff's Office, where he had served in various capacities for slightly more than 20 years.\nHired by the late Sheriff John F. \"Jack\" DeWitt, Wood started his CCSO career in 1979 as a correctional officer at the old jail on North Street in Elkton. After about three years, Wood transferred to the law enforcement side of CCSO and attended the Anne Arundel Police Academy.\nWood served as a patrol deputy and as a detective while with the CCSO. During his time with the agency, Wood also helped form the county's first dive team. In addition, Wood ran the Sheriff's Office Explorer Post Program for four years.\nHe left the CCSO in May 1999 to take an officer position with the North East Police Department and started in June 1999, one month later.\nDuring the retirement ceremony on Thursday, a dispatcher read Wood's career summary aloud over the police radio. In conclusion, the dispatcher read, \"We thank Cpl. Wood's wife, Lou, and his family for sharing him with us for 46 years. Cpl. Wood, thank you for all you have done to make Cecil County a better place . . . Enjoy your camping trips and cutting firewood.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

He said the sally port — which is a secure garage for officers to enter with arrestees — is projected to be completed this summer.\n\"When they're getting a prisoner or somebody under arrest out, they can't take off running anywhere,\" Gamble said. \"It's a secure garage basically, and then they can just enter our building there.\"\nThe sheriff says once the Department of Emergency Services fully moves in, there'll be an open house or ribbon-cutting event to celebrate the new building.\n\"Everybody's really enjoying it,\" Gamble said. \" … Once everything's done, we should be in good shape.\"\nThe Talbot County Sheriff's Office can be reached at (410) 822-1020, located at 28640 Mary's Court, Suite 100, Easton, MD. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After further investigation, deputies determined that three male suspects wearing all black clothing and masks attempted to enter multiple vehicles, stealing various items.\nAt around 5 p.m., deputies were dispatched to Harrison Circle in Trappe for suspicious activity. A resident of the area noticed the three male suspects dressed in black clothing and wearing masks looking into vehicles, police said.\nAfter observation, the suspects fled on foot into a residence on the 3900 block of Main Street and attempted to barricade themselves inside, according to the sheriff's office. Deputies surrounded the residence and made contact with the suspects after a short time, police said.\nThe suspects were identified as 18 year-old Nihjay T. Greene of Trappe, 18 year-old Aamad A. Turner of Trappe and a juvenile 16 year-old male, who was not named by the sheriff's office.\nPolice said Greene attempted to resist arrest and assaulted a deputy as he was being detained. No one was injured during the arrests.\nGreene has been charged with second degree assault on a police officer, resisting arrest, obstructing and hindering, fourth degree burglary, rogue and vagabond, theft of less than $100 and malicious destruction of property.\nTurner has been charged with obstructing and hindering, fourth degree burglary, rogue and vagabond, theft less than $100 and malicious destruction of property less than $1,000.\nThe 16-year-old juvenile was charged with the same offenses as Turner and referred to the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services, where he was released to a guardian, the sheriff's office said.\nMembers of the Talbot County Sheriff's Office Criminal Investigations Division arranged and proceeded a search and seizure warrant of the residence the suspects attempted to barricade, which was signed by a judge. During the search deputies found evidence connecting the three suspects to the vehicle break-ins in La Trappe Heights, as well as vehicle break-ins that occurred in Easton early in 2024.\nGreene and Turner were transferred to the Talbot County Central Booking Facility for processing and their first appearance before a District Court Commissioner. They are being held without bond at Talbot County Detention Center. Both suspects were released on unsecured bail after bail reviews before a district court judge. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Jones, outgoing Easton fire chief, reflects on third term\n\n January 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 547\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Wrapping up his third stint as Easton Volunteer Fire Department's fire chief, Sonny Jones is proud of the group of men and women that he has led for the past two years.\"I have a love of the fire service in general. I love the job that the volunteer firefighters do,\" Jones said. \"I enjoy knowing that when someone needs help … we respond and try to make what could be their worst day a better day by trying to solve their problems or make things better.\"\nJones has served as chief of the volunteer department from 2013-2014, 2019-2020, and most recently, 2023-2024. It's typically a \"gentleman's agreement\" within the firehouse that chiefs serve two-year terms non-consecutively.\nAt its December meeting, the fire department elected current Assistant Chief JR Dobson as its incoming chief for 2025.\nIt'll be Dobson's first stint as fire chief, something Jones remembers being excited for when he assumed the role in 2013.\n\"I'm excited for him to be able to experience that as well,\" Jones said. \"I'm confident that he'll do a good job.\"\nJones began in fire service when he was 16, joining the Kent Island Volunteer Fire Department in 1988. He says he isn't going anywhere. He'll still be responding to calls as a volunteer and helping the department carry out its mission to serve Easton residents.\nFor more than 23 years, Jones has been an active member of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, including in roles such as fire officer and assistant chief before he was first elected chief.\n\"Each time I've been chief, it's had its unique challenges, whether it be major incidents or natural disasters,\" Jones said. \"There's been some really positive moments in the acquisition of new firefighting apparatus.\"\nIn the past year, firefighters responded to a fatal plane crash in the Tred Avon River in July, along with multiple significant fires. The fire department and its fundraising arm was also integral in the groundbreaking of the A. James Clark Emergency Services Training Campus in December.\nDuring the pandemic, firefighters didn't socialize in-person at the firehouse as much as usual due to safety guidelines. But in the years since, Jones is happy that aspect has returned, especially since he views the membership as family.\n\"They're your brothers and sisters as much as your own brothers and sisters or wives or husbands would be,\" Jones said. \"They're people that you see almost every day. You put your life in their hands, they put their life in yours, and you work together to do some very exciting yet dangerous work.\"\nSince Easton Volunteer Fire Department's start in 1808, Jones is only one of three members to serve three separate times as chief. C.R. Chance has the department record at four terms.\nAs he exits a historic third term, Jones is thankful for the fire department's strong membership, and he looks forward to those assuming leadership roles in 2025.\n\"I can step away from the position not having any regrets whatsoever and nothing but pride in the job that the members have done over the years,\" he said. \"Pride in the upcoming leadership, knowing that they'll continue to do good work to support not only the department but the public in general. And just knowing that I was part of a small group of history within the Town of Easton.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2025-01-04",
    "author": "DAVID REEL",
    "content": "Our moral compass is broken ... that is worrisome\n\n January 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 800\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A dictionary definition of a moral compass is a set of beliefs or values that help guide ethical decisions, judgments and behavior, an internal sense of what is right and wrong.A dictionary definition of broken is something that is no longer whole or working correctly.\nAs has been reported regularly and with great public interest since early December, Brian Thompson, the CEO of United American Healthcare Insurance Company was ambushed, shot and killed while attending a business meeting in New York City.\nAfter reading a recent commentary authored by Adam Panucco and posted on Montgomery Perspective on the aftermath of that assassination, I suggest we are experiencing an emerging crisis due to a broken moral compass in American society.\nCase in point are recaps in Panucco's commentary of widespread reactions to the formal accusation of and trial for Luigi Mangione, on his alleged involvement in the assassination of Brian Thompson. Panucco wrote in part:\n\"Celebrations of the murder broke out on social media almost as soon as the killing was reported. The then unknown assailant had provided a public service by taking out a leader in a predatory and heartless industry, the killer's fans asserted. The jubilation grew in fervor as each newly released surveillance video confirmed the original impression that the killer, still at large, was young and handsome. Once an arrest was made, the lionization of the suspect, reached a frenzy. Luigi —always Luigi—was the 'hot assassin.' Merchandise featuring his image and phrases from a handwritten manifesto he had carried with him sprung up on Amazon. A video projection of Mangione's face was cheered at a rock concert in Boston. A crowdsourced defense fund quickly swelled with donations. Wanted posters appeared in Manhattan with pictures of other corporate CEOs. The names and salaries of health care executives were posted online. Private citizens who had helped with the manhunt were vilified as snitches, police officers involved in arresting alleged killer Mangione received threats.\"\nWhile these may be relatively isolated incidents, even more distressing was Panucco's recap of public polling results on this matter.\n\"Over 41 percent of respondents supported the Thompson assassination, or were at best ambivalent about it. Nearly 16 percent of respondents were 'unsure' or 'neutral' about whether the killer's actions were 'acceptable or unacceptable.' A little over 8 percent of respondents found Mangione's actions 'completely acceptable.' Another 8.4 percent found those actions 'somewhat acceptable,' and 9 percent found them 'somewhat unacceptable.' It is not clear how 'somewhat acceptable' differs from 'somewhat unacceptable.' Four of every 10 Americans, in other words, will not unequivocally condemn the killing. The younger the voter, the greater the level of support for political killings. Sixty-seven percent of voters aged 18 to 29 were ambivalent about or supportive of Mangione's actions, with only 33 percent finding those actions completely unacceptable. Fifty-seven percent of voters aged 30 to 39 were unwilling to condemn the killing unequivocally, with only 43 percent finding it 'completely unacceptable.' Democrats were nearly twice as likely as Republicans to find it either somewhat or completely acceptable.\"\nIn closing remarks in his thought-provoking commentary, Panucco asks:\n\"What has gone wrong with Americans' moral compass that so many could cheer the extrajudicial killing of an innocent man? That question has not been deemed worthy of exploring.\"\nI suggest what is wrong with America's moral compass is simple.\nOur moral compass is broken.\nTo the best of my knowledge this brokenness has not been deemed worthy of exploring.\nIt is imperative that we individually and collectively embrace the timeless principles contained in the United States Constitution, especially with regard to due process and the rule of law in America.\nWhile every American has a right to hold and express their opinion, every American has a right and an obligation to point out and challenge misguided and hypocritical opinions that reflect a broken moral compass.\nIt is indefensible that anyone would support, celebrate or glorify any accused killer who already has constitutional rights to:\nAn assumption of innocence until proven guilty.\nA properly processed an indictment, i.e., formal charge or accusation of a serious crime.\nAccess to legal counsel and representation.\nOpportunities during a trial for cross examinations.\nVerdicts on guilt or innocence on all charges.\nOpportunities to appeal all verdicts.\nThat person does not have any right to act alone as the judge, jury and executioner, thereby denying a murder victim the same rights, regardless of who he is or his occupation.\nIn his book, \"Democracy in America,\" Alexis de Tocqueville wrote, \"America is great because America is good. If America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.\"\nIf America does not take proper immediate steps to address the consequences of a broken moral compass going forward, our society will not only cease to be good and cease to be great, but will also ultimately cease to exist. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

At the time, the employee was in a section of the parking lot that is closest to the Chick-Fil-A while servicing an ATM machine, police added.\nAn ambulance crew transported the woman from the scene to ChristianaCare Union Hospital in Elkton, where she was treated for minor injuries and then discharged, police reported.\nBased on the preliminary investigation, detectives believe that the culprits approached the employee in that parking lot and tried to force her to open a compartment in the armored vehicle where the money is stored, according to Odom.\nAt some point during the attempted robbery, one of the suspects pepper-sprayed the woman, who was unable to oblige her assailants' demand to unlock the compartment, Odom reported.\n\"She was not able to open the locked section because, for security reasons, there are procedures in place. It's not as easy as unlocking your car,\" Odom explained.\nOdom described the three assailants only as black men and noted that one of them brandished \"an AK mini Draco style pistol that looks like an assault rifle.\"\nHe further reported that the culprits fled from the scene in a dark-colored sport utility vehicle that is similar to a Dodge Durango or a Chevrolet Tahoe — with tinted windows and a white license plate — and that the getaway vehicle was last seen heading east on Route 40 into Delaware.\nInvestigators believe that the assailants were concerned that law enforcement officers might be rushing to the scene, which prompted them to abandon their efforts to break into the armored vehicle and flee instead, police reported.\nEPD investigators watched video that they gleaned from security cameras in the area where the attempted armed robbery occurred, Odom said. They also interviewed witnesses, Odom added, declining to elaborate because of the ongoing investigation.\nAfter receiving notification about the attempted robbery resulting in an injured employee, Brink sent representatives to the scene and they removed the armored vehicle, police reported. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore (D) for the state of Maryland, among others.\nThe snow storm began Sunday night and continued through early Tuesday morning. Weather reports are predicting more snow may come Friday and Saturday.\nThe National Weather Service has reported inch counts throughout the day for several Eastern Shore counties, with several areas reporting snowfall at or near a foot.\n12 inches of snow were reported in Preston at 2:53 p.m. Monday, with more snowfall to come that evening.\nA reading taken in Easton the following morning also showed a foot of snow had fallen, and a 6:15 a.m. reading Tuesday in East New Market showed 10.5 inches of snowfall.\nMegan Cook, mayor of Easton, said county and town departments and residents did a great job with addressing the snow storm.\n\"Our Public Works department did an excellent job clearing the roads during the snow emergency,\" Cook said Tuesday afternoon. \"They worked tirelessly during the last 40 hours, starting at midnight Sunday night, plowing roads, parking lots and parks for residents. And during this time, they also managed to pick up both Monday and Tuesday's trash routes.\"\nAdditionally, Cook said she is grateful for the residents who heeded the snow emergency declaration and stayed off the roads so it could be properly be cleared in a safe manner. The Easton Volunteer Fire Department and the Easton Police Department worked hard on responding to all the calls made during the snow storm.\nGlenn Steckman, city manager for Cambridge, said he is happy with the amount of cooperation the residents and town staff had when trying to navigate the snow storm.\n\"I think the city did very well,\" Steckman said. \"We haven't had a — from what everybody has told me — a major snow in Cambridge in about four years. The city staff started meeting on Friday to discuss how they were going to approach addressing the storm. And we just did what we needed to do, which was get out and plow our streets, and salt them and make travel as easy as possible.\"\nAccording to Steckman, Cambridge staff tried to work quickly and efficiently with the changes in weather. Steckman said there was a point where staff spent 20 hours battling the snow.\n\"I want to acknowledge our staff in the Public Works who are the ones who put the effort in in moving the snow,\" Steckman said. \"That was a long day for anybody, and I think they need a pat on the back for the work they did.\"\nIn a press release from Talbot County, Brian LeCates, director of the Talbot County Department of Emergency Services, said his department had been working hard to keep the county safe from the drastic changes in weather.\n\"Our first priority is keeping residents safe,\" LeCates said. \"We urge everyone to stay off the roads, especially as drifting snow and strong winds will create dangerous driving conditions overnight.\"\nTalbot County Sheriff's Office made a post on Facebook Monday morning showing heavy snow on MD 331 coming out of Caroline County and recommended for residents to \"Please stay home and stay safe.\"\nIn a press release from the county, Clay Stamp, manager for Talbot County, expressed his gratitude for the dedication of Talbot County employees during the storm response.\n\"I want to personally thank our Roads & Facilities Department and Emergency Services staff for their incredible efforts during this winter storm,\" Stamp said. \"Their hard work and commitment to keeping our community safe and operational, often in challenging conditions, exemplify the very best of public service.\"\nWhile crews worked to keep roadways safe and return operations to normal as soon as possible, Eastern Shore communities saw multiple businesses, government offices and schools close for the inclement weather.\nThe town of St. Michaels announced its town offices would be closed due to the weather Monday, as did the town of Easton and other municipalities in the area, many of which also remained closed on Tuesday. By Wednesday, many offices were expected to return to normal operations.\nSt. Michaels announced trash collection would resume its usual schedule with collection on Wednesday, but Denton delayed trash pick up for Thursday due to the weather.\nTalbot County, Caroline County and Dorchester County Public Schools announced closures on Monday due to the weather and were not expected to reopen to students until Thursday.\nSaints Peter & Paul School announced virtual learning days for its students on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nChesapeake Community College, Salisbury University and University of Maryland Eastern Shore announced closures due to the weather for Monday and Tuesday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They are a family-owned business specializing in window replacements, and when notified of the incident, workers came out, made measurements, then boarded up two out of three holes.\nUnless delayed by snow, glass for the door replacement at Boyers should arrive on Tuesday, an employee of MK Specialties said. The total work should not take longer than two weeks.\nChestertown officer in charge of the investigation Pfc. Travis Burke encouraged anyone with information to come forward.

The 911 operator listened, gave me directions, kept me calm and told me that the medical team was on its way. Within 15 minutes of the call, the crew arrived. I call it a crew because at least two trucks from the Easton fire department accompanied the ambulance.\nThe fire department members shoveled the snow off the entrance to my house within a matter of minutes to give a safer passageway for the EMS crew. The EMS crew handled my wife's situation quickly and efficiently, moved her to the ambulance for transport to the emergency room. They kept apologizing for bringing snow into the house — the least of my concerns.\nThe entire team put themselves at risk to help us. The quickness of their response, especially considering the weather, was amazing.

Gasser has been interim chief of police since October, when an unspecified incident caused the town to have a third party investigate the department.\nGasser comes into this position with a military background, and he has been serving the Town of Federalsburg for almost 30 years. He believes his strong background and experience will help him serve as chief.\n\"The jobs that I have had throughout both my military and my police career have pointed me in this direction,\" Gasser said. \"As not somebody simply to have a standard to take over, but someone that has the ability and the knowledge to build from.\"\nOn Oct. 14 the Town of Federalsburg made a facebook post about an unspecified incident causing the town to have a third party investigate the department.\n\"The Town of Federalsburg received a complaint about an incident involving the Federalsburg Police Department that occurred on October 9, 2024. We are engaging an independent third party to investigate this incident,\" the post said.\nWhen asked whether turnover in the Federalsburg Police Department was related to the October incident, Mayor Kim Abner referred the Star Democrat to the Facebook post.\nGasser confirmed the October incident was a consideration in his appointment. \"But that's as far as I'll go with it,\" he said.\nIn the post announcing Gasser promotion, the town stated former Chief Michael McDermott, who had served in law enforcement for more than 40 years, resigned effective Jan. 5.\n\"The Mayor and Council, on behalf of the Town of Federalsburg, extend our appreciation to Chief McDermott for his years of service to the Town and wish him all the best in his future endeavors,\" the town said in the Facebook post.\nIn McDermott's years as chief, the department saw a significant reduction in crime rates, the post said. Gasser wants to continue McDermott's work.\n\"We've had a good several years here with the former chief, and I want to expound upon that and make it even better for the future,\" Gasser said.\nSome of Gasser's goals and plans will be executed within three years, the new chief said. He plans to shape the department better for the future.\n\"We have several new officers with less than a year in the field,\" Gasser stated. \"They are the future of this department. My primary goal is to prepare this department three years down the line, five years down the line, for those individuals to take over this department and to run it effectively and in service of the community.\"\nIn addition to continuing the work that has been done, Gasser plans for some reorganization as well.\n\"There's certainly some internal reorganization to the department that needs to be done,\" Gasser said. \"That's going to be a transitional point, both with me coming in as Chief, even though I've been here forever. It's also going to be a task to better serve the officers themselves, like some officers have things they like to do more than others, I want to get them headed in that direction.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The same point could have been made regarding the violent rioters who broke into the capitol four years ago and those who now applaud them.As a frequent contributor to the Star, Mr. Reel owes us more than the obvious conclusion that something is morally wrong. He needs to offer insights on how this compass is going to be fixed in light of the fact that the national leader we just elected fails a morality test by any reasonable standard (e.g., the Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule, or state and federal laws).\nRALPH MEYER\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Believers don’t give up hope': Delaware church vows to rebuild after second vehicle strike in six months\n\n January 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 719\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The driver of a stolen car fleeing police smashed through the front of St. John AM Church early Jan. 13 marking the second time in six months that a vehicle has caused significant damage to the historic church.The latest incident happened at approximately 4:30 a.m. An Infiniti Q50 jumped the curb, knocked over a barrier intended to protect the church, destroyed a chain-link fence and crashed through the front of the building, which is located at the corner of New London Road and Cleveland Avenue.\nLt. Greg D'Elia, a spokesman for the Newark Police Department, said officers were called to a car dealership on Cleveland Avenue for a report of suspicious people. While investigating, they saw a car pulling out of the dealership, and the officers attempted to pull over the vehicle. The vehicle fled, and the officers did not pursue it but discovered minutes later that the car had crashed into the church.\nTwo occupants of the vehicle were taken to Christiana Hospital for treatment. Both are 24-year-old men, and one was listed in critical condition, according to paramedics.\nCharges are pending, D'Elia said, adding that the car had been reported stolen from Pennsylvania.\nSt. John AM Church was damaged in a similar incident Aug. 9, when a car topping speeds of 90 mph crashed into the church. That driver, who had stolen the car from a Cleveland Avenue dealership, managed to get out of the car before police arrived and was finally arrested in December.\nThe church's sanctuary has remained condemned since the August crash, and the church has been holding weekly services in the fellowship hall, which is located in an undamaged rear portion of the building.\nPastor Blaine Hackett said the church had just finished negotiating with its insurance company about repairing the damage from the August incident. Monday's crash happened just hours before he was scheduled to sign a contract with the construction company.\nNow, Hackett and his congregation have even further damage to contend with. While the first crash mostly damaged the entry vestibule, the latest crash appeared to be more severe. The car did heavy damage to the corner of the main church building, and large cracks could be seen in the surrounding brick walls.\nThough Monday's crash is a setback, the congregation remains undeterred, Hackett said.\n\"Believers don't give up hope,\" he said. \"God is still in the fixing business, and he's going to fix this. He's going to restore it all back to where it needs to be. We're encouraged. This is just a delay, not a denial, of what God is doing in our ministry.\"\nAfter two crashes, many have wondered why this keeps happening to the small, tight-knit congregation.\n\"I believe because the gospel is going forth here and that we're really sharing the good news of Jesus Christ, the enemy is not happy,\" Hackett said. \"But the gates of hell will not prevail.\"\nThe first Black church in Newark, St. John first opened in a log cabin in 1848. The log cabin burned down in 1866, and the following year, the current church building was constructed at the same site. Since its inception, St. John has been a cornerstone of Newark's historically Black community.\nDue to its location, the church has unfortunately been the victim of several crashes recently. Cars build up speed coming down a hill on Cleveland Avenue and either lose control or fail to navigate a slight curve past the church.\nWhile Monday's crash and the one in August did the most damage, the church was also struck a few years ago. The damage in that case was just exterior, but it prompted the church to install barriers in the front yard to try to stop cars from hitting the building. The church suffered another vehicle strike this past November, but the car was stopped by the barriers and did not impact the main building.\nHackett said he is talking with the construction company about reinforcing the concrete barriers and adding additional barriers to better protect the church.\nHe is also planning to start a GoFundMe page to raise money for repairing the damage. Those interested in helping can also mail or drop off donations to St. John AM Church, 77 New London Road, Newark DE, 19711.\n\"We're resilient people, we have always been,\" Hackett said. \"We believe in the power of God and how he restores those that love.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

No injuries were reported.\nA preliminary investigation ruled the cause as \"incendiary.\" The fire marshal stated that \"subject(s) ignited a small pile of party supplies located on the second floor rear storage hallway.\"\nNormal operations at the Y resumed Sunday.\nYMCA of the Chesapeake CEO Robbie Gill said, \"it's disheartening to know that that can happen.\"\n\"The Y's been in this community 168 years,\" Gill said Monday. \"It serves one in three people. It's kind of a third place where people go. It's a place where everyone is welcome.\"\nThe blaze around 12:30 p.m. was the first of two fires at the Y on Saturday. Around 5:30 p.m., firefighters were once again called to the Y, where an HVAC unit was on fire on the building's roof.\nThe cause of the HVAC fire was deemed to be a mechanical failure. The fire marshal ruled that second blaze as accidental and said it was unrelated to the incident earlier that day.\nBoth fires caused a combined $50,000 in estimated damages, according to the fire marshal's reports.\nGill said he's grateful the Easton Volunteer Fire Department responded so promptly and that there weren't extensive damages to the Y. Saturday's first fire was extinguished by the Y's sprinkler system before firefighters arrived at the scene.\nPeter Hyman, president of the YMCA's board, was on his way to the Y around noon on Saturday when he learned of the first fire. He noticed community members and Y staff gathering.\n\"The staff was upset. It was an upsetting moment, and I just did what I could to help both in terms of the emotions of the folks as well as the physical reality of the situation,\" Hyman said Sunday morning.\n\"When something like this happens, it's offensive on a multiplicity of levels,\" Hyman added.\nGill said the Y is going to take a look at its procedures and protocols moving forward, as well as continuing to work with law enforcement in its investigation.\nThe fire marshal's office is asking anyone with information regarding the intentionally set fire to contact its Upper Eastern Regional Office at 410-819-3500.\nGill said the fact that someone tried to \"impact the sanctity\" of the Y as a community center is \"always scary at the time and also sad.\"\n\"But if there's one thing about Talbot County and our community, it is a tight group of people,\" Gill said. \"... Something like this isn't going to deter us from continuing to make a positive impact.\"\nStar Democrat editor Wendy Weitzel contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The blaze was reported Jan. 12 just before 4 a.m.According to Maryland State Fire Marshal's Office spokesman Oliver Alkire, the two adult occupants of the house escaped the structure without injury. Alkire said they are being assisted by family members.\nA report from the North Beach Volunteer Fire Department stated crews arrived at the scene \"with fire showing from multiple floors and the roof.\"\nAlkire said the smoke alarm that sounded in the house alerted the occupants who fled the home and was also connected to a line that alerted 911.\nThe Jan. 12 blaze resulted in two alarms.\n\"Units from Calvert, Charles and Prince George's counties arrived to assist on a defensive operation due to the extensive amount of fire that was present,\" the North Beach VFD report stated.\nBoth Alkire and the fire department confirmed that crews had a difficult time accessing the burning house.\n\"This was because of the long driveway and snow and ice not being removed,\" Alkire told Southern Maryland News.\n\"Alternative access was located through a neighbor's driveway and crews from other companies deployed hand lines for defensive operations,\" a report posted by the Huntingtown Volunteer Fire Department stated.\nThe house was located near Roosevelt Cliffs and the Chesapeake Bay.\nThe structure and contents sustained an estimated $700,000 in damage.\nDespite the arduous conditions, no firefighters were injured and members of the Huntingtown Ladies Auxiliary were at the site providing refreshments and snacks to operating crews throughout the incident, local fire officials reported.\nThe North Beach VFD reported crews worked at the site for approximately four-and-a-half hours.\nThe cause of the fire and its area of origin remains under investigation.\nNorth Beach volunteers reminds citizens to \"always ensure emergency vehicles can access your house from the driveway.

When Queen Anne-Hillsboro Volunteer Fire Department and surrounding fire departments arrived, they discovered a double-wide manufactured home engulfed in flames. Initial reports indicated that two occupants were unaccounted for. After extinguishing the fire, firefighters located the remains of two deceased victims.\nThe victims have been tentatively identified as Margarete Brown, 83, and her son, Larry Brown, 63. According to reports from the State Fire Marshal's office, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) will conduct a formal identification and investigation into the cause and manner of death.\nWhile the cause of the fire remains under investigation, family members told investigators that the victims had purchased a kerosene heater yesterday to replace an older unit. Deputy state fire marshals uncovered seven kerosene heaters among the debris during the investigation. It is unknown at this time how many of those were in use and functioning.\n\"Our hearts break for the families affected by this tragedy,\" said Acting State Fire Marshal Jason M. Mowbray. \"While the cause of this fire remains under investigation, tragedies like this remind us of the importance of fire safety, especially during the winter when the risks increase. I ask everyone to remain vigilant as we light our homes to stay warm. Please check your smoke alarms, have an exit plan and practice it, and get out, stay out,\" Mowbray continued.\nWhenever a fatal fire occurs, a joint investigation between the police agency having jurisdiction, the Office of the State Fire Marshal, and an accelerant detection canine team is standard operating procedure.\n\"Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences are with the victims, their families, and loved ones affected by today's tragic accident,\" shared the Queen Anne's County Sheriff's Office. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Cecilton Volunteer Fire Company served as the on-scene command unit, fire officials added.\nInvestigators reported that an employee at a nearby convenience store attempted to extinguish the blaze before firefighters arrived at the scene.\n\"The owners noticed smoke and later discovered a fire on the side of the home. Passersby observed the house on fire, and a Royal Farms employee attempted to use a fire extinguisher; however, the fire quickly spread upwards and throughout the home,\" an MOSFM spokesman summarized.\nApproximately 35 volunteer firefighters battled the blaze for about one hour before bringing it under control, reported the spokesman, who then qualified that flare-ups resulted in firefighters working at the scene well beyond that point in time.\n\"Due to the home's balloon-frame construction, firefighters continued to extinguish fire and hotspots for hours into the early morning,\" the spokesman noted.\nThe blaze caused an estimated $200,000 in structural damage to the two-story house and destroyed approximately $50,000 in belongings inside the dwelling, according to the spokesman, who further reported that the American Red Cross is assisting the two adult occupants and their 10-year-old child, as are friends of the displaced family. No one was injured.\nFire officials identified Kevin Delaney as the property owner and Samuel and Jentina Roark and their child as the displaced occupants.\nMOSFM detectives determined that the blaze started in a wall space but, as of Thursday, the cause of the fire remained under investigation, according to the spokesman, who added, \"While the cause remains under investigation, investigators can not rule out a failure of the wood stove flue pipe.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This means he will serve no jail time.\nAdams said Schwaninger will have to serve five years of supervised probation, register as a Tier I sex offender and submit to supervision, meaning that he will have to comply with a sex offender management program.\nThe state agreed not to prosecute the remaining four charges Schwaninger faced.\nBefore handing down Schwaninger's sentence, Adams said that by obtaining and possessing the videos, Schwaninger was participating in the child pornography industry.\n\"The most important thing we can all do is protect children,\" she said.\nDuring the plea hearing, Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale gave descriptions of the four videos that Schwaninger pleaded guilty to having. He said the children in the videos were real children, not created by artificial intelligence.\nCoale said that although Schwaninger had not manufactured the videos, his \"participation in that market allows the market to flourish.\"\nSchwaninger's attorney Thomas Maronick Jr. said his client \"looked at some pictures he should not have\" and didn't distribute them. Maronick said Schwaninger has since met with a counselor experienced in treating sex offenders. Maronick said the counselor did not feel that Schwaninger had a problem that requires \"lengthy\" therapy.\nThis was \"a crime of curiosity,\" Maronick said, later adding that Schwaninger didn't realize the industry he was supporting.\nSchwaninger told Adams that he came across the videos on social media toward the end of 2023.\n\"It was like watching a train wreck,\" he said about the videos. \"I know better.\"\nSchwaninger said the videos were on an old phone and didn't realize they were on the phone he was using at the time of his arrest. He said he thought he had deleted the videos. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Zoar Road while the son was attempting to break into his parents' home, police reported at the time.\nDuring the incident leading up to the fatal shooting, the patriarch's 78-year-old wife suffered injuries, police said. An ambulance crew drove the woman to Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air, where she was treated for unspecified injuries that were not caused by gunfire, police added.\n\"Following a thorough review of the evidence, Maryland State Police investigators determined that the decedent was shot while attempting to break into the home after an earlier physical and verbal altercation with the resident elderly couple. After a review of the current statute, case law, and all information gathered by the Maryland State Police, the Office of the State's Attorney has elected to not proceed with criminal charges. In these circumstances, the suspect was protecting himself and his wife and was acting in self-defense,\" an SAO spokeswoman explained.\nThe father was cooperative throughout the investigation, police reported.\nMSP troopers assigned to the agency's North East Barrack rushed to scene shortly before 2 p.m. on Sept. 24 in response to a reported shooting, police said.\nFirefighters responded to that Mt. Zoar Road property, too, and extinguished a blaze at an adjacent home, police added.\nAfter completing their concurrent investigation, detectives with the Maryland Office of the State Fire Marshal ruled \"undetermined\" for the cause of that blaze, the SAO spokeswoman reported. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton's new fire chief has plans for equipment, recruitment\n\n January 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 626\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — J.R. Dobson grew up around the fire house, always knowing he wanted to be a firefighter.In his teenage years, Dobson joined the Trappe Volunteer Fire Company as a junior cadet, and by 16 he began riding the fire trucks. He fondly recalls the \"everybody knew everybody\" aspect of the tight-knit community.\nDobson eventually moved to Easton, beginning his journey with the Easton Volunteer Fire Department in 2003. Over time, he's served in a number of roles, including most recently, assistant chief.\nNow he's taking on the department's top role for the first time. Dobson was elected the department's chief in December.\nWith a wife and two daughters, timing was everything for Dobson when considering the commitment to assume a role as demanding as Easton fire chief. The timing is right, he said, and he's looking forward to leading and making a difference.\n\"There's a lot of tradition here,\" Dobson said. \"It's certainly the biggest department in the county. It's got probably the most going on out of all the departments in the county. I think just being here, seeing how this department operates versus a small department. It's a business. And we're all here for free, none of us get paid.\"\nDobson officially began as chief this month. Sonny Jones just wrapped up his third two-year term leading the department.\nDobson, who volunteers at the fire department as all the firefighters do, is a patrol and operations commander at the Talbot County Sheriff's Office. He believes his experience leading around 35 deputies across multiple divisions will translate to his duties in the fire house.\n\"I think that I bring a lot of management skills, leadership skills,\" Dobson said. \"Just from my experience there, I think it helps you here.\"\nThus far, Dobson says the support he's received has been \"overwhelming.\"\nPast fire chiefs have reached out, and he hopes to pick up one thing from each of them to set himself up for success. For instance, Jones' ability as an incident commander is something Dobson admires.\n\"If there were ever a bad day anybody was having, he's who you would want there,\" Dobson said of Jones. \"Just the way he kind of rolls through an incident scene. He's been there and done that kind of thing.\"\nSimilarly, Jones — who is remaining involved with the department — spoke highly of Dobson.\n\"I've known J.R. the entire time that I've been a member of the Easton fire department,\" Jones said. \"J.R. is a first-rate guy. He's a terrific leader. He has many, many qualities which will bode well for him as the chief of the department.\"\nSome of the ongoing projects the new fire chief has his eye on include purchasing a utility vehicle to use for Rails to Trails and woods fires, buying a new engine and updating box alarm assignments. He also wants to implement some new standard operating procedures.\nDobson said he hopes to nail down a handful of tasks for the year and keep circling back to see what progress is being made. At the top of his list is recruitment and retention of volunteers.\n\"I think it all starts with recruiting. I think it all starts with retention,\" Dobson said. \"Those are things that we've done well in the past, although the last year or so we haven't gotten as many members as we would like. And sometimes we'll get members in and they don't realize the commitment.\"\nWhile acknowledging the town's consistent support of the department over the years, Dobson believes Easton Fire can do better in attracting more volunteers amid struggles statewide and nationwide to fill volunteer fire departments.\n\"We got to get people in here,\" Dobson said. \"We've got to get these trucks out. And I think that the way the town's growing, if we don't grow with it, then we're failing ourselves.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "OFFICERS WANTED: Mid-Shore law enforcement grapples with recruitment, retention\n\n January 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 1400\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In his 48 years with the department, Dorchester County Sheriff James Phillips says the current landscape of law enforcement recruiting is the \"absolute worst\" he's ever seen.His department historically had applications on file at all times, but in recent years, the number of applicants has severely dwindled.\nPhillips said while he loves his career, he understands why many are hesitant to become police officers.\n\"If it were me today, and I was starting over again, I'd probably go and try to be a paid firefighter somewhere,\" Phillips said, \"because their schedules are better, they make good money and they're not under the scrutinization that we are.\"\nFor Phillips, increased state oversight on police officer conduct and a social shift in how the career is viewed by the general public have both negatively impacted the recruitment and retention of officers on the Eastern Shore.\nOther sheriffs and police chiefs have cited those same state oversight actions, along with growing competition between agencies and a decline in quality applicants as reasons why smaller departments are struggling to staff at 100%.\nEaston Police Department Deputy Chief Greg Wright says \"police officers that were once held on the pedestal as being heroes are now villains.\"\n\"I think that all the negative talk that's broadcasted across the nation does affect these small agencies,\" Wright said. \"There's larger agencies that we've talked to that talk about their struggles, because they're a thousand short of officers. But when you scale that down to a 48-man agency, 10 is a quarter of your agency.\"\nSTATE ACTIONSMaryland's Police Accountability Act of 2021 ushered in a new era of police reform, requiring counties to have police accountability boards and repealing the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights. It came the year after George Floyd's murder by a Minneapolis police officer and calls for reform to prevent police brutality.\nWright believes the enacted reform has positive aspects, but he worries that officers feel the waning trust from the public.\n\"You feel like you can't be trusted,\" he said. \"They don't trust us to do the job.\"\nIn Easton, the police department has 43 of 48 slots full. Wright says the town has always been supportive of its police, and in his 37 years in Easton, he's never felt that community support evaporate.\nWright and Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble each mentioned local support is critical to the success of small departments. The Talbot County Sheriff's Office is at 47 of 48 slots, and Gamble says some of that is due to \"lateral\" transfers — officers choosing Talbot over other nearby departments.\nHowever, multiple sheriffs and chiefs on the Eastern Shore separately raised concerns about the Maryland attorney general's Independent Investigations Division, which investigates all police-involved deaths such as high-speed chases.\nSince its inception in 2021, the division has investigated 65 police-related deaths, according to data on its website. A fatal vehicle pursuit in Easton last July — which involved both county deputies and Easton officers — is still under investigation.\nWright says there's no doubt that it's in the back of officers' minds when conducting chases and \"could delay their response.\" Phillips said it not only affects how many applicants Dorchester receives, but also how long current law enforcement employees remain.\n\"I've had several officers that could've worked longer, but as soon as they got their time then were able to retire, they retired just to get away from it,\" Phillips said.\nCambridge-Dorchester Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 27 President Thomas Hurley believes the state's actions are hurting recruitment and retention.\n\"You have to get them in the door, you have to keep them, and when they get old like me, you have to get rid of them,\" Hurley said. \"The only thing that's working right now is retirement.\"\nHurley — a retired Cambridge officer of 30 years — said he sees officers leaving \"all the time now\" and that some \"feel like they can't be cops.\"\n\"Absolutely it affects their job performance,\" Gamble said of the investigations. \"Proactive policing in Maryland is dying. Proactive policing is traffic enforcement, it's DWI enforcement, it's drug enforcement. It's dying. People don't want to go into those units in some of these larger departments.\"\n\"Cops are going to shut down,\" Gamble later said. \"They're going to do what they do in the metro areas. They answer the 911 calls and no more.\"\nLast month, Attorney General Anthony Brown announced the indictment of two Anne Arundel County police officers in connection to a fatal 2023 chase. It was the division's first time charging an officer since the state passed a bill in 2023 giving the attorney general prosecutorial power in the investigations instead of local state's attorneys.\nThe attorney general's office declined a request for comment. In 2023, Brown voiced his support for that bill, noting that the Independent Investigations Division has \"a team of experienced criminal prosecutors and investigators\" and the measure to ensure independence and transparency \"would fall in line with police accountability in many other states.\"\n\"The public should have confidence that prosecution decisions are made in an impartial manner, by people who do not work together or rely on each other professionally or personally,\" Brown wrote in a letter addressed to Maryland House Judiciary Committee Chair Luke Clippinger.\n{h3 style=\"text-align: center \"}PATH FORWARD{/h3}\nWhile legislative decisions have drawn worries that police recruiting may only become more difficult, law enforcement leaders are also aware of challenges such as applicant quality, salaries and tight competition.\nIn Caroline County, Sheriff Donnie Baker noted that agencies in Delaware create serious competition in terms of hiring.\nSgt. Timothy Maloney of the Milford Police Department, around 20 miles from the Maryland border, said his department sees a \"consistent\" one to two Maryland officers apply during each hiring cycle.\nThe Caroline County Sheriff's Office has 46 of 48 positions staffed. Baker said many officers are working overtime to provide coverage in the towns of Ridgely and Greensboro.\nRidgely has been without a police department since it was suspended by the town last March, while Greensboro is down to Chief Lenox Trams as its lone officer.\nCambridge Police Department Chief Justin Todd said the hiring process remains \"strict,\" and that many applicants fail background checks or the police academy.\nTodd, though, has seen improvement in the last few years. Currently, 36 of 40 positions are filled in Cambridge, compared to 29 in the summer of 2022, despite the department's $56,000 starting salary for officers in the academy being slightly below Dorchester County ($57,458) and other agencies.\n\"The competition per agency is so strong,\" Todd said. \"You have different agencies that make more money, say, than us. So it's a challenge for us to recruit the good officers.\"\nThis year, the Cambridge chief says the goal is to increase recruitment at job fairs, colleges and universities. He already feels the City of Cambridge and its council has been supportive of the police department's efforts.\n\"We know there's qualified applicants and great people out there that want to be officers,\" Todd said. \"I think that we just need to promote ourselves better.\"\nMaryland State Police leaders are similarly focusing on recruitment. Lt. Col. Scott Keyser, chief of MSP's Support Services Bureau, said the department is \"incredibly aggressive,\" noting it went to 558 events and contacted more than 19,000 applicants last year.\nMSP is authorized to have 1,564 troopers and there are currently 155 vacancies, Keyser said. He said the department's unique task is recruiting amid what is a \"rigorous\" and \"daunting\" hiring process.\n\"We're casting a wide net, just as far as we can go to get anybody that might be pursuing a career in law enforcement,\" Keyser said. \"We want to bring them to the Maryland State Police.\"\nIn Easton, Wright said it's difficult to compete with MSP, though the town focuses on an appealing pension plan and other perks to recruit. State troopers start at a $68,000 salary upon training graduation, which is around $5,000 to $10,000 more than many departments on the Mid-Shore.\nIn terms of a path forward for recruiting, Wright sees it as a \"reset button.\" Since George Floyd's death, Wright believes all officers have been viewed in \"the same light,\" which has affected both public perception and desire to become an officer.\n\"We have to gain the trust, and we probably have to start young again,\" Wright said. \"As they grow up, let them see that we're not the monsters that the news or the parents or society's making us look to be.\"\n\"We have no choice. We have to regain our fanbase,\" he continued. \"And make people interested and excited about doing the job.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Police said the temperature at that time was 88 degrees Fahrenheit but felt like 100 degrees Fahrenheit and the children were sweating \"profusely.\"\nPolice said both children vomited from heat exposure before getting transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Cambridge for further evaluation.\nAccording to Maryland court records, Lucas and Delcid-Aguilar were each placed on probation before judgement during a pre-trial conference on Jan. 13. This means the court has deferred any entry of conviction or finding of guilt and placed the defendants on probation.\nThe supervised probation will last two years and includes standard conditions, according to court documents. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

First responders arrived to find significant damage and active fire at the facility.\nThe cause of the explosion has not been identified by officials.\nAccording to emergency dispatch communications, the explosion reportedly originated in the building's extraction room. Multiple witnesses reported hearing the blast, with emergency services receiving numerous 911 calls from the area.\nThe 3,350-square-foot commercial facility formerly housed operations for Munters, a Swedish-owned international company that manufactures climate control solutions. However, employees on site gave contact information for PharmaCann, which, according to its website, is \"one of the country's largest vertically integrated cannabis companies, providing safe, reliable, top-quality cannabis products.\"\nEmployees for PharmaCann said they could not comment further due to the \"sensitive nature of their business.\"\nKent Island Volunteer Fire Department Chief Buddy Thomas advised additional support from Anne Arundel and Dorchester counties' hazmat teams was requested due to the presence of hazardous materials.\nLocal volunteer fire departments from Kent Island, Grasovnille, Romancoke, Goodwill, United Communities and Queenstown responded, along with units from Queen Anne's County Department of Emergency Services and the Naval District Fire Department in Annapolis.\nSprinklers contained the fire, and crews were able to further extinguish with the fire with no involvement of nearby businesses, an official on the scene told reporters.\nOfficials said the site was no longer a hazmat concern by late afternoon.

    "content": "'A cautionary tale': Problems with hydrants, water during L.A. fires brings infrastructure, preparedness to forefront\n\n January 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: News \n \n 1200\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n There are an estimated 9 million fire hydrants in the U.S.Some hydrants ran dry and failed to operate during the recent raging wildfires that decimated Malibu, Pacific Palisades and other parts of Los Angeles because of water pressure and water supplies problems.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom — who has faced significant criticism along with Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass over the fires — has ordered investigations into what went wrong with the fires, including the issues with hydrants losing pressure and not working.\nJeff Wenninger, CEO of Law Enforcement Consultants LLC (a public safety advisory firm) and a former Los Angeles Police Department lieutenant, says other communities should take heed of the Southern California fires.\n\"The Los Angeles wildfires are a cautionary tale for every community, showing that preparedness is non-negotiable,\" Wenninger said. \"One key lesson is the importance of maintaining critical infrastructure. Fire hydrants, reservoirs, and water systems must be inspected and repaired regularly.\"\nHe pointed to tree trimming in the Los Angeles urban forest and a local reservoir that was empty at the time of the fires earlier this month.\nWenninger said Los Angeles has the largest tree count in the country, with 700,000 trees and 6,500 miles of tree-lined streets.\n\"But tree trimming happens on a 15-year cycle—far too long in fire-prone areas. Nearby communities trim every 2–5 years, significantly reducing their risk. This is a clear area where improvement is both possible and necessary,\" he said.\n\"Then, there's the failure of the Santa Ynez Reservoir, which sat empty for over a year due to a torn cover awaiting repair. Fixing it would've cost $130,000—a fraction of the damages caused by the fires,\" he said.\nWenninger said a regular inspection and maintenance regime as well as smart technologies that can detect water and firefighting infrastructure problems should be looked at in California and across the country.\nMitch Francis, a Beverly Hills-based real estate developer and author who delves into policy matters, said communities need to look at and potentially up their current funding and resource levels for water reserves, firefighting equipments and forest and brush management.\n\"Building methodologies and codes must be restructured to move away from building with flammable materials. Building wood-frame structures is tantamount to building with gasoline. We have to build with more nonflammable materials such as concrete and steel,\" Francis said.\nHe also said there could be reimagined volunteer fire departments in local neighborhoods to help battle blazes\n\"We have to reinstate and proliferate the old idea of volunteer fire departments, but on an extremely local level of small communities, down to even just a few blocks. Small enclaves of homeowners can own their own water/hose truck and be trained in maintaining and using it,\" Francis said.\nYear-round vigilance\nFire departments and local governments across the country are also watching and looking to learn lessons from the California fires, which continue to spark in the Los Angeles and San Diego area.\nIn Sarasota County on Florida's west coast, county officials said the California fires reinforce the need for year-round mitigation and clearings for fire-prone areas, year-around monitoring and maintenance of water infrastructure and shows the need for brushfire training and mutual aid emergency planning with other jurisdictions.\nSarasota County, which has a population of more than 469,000 people, operates 7,800 fire hydrants in unincorporated areas and 1,400 miles of water mains.\n\"All potable water supply mains, back-flow preventers, and fire hydrants are approved, inspected, and maintained by the Sarasota County Public Utilities Department,\" the county said in a statement\nThe Florida county abides by National Fire Protection Association standards that calls for fire hydrants to be inspected annually and after each use.\n'Prevention and preparation'\nTakami Clark, spokesperson for the city of Bozeman in Montana, said her city is also watching the California fires unfold.\n\"We recognize that wildfire is a major concern and our best strategies to deal with this growing problem are prevention and preparation,\" Clark said.\nThe Montana city of more than 57,300 people has roughly 3,100 fire hydrants and 350 miles of water mains that are supplied by four water tanks with 16 million gallons of storage.\nThe city's water and sewer division maintains the hydrants and mains.\nBozeman officials said they conduct leak detection surveys and inspections, including to make sure they are working in the wintertime.\n\"We try to accomplish one-third of our hydrants each year for this task. We also flow about a one-fourth of our fire hydrants each year and flow test random spots of another 5% of our system each year,\" Clark said.\nClark said Bozeman has not had any problems with its hydrants, noting that the city only utilizes two pump stations to get water to higher elevations.\nActionable lessons\nRebekah Thurston, public information officer for the Wilmington Fire Department in North Carolina said the agency \"directly inspected 6,294 fire hydrants\" in 2024 and any repairs are done promptly.\n\"This includes both public hydrants owned by the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority (CFPUA) and private hydrants,\" she said. The North Carolina city has a population of close 122,700 people.\n\"Our hydrant management software uses GPS for precise location tracking, records hydrant details, captures maintenance needs, and includes a comprehensive inspection checklist,\" Thurston said, adding that inspections are conducted throughout the year.\nShe said WFD conducts post-incident reviews of major national and international disasters and weather events.\n\"These reviews are essential for enhancing safety, fostering continuous improvement, and identifying actionable lessons to improve future responses,\" she said.\n'You're vulnerable'\nMichael Coffey, a partner with New York-based law firm Coffey Modica LLP (who previously served as fire commissioner and on the city council in Norwalk, Connecticut), said local governments need to look if they are doing enough emergency preparedness for wildfires and other natural disasters and make sure water systems and other infrastructure are in working conditions.\n\"This is an epic failure of a lot of different agencies,\" Coffey said, of the California wildfires.\nCoffey said working fire hydrants are tied to insurance premiums for nearby. He said water infrastructure isn't always high on government spending lists, but municipalities and counties need to take fresh and regular looks at those needs.\n\"Infrastructure is not sexy. People don't get jazzed up about it,\" Coffey said.\nHe said communities also need to look at building codes (including materials used for housing and commercial buildings), zoning, current and future challenges with water rights and insurance quandaries with fire seasons getting longer and more destructive hurricanes and other storms due to weather changes.\nEric Brown, founder and CEO of Orlando-based Imperio Consulting and former U.S. Army Green Beret, puts fighting fires in military terms.\n\"There's a tenet I've carried with me from my time in Special Forces: You're only as strong as your supply lines. In the context of firefighting, that means your water infrastructure must be rock-solid,\" Brown said.\nHe said the lessons of Los Angeles should be \"to shore up\" water delivery systems and infrastructure and be on the watch for aging hydrants and pipes and insufficient or fluctuating water pressure.\nHe said local governments need to collaborate more closely with utilities and treat water infrastructure as a \"critical asset.\"\n\"When the fires raged, every second counted. Without robust water pressure and well-maintained hydrants, firefighters are effectively sent into battle with half their ammunition. Communities and fire departments across the country should take note: If your infrastructure can't handle peak demand at a moment's notice, you're vulnerable,\" Brown said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The backup generator at the school offered limited heat, and the school stayed up due to the outages being widespread in the area.\nColonel Richardson Middle School and Colonel Richardson High School also lost power. Both schools stayed open with backup generators but gave student drivers the choice to go home. They also granted parents the opportunity to come pick up their kids.\nColonel Richardson High school canceled final exams on Thursday due to the outages.\n\"I know it. It caused some havoc in a few of our schools, Breeding said. \"I think Colonel Richardson Middle, Colonel Richardson High, and Greensboro Elementary had to react and make some changes. But I think all in all we got through it okay.\"\nCaroline County and the town of Denton offered warming shelters for those without power.

By a unanimous vote, town councilmembers approved a resolution for the stop signs.\nCurrently, at the intersection of Brookletts Avenue and South Harrison Street, vehicles driving on Harrison Street do not stop, while vehicles traveling on Brookletts do.\nVan Emburgh's recommendation indicated that Easton's crash data dashboard showed five crash incidents at the intersection occurring between 2018 and 2023. Three were \"property damage incidents\" and two were \"injury incidents.\"\nAt Brookletts Avenue and Hanson Street, stop signs halt drivers on Hanson Street but not Brookletts Avenue. According to crash data, between 2018 and 2023, there was one crash incident involving five people at the intersection.\n\"I know that we've had multiple conversations and emails and stuff about some of the complaints of traffic and stuff on Brookletts,\" Interim Town Manager Alan Lowrey said Tuesday. \"And this is an opportunity to try to address that to see if implementing these four-way stops will improve some of that accident data and speed concerns.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "State could improve juvenile justice system\n\n January 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPHEN RIDEOUT | Section: Columns \n \n 759\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The first juvenile court was founded in 1899 in Chicago. Since then, the states have passed laws that created their own juvenile court systems. These are broad systems that function differently within each state. That impacts similar cases in different ways.So, in one state a child of a certain age automatically can be treated as an adult depending on the crime charged while in another state that same child would go through a hearing in the juvenile court to determine probable cause and if a judicial officer felt the case should remain in juvenile court or go to adult court for trial and treatment as an adult.\nAfter I retired from the bench in 2004, I began consulting in states to help them improve how their systems worked for children and families with a focus on local collaboration efforts among courts, child welfare agencies, lawyers and service agencies to help improve outcomes.\nFrom my experience as a judge in Virginia and my consulting work around the country, some states have confusing and sometimes counterproductive laws for the treatment of juveniles tried for delinquent offenses or crimes. Maryland is one of them.\nTo that end, what follows is an explanation of just one way that Maryland could improve its juvenile justice system. It is not, however, intended to say that the proposed legislation that the General Assembly is considering is the right answer. It is meant to offer an alternative that might work better for everyone.\nIn Virginia, where I was a juvenile and domestic relations district court judge, the decision for treating a youth as an adult was left to the juvenile court judge after he or she made a determination of probable cause that the child committed the offense, reviewed a report prepared by the juvenile justice agency on the child's background and court history and heard other evidence that the parties wanted to present.\nThe judge then decided if the evidence supported the removal of the case to adult court or not. No matter what the decision was, either the commonwealth attorney or the defense attorney could appeal that decision to the Circuit Court for a new hearing by a different judge.\nThe Virginia process worked well and efficiently, and those cases that were removed to Circuit Court were done with a more complete understanding of what happened and who may have done what. It also allowed the juvenile court judge to detain the youth in a juvenile detention facility where services were available rather than in an adult jail, where he or she should have been held separate from the adult population.\nThe concern that I have about the Maryland process is that the state's attorney can have limited information about the crime and alleged perpetrator and his or her background. The decision can be made based on public outrage that may not be founded on facts but rather, nowadays, on social media.\nI recall cases that I heard that would have met the Maryland standard for trial as an adult that did not, in my opinion, warrant removal to Circuit Court. One involved a youth with no prior court involvement who was handed a gun while riding in a car with four other youth, one of whom was his cousin, who was sitting in the front seat of the car. The defendant was holding the gun when it discharged accidentally and killed his cousin.\nIn Maryland, given his age, from my understanding of Maryland law, it would have gone to Circuit Court for trial as an adult; and he would have been held in jail rather than a juvenile detention facility.\nAnother case involved what would have been a school yard fistfight. The commonwealth attorney sought to remove that case involving several youths to Circuit Court. While there was probable cause for the removal of most of them, there was no probable cause as to one and the cause of death was a blow to the back of deceased youth's head when his head hit on some steps after he was hit one time with a fist.\nSome of the youth had prior records with the court and so their cases went to Circuit Court for trial as adults while I kept some in juvenile court and found no probable cause as to one youth. Appeals were allowed for all those cases for new determinations by our Circuit Court.\nDespite opposition by state's attorneys to a change in the law, I would urge the members of the General Assembly to work to improve the current law by supporting reasonable changes such as the process in Virginia. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Will state lawmakers regulate police drones?\n\n January 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: PAUL KIEFER Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 1052\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — On an afternoon in mid-January, a Montgomery County police drone tracked a shoplifting suspect as he made his way from a Wheaton CVS to the entrance of a nearby Metro station, where a patrol unit intercepted and arrested him.Police flight records show that the drone, piloted by officers at a command center in Rockville, then returned to its station on a nearby rooftop to await the next 911 call.\nThe drone is one of four operated by the Montgomery County Department of Police. The year-old drone response program is the first of its kind in Maryland, with drones stationed in Gaithersburg, Silver Spring and Wheaton. The drones have responded to nearly 2,000 calls since the program's launch, often reaching the scene before police officers get there.\n\"We hear the emergency as you're describing it, and we can just send the drone,\" said Commander Jason Cokinos, who leads the department's drone program. \"We're cheating time.\"\nReactions to the program are mixed, with some observers enthusiastic about the flexibility it provides and others concerned about the technology's privacy implications. This year, Maryland lawmakers are considering regulating the use of drones for police responses before a more widespread adoption of the technology occurs.\nSome Maryland lawmakers worry that current state law doesn't offer clear guidance on how or when law enforcement can use drones as the first or only responders to emergency calls.\nThe police are operating in a legal gray area, said Del. Robin Grammer Jr., a Republican representing Baltimore County and a member of Maryland's House Judiciary Committee.\n\"Now, it's reactive enforcement,\" Grammer said. \"You can come back to this moment in time in a year, two years from now, and some jurisdiction's going to be sending out drones proactively. That's not the world I want to live in.\"\nMontgomery County police say they reached out to community members and civil liberties groups to develop rules for their use of drones and the storage of aerial surveillance footage before implementing their program in November 2023.\nBut it wasn't until this month that the Maryland General Assembly began weighing whether to set state-level rules for more expansive drone programs. House lawmakers summoned police and a spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union to Annapolis last Wednesday to review Montgomery County's program.\nIn that meeting, Cokinos emphasized that his department has taken a narrow approach to aerial surveillance.\n\"We want to have the least amount of visual intrusion (on) anybody on the ground level that we can,\" Cokinos told lawmakers.\nPolice only dispatch the drones in response to emergency calls involving \"safety issues,\" Cokinos said, and they do not send drones to calls without a suspect present. Those can range from assaults in progress to children playing hockey on potentially thin ice, according to the department's flight records.\nPilots do not point the drones' cameras downward nor begin recording until they reach the scene, he added, and the drones do not record audio or use facial recognition technology. Members of the public can view details of drone responses within 24 hours of a deployment.\nCokinos said that the drone's live feeds have helped officers avoid at least one confrontation with an armed suspect. He argued that the use of the drone helped to de-escalate a response that \"very well could have resulted in an officer-involved shooting.\"\nWhile the drones aren't a replacement for police officers, Cokinos said, the department has responded to nearly 300 emergency calls with drones alone since November 2023. If there's no need for a police officer, he said, they don't dispatch one.\nMore widespread adoption of the technology by law enforcement agencies appears to be just over the horizon.\nAs the prices of drones fall, other law enforcement agencies across the state will likely be able to launch their own programs for far less than the roughly $773,000 the Montgomery County Department of Police spent last year. The FAA could offer a less costly waiver to fly surveillance drones over large areas, potentially enabling smaller departments to launch their own programs. The Prince George's County Police Department is currently considering whether to launch its own first responder drone program.\nBut civil libertarians say Maryland lawmakers should get ahead of that trend.\nJay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the ACLU's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, warned lawmakers against allowing the use of surveillance drones to proliferate without guardrails.\nLaw enforcement agencies have used drones in less sophisticated ways for years, Stanley said, but so-called \"Drone as First Responder\" programs raise a much larger range of privacy and transparency concerns for civil liberties groups.\n\"When there's a brand new technology that's controversial … government agencies tend to be on their best behavior,\" Stanley said. But as the technology becomes more ubiquitous and scrutiny subsides, he added, \"We could see it expand to routine patrols to cover an entire city.\"\nStanley also underscored that other law enforcement agencies may not adopt Montgomery County's transparency mechanisms and privacy protections.\n\"[As] this technology spreads to other counties in Maryland, and perhaps someday all counties in Maryland, are they all going to have these same protections?\" he asked.\nEven Montgomery County's program, he added, may still evolve in ways lawmakers do not anticipate.\nGrammer, the Republican lawmaker, shares Stanley's concerns.\n\"These marginal benefits — I don't think they outweigh the costs of, frankly, living in a society where the state's surveilling you 24/7 in 10 different ways,\" Grammer said.\nAfter the Baltimore Police Department launched a controversial aerial surveillance program to capture images of nearly the entire city in 2019, Grammer introduced legislation to require law enforcement to obtain warrants before using aerial surveillance to gather evidence in criminal investigations. Despite reintroducing the bill each year, Grammar hasn't managed to pass it.\nGrammer told Capital News Service he approached fellow lawmakers for signatures on the latest iteration of his bill ahead of last Wednesday's hearing.\n\"I'm talking with people in the committee on both sides of the aisle that are uneasy about how we didn't take this unmanned aerial surveillance (and) put guardrails there,\" he told CNS.\nThough the General Assembly has yet to act on the subject, Stanley says Maryland may actually be ahead of other state legislatures by taking an interest in the Montgomery County program.\n\"I'm not aware of any other state legislatures that have begun to really think through the questions that the DFR programs bring forth,\" he said.\nSo far, legislation has yet to materialize in Maryland's General Assembly. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Using emergency power from generators and solar panels, they communicated with 145 stations — 18 were amateur radio satellites.\nWith a refurbished school bus and a camper, they operated from five stations, classified as mobile, including the emergency trailer EMCOMM 1, which contained equipment from the school's ham radio classes taught by WKHS station manager Chris Singleton, a KARS member for 30 years.\nEMCOMM 1 serves as backup when regular emergency dispatch fails.\nThis was part of the American Radio Relay League's Winter Field Day training exercise. Radio operators set up field operations in remote locations \"with the aim to improve their preparedness for disasters, enhancing their operational abilities in adverse conditions.\"\nFor KARS members, ham radio is a lifelong passion, but disaster preparation remains the priority.\nKARS President Chris Cote cited Hurricane Irma in September 2017, when 7.5 million homes lost electricity. Ham radio could become the only communication mode in such situations.\nInside Cote's bus, three stations operate off a 12-volt battery charging from a solar array — two radio with VHF/UHF capabilities and one satellite communications. They reached operators nationwide without external power all weekend.\nThe event reached young people when Singleton's KCHS broadcasting students operated the ham radio. Junior, Jordana Capp, in her second year of broadcasting, contacted Washington state over a Russian satellite connection.\nJunior, Aidan Maxey, also in his second broadcasting year, made contact with New York. He plans to pursue media studies at Syracuse, impressed with ther program.\nSenior, Alayna Brown, featured on Radio World's Jan. 1 cover, contacted Tennessee. Brown, already certified by the Society of Broadcast Engineers, was recently accepted to Belmont in Nashville, where she plans to work with multitrack recording systems, live stage and master tapes.\nAll three students became interested in ham radio certification after attending the ARRL School Round up on Oct. 21. Brown had communicated with Russia during that event.\nSingleton celebrated his students' interest in this vital skill. He had worked for 15 years to engage youth in ham radio, noting that combining broadcasting skills, live audio, music production and SBE certification opens many career paths.\n\"They are amazed,\" Singleton said. \"They don't get many opportunities to work with this very specialized equipment. It is a rare opportunity.\"\nKARS members continue generating youth interest in ham radio by teaching them radio operating skills and attending the Winter Field Day Contest. They anticipate the ARRL School Club Roundup Contest Feb. 10-14 as well.\nOn Sunday, as Cote's drone photographed their stations, KARS member Bobby Kelley helped newest member Alberto Larotonda dismantle his homemade antenna built from a ski pole, copper pipes and a drywall mud bucket.\n\"My little setup just shows anybody can do this with enough imagination,\" said Larotonda, who joined two months ago.\nCote said while no one wants to think disasters like those in California or North Carolina will strike locally, testing equipment in harsh conditions benefits the county; ensuring first responders that it is battle-tested.\nFor more information about KARS, visit k3ars.org/kars/. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hoarding turned deadly: Mother takes plea deal in Christmas Day 2023 fire that killed her daughter\n\n January 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1125\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The mother of a 10-year-old girl who was killed in a townhouse fire near Elkton on Christmas Day 2023 is facing up to 10 years in prison, after accepting a plea deal in a criminal case in which prosecutors maintain that overloaded electrical outlets, hoarding conditions and a lack of smoke detectors contributed to the youngster's death.The defendant — Theresa Ann Moats, 41 — entered an Alford plea to involuntary manslaughter, the most serious charge in the case, on Jan. 24 during a Cecil County Circuit Court hearing.\nIn an Alford plea, the defendant maintains his or her innocence but, at the same time, he or she does not dispute the incriminating evidence possessed by the state.\nProsecutors agreed to drop 11 related charges against Moats, including reckless endangerment and neglect of a child, as part of the plea agreement reached by Assistant State's Attorney Gavin Patashnick and Moats' lawyers, Assistant Public Defenders Denise Winston and Emily Gillis.\nCecil County Circuit Court Judge William W. Davis Jr. accepted Moats' Alford plea and then, after Patashnick read aloud the prosecution's statement of facts, the judge found her guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\nAlso part of the plea deal, Davis will wait four months before sentencing Moats, who will remain on house arrest until then on an unsecured $50,000 bond posted in late May after she had spent approximately six weeks in jail on no bond.\nMoats' daughter — Kyleigh Nicole Treadway — perished in the swift-moving, two-alarm blaze that started accidentally inside 317 Willow Dr. in the Winding Brook neighborhood, northeast of Elkton, shortly before 7:30 a.m. on Dec. 25, 2023.\nKyleigh, who had been sleeping in a second-floor bedroom, was trapped inside that burning townhouse after her mother, her grandmother, her two older brothers and her mother's boyfriend — Kevin Neal Summerfield, now 41 — had escaped.\nAs firefighters battled the blaze, Moats alerted Capt. William Ryan of Singerly Volunteer Fire Company that \"her baby was right inside the front door.\" Firefighters tried to rescue Kyleigh, but the \"magnitude and intensity of the fire\" prevented them from entering the house. Kyleigh's body later was found near the front door.\nIncluding Kyleigh's five surviving family members, the blaze displaced 17 residents in the three adjacent townhouses damaged by the fire.\nIn March, a Cecil County grand jury handed up indictments against Moats and Summerfield, charging them with involuntary manslaughter and numerous other offenses.\nSummerfield's jury trial is set to start and Feb. 3 and is expected to last five days. Before taking the plea deal, Moats had been scheduled to tried along with Summerfield.\nDuring her plea hearing on Friday, Moats stood behind the defense table and wiped tears from her eyes with tissue paper as Patashnick read aloud the prosecution's statement of fact.\nThe prosecutor reported that an \"overload situation\" existed in the dwelling's electrical system because multiple extension cords inside an 8'-by-8' first-floor addition at the rear of house had been connected to each other to bypass non-functioning outlets and to reach operational power sources. Court records show that cords were plugged into a power strip.\nAlong those lines, Patashnick noted that a freezer and refrigerator were plugged into electrical outlets that weren't designed to handle the power demand of such heavy-duty appliances.\nOne of the power cords drawing electricity from inside of the townhouse snaked out of the dwelling and was connected to a backyard grill, according to the prosecutor, who also reported that some cords ran behind appliances.\nExacerbating the overload situation, strewn clothing, trash and other combustible debris — including a coating of animal feces left by numerous pet dogs and cats — covered the electrical cords in the back room, according to the prosecutor.\nCourt records show that Moats admitted that as many as 35 pets — mostly dogs and cats — were kept inside the dwelling at one time.\nThe prosecutor told the judge that \"an extensive amount of hoarding conditions\" existed inside the 1,100-square-foot, two-story townhouse. He explained that boxes of clothing, bags of trash and other miscellaneous items cluttered the dwelling.\nIn addition to making it difficult to walk out of the townhouse or anywhere inside of the dwelling, the hoarding conditions worsened an already existing fire hazard created by the improper use of electrical cords and outlets.\nThe trash, pet feces, clothing and other combustible items \"increased the magnitude and intensity of the fire\" caused by the electrical overload, according to Patashnick.\nAlso a factor, the townhouse lacked smoke detectors.\nThe prosecutor reported that autopsy results indicated that Kyleigh had 0.3 grams of an antidepressant that aids sleep in her system and that her death was attributed to smoke inhalation and burns over 90 percent of her body.\nPatashnick summarized that the involuntary manslaughter charge against Moats hinges on her neglect of the townhouse and of Kyleigh.\nCourt records indicate that two Cecil County Department of Animal Services officers went to 317 Willow Dr. on Dec. 20, 2023 — five days before the fatal fire there — and impounded 14 dogs and four cats that showed signs of neglect and abuse after receiving a complaint.\nOfficers heard \"excessive barking\" when they knocked on the door and, once inside the dwelling, they \"detected the smell of animal urine and feces\" and noticed that a vast majority of the floor was covered in caked animal waste, court records show.\nAfter impounding the 18 animals, officers, \"planned to make a report to Child Protective Services, as the children in the home were subjected to poor living conditions,\" according to court records.\nAdministrators at Cecil Manor Elementary School in Elk Mills, where Kyleigh was a fourth-grader, also noticed signs of possible neglect and made referrals to the Cecil County Department of Social Services after Kyleigh moved with her family from Delaware and started attending that school, court records show.\nThose school officials reported to investigators that Kyleigh's hair and clothes emanated the smell of animal waste and that fellow students avoided the girl because of the pungent odor, according to court records.\nThe school nurse routinely washed Kyleigh's clothes and washed and brushed the girl's unkempt hair, investigators said. Staff members replaced Kyleigh's backpack twice because cats at her residence urinated and vomited on top of her previous backpacks, investigators added.\n\"Kyleigh's hygiene issues were described as 'terrible' and they needed to be addressed 3-4 times per day. Kyleigh stated to teachers that she had a 'ton' of pets and that she loved them,\" court records show.\nSchool staff attempted to contact Moats by email and by phone, but there was \"absolutely no involvement to address concern brought forth by the school,\" according to court records.\nCourt records also indicate that, in the wake of townhouse fire, Moats told investigators that \"this all could have been preventable,\" and that she \"felt bad and felt it was her fault.\"\nIn addition, according to those court records, Moats told investigators that she missed Kyleigh. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the report, \"the complaint topics alleged an officer's rude and discourteous behavior, a police chase, use of force, conduct unbecoming, and sexual assault.\"\nEight of nine complaints were closed and exonerated, with one complaint not being investigated by the Police Accountability Board because it involved a police chief, thus it was beyond the board's purview.\nThe county secured another Police Accountability, Community, and Transparency grant from the state to cover expenses for 2025. Costs covered by the $153,597 grant include expenses, citizen training, payroll for the board members and attorney fees.\nIn addition, the fund will go toward body cameras for officers, LAPro software renewal and Lexipol and Police One academy software.\n\"Thank you for your service on the board,\" Commission President Travis Breeding said. \"I know at times its a thankless job, and we really appreciate the time you and your members from the ACC (Administrative Charging Committee) and the PAB put in.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After retiring, he became a national and international coach.\nHis wife, Natalya Gudin, who is also a skating coach, told ABC News that her husband was accompanying Kay and Yang on the trip while she stayed home with the other skaters.\n\"I lost everything,\" Gudin told ABC News. \"I lost my husband, I lost my students, I lost my friends.\"\nKay and Yang were partners in pairs skating and in November, they won first place at a U.S. Figure Skating competition in Texas.\nThey were in Wichita, Kansas, this week to attend a national development camp held in conjunction with the U.S. Figure Skating Championships.\n\"It was a lot of fun watching all the skaters at Kansas,\" Yang wrote on Instagram, three days before the fatal plane crash. \"I had a lot of fun sitting with my friends watching amazing skaters! I wish I could watch it all over again!\"\nThe UD skaters were among at least 14 members of the national skating community who were returning from Wichita when the plane crashed. Several were from the Skating Club of Boston and other clubs on the East Coast.\n\"We are heartbroken to learn that figure skaters, along with their families, friends and coaches, are understood to be among those on board. Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this tragedy,\" U.S. Figure Skating said in a statement.\nThe crash happened late Wednesday when an American Airlines plane collided with a military helicopter while landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, officials said. The plane carried 60 passengers and four crew. Three soldiers were aboard the helicopter.\nThere were no survivors.\n\"We are now at the point where we are switching from a rescue operation to a recovery operation,\" said John Donnelly, the fire chief in the nation's capital.\nThe plane was found upside-down in three sections in waist-deep water, and first responders were searching an area of the Potomac as far south as the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, roughly 3 miles south of the airport, Donnelly said. The helicopter wreckage was also found. Images from the river showed boats around the partly submerged wing and the mangled wreckage of the plane's fuselage.\nThe collision is the deadliest U.S. air crash since 2001.\nThere was no immediate word on the cause of the collision, but officials said flight conditions were clear as the jet arrived from Wichita, Kansas, with U.S. and Russian figure skaters and others aboard.\n\"On final approach into Reagan National, it collided with a military aircraft on an otherwise normal approach,\" American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said.\nA top Army aviation official said the Black Hawk crew was \"very experienced\" and familiar with the congested flying that occurs daily around Washington.\n\"Both pilots had flown this specific route before, at night. This wasn't something new to either one of them,\" said Jonathan Koziol, chief of staff for Army aviation. \"Even the crew chief in the back has been in the unit for a very long time, very familiar with the area, very familiar with the routing structure.\"\nDelaware Gov. Matt Meyer called for a full investigation into the crash.\n\"Here in Delaware, we're mourning the loss of former University of Delaware Figure Skating coach Sasha Kirsanov, as well as two youth skaters and their family members who were aboard AA5342,\" Meyer said. \"Lauren's and my thoughts are with the families today as they grapple with this new reality, and we encourage all Delawareans to keep them in your prayers.\"\nSen. Chris Coons also issued a statement of condolences.\n\"I'm devastated to hear the news that at least three Delawareans died during last night's air collision,\" Coons said. \"Sasha Kirsanov, Sean Kay, and Angela Yang went to Wichita to pursue their passion for figure skating. It is a tragedy that none of them returned home to our state. Delaware is a state of neighbors, and tonight we hold all of our neighbors a little closer. My heart goes out to Sasha's wife Natalia, the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club, and every other Delawarean touched by the three of them.\"\nThis article contains information from the Associated Press. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said that informs how the department spends its time patrolling.\n\"We make sure that officers are in those areas as much as possible during that time,\" he said.\nTodd listed the department's continued commitment to community-oriented policing as an accomplishment.\n\"These things, patrolling with purpose and community-oriented policing, will continue as we charge harder to fine-tune it and make it better,\" he said.\nWhen it comes to specific crime stats for 2024, there were 30 aggravated assaults reported. Todd pointed out the \"significant difference\" from 2022 when there were 110 aggravated assaults reported in Cambridge. Compared to 2023, there was a 53% reduction in aggravated assaults in Cambridge in 2024.\nAccording to the report, compared to 2023, burglaries and simple assaults were down 12% and 16%, respectively, in 2024.\nTodd said that like 2023, there were two homicides in Cambridge in 2024. This number is a decrease from seven homicides in 2022.\nTodd said one of the homicides in Cambridge this year was the result of gun violence and the other was a kidnapping in Easton that law enforcement officials believe resulted in a homicide in Cambridge.\nThe number of robberies as well as the number of rapes and sex offenses each increased by 12% in 2024 compared to the previous year. Todd said some of those rape and sex offenses investigations are still open.\nRECRUITMENT AND RETENTIONDuring his presentation to the City Council, Todd also talked about the city's efforts to recruit and keep a full staff, which will continue into 2025.\n\"We're going to recruit, recruit, recruit good quality people that want to invest in the City of Cambridge and be here,\" he said.\nTodd said the city has 36 sworn officers, including a civilian liaison officer. He said they were ready to put three people in the police academy but one didn't make the final interview and the other two determined it wasn't a good fit.\n\"So we're back at the drawing boards,\" he said.\nTodd said the department has seven civilian employees.\n\"That has been significant in helping us do our daily work and customer service as we continue to move along,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Greene will also have to serve 18 months of supervised probation.\nFlamond Woolford Jr., 19, of Cambridge, was sentenced to a total of seven years with three of those years suspended after pleading guilty on Dec. 11 to home invasion and possession of a handgun in a vehicle. Woolford will have to serve two years of supervised probation.\nThe charges stemmed from an incident that led to residents south of Trappe sheltering in place while police searched for four people suspected of firing gunshots.\nTalbot County deputies responding to the shots fired call on March 23, 2024, found a lone subject walking on Howell Point Road. The individual reported being forced into the vehicle in an apparent armed robbery attempt.\nAs deputies and troopers spoke with the individual, a vehicle approached, stopped and put the car in reverse, attempting to flee when a deputy ordered the occupants to show their hands. The car drove into a ditch, and four people got out and fled into the surrounding woods, according to a report from the sheriff's office.\nBoth Greene and Woolford were later charged in the incident. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "For All Seasons gives update on human trafficking in Talbot County\n\n January 31, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 421\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Representatives from For All Seasons say the problem of human trafficking in Talbot County is persisting, though they are seeing positive gains in awareness and detection.During a Talbot County Council meeting Tuesday, Lauren Weber, the nonprofit's vice president of strategy and development, provided an update to council members regarding human and labor trafficking.\n\"It is happening and it's happening here. That continues to be the case,\" Weber said. \" … There's a complexity to human trafficking that it doesn't really know county boundaries.\"\nWeber and Katie Theeke, vice president of marketing and communications, each said the organization has a special role given its wide reach. For All Seasons' presence in the five Mid-Shore counties — Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot — is critical to providing victims with essential services.\n\"We know that human trafficking knows no boundaries and that it affects people of different backgrounds, races, genders,\" Theeke said. \"We have seen several cases come through our doors, and it comes from Talbot County. It comes from neighboring counties. We really aim to be the connector to get those people the help that they need.\"\nCouncil Member Keasha Haythe asked if For All Seasons is seeing a decline in human trafficking numbers. Weber said it's a \"double-edged sword.\"\n\"A year ago we sat in front of you and said, when we look at our rape crisis center data, a good fifth of what was coming in was having at least one indicator of human trafficking,\" Weber said. \" … That persists.\"\nThe organization has noticed a shift in how many people are recognizing signs of human trafficking and making those reports, Weber says.\n\"The folks that are self-referring, we're seeing a decline,\" she said. \"But we're seeing a real rapid incline in folks coming to us and saying, 'Hey, I know more and now I've seen something.'\"\nWeber said that since September, more than 120 people have taken For All Seasons' free, online anti-human trafficking course.\nFor All Seasons is an official regional navigator for the Mid-Shore area, Theeke said, meaning it works on task forces and serves youth and young adults that are victims of trafficking.\nAt the end of the discussion, council members thanked the For All Seasons representatives for their work and presented the organization with a proclamation Tuesday declaring January as National Human Trafficking Awareness Month.\n\"We know that even one victim is too many,\" council Vice President Pete Lesher said. \"We appreciate all that you do both on prevention, but also to develop and take care of those who have been victims.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Organizations on the Shore hosts count of people experiencing homelessness\n\n January 31, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 599\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — From Queen Anne's County to Dorchester County many churches, libraries and senior centers assisted as various organizations hosted a point-in-time, a count of all experiencing unsheltered and sheltered homelessness.In Caroline County alone, approximately 142 people were reported to be in attendance on Wednesday. Jimmy Morris, continuum of care housing specialist for Mid-Shore Behavioral Health, said the count in Dorchester County recorded its highest ever number of people experiencing homelessness. Finalized numbers for the Mid-Shore will not be available for several weeks.\nMorris said large efforts were made to reach this specific population, from media outreach to visiting encampments. He said this larger effort was made due to the growing population of homelessness on the Shore.\nOver the last few years, the population of people experiencing homelessness has skyrocketed on the Eastern Shore, and organizations focused on assisting this population are working to have a proper count in order to better secure funds to provide resources.\nAshley Kessinger, continuum care manager at Mid-Shore Behavioral Health, said this winter the organization's shelters were filled with people trying to stay warm.\n\"It's been a crisis,\" Kessinger said. \"Our shelters are completely full, and they stay full all the time. They're all working off of waitlists. They're all trying to find other ways so that people that come to them, don't have to turn them away. But they're just full and we don't have enough.\"\nAccording to Kessinger, the results of the data gathered by each jurisdiction will be submitted to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and can be used to secure grant funding.\nYvette Robinson, grant manager at Neighborhood Service Center, was distributing information at the Fredrick Douglas room of the Talbot County Free Library in Easton, one of the locations for the county Wednesday. Robinson said homelessness on the Eastern Shore looks different in comparison to homelessness in major cities. One of those contributing factors, she said, is resources.\n\"The numbers are growing, the resources are not,\" Robinson said. \"We rely on community partners to try to collaborate so that we can see what's working, what may not be working …we're just trying to get the information out that there are variable resources.\"\nAccording to Robinson, since Nov. 24, 2024, Neighborhood Service Center has given out 9,000 pounds of food and served over 600 families, a majority of which were homeless.\nKessinger said a contributing factor to the growing homeless population has been a lack of affordable housing on the shore. Many of the people served at Mid-Shore Behavioral Health either have no income or they receive funds from Social Security which can be about $900 a month.\nA lack of affordable housing has made the issue worse but it is the mark of homelessness that will make it difficult to get landlords to consider working on affordable housing alternatives.\nIn her experience, there are some landlords that refuse to help customers that her organization works with because the customers have experienced homelessness. Kessinger said there is an assumption that the customers will be bad tenants or bad people in general.\nFor Kessinger, everyone deserves help and people shouldn't treat those experiencing homelessness differently because of their circumstance because it can happen to anyone at any time.\n\"People think homelessness looks a certain way and we have seen people from all walks of life and it does not look a certain way,\" Kessinger said. \"There's a lot of stigma on the shore about homelessness and some people just don't want to see it. If they come across an encampment or something like that, they just want it to go away. …everyone deserves a chance to have a home.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland man gets 8 years in crossbow killing of girlfriend\n\n February 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 790\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A man who fatally shot his live-in girlfriend with a crossbow arrow inside their Conowingo residence — maintaining that it was an accident — received an eight-year sentence on Tuesday, after a jury had convicted him of involuntary manslaughter but acquitted him of murder and assault two months earlier.Cecil County Circuit Court Administrative Judge Brenda A. Sexton imposed the eight-year sentence on 41-year-old Jeffrey Allen Lander, who also had been found guilty of reckless endangerment. At sentencing, however, that lesser charge merged into Lander's conviction for involuntary manslaughter, which carries a maximum 10-year penalty.\nThe victim — Judy Elizabeth Gee, 45 — was shot through the back inside the couple's residence in the 700 block of Bell Manor Road at approximately 4:40 p.m. on Jan. 14, 2024, causing heavy internal bleeding. An ambulance crew transported Gee to Lancaster General Hospital in Lancaster, Pa., where she died on an operating table at 7:13 p.m., about two and half hours later.\nSexton remarked from the bench Tuesday that Lander's \"conduct was heinous,\" and she agreed with Assistant State's Attorney Robert Sentman's assessment that Lander exhibited a \"lack of remorse or acceptance of responsibility for Gee's death,\" prosecutors summarized.\nSentman, who prosecuted Lander at trial, recommended a maximum 10-year sentence — exceeding state sentencing guidelines that set a penalty range of three to eight years of active incarceration for Lander. Those guidelines are based on a defendant's criminal record, the seriousness of the offense and other factors.\nLander's lawyer, Assistant Public Defender Jason Ricke, requested a sentence at the lower end of state sentencing guidelines.\nLanders will serve his eight-year term in a Maryland Department of Corrections prison, and he received credit for approximately seven months that he spent in jail after his June arrest.\nIn November, at the conclusion of a three-day-long trial, jurors deliberated for approximately four hours before finding Lander guilty of involuntary manslaughter and reckless endangerment.\nInvoluntary manslaughter applies when the defendant unintentionally kills someone while acting with gross negligence, meaning the defendant should have known the risk of his or her actions. Other elements also can apply under the statute.\nThe jury, however, acquitted Lander of second-degree murder, first-degree assault and second-degree assault — criminal offenses that involve an intentional act, to varied degrees. Second-degree murder is punishable by up to 40 years in prison. First-degree assault and second-degree assault carry maximum sentences of 25 years and 10 years respectively.\nAt trial, Sentman maintained that Lander intentionally shot Gee because, during an argument moments earlier, Gee had informed Lander that she was ending their two-year relationship and that she was leaving him.\nAside from Gee, Lander was the only person present when the fatal shooting occurred — and he provided the narrative of the incident to investigators.\nWhile police and paramedics were at the shooting scene, Gee was seated on a couch, with the arrow protruding out the entrance and exit wounds on her upper torso. She was barely conscious and was not alert. Gee wasn't capable of giving investigators her account of the incident.\nThe day of the fatal shooting started for Lander at about 4 p.m., with Gee jolting him awake and starting an argument with him. \"She was kicking me in the knee. It was a rude awakening. I woke up angry,\" Lander told investigators.\nLander volunteered all of that information to investigators at the outset, after he had called 911. But in a police interview about two months later, Lander denied that he and Gee had been arguing directly before the fatal shooting.\nThe defense contended that Lander accidentally shot Gee with the arrow when he tripped over a cat seconds after removing his loaded crossbow from a wall rack in the living room while she was seated on a nearby couch, possibly leaning toward an end table to retrieve something.\nLander, who elected not to testify on his own behalf, told investigators that he thought the crossbow's safety was engaged and that he always stored his crossbow locked and loaded during hunting season.\nIn addition, Lander told investigators that he was preparing to go deer hunting that late afternoon, noting that there was about one hour of daylight left. Lander also told investigators that he liked going into the woods to decompress after confrontations with Gee.\nCecil County Sheriff's Office detectives testified that they believe Lander shot Gee in the \"heat of the moment\" amid the argument and that he immediately experienced regret and emotional aguish, prompting him to call 911.\nRicke, however, categorized the deadly shooting this way when addressing the jury in his opening statement: \"It was a tragic accident — nothing more. It is not a murder. It is not a crime.\"\nPolice arrested and charged Lander on June 28, six months after the incident, at the conclusion of an investigation that included consulting with a crossbow expert. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cleanup launched at former homeless camp in Maryland woods near I-95\n\n February 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 594\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Nearly 30 contracted workers wearing hazmat suits and protective masks and gloves spent about 30 hours collecting garbage left at a former homeless encampment in the woods adjacent to the North East Station Shopping Center, marking the latest step in restricting the property.The cleanup started on Monday morning (Feb. 3) and continued through Thursday, with contractors filling scores of industrial-sized garbage bags by the end of each 7-hour workday. In addition to bottles, cans and other trash, workers gathered the remnants of campsites, including worn blankets, pillows and so forth. Numerous syringes reportedly were found while clearing the area.\nBaltimore-based real estate developer Klein Enterprises, which acquired the 87,006-square-foot North East Station Shopping Center for $11.6 million in 2017, also owns approximately 40 acres of adjacent woods, and that company is paying for the cleanup of the homeless encampment that once occupied that area.\nProblems associated with the homeless people living in those woods grew over time as the number of campers increased, according to North East Police Chief Stephen Yates, who noted that an NEPD patrol officer checked the area at the start of the cleanup project Monday morning to make sure that no homeless people were on the property.\n\"Drug overdoses were occurring more and more in those woods and so were medical emergencies in general. And it is not an easy area for paramedics and police officers to access,\" Yates said, before remarking, \"The concern was for everyone's safety.\"\nThe police chief also reported that trash created by the homeless people started accumulating in the woods and that the number of complaints regarding malicious destruction of property and vandalism also increased, as the number of campsites grew.\nIn addition, according to Yates, his agency frequently received complaints about homeless people panhandling outside stores in the North East Station Shopping Center and disturbing patrons in other ways.\nThe situation reached its boiling point about a year ago, when garbage, rocks and other debris that the homeless people had dropped into an opening after removing a manhole cover clogged a sewer pipe — causing backed-up sewage to spill into the creek.\nIt reportedly cost Klein Enterprises thousands of dollars to repair the damaged pipe.\nBut much worse, the seeped sewage triggered a Maryland Department of Environment investigation. Because the environmental incident occurred on property owned by Klein Enterprises, the MDE levied an \"astronomical fine\" on the company, according to Yates.\nAnd that was the catalyst for Klein Enterprises taking proper measures to get rid of the homeless people in the woods, Yates said.\nFollowing eviction procedures, the company first posted \"no trespassing\" signs in and around the woods and then gave people in that makeshift homeless community notice that they must vacate the property within at least two months, Yates added, noting that circumstances later pushed that deadline back.\nAfter the homeless people were gone, Klein Enterprises was free to embark on the next phase — cleanup of the former campground. Contractors started removing the garbage left behind by the banished homeless people on Monday morning and, as of late Thursday afternoon, it wasn't clear when the cleanup project will end.\nOnce the cleanup is completed, Klein Enterprises will erect a high fence around that entire wooded area, in an effort to keep people from entering the property, Yates said. It also will install security cameras in and around that wooded area, he added.\nThe Cecil Whig reached Klein Enterprises representatives Thursday and asked for more specific information for this story, including the sum of the MDE fine and the cost of the cleanup. As of deadline, however, the Whig had not received that information. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "\"These allegations are despicable': In wake of crematorium scandal, morticians resign, board being reviewed\n\n February 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Matt Wynn mwynn@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 676\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After a scathing report about a White Plains crematorium began circulating in late January, the Maryland State Board of Morticians had several key figures resign after complaints arose of their inaction over the last several years.Brandon Wylie, Michele Kutta and Patrick Thompson, executive members and officers of the board, all resigned under pressure from Gov. Wes Moore (D).\nSoon after their resignation, they were promptly removed from the Maryland Department of Health's website.\nHeaven Bound Cremation Services LLC — located in a White Plains building with beauty salons, a pharmacy and a restaurant — had its license suspended last month after it was determined that \"the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires emergency action,\" the Maryland State Board of Morticians' report said.\nRosa and Brandon Williams, the two operators of the crematorium, were already on probation by the board for prior disciplinary action before the most recent report due to improper storage of human remains.\nAn August 2019 final order said that Rosa Williams had violated several statutory and regulatory provisions by \"commingling cremains, disposing of cremated remains in a receptacle with bio-hazard waste, otherwise improperly storing cremated remains, and failing to send cremated remains to the agent of the decedent.\"\nIn January 2021, it was determined that Williams had failed to comply with the order, which set another two-year probationary term on her.\nThen, in March last year, the Maryland State Board of Morticians' investigator conducted an inspection that revealed \"human bodies in cardboard boxes stacked on top of each other with no support between the boxes, human bodies in ripped body bags with arms and legs hanging out of the body bags, human remains that were not being stored at temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit and blood on the refrigeration unit and bodily fluids on the floor.\"\nBy January this year, not much had changed, according to the report.\nIt was determined that the cremation chamber was not operational and human bodies were \"accumulating rather than being cremated in a timely manner.\"\nAlso found last month, the door to a refrigeration unit was blocked by an accumulation of boxes with bodies, dried blood and fluids were on the floors, bodies were stored in damaged bags, 18 bodies were stored in temperatures not below 40 degrees, \"three visibly decomposing bodies,\" and one decomposing body that had been in the facility since the March 2024 inspection.\nMoore commented on the report, saying, \"Firstly, these allegations are despicable, and those responsible need to be held accountable. I know the board is independent, but they have failed these families and I share in their outrage, and I stand with them in demanding justice. There is an active investigation into this matter, and these families deserve better.\"\nSoon after, he announced a review of the board.\nMoore asked attorney Charles P. Scheeler to lead the review, which will involve a thorough assessment of the board's structure and operations and whether changes to law or regulations are warranted. Scheeler previously served as a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland.\n\"The operational review of Maryland's health professional licensing boards is an important step in ensuring these entities are effectively fulfilling their responsibilities,\" said Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Anne Arundel, Prince George's), who is the chair of the Health Government and Operations Committee. \"Given their critical role in safeguarding public health and maintaining professional standards, it is essential that we fully understand any challenges they may be facing. I appreciate the administration's efforts in undertaking this review.\"\nSouthern Maryland News visited various businesses in the building, with multiple employees having no idea what was occurring right behind them. Most businesses within the building are front-facing, toward Crain Highway; the crematorium is in the back of the facility.\nThe Charles County Department of Health issued an abatement order to the crematorium, while the Maryland Department of Health condemned \"in the strongest terms\" the mistreatment of human remains.\nAnyone who may have questions or need guidance regarding concerns for the remains of a loved one can contact the Maryland Department of Health Board of Morticians and Funeral Directors.

It would also require the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration to work on awareness programs.\nThe changes are meant to help protect people with invisible disabilities during encounters with first responders — a special concern for parents of Black children who may be at higher risk during conflict with police.\n\"The reality of these encounters presents differently when your Black son transitions to adulthood and becomes a legally independent Black man,\" said bill co-sponsor Del. Kym Taylor, a Democrat representing Prince George's County, who said her son has a hidden disability. \"There are no visible signs nor immediate indicators to help first responders understand potential reactions.\"\nThe bill, known as Eric's ID Law, is named for Maryland native Eric Blessed Carpenter Grantham, 20, a Black man who lives with autism.\nFollowing the 2020 death of George Floyd — a Black man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police officers — Grantham and his mother Linda worried about Grantham potentially encountering police and failing to respond as expected because of his disability. The two met with Sen. William Smith Jr., a Democrat representing Montgomery County, Senate sponsor of the bill.\nGrantham says that he designed special logos that easily identify hidden disabilities to law enforcement.\n\"Eric's ID Law was created to help save lives for people who cannot use their own voice,\" he said.\nPrince George's County Sheriff John Carr said he supports the proposal, adding that increased resources to aid people with invisible disabilities during encounters with law enforcement are a \"must.\"\n\"From a law enforcement perspective, we want you to know that we are here to serve you and we want this bill to pass,\" Carr said. \"Any time that we're able to put a citizen at ease during a traffic stop, that is something that helps us interact and keep our community safe.\"\nSimilar initiatives exist in Maryland already, such as the MVA \"blue card\" that people can present to identify their disability. Additionally, the Ethan Saylor Alliance was established in 2015 to \"provide increased training for law enforcement and other public service entities\" to address situations with people with invisible disabilities.\nIts formation follows the death of Saylor, a 26-year-old man with Down syndrome, following a police altercation at a Frederick movie theatre.\nThe passage of this law would mean Maryland joins 11 other states allowing people with disabilities to identify themselves on their identification cards. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She said that through investigation, the person was identified as Braun.\nEndzel described the content of the videos Braun pleaded guilty to distributing, which all included underage girls. Endzel said that when police executed a search and seizure warrant at Braun's residence, Braun told police that he knew he messed up.\nAfter Endzel detailed the case, Braun's attorney Holland Brownley, who is with the Talbot County Public Defender's Office, said she had no additions or corrections to Endzel's summary.\nBefore entering into a plea agreement with the state, Braun had received 34 charges. Seventeen of those charges were for promoting and distributing child pornography, and the other 17 charges were for possessing child pornography.\nAs a part of the plea agreement, the state will enter nolle prosequi for the remaining 28 charges Braun did not plead guilty to, meaning the state will not prosecute for those charges.\nThe six counts Braun pleaded guilty to each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years and a maximum fine of $25,000.\nBraun was not sentenced during the plea hearing, and a sentence hearing date has not yet been set.\nThe state recommends Braun receive a sentence of 25 years with all but six of those years suspended. The state also recommends Braun serve five years of supervised probation and be added to the sex offender registry as a tier II sex offender. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jeff Adams as its newest member, ending a long stretch during which Police Chief Lenox Trams was the town's sole officer.\"Sgt. Adams brings 18 years of law enforcement experience and officially started on February 11,\" The Town of Greensboro said in a Facebook post. \"He's currently completing his 80-hour FTO training, and we can't wait for you to meet him.\"\nTrams has been the lone officer at Greensboro Police Department since September of 2024, and he is pleased to bring Adams on board.\n\"I've been there since March of 2023, and I've been trying to recruit only the highest best qualified officers, and it's been a struggle,\" Trams said. \"So when I was down to myself I didn't give up, I kept recruiting and I actually had the applicant who kind of met our standards, so he applied, and then he went through the hiring process and a very extensive background investigation, and I just hired him.\"\nAdams' 18 years of law enforcement experience was one of these reasons Trams hired him, the police chief said, but also Adams' 18 years of loyalty.\n\"Sergeant Adams has been at one agency for 18 years and that track record to me says a lot,\" Trams said. \"He's very loyal to the agency, and he just doesn't bounce around. We also look at like other factors of his application, but I think off the face, just having him be loyal to his one agency for 18 years says a lot.\"\nIn September 2024, the town of Greensboro considered closing the police department because the public safety demands were too much for one officer to handle. The Caroline County Sheriff's Office would have taken over the policing duties for the town.\nTrams believes with this hire the conversations of dissolving the police department have been \"tabled.\" He hopes to continue to grow the staff at the Greensboro Police Department.\nWhen Trams was by himself, Greensboro moved its offices into the police department's building, with the town's town hall experiencing maintenance concerns. But now there will be talks of moving the police department to another office since the plan will be to continue to grow the department, Trams said.\n\"I was by myself, so that was the best move at the time,\" Trams said. \"But now that I'm going to build up the agency and hire quality officers, we all can't be in the same building, so there is some talking about putting the police department in another building.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Multiple crashes at Easton intersection lead to resident concerns\n\n February 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 630\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A recent string of crashes at the intersection of Brookletts Avenue and South Aurora Street have ignited resident calls for traffic and safety improvements.Monday morning, residents Lydia Pinkney and Tony Ruffini stood on the sidewalk of Aurora Street, discussing their safety concerns for the residential area that is home to many families and children.\n\"You stand out here for about five, ten minutes, you'll see how fast people go,\" Ruffini said. \"It's insane. They don't care, and they're always in a hurry.\"\nAccording to the Easton Police Department, the intersection has seen three crashes this month, all due to driver error. There were only 13 in the last 11 years, police said.\nTown engineers reviewed the traffic light, which was confirmed as operational. In a Facebook post, the police department encouraged drivers to be cautious and stated the intersection will be monitored.\n\"While this location is being monitored, officers have begun targeted traffic enforcement and will continue to do so at different hours of the day,\" the department wrote.\nPinkney said she's worried for the safety of her 9-year-old daughter and her dog when walking up and down Aurora Street near the intersection. She says a car has careened into her yard before, and many neighbors have had their parked cars damaged.\nPinkney believes part of the issue is drivers may be unaware it is a residential area.\n\"The speed limit's 25, and I know people are going more than 25,\" she said. \"Our kids play out here. And what worries me about everything is if … someone's not paying attention or whatnot, them running the red light or just going way too fast and clipping me and my daughter.\"\nTown Engineer Rick Van Emburgh said the town is looking at what it can do with the intersection's traffic light in terms of safety and timing.\nEaston's engineers recently adjusted the timing of the intersection's traffic light, hoping to lower the \"chances of a collision if a driver attempts to beat a red light,\" the Easton Police Department announced Tuesday.\nDiscussion around safety on Brookletts Avenue has been recurring. This month, the town installed four-way stop signs at two other Brookletts intersections, South Harrison Street and Hanson Street. The intersections previously had two stop signs each.\nVan Emburgh said thus far, feedback on the four-way stop signs has been positive. Resident Lisa Stone lives next to the intersections and said she's happy with the change.\n\"I have seen so many near accidents at the intersections, particularly Hanson and Brookletts,\" Stone said. \" … I think that's a good improvement.\"\nThe town also added on-street parking lines to Brookletts Avenue, a measure that Van Emburgh said will improve safety on the wide, two-way street.\n\"The white lines give the drivers cues as to where they're supposed to be in the travel lanes,\" Van Emburgh said. \"Because one of the things that we struggle with is when you have a road that can accommodate on-street parking, but no one's actually parking on it, it looks like a wide-open raceway.\"\nFor many neighbors, traffic and safety concerns only grow as developers revamp a nearby property formerly owned by Perdue AgriBusiness. Last week, Easton's Planning Commission approved the majority of a 123-unit proposal for the site along Brookletts Avenue.\nDevelopers had Lenhart Traffic Consulting prepare a traffic impact study, which recommended project approval. Per Planning Commission documents, the study found redevelopment will have \"minimal impact on the surrounding road network.\"\nRuffini said with the new development and an eventual increase in traffic, South Aurora Street \"will be a main road before you know it.\"\nStone, meanwhile, is excited to see the redevelopment, given it includes commercial space and affordable housing. But she's keeping an eye on its impacts to driver and pedestrian safety.\n\"Hopefully it will just be an increase in traffic and not a decrease in safety,\" Stone said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Former councilmember Engle leads way in creating Easton's new highway safety plan\n\n February 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 611\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Ron Engle has a robust resume of public service.The former National Highway Traffic Safety Administration senior manager and Virginia police officer developed an extensive portfolio in traffic policy and management over more than three decades.\nFollowing retirement, Engle remained busy, serving on many local boards in Talbot County and winning a seat on the Easton Town Council in 2015.\nSo when Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey asked Engle in 2023 if he would give the town a hand in creating a Strategic Highway Safety Plan, it was a no-brainer.\n\"The chief grabbed me and said, 'I need help getting grants,'\" Engle recalled. \"And he said, 'And I know you know how to do it.'\"\nThough he lost his council seat two years ago, Engle has spearheaded the creation of a traffic safety plan for Easton during the last year.\nApproved by the Town Council earlier this month, Easton's new Strategic Highway Safety Plan is expected to bring significant funding opportunities to the town for its transportation and safety efforts, town officials say.\nIt is 72 pages in length, detailing strategies and action plans for Easton to address vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian safety issues as the town grows. Not every city or town in the state has adopted a strategic plan aligning with the state's vision, Engle noted.\n\"My gut feeling is that with so few of these programs, we can do pretty well,\" he said.\nThe plan goes hand-in-hand with Maryland's Vision Zero law that was established in 2019, which aims to eliminate all vehicle-related deaths by 2030. Traditional approaches to highway safety assume crashes and injuries are inevitable, but Vision Zero lays out that traffic systems can accommodate for human error.\n\"What I mainly focused on was speeding, distracted driving, impaired driving, bicycling and pedestrians,\" Engle said, as well as sections dedicated to Route 50 safety and mature drivers, given Talbot County's older population.\nIn order to lay the groundwork, town leaders worked with Washington College's Geographic Information Systems Program to compile accident data dating back to 2018, culminating in the release of an interactive traffic dashboard.\nWhile Easton doesn't have traffic fatalities often, the numbers depict problem areas in town where the most crashes occurred from 2018-2023, such as Dover Road and Aurora Street.\nEngle said the data, combined with sleek and easy-to-read graphic designs and charts made by the town's communications specialist, Greg Mueller, helped the strategic plan come to life.\n\"It wasn't until I got the data,\" Engle said. \"I would have never thought Dover Street had the most crashes. It just wouldn't occur to me.\"\nTown Engineer Rick Van Emburgh, one of the plan's main contributors, said it all boils down to making Easton safer. Clear deadlines for goals and improvements will keep the town's progress timely, he said.\n\"It will hold us accountable,\" Van Emburgh said.\nLowrey says the Strategic Highway Safety Plan is just one step in Easton's efforts to better safety for residents using all modes of transportation.\n\"It's an important first step, but it's part of a bigger process that the mayor's undertaking to help us address Easton as it is right now and how it will be in the future,\" Lowrey said.\nEngle, who says he's \"fascinated\" by public service, has been inspired not just by his traffic safety background, but by local organizations and residents, too.\nIt's part of the reason he's continued to dedicate hours upon hours of his time to creating a better and safer Easton.\n\"It's a big bite for the town, because there's a lot of things in here they need to (do that) they may not have the money or may not have the resources (for),\" Engle said of the highway safety plan. \"But everything in here is something we should do.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Peak was also sentenced to serve five years of probation with the condition that he not have any unsupervised contact with minors.\nIn December, Dorchester County Circuit Court Judge William Jones found Peak guilty of of first- and second-degree assault, first- and second-degree child abuse, neglect of a minor and reckless endangerment.\nThe charges against Peak stem from an incident on April 21, 2023, when Cambridge Police officers responded to assist Dorchester County Emergency Medical Services with an infant who was unconscious and not breathing. EMS treated the infant and transported her to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Cambridge. The baby was then transported to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.\nAccording to police, Peak told detectives he had just fed his daughter a bottle and placed her in a bassinet for a nap. He said the baby was asleep.\nPeak said that when he returned to check on her later, he noticed the baby's head was tilted to the side with fluid coming from her nose and mouth. He said the baby's eyes were partially opened.\nAt that time, Peak denied any traumatic event that could have caused injury to his daughter.\nDetectives were told Peak had lied and did not inform them the baby had fallen to the floor, striking her head. Peak allegedly then picked the baby up and shook her to wake her up, according to a report from the Cambridge Police Department.\nDuring the trial in December, Dr. Eric Klotz, an emergency medicine physician who treated the child that day, said the child's injuries were consistent with a high mechanism of injury. He said it was one of the more severe head injuries he's seen in his career.\nDr. Joseph Scheller, a pediatric neurologist who was asked by Peak's defense to testify, said it is possible the child's injuries were caused by an accidental fall. He said short falls can sometimes cause serious injury.\nAccording to Maryland court documents, Dorchester County Assistant Public Defender Michelle Moodispaw filed a notice to appeal the case on Tuesday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Eastern Shore renters face challenges with affordable housing\n\n March 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 1987\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Bradford House Apartments resident Linda Johnson doesn't carry mace on her keychain anymore.She doesn't feel the need to use a key or a cell phone instead of her finger to tap the buttons of the apartment's elevator.\nAfter years of asking apartment management to address resident safety concerns, from mold and bug infestations to a lack of security, Johnson and other Bradford House residents finally feel safe.\n\"I feel better every day,\" said Johnson, who has lived at Bradford House on Race Street in Cambridge for nearly 25 years. \"I'm not angry no more.\"\nThe complex — which offers multifamily, subsidized housing for low-income individuals who are elderly or have special needs — came under new management with a new principal owner in the fall, and residents started to see changes they had requested for years be made.\nBut as housing problems across the Eastern Shore persist, others have not been as lucky.\nA SHORE PROBLEM\nWith a lack of affordable housing options on the Eastern Shore and a need for better enforcement over housing standards, renters living in poor conditions often feel stuck.\nIn the eyes of Larry Rooths, the head of the Public Safety and Intelligence Committee for the Eastern Shore branch of the Caucus of African American Leaders, the lack of affordable housing is a national issue.\n\"But it seems a lot worse down here because there's so little housing,\" he said, \"and there's no infrastructure in place for emergency services, emergency shelters.\"\nRooths said he's noticed landlords don't feel like they have to do much for tenants because there aren't many other places those tenants can go.\n\"And then the residents feel like that also,\" he said. \"They don't want to stir up too much trouble because they know if somebody comes in and shuts the building down, where are they going?\"\nRooths sees a need for housing legislation with more enforcement power so landlords address the issues residents face. He said the Shore also needs more housing infrastructure.\n\"If you create a situation where there's enough housing, then the landlords lose control,\" he said. \"...If you don't like the place you're living in, you get up and move. But if there's no place to move or you can't move to another apartment building close to where you work, then it gets difficult.\"\nThe caucus is working to get tenants to form groups, which Rooths said would help them know their rights and push elected officials to make change.\n\"Unless there's some change in legislation or there's some increased funding to create a bigger pool of housing, this problem is going to be the same,\" he said.\nIn October, the Tenant Safety Act of 2024 went into effect in Maryland. The act, which places responsibility on landlords to provide safe dwelling for tenants, guarantees tenants can form groups.\nShore Legal Access Executive Director Meredith Girard considers Bradford House's tenant association a critical piece of its success in getting new management.\n\"I think the tenant association was critical to really letting the management and the court know what the issues were and how widespread it was,\" Girard said. \"And that prompted some really important changes so that now the building is managed by a new company.\"\nGirard said rural counties don't always have enough resources to support a rental inspection and licensing system. She said it would be great if counties on the Eastern Shore could pool their resources to form a regional housing commission.\n\"Where you could set some basic standards for habitability to make sure that if you're renting a unit, that the oven works, that the heat works, that the plumbing works, that the roof isn't leaking,\" she said.\nGirard acknowledged rural landlords may also be strapped for resources. She said in some cases, landlords might not have the resources to make needed repairs.\n\"Which then becomes this really problematic cycle,\" she said.\nAt Bradford House, previous management said the property had been neglected before they took over in 2022.\nIn an April 2024 statement to The Star Democrat, Millennia Housing Management, the previous management at the complex, said it had invested more than $300,000 into the maintenance and enhancement of the \"severely distressed property.\"\nGirard said that when problems in complexes are fixed, tenants are often scared to complain about the conditions because they don't have anywhere else to go.\n\"And they don't want to upset their landlords,\" she said. \"But at the same time, they need landlords to fix the things that need to be fixed.\"\nMaryland Legal Aid Advocacy Director for the Human Right to Housing Zafar Shah said further protections against evictions are needed so tenants aren't reluctant to use the Tenant Safety Act of 2024. He said the Maryland legislature is considering a good cause eviction bill \"that would protect tenants from lease non-renewal without a good reason.\"\n\"This is the big priority for renters in Maryland,\" he said.\nNO WHERE TO GO\nDe'Auntte Clark came to Cambridge for peace.\nIn 2016, her 14-year-old son was killed after being hit by a car in Anne Arundel County. Four years later, her husband died from COVID-19.\nIn September 2022, Clark brought her family to the Eastern Shore for a fresh start. But since moving here, Clark has found anything but the peace she was seeking.\n\"I'm so numb, I can't cry,\" she said.\nWith concerns about the safety of her apartment at Calvin Mowbray Park and Stephen Camper Park in Cambridge and nowhere else to go, Clark spent more than a month living out of a van with her family.\nA few days after her family moved into the complex, Clark noticed what seemed like mold in the cabinets along one of the walls in the kitchen.\nMaintenance came to clean the cabinets out, but as the weather outside got colder and she turned the heat on, Clark said she started to see black spots pop up on the walls.\nIn December 2023, Clark's son, Keith Dezurn — who has a medical history of severe, persistent asthma — was airlifted to the University of Maryland Children's Hospital because he was struggling to breathe. He stayed in intensive care for five days, Clark said, displaying symptoms consistent with mold exposure.\nClark said on the way to the hospital in Baltimore, she could barely see anything and was crying.\n\"I don't want to lose another child,\" she said.\nEd Cafasso, a spokesperson for the property that is managed by WinnResidential, said on Jan. 15 that the health and safety of residents is WinnResidential's number one priority.\n\"Any time a household reports a moisture-related issue, it is treated as an emergency and remediated immediately by a professional, licensed specialist,\" he said.\nCafasso said over the past year, there have been seven instances at the complex that required professional mold remediation. He said there were zero reported cases of mold at the 190-apartment community as of January.\nBefore Clark and her family could move into a new unit at the complex this past fall, the unit was condemned. Cambridge Assistant City Manager Brandon Hesson said that in condemning the unit, the city ordered mold and moisture testing be done.\nAn inspection report obtained by The Star Democrat from the city showed an early November analysis found aspergillus and penicillium spore counts in the unit that were \"significantly higher than the baseline count and probably indicates a source of contamination.\"\nThe unit was later removed from the city's list of condemned properties after a report by Simple Mold Solutions, which was based on the analysis, found the numbers \"indicated a normal fungal environment with no elevated concentrations of airborne mold spores.\" The report recommended the HVAC system be cleaned to prevent mold spores from circulating.\nBut Clark's son's health scare was enough to make her seek housing elsewhere. The search proved to be no easy feat.\nLimited affordable housing options on the Eastern Shore and across the state have made it difficult for Clark to find somewhere new to settle.\nClark said she went to multiple shelters in Howard County, where her children are currently enrolled in school, but all of them were full. She said the places she did find that had space required she live in the county for six months, which she had not.\nMoving from place to place hasn't been easy on Clark's kids. She said they are scared to go back to the complex.\n\"They don't want to go back there, and I don't know what to do,\" Clark told The Star Democrat while they were living out of a van. \"But at the same time, I know we can't keep living like this.\"\nIn mid-December, Clark and her family were able to secure a hotel room after living out of a van for more than a month. On Valentine's Day, they moved into a townhouse on the western shore.\n\"It's much better,\" she said. \"No mold.\"\nZOOMING IN ON THE PROBLEM\nClark's story isn't an uncommon one when it comes to tenants of affordable housing on the Eastern Shore.\nResidential issues at affordable housing complexes in Cambridge have come to a head more than once in the last two years.\nIn an attempt to attack the bigger issue at the local level, Cambridge has beefed up its Code Enforcement Department and is working on projects intended to increase and improve the city's housing stock.\nHesson said although the issues at housing facilities are all unique, there are common themes among them.\n\"There have been failures by agencies at the local, state and federal level to hold up the standards we've set for housing providers here,\" he said. \"It's not my place to point fingers, because it isn't going to fix anything. The city is part of that structure, and we're committed to being better.\"\nHesson said building \"strong relationships\" with the governing authorities for the different housing facilities has helped achieve \"significant progress.\"\n\"We've been able to draw attention to where these systems and processes have fallen short, and residents are seeing some of the early results of those efforts,\" he said.\nPROGRESS\nFor Linda Johnson, those results are clear.\nOn Feb. 13, Johnson moved into a new unit within Bradford House Apartments. The move is not just a win for Johnson, who has been a loud and consistent voice of the Bradford House community, but proof of a new era for the apartment complex and its residents.\nFor years Bradford House residents expressed concerns about the safety of the building. In September 2023, the property — which was then managed by Millennia — received a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development inspection score that indicated health and safety deficiencies.\nThree months later, Millennia received a debarment order from HUD, preventing the company from participating in any new business with the department.\nIn October, it was announced that Nuveen, an asset manager and subsidiary of financial planning firm TIAA, had been made principal owner of the apartment complex. Paths Management Services, a subsidiary of Nuveen, would manage the property.\nJohnson's new digs, complete with a brand new, updated kitchen and laminate wood flooring, are a stark contrast from her previous unit.\nWhen The Star Democrat visited some residents' homes last year, residents pointed out things like holes in ceilings, possible mold and problems with stoves. At that time, multiple residents had active rent escrow cases, where tenants pay their rent to a court, rather than to their landlord, until property issues are addressed.\nThe change at Bradford House isn't just visible in individual apartment units. The hallways have new flooring, the stairways are consistently clean, there is better lighting and new cameras and the community room has been renovated. Johnson said management is fixing the elevator that's been broken for more than a year.\n\"It's been wonderful,\" Johnson said. \"I mean Paths came in here, they didn't talk, they worked.\"\nJohnson is the president of the complex's tenant association, which was formed with guidance from Shore Legal Access.\n\"Just because we're low income people doesn't mean we have to live like that,\" she said.\nJohnson said other renters going through housing issues should fight for what they believe in, adding that tenants have the right to withhold rent and form tenant associations.\n\"Your voice matters,\" she said.\nStar Democrat reporter Konner Metz contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Court docs: Delaware middle school teacher spent months grooming student online with sexual messages\n\n March 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 681\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Delaware court documents released Tuesday shed new light on how a Kirk Middle School teacher allegedly spent months grooming one of his students by sending her sexual messages and fantasies through an online chat application.Ultimately, the inappropriate behavior expanded to school grounds, where David DiFilippo would spend time alone with the 13-year-old girl in his classroom, making sexual comments to her and, on one occasion, touching her legs, court records allege.\nDiFilippo's actions \"are clearly and reasonably indicative of an adult grooming and enticing a minor for the purpose of sexual contact and/or a sexual experience,\" Detective Marc Conway, of the Delaware State Police, wrote in court documents, adding that DiFilippo was trying to build up trust with the girl to \"ultimately entice and arouse her sexually.\"\nDiFilippo's alleged behavior took place between September 2023 and February 2024, when DiFilippo was 43 and 44 years old.\nDuring that six-month period, DiFilippo and the girl chatted nearly every day over Discord, a messaging app. The messages were \"flirtatious and sexual in nature,\" and DiFilippo suggested sexual acts with the girl, made comments about her body and clothing and referred to her as \"babe\" and \"baby,\" court records show.\nHe sent her several stories detailing explicit sexual fantasies involving her engaging in sexual intercourse, masturbation and oral sex. He would then ask the girl \"if the writings were good enough that she could picture them in her mind and if reading them made her feel a certain way,\" court documents allege.\nOne story involved a teacher and a student having sexual relations on a school bus during a field trip, and DiFilippo then told the girl he was planing a field trip and asked if she would like to sit with him on the bus, court records indicate.\nDiFilippo would delete the messages after the girl read them, but she kept screenshots of the messages on her phone.\nDiFilippo's behavior eventually extended into in-person encounters, and he would allow the girl to skip class to hang out with him alone in his classroom during his planning period when he did not have a class to teach. Other times, she would stay in his classroom after class ended and the other students left.\nOn one occasion, DiFilippo told the girl he liked her \"milky white thighs\" and said seeing them made him feel \"like an animal ready to attack his prey,\" court documents allege. Another time, he suggested they go into a closet to kiss, but the girl refused. On a different day, the girl brought DiFilippo an assortment of snack food and asked him which he liked best, to which he replied he liked \"the snack in the dress,\" presumably referring to her.\nCourt records describe one incident in which DiFilippo's behavior turned physical. The girl was sitting on a counter near his desk, and DiFilippo allegedly knelt down and rubbed her legs. The girl told him to stop, which he did.\nIt's not clear why DiFilippo's behavior ended in February 2024. Court records indicate that the girl told her therapist about it in August 2024, sparking a police investigation.\nThe girl provided police with screenshots of DiFilippo's Discord messages, and detectives later subpoenaed Discord for a transcript of the messages sent from his account. Investigators interviewed the girl with help from the Child Advocacy Center in Wilmington.\nDiFilippo turned himself in to police in February after the months-long investigation.\nHe was charged with sexual solicitation of a child, enticement for purposes of sexual conduct, dangerous crime against a minor, promoting sexual solicitation of a child, providing obscenity material to a child, sexual abuse of a child by a person of trust and offensive touching. He was released after posting $65,500 secured bond.\nPolice asked anyone with information or who may be a victim to contact Conway at 302-365-8411.\nAccording to a brief biography posted on Kirk's website, DiFilippo taught in the gifted and talented program and has been a teacher for approximately 15 years. He wrote that his favorite part of the job is \"forming strong bonds and relationships with my students.\"\nA spokesperson for the Christina School District did not respond to a request for comment. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ketterman in the Maryland District Court for Talbot County Monday.\nHandy was also sentenced to two years of incarceration with all of the incarceration term suspended except one day. She was given credit for time served for one day.\nThe charge stemmed from a Jan. 11 incident that occurred at the Talbot County Detention Center. According to court documents, Handy was accused of biting Cpl.

But then I remember Frank Gunsallus and how one person can truly make a difference. He's a fellow Easton Rotarian and friend, and all of us can learn a lot from him about courage, integrity, action and service to others.Heroes come along rarely, but when Frank Gunsallus and his wife, Iryna, traveled to Ukraine to get her parents out of the country at the beginning of the war there, he became one in short order. Instead of running home, the whole family stayed in Warsaw, Poland, to help Ukrainian refugees in Poland and Ukrainians stuck at home and facing the horrors of a merciless, dreadful war.\nFrank secured three ambulances to save lives at the front. He made sure a mental health facility was secured in Warsaw to accommodate refugees who had seen and experienced far too much. Working with Rotary Clubs in Poland and Ukraine and with Disaster Aid USA, he delivered tents, water purification systems, lights, cell phone chargers and much-needed food and supplies to where they were needed most.\nHe delivered teddy bears made in our own Rotary District to refugee children, and they worked magic. He guided Rotarians from all over the world to refugee camps so they, too, could help.\nLast fall, when Hurricane Helene slammed its way through the South, as a Rotary and community leader, Frank could not just sit comfortably at home here in Easton. He wrote:\n\"In the wake of Hurricane Helene, I felt a deep sense of responsibility to step up and offer help to our fellow countrymen in need during such a challenging time. Perhaps it was the summers I spent in those North Carolina hills as a child, visiting my grandparents, or the deep connection my family has to that land that stirred something within me. Or maybe it was simply the empathy I feel for others in times of crisis. After seeing heartbreaking videos of people suffering on social media, I knew I had to act.\"\nWith Rotary's help, he quickly gathered supplies and money and headed to Asheville, North Carolina. He witnessed incredible devastation and not only delivered the supplies where they were needed most, but also pitched in and helped those in need. By doing so, he discovered that many hurricane victims could not be reached because of the severe, unimaginable destruction. Exhausted, but determined, he returned to Easton and procured an ATV that could break into those unreachable areas.\nHe then went right back to North Carolina with the ATV and delivered it to emergency personnel who could immediately put it to work.\nLike the firefighters and police who ran into—and not away from— the World Trade Center on 9/11, Frank Gunsallus ran into the teeth of trouble in Europe and in North Carolina. He is a true hero and public servant and sets a very high standard for the rest of us to follow. Frank will soon be the president of the Rotary Club of Easton and is the very definition of Rotary International's motto of \"Service above Self\" and its members' proven track record of being \"People of Action.\"\nGEORGE A.

He was later charged with eight additional counts, including illegal possession of a firearm and loaded handgun in a vehicle, among others.\nCourt documents state that Browning sent an application to the Easton Police Department Feb. 4. During applicant testing and extensive background investigations that followed, police found discrepancies in Browning's documents and application.\nLt. Milton Orellana, special operations commander for the Easton Police Department, received Browning's initial application and worked the investigation.\n\"I've been doing background investigations for 21 years, and never seen this before,\" Orellana told The Star Democrat.\nPer court documents, Browning falsified documents claiming he had prior employment with the U.S. Marshals Service and U.S. Capitol Police.\nBrowning had a warrant out for his arrest in Florida on charges of larceny and grand theft, court records state, as well as criminal history in Texas and Washington, D.C.\nDuring the interview process, Browning was \"well-spoken, poised, and respectful\" and did not struggle to answer questions, according to court records.\nAfter a lengthy investigation, police brought Browning to the department Wednesday and arrested him. The 30-year-old admitted to the falsified documents and said he was in a \"bad place in his life,\" per court records.\n\"Browning stated that he got the documents from a guy but would not identify the person,\" charging documents read. \"Browning stated that he didn't want to talk anymore … .\"\nPolice determined that the handgun found in Browning's vehicle was illegally carried. Browning was taken to the Talbot County Detention Center following his arrest. He's being held without bond for the initial 15 charges and held on $10,000 bond for the subsequent eight charges.\nOrellana said it was a unique investigation, \"especially since (Browning) presented all these documents to a law enforcement agency.\"\n\"We do a pretty intense and thorough background investigation,\" Orellana said. \"We're going to catch something if it's fictitious.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "On NTSB recommendations, FAA closes helicopter route near DC airport weeks after tragedy\n\n March 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MENNATALLA IBRAHIM Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 601\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — The National Transportation Safety Board issued urgent safety recommendations Tuesday, warning that helicopter flights near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport pose serious safety risks and one helicopter route should be closed during airport operations.Hours later, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy accepted the recommendations on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration, promising long-term changes.\n\"Urgent recommendations require immediate action to prevent similar accidents or incidents when we issue them,\" NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said at an NTSB media briefing Tuesday. \"We believe a critical safety issue must be addressed without delay.\"\nThe recommendations were released alongside a preliminary investigative report on the Jan. 29 midair collision of an American Airlines jetliner and a military helicopter near Reagan National that killed 67 people.\nThe NTSB urged the FAA to ban helicopters from a four-mile stretch over the Potomac River when airport runway 15/33 is in use and to designate an alternative route when the area is closed, according to the published recommendations. The American jet was on final approach to runway 15/33 when the collision occurred.\nHomendy said that there were warning signs before the January collision, citing data detailing more than 15,000 near-collisions between commercial aircraft and helicopters at Reagan National between October 2021 and December 2024. The majority occurred during plane landings and at night, according to the NTSB's report.\n\"We're in a situation where we're threading the needle, allowing helicopters to fly down the same airspace as landing aircraft,\" Duffy said. \"And why this information wasn't studied and known before January 29 is an important question.\"\nFollowing the crash, Duffy restricted helicopter traffic around the airport through the end of March. He said those restrictions will continue in accordance with NTSB recommendations. Duffy said he also spoke with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth about alternative military flight routes, with exceptions for presidential travel, life-saving operations and law enforcement.\nThe preliminary report does not identify any probable causes of the collision, as the NTSB is still in \"the fact-finding phase\" of its investigation, according to Homendy.\n\"We still have a lot of work to do in this investigation, so the report contains only the facts that we're able to validate and release at this time,\" Homendy said. \"The easiest and quickest part of the investigation is determining what happened. The part that takes longer is the how and why.\"\nTuesday's NTSB media briefing was the fifth of its kind since the collision.\nAt a Feb. 14 briefing, Homendy told reporters that investigators believe that the helicopter crew was wearing night vision goggles that would have limited their peripheral vision. She also said that cockpit conversations suggest that the helicopter crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers and had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash.\nDuffy criticized the air traffic control system as outdated, relying on 25- to 30-year-old technology, including floppy disks and plug-in headphones, at a separate press conference Tuesday. He pledged to propose a plan in the coming weeks that would revolutionize the \"antiquated\" technology, seeking congressional approval and funding.\n\"We're at a point where we can do this fast—three and a half to four years for a brand new air traffic control system. Gold plated. Envy of the world,\" he said. \"It will greatly improve our safety…but it's also going to improve the efficiency that we have in American air travel, which I think will mean less delays, less cancellations, and again, better safety.\"\nDespite concerns, Homendy reassured travelers.\n\"I just flew with my daughter out of DCA…aviation is incredibly safe,\" she said. \"However, there are safety issues and areas where we need to improve to make sure that we are at zero.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lawmakers battle between cracking down and easing up on prison sentences\n\n March 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SASHA ALLEN Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 745\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Lawmakers are taking a hard look at prison sentences in Maryland this spring, but from two dramatically different points of view.One measure under consideration would help offenders reduce their sentences for demonstrating good behavior. The other would crack down on violent offenders seeking time off their sentences.\nDemocrat Del. Cheryl Pasteur is sponsoring the Maryland Second Look Act, which would allow offenders showcasing good behavior to petition the courts for time off after serving at least 20 years.\n\"They have done every single thing possible to be better folks, better than a lot of the folks that I work with here,\" Pasteur, who represents Baltimore County said, referring to incarcerated people who demonstrate good behavior. \"When do we ever have to spend 20 years to be vetted? Never.\"\nBut Republican Sen. William Folden is the sponsor for Real Time for Violent Crimes, a bill that would restrict or prohibit violent offenders from receiving diminution credits, or time off due to good behavior. He disagrees with Pasteur.\n\"If you commit a violent crime and you prey on our communities, and you're that two percenters that are the worst of the worst, then you should get real time and not allow it to be watered down through dim credits and things of that,\" said Folden, who represents Frederick County.\nHearings for both bills have elicited contentious and emotional testimony, both from families of murder victims and from formerly incarcerated individuals. But after both bills died during last year's legislative session, proponents of each bill are pushing yet again for passage.\nSupporters and opponents alike for the Real Time for Real Crimes Act gathered at a Tuesday bill hearing to provide their testimony. Kurt Wolfgang, the executive director of the Maryland Crime Victims Resource Center, said this bill is \"long overdue.\"\n\"There are so many ways to already diminish a sentence in Maryland,\" Wolfgang said. \"This is just one more hole in the bucket that needs to be plugged up by taking away or diminishing the use of diminution credits to release violent offenders.\"\nDespite his efforts, Folden told CNS that there isn't a \"big appetite\" for his bill.\nStill, there was some opposition to the Maryland Second Look Act in a nearly three-hour long hearing in February, with some detailing emotional stories of their loved ones who are victims of violence.\nTheresa Darvish, whose son was murdered in 2021, opposed the bill. She said it is retroactive, and referred to the procedures in the bill as \"rampant and ambiguous at best.\"\n\"My son will never return to his home,\" Darvish testified. \"No murderer should be given a free ride home.\"\nThis is a sentiment was echoed by many including Folden, who said those accused of rape and murder specifically should not get a second look.\nBut the bill that could allow review of prison sentences over 20 years was also met with large amounts of support from activists and formerly incarcerated individuals.\nAnthony Muhummad was just 15 when he was arrested for two homicide charges in Baltimore City. He served over 29 years and was released under the Juvenile Restoration Act, and was one of the first to testify in support of the bill.\n\"There are dozens of individuals who are still incarcerated throughout the Maryland prison system who have served 20, 30, 40 and yes, sometimes even 50 years of incarceration who are not juveniles, who have demonstrated their maturity and rehabilitation and we believe are worthy of a second opportunity,\" Muhummad said.\nMuhummad detailed his community engagement since his release, including his current employment at the ACLU. He also spoke about the conversation he had with the families of the two victims in his case, both of whom were in favor of rehabilitation.\nAnd Pasteur, who is a former educator in Baltimore City and Baltimore County schools, believes that all deserve the chance for reevaluation after 20 years, especially those who entered the prison system at a young age. Pasteur said two of her \"very favorite\" former students have been or are currently incarcerated.\n\"I am really an educator, not a politician,\" Pasteur said. \"Having always been in schools where things are tough for a lot of the students I have seen students get themselves engaged and involved in things that they know they shouldn't have. So they are in my heart.\"\nAnd ultimately, Pasteur has high hopes for the bill.\n\"It's about appreciating and recognizing that some folks under the most horrific circumstances have made themselves better,\" Pasteur said. \"Much better than a whole lot of us on any given day.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Upon arrival firefighters saw a townhome in flames and spreading to the two adjacent homes.\nAccording to Fire Chief Brad Walters, all occupants had already exited the adjacent buildings, and the occupants of the main affected townhome were not home at the time, so nobody was injured in the fire.\nWalters also stated that approximately 55 firemen were called to the fire. The firefighters got the fire under control at about 1 a.m.\nAccording to the state fire marshal estimated damages to be at $750,000.\nCambridge Commissioner Shay Lewis-Sisco lives in the same development. She said heard a loud boom and then saw the home burst into flames.\n\"I heard a boom in the living room,\" Lewis-Sisco said. \"Then we looked outside and the house within a matter of minutes, the house was engulfed in flames.\"\nWhile everyone was OK, Lewis-Sisco said her heart goes out to the families affected by the fire.\n\"Representing the area, I think for me, my heart broke in the process of watching the other houses also the fire alone, my heart broke for just seeing itself,\" she said.\nThe fire marshal confirmed that there was a gas explosion in the townhome where the fire started, but the fire marshal's office is still investigating to determine what caused the gas explosion.\nThis story has been updated to include information about the potential cause of the fire. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jeff Adams chose the Greensboro Police Department as his next endeavor because of his great relationship with Police Chief Lenox Trams.\"I was looking at different agencies but I reached out the chief. Chief and I go back to 2005 or 2006,\" Adams said. \"I didn't know if I wanted to come here or not. We just had a brief conversation, then I came and did an interview and instantly fell in love. Ever since talking to him and doing a ride along, I was pretty much sold.\"\nAdams, originally from New Jersey, came to the Eastern Shore in 2004 after his career in the military. Adams served in the Navy and in the Army Reserve.\nA friend talked to him about coming down to the Eastern Shore and pursing law enforcement as a career.\nAdams started his career in law enforcement in dispatch at Easton Police Department for one year. Then Adams moved to the Federalsburg Police Department, where he served for the past 17 years.\nWhile Adams and Trams' long relationship played a big part in his decision to pick Greensboro as his next stop, Adams' residence in Greensboro played a big part as well.\n\"I think the people here are very nice,\" Adams said. \"They're genuine, and it just seem like a really good fit after we went for a ride along. Just the environment alone was was good enough.\"\nAdams wants residents to know if they ever cross paths with him, he is a easy officer to work with.\n\"I'm easy going,\" Adams said. \"So what you see is what you get. I think Chief can attest to that, but I'm just laid back, professional, polite and kind. Hopefully we'll be community-oriented.

No injuries were reported.Patrick J. Ward, 61, of Easton, was arrested after allegedly fleeing the scene, Easton police said. Ward didn't require medical treatment, according to police.\nJust after 5 p.m. Sunday, authorities responded to the crash in front of the Avalon Theatre. Easton Police Department Deputy Chief Greg Wright said investigators determined Ward was traveling westbound on Dover Street in a Toyota Camry.\nWright said Ward \"failed to maintain driving in the roadway\" and hit the rear of a parked Tesla, which was unattended. The Camry then flipped, Wright said.\n\"Witnesses then described the driver to have gotten out of the vehicle and then fled on foot,\" Wright said.\nPolice say Ward was later located and arrested in the area of Brookletts Avenue. He's been charged with four separate traffic offenses for failing to remain at the scene and locate the owner of the unattended vehicle.\nThe wreck was an uncommon occurrence, Wright said.\n\"Anytime you get a vehicle (in) a car crash flipped over in a downtown where streets are relatively congested, slower speeds, it is unusual for it to happen,\" Wright said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "FAA closes helicopter route near D.C. airport\n\n March 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MENNATALLA IBRAHIM Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 676\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The National Transportation Safety Board issued urgent safety recommendations last week, warning that helicopter flights near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport pose serious safety risks and one helicopter route should be closed during airport operations.Hours later, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy accepted the recommendations on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration, promising long-term changes.\n\"Urgent recommendations require immediate action to prevent similar accidents or incidents when we issue them,\" NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said at an NTSB media briefing on March 11. \"We believe a critical safety issue must be addressed without delay.\"\nThe recommendations were released alongside a preliminary investigative report on the Jan. 29 midair collision of an American Airlines jetliner and a military helicopter near Reagan National that killed 67 people.\nNine men from Southern Maryland died in the collision: Jonathan D. Boyd, 40, of Welcome; Tom Clagett, 43, of Newburg; Andrew Eaves, 39, of Great Mills; Alexander \"Alex\" Huffman, 34, of Mechanicsville; Steven \"Stevie\" Johnson, 45, of Welcome; Charles \"Charlie\" McDaniel, 44, of Port Republic; Jesse Pitcher, 30, of Lusby; Robert Prewitt, 44, of Calvert County; and Michael \"Mikey\" Stovall, 40, of Accokeek.\nThe NTSB urged the FAA to ban helicopters from a four-mile stretch over the Potomac River when airport runway 15/33 is in use and to designate an alternative route when the area is closed, according to the published recommendations. The American jet was on final approach to runway 15/33 when the collision occurred and everyone on board died.\nHomendy said that there were warning signs before the January collision, citing data detailing more than 15,000 near-collisions between commercial aircraft and helicopters at Reagan National between October 2021 and December 2024. The majority occurred during plane landings and at night, according to the NTSB's report.\n\"We're in a situation where we're threading the needle, allowing helicopters to fly down the same airspace as landing aircraft,\" Duffy said. \"And why this information wasn't studied and known before Jan. 29 is an important question.\"\nFollowing the crash, Duffy restricted helicopter traffic around the airport through the end of March. He said those restrictions will continue in accordance with NTSB recommendations.\nDuffy said he also spoke with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth about alternative military flight routes, with exceptions for presidential travel, life-saving operations and law enforcement.\nThe preliminary report does not identify any probable causes of the collision, as the NTSB is still in \"the fact-finding phase\" of its investigation, according to Homendy.\n\"We still have a lot of work to do in this investigation, so the report contains only the facts that we're able to validate and release at this time,\" Homendy said. \"The easiest and quickest part of the investigation is determining what happened. The part that takes longer is the how and why.\"\nTuesday's NTSB media briefing was the fifth of its kind since the collision.\nAt a Feb. 14 briefing, Homendy told reporters that investigators believe that the helicopter crew was wearing night vision goggles that would have limited their peripheral vision. She also said that cockpit conversations suggest that the helicopter crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers and had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash.\nDuffy criticized the air traffic control system as outdated, relying on 25- to 30-year-old technology, including floppy disks and plug-in headphones, at a separate press conference on March 11. He pledged to propose a plan in the coming weeks that would revolutionize the \"antiquated\" technology, seeking congressional approval and funding.\n\"We're at a point where we can do this fast — three and a half to four years for a brand new air traffic control system. Gold plated. Envy of the world,\" he said. \"It will greatly improve our safety … but it's also going to improve the efficiency that we have in American air travel, which I think will mean less delays, less cancellations, and again, better safety.\"\nDespite concerns, Homendy reassured travelers.\n\"I just flew with my daughter out of DCA … aviation is incredibly safe,\" she said. \"However, there are safety issues and areas where we need to improve to make sure that we are at zero.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

All but 18 months of Lee's 25-year sentence were suspended. His entire three-year sentence was suspended.\nAfter incarceration, Lee will have to serve five years of supervised probation.\nLee had previously been charged with 18 other charges related to the July incident, including attempted first- and second-degree murder. The state has entered nolle prosequi for those charges, meaning the state will not prosecute for them.\nLee's charges stem from a July 11 shooting. According to a news release from the Cambridge Police Department, officers responded to the Corner Market Exxon on Maryland Route 16 and Stone Boundary Road for a report of shots fired that day.\nPolice said that as officers were on their way to the scene, Cambridge Police learned a vehicle had left the area of the reported shooting and two victims had arrived at the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Cambridge. Police said both victims, a 19-year-old from Cambridge and a 20-year-old from Cambridge, were treated for non-life-threatening gunshot wounds.\nPolice said evidence was found at the scene of the shooting and at the hospital, where the vehicle — reportedly damaged in the shooting — was located. Through investigation by the police department's Criminal Investigations Division, Lee was identified as a suspect in the shooting.\nWith assistance from the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force, the Cambridge Police Department located Lee at a home in Cambridge in August and arrested him. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Our area was devastated by the storm. Basic infrastructure services as of today, March 18, will still take based on estimates five months to one year to complete. Many are still homeless and struggling day to day.We are a small all volunteer fire department in western North Carolina. Limited budget resources handicap our ability to afford specialized equipment like all-terrain side-by-side vehicles.\nWithin 48 hours of making contact with Frank, a side-by-side vehicle was delivered to our station by Frank himself. Immediately we were able to access areas for rescue operations and ferry personnel and equipment to badly damaged locations. In some cases we had to build, cut and clear nonexistent roads and old logging roads. It took over five days to cut a path on existing roads just to get a side by side vehicle through.\nDozens of residents were transported for medical care using the machine Frank delivered to us.\nIt is the support and rapid response shown by Frank and Disaster Aid USA that gives hope and shores up faith in the greatness of the people of the United States of America.\nDAN BUCHANAN\nGreen Mountain, N.C. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's not all fun and games,\" Tyree said. \" … When they go into a situation, there's a lot of thinking behind it because they can't violate procedure. If they violate procedure, they can't be a police officer.\"\nJunior Canin Parks said he took the academy to learn more about law enforcement since he is considering entering the field. His favorite week was the virtual reality simulator, during which students were posed with the virtual task of helping people in distress.\nJules Stepp, a Saints Peter & Paul junior, most enjoyed learning about Talbot County's crisis response unit, or SWAT team. Students were shown the inside of a SWAT van and learned about the materials and techniques used in situations that call for crisis response.\n\"It was like we were there with them,\" Stepp said. \"We got to live vicariously through them.\"\nStepp said she recommends the academy to anyone interested. The academy made it clear the extreme level of detail that policing requires, she said.\n\"I was surprised how much detail went into every little thing, and how one little thing can cause a problem so they had to backtrack and think about what the consequences could be,\" she said. \"And how they have to go through so many processes to get grants, peace orders, protective orders and all that type of stuff.\"\nFollowing Tuesday's 10th and final class, Maj. Steve Elliott thanked the students and called them a \"great group\" for the first ever citizens police academy. Lt. J.R Dobson said it was a fun 10 weeks.\n\"I think from day one — when (Sheriff Joe Gamble) was giving you guys a lesson on when the first sheriff of Talbot County was — until now, I've seen you all loosen up,\" Dobson said.\nGamble thanked Lori Stepp, the grants administrator for the Sheriff's Office, for procuring a grant to make the police academy possible.\nThe Talbot County Sheriff's Office is now fielding applications for its second citizens police academy. This round is open to county residents 18 and older. Classes are held every Tuesday for 10 weeks beginning April 8. Applications are open until March 31.\nGraduates of the inaugural Talbot County Sheriff's Office citizens police academy:\nYvonne Herrera Hernandez, North Caroline High School.\nIan Knopp, Saints Peter & Paul High School.\nEric Loredo, Easton High School.\nSofia Miller, St. Michaels Middle High School.\nCanin Parks, Saints Peter & Paul High School.\nJules Stepp, Saints Peter & Paul High School.\nCarson Tyree, Saints Peter & Paul High School.\nEvelio Urdaneta Delgado, Easton High School. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The offense is punishable by up to 90 days in jail and/or a $1,000 fine.\nIn August 2024, county animal control officers responded to an anonymous tip about a dog in distress at Sellman's Thompson Avenue residence, Richardson reported. Officers found the Cane Corso tethered with a choker collar in direct sunlight without shelter or water. The dog was heavily panting in critical condition, with an external temperature of 121 degrees when the air temperature was 96 degrees.\nAccording to Richardson, officers transported the animal to a nearby clinic where it was pronounced dead upon arrival.\nRichardson said Sellman received a suspended jail sentence and supervised probation, as he was already incarcerated on unrelated charges. His probation conditions prohibit him from owning or possessing animals and require a mental health evaluation.\nThe Queen Anne's County Animal Abuse Registry, maintained by the county State's Attorney as mandated by County Ordinance 24-17, lists individuals convicted of animal abuse in county courts, Richardson noted. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Most of the barn was engulfed in flames at that time, he said.\n\"On arrival, it was probably 75% involved,\" Jones said. \"And with the wind conditions, spot fires were popping up all around the property. And with all the fuel load around the structure, I went ahead and hit the second (alarm) to get the manpower and equipment that I needed.\"\nJones said 76 personnel were on scene. It took around 200,000 gallons of water and hours of work for firefighters to handle the blaze, which was fully extinguished by 3:50 p.m.\nWood and mulch piles around the barn led to spot fires that presented a further challenge for fire crews. Excavators were brought to the scene to help pull apart the piles.\n\"The main challenge was getting all the piles of debris around the structure broken apart, soaked down anyway we could, and keeping all the fire in check,\" Jones said.\nOfficials say the barn and surrounding area is used by Economy Tree Service, a company based in Queenstown. Jones said personnel on the scene confirmed the fire began as a controlled burn by the tree service. It then spread, partly due to significant wind gusts and dry conditions.\nJones said he wasn't aware of any animal injuries. A cat that exited the barn structure during the fire was saved, he added.\nThe property is located at the 9000 block of Chapel Road, east of U.S. Route 50. It's at the site of the former Murdoch Gardens florist business and farm, according to officials.\nJones thanked the many fire departments from across the Mid-Shore that provided crucial assistance Wednesday.\n\"We couldn't do it without all the mutual aid from Caroline, Dorchester, the other stations in Talbot County and also Queen Anne's County,\" Jones said.\nThis report has been updated to include additional information. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Witnesses, including neighbor Todd Hughes, reported hearing gunshots around 5 a.m., followed by someone knocking on a nearby door.\nPolice vehicles were first spotted in the area around 5:30 a.m., with tactical response escalating throughout the morning. At approximately 8:30 a.m., a SWAT-type vehicle with a large ram approached the house, officers repeatedly calling for the individual to come out, saying they wanted to \"check on him\" and were \"not there to hurt him.\"\nThe extensive operation disrupted community activities. Shortly before 1 p.m., parents were notified that students on bus routes near Flatland Road and Hilltop Drive would need to be picked up from school due to safety concerns. Radcliffe Creek School, the closest school to the incident, advised keeping students indoors.\nResidents in surrounding areas, including a trailer park near Sunny's Mart, were advised to stay inside.\nLaw enforcement personnel were observed in nearby woods, and a helicopter and drone were part of the operation.\nAt approximately 1:30 p.m., the subject voluntarily exited the residence and surrendered without incident. He was taken into custody and transported to a local medical facility for a mental health evaluation. Criminal charges are pending, Chestertown Police Chief Ron Dixon, lead agency on the incident, said.\nFlatland Road remained closed throughout the day, with motorists advised to avoid the area. Authorities used the Everbridge alert system to notify nearby residents of the ongoing situation.\nWhile initial police statements suggested no immediate public risk, neighbors expressed concerns about the incident's severity. The precise circumstances leading to the standoff remain under investigation. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Brown imposed a three-year sentence on the defendant — Deta Marie O'Toole, 38, of Earleville — for theft of more than $25,000 and less than $100,000 on Monday and then suspended the penalty, court records show.\nThe judge then placed O'Toole on three years of supervised probation and ordered to pay the Family Dollar store in the unit block of Chestnut Drive $31,130, according to court records.\nEarlier in the courtroom proceeding, O'Toole pleaded guilty to that felony theft offense as part of a plea bargain in which prosecutors agreed to dismiss related charges of embezzlement/misappropriation and theft scheme of more than $25,000 and less than $100,000, court records show.\nAssistant State's Attorney Robert Sentman and O'Toole's lawyer, Assistant Public Defender Emily Gillis, negotiated the plea agreement.\nThe Cecil County State's Attorney's Office charged O'Toole by way of a criminal information that was filed against her in September, after an investigation conducted by Cecil County Sheriff's Office deputies, court records show.\nO'Toole committed the thefts totaling $31,130 from Sept. 1, 2023 through Dec. 5, 2023, according to that charging document.\nAs general manager of the Family Dollar store on Chestnut Drive, making daily deposits of proceeds into the business' bank account was one of O'Toole's responsibilities, according to prosecutors. O'Toole, however, kept some of the cash for herself when making those bank deposits and, other times, kept all of the money for herself and failed to make any deposit, prosecutors reported.\nHer Family Dollar superiors contacted authorities at an unspecified point in or after December 2023 when bank officials informed them that a deposit had not been made on a particular day and they, in turn, contacted CCSO — spurring the investigation that led to the charges against O'Toole, prosecutors said.\nAlso identified as a cause for that investigation, an anonymous tipster reported that O'Toole was stealing cash that was intended for bank deposits and that she also had stolen about $400 in store merchandise, prosecutors added. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the Queen Anne's County Fire Marshal's report, the blaze caused an estimated $240,000 in structural damage and $100,000 in content loss.\nThe owner and sole occupant, Bert Olmstead, 73, told officials he had cleaned out his wood stove and placed the embers in a closed bucket on the front porch when wind blew it over. Olmstead was alerted by the smell of burning plastic and discovered the fire had already spread significantly before calling 911.\n\"And after that, the whole thing went up,\" Olmstead said. \"I just got out as quickly as I could.\"\nOlmstead reported losing \"everything\" in the fire, including his wallet and hearing aids. He is currently being assisted by family and friends while waiting to hear from his insurance company.\nForty-six firefighters from Grasonville Volunteer Fire Department and Kent Island Volunteer Fire Department responded to the one-alarm fire, which took one hour and 24 minutes to control. The fire originated on the front porch and has been ruled accidental due to the discarded wood stove ashes.\nAccording to the Office of the State Fire Marshal, no injuries were reported and emergency responders cleared the scene by approximately 11 a.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A steady stream of cars pulled up at the Food Bank's Glasgow warehouse to drop off food donations that were then unloaded by legislators and other volunteers.\nInside, 25 volunteers helped sort and pack food.\n\"Tonight has been so heartwarming to just stand here and watch all the legislators that have come out to support, and all the people that are coming with food,\" Kanefsky said.\nFood banks across the country were left reeling last week when the Trump administration abruptly paused $500 million in funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Emergency Food Assistance Program.\nFor the Food Bank of Delaware, from April to June alone, the canceled shipments equate to 750,000 pounds of food or 900,000 meals that would have directly benefited residents across the state.\nState Rep. Eric Morrison, who has been a regular Food Bank volunteer for 20 years, organized Tuesday's food drive.\n\"When I learned that they are going to be losing about 50 percent of their food, everybody felt frustrated and I thought I have to do something. Somebody has to do something,\" Morrison said. \"Tonight, we can bring in a lot of food, but we can also bring in awareness, which is really important.\"\nOne in seven Delawareans, including one in five children, are food insecure, he added.\n\"I think some people may have certain prejudices or misconceptions about who uses the Food Bank, but we're talking about your grandparents, your children, your next door neighbor with a disability. It's a lot of people,\" he said.\nMorrison added that in Dover, there are ongoing discussions about how much the state will have to step in to make up for lost funding to the Food Bank and other programs affected by federal cuts.\n\"It's very hard right now, because with the federal administration, everything is just very day-by-day,\" he said. \"Every day, we're waking up to something new.\"\nResidents can visit fbd.org to learn how they can help the Food Bank.\n\"We're facing some interesting times, and we've all got to take care of each other,\" Morrison said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Unsheltered homelessness involves a person living in a place not meant for habitation.\nBut Ashley Kessinger, continuum of care program manager, says these numbers might not accurately represent changes in homelessness on the Mid-Shore.\nThe number may be so high, she said, because of the difficulty of reaching people in the past due to the Shore's rural nature.\n\"That 400% increase, I think it has to do with the efforts that went into reaching more people (this year),\" Kessinger said. \"We live in a rural community, and it's different from the cities, where a lot of times people experiencing homelessness may be right on the sidewalk and in front of your stores.\"\nAccording to the count, The total number of people experiencing homelessness on the Mid-Shore sits at 195, with 179 people in sheltered locations and 16 in unsheltered locations.\nAccording to Jimmy Morris, continuum of care housing outreach specialist at Mid-Shore Behavioral Health, the count is important due to the rise of unsheltered individuals on the Shore.\n\"There's people that lost their homes because of medical conditions or job layoff, drug, alcohol, addiction or mental health,\" Morris said to the Star Democrat in January. \"We are overwhelmed in these five counties.\"\nWhile many issues can cause homelessness, Kessinger cites lack of affordable housing as one of the main factors.\n\"Housing is definitely a huge barrier that we have seen,\" Kessinger said. \"We have funding that can place people in housing like security deposits, first month's rent and depending on the program, they can help with some additional months.\n\"But it has been really hard to find housing that can fit within the HUD fair market rent that we have to abide by.\"\nAnother factor Kessinger cites is transportation in Mid-Shore communities.\n\"Transportation may not be something that people think about right off the bat, but it's a huge need for the people that we work with,\" Kessinger said. \"This rural community, it makes it very hard to go from one county to another. It's hard because it's so spread out, you need a vehicle, and vehicles are expensive.\"\nKessigner hopes that Continuum of Care can help improve homelessness in the area. Aid from the Department of Housing and Community Development with affordable housing for people experiencing homelessness will help as well, she said.\n\"So I know the DHCD has a really great initiative with creating more permanent housing,\" Kessinger said. \"We have a permanent housing program, and they are basically expanding that in the state of Maryland.\n\"I know the governor's had a hand in that as well. I think that is a really great is a step in the right direction as far as helping to resolve a lot of the homelessness that we see on the shore. I think the emergency shelters are vital. They're very important, but what everyone needs is a safe home that they can actually afford.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The room was packed with concerned citizens and surrounding business owners Wednesday.\nMajor concerns the board continued to address with the developers included traffic impact on Maryland Route 8, entrance and exit access, and architectural issues.\nThe proposal is not before the County Commissioners for a vote, and due to subsequent comments from the planning commission that must be addressed, the Royal Farms project is not expected to be placed on an agenda for some time, Moredock said.\nBay Bridge Cove residents and members of the Homeowners Association there plan to seek information about a potential county ordinance to prevent gas stations within 500 feet of a day care center, Tamburrino said.\nResidents are also compiling data and crash statistics to prepare for the next meeting, according to Tamburrino.\nMore information and updates can be found on the Planning and Zoning Department section of the county website at qac.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The incident involved four dogs and five cats. One of the dogs was found dead, according to court documents.\nMonday, Lemaire's case was transferred from the county's district court to its circuit court. A trial has been scheduled for July 21.\nFederalsburg resident Anthony Sarro, 30, was also charged with 34 counts of animal cruelty for the incident. Sarro failed to appear in court Monday, and District Court Judge Joseph Riley issued a bench warrant for Sarro that day.\nThe charges stem from Caroline County Animal Control visits in early November.\nAccording to charging documents, Caroline County Animal Control officer Diana Greenwood stated she first visited the Greensboro property Lemaire and Sarro were tenants of on Nov. 6. In her statement, Greenwood said Greensboro Police Chief Lenox Trams told her the property had not had electric or water for at least one month.\nOnce an eviction was performed a day later, Greenwood reportedly entered the property and observed piles of feces throughout the residence. She said she did not observe any available water source for the animals. She said there was only one litter box provided for the cats that hadn't been cleaned.\nGreenwood said there was a small amount of dry food in a container, but noted animals often stop eating when they become dehydrated.\nIn her statement, Greenwood said two of the dogs were found in crates without food or water. She said one of the dogs appeared to be dead.\nAll of the animals were taken to the Caroline County Humane Society for processing. Greenwood stated the dogs drank water for multiple minutes during intake. She said two of the cats were dehydrated and she could feel their ribs.\nGreenwood said that in contacting Lemaire and Sarro, Sarro reportedly told her he did not stay at the residence and the animals were the responsibility of his girlfriend, Lemaire.\nLemaire reportedly told Greenwood she was living in Talbot County and Sarro was staying at the Greenwood residence. Lemaire reportedly said she had been to the residence that morning and planned to re-home all of the pets the next day.\nGreenwood said later that day, Lemaire was on the property and surrendered all the animals except one dog that she said belonged to Sarro. Greenwood said Sarro also arrived on the property but refused to speak with her. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Keith Collison faces a second-degree assault charge from a domestic violence incident on Monday involving he and his former wife, according to court documents obtained by The Star Democrat.Court records allege that during an argument, Collison \"positioned himself over top of her, face to face\" on a bed. After attempting to \"kick him off,\" she \"choked Keith with two hands.\"\nHe then head-butted her, \"resulting in a bloodied nose,\" court records state. He then allegedly flipped the mattress over, causing her to \"roll out of the bed.\"\nCharging documents state Collison advised officers that \"he was the aggressor.\" Officers observed he had an abrasion on his neck and the woman had an injured nose stemming from the incident.\nCollison was released on his own recognizance Tuesday. A trial date is set for June 9.\nSheriff Donnie Baker told The Star Democrat Wednesday that Collison has been suspended with pay pending the outcome of the criminal investigation. The Sheriff's Office is also conducting an administrative investigation.\nCollison is one of three county officers assigned to patrol the town of Ridgely as part of a memorandum of understanding between Ridgely commissioners and county police. Ridgely has been without its own police department for more than a year, and the Sheriff's Office has filled that gap through an MOU since last July.\nBaker said the Sheriff's Office will continue to fulfill the required hours of police coverage outlined in the MOU.\n\"To ensure no disruption of police services to the residents of Ridgely, the Sheriff's Office is fully committed to providing all agreed upon law enforcement services to the town,\" Baker wrote in a statement Thursday morning. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — The St. Michaels commissioners plan to invest $215,000 from this fiscal year and next fiscal year into three new police vehicles for the St. Michaels Police Department.\"These guys are always in need for updated equipment,\" Alfred Mercier, commissioners president, said.\nThe company that St. Michaels is buying the police vehicles through will allow the commissioners to pay for one vehicle with this year's fbudget and two in next year's budget. The town will receive all three vehicles up front.\n\"These are all coming out of speed camera funds that are held in a separate account, so unless there's going to be changes in the FY26 budget, this should be something that we can accomplish,\" Don Richardson, town manager, said.\nWhile the budget for the vehicles is $215,000, the three vehicles will cost $146,820. The rest will be used for graphics, lights and equipment.\nJeffery Oswald, St. Michaels chief of police, credits the St. Michaels commissioners for their help getting the new vehicles.\n\"I would have to thank to the commissioners because they're always have the support on keeping our equipment up-to-date to match other agencies surrounding us,\" Oswald said. \"We want to keep our emergency vehicles safe and well equipped so we can provide public safety to the town.\n\"Our fleet is aging, so having the cost and the liabilities of an aging fleet, so not only it will save us money on maintenance, it will provide a better look to attract officers with new equipment and new vehicles.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

During the investigation, detectives reviewed video surveillance showing the victim entering their residence on March 31 but never exiting, the release said.\nWitnesses reported that during the early morning hours of April 1 Barrera-Rosa and Guerra were allegedly in a violent argument.\nDuring the afternoon of April 1, video surveillance allegedly captured Barrera-Rosa grabbing a large plastic bin from a shed in his backyard and carrying it to the back of the house, the state's attorney's office said.\nBarrera-Rosa then drove his truck to the back of the house.\nCellular tower data records indicate that Barrera-Rosa traveled to Prince George's County to meet with his uncle, Rolvin Eduardo Barerra-Barerra, at a construction worksite, according to the release.\nFurther cellular records indicate that Barrera-Rosa and his uncle traveled to a secluded, densely wooded intersection in the area of Cedarville State Park.\nBarerra-Barerra was interviewed by detectives and reported that on April 1 his nephew told him that he had killed his girlfriend by strangulation and asked for help with hiding the body, the release said.\nHe further stated that when Barrera-Rosa allegedly traveled to his work site in Prince George's County, the woman was already deceased and in a plastic bin in the back of Barrera-Rosa's vehicle.\nThe uncle, Barerra-Barerra, allegedly told detectives that he and Barrera-Rosa disposed of the Guerra's body by burying her in a wooded area near Cedarville State Park, the release said.\nOn April 18, Charles sheriff's officers located Guerra's body in a plastic bin buried at a location described by Barerra-Barerra and in proximity to where phone records indicated Barrera-Rosa and his uncle parked their vehicles on April 1.\nOn April 5, Barrera-Rosa was arrested and detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for unrelated charges.\nOn April 22, he was transported by ICE agents and turned over to the Charles County Sheriff's Office. He is being held without bond at the Charles County Detention Center.\nBarerra-Barerra has been charged as an accessory after the fact to murder in Prince George's County and is also being held without bond in that jurisdiction. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Both vehicles were rendered inoperable.\nSheriff's deputies investigated the crash, and emergency services responded to the scene. Schulz was taken to a local medical facility for evaluation and treatment of minor injuries.\nDeputies contacted the driver of the striking vehicle, identified as Christopher Teta, 35, of Stevensville. During the interaction, deputies detected a strong odor of alcohol and observed signs of impairment. Teta agreed to perform standardized field sobriety tests, which he failed, and was arrested for driving while impaired. Teta later refused a breath test.\nSheriff Gary Hofmann said, \"This serves as a stark reminder that impaired driving endangers everyone on the road, including law enforcement officers who are simply doing their jobs. This could have easily ended in unimaginable tragedy.\"\nTeta was charged with: driving under the influence, driving while intoxicated, negligent driving, reckless driving, driving too fast for conditions, failure to obey a traffic control device and unsafe lane change.\nA court date is pending for the charges. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Motorists traveling east on Maryland Avenue will turn right on Academy Street, left on Cedar Street, left on Dorchester Avenue and proceed to Maryland Avenue.\nMotorists may dial #77 on their mobile devices for roadside assistance.\nFor a list of all major State Highway Administration projects, go to Project Portal, or visit the homepage at roads.maryland.gov.

We lived in a relatively new area. But my brother was beaten half to death by a gang of teens when walking home from working at a restaurant.Later another gang of youths tried to lure my small daughter and her friends into their car by offering them candy.\nMy elderly mother was harassed and threatened by another group of boys while taking a walk in broad daylight. Another kid threw a sharp rock at our door which gouged it. Luckily no one was coming out of the door.\nThere were several other terrible things that happened, drug dealers hanging around, threats from teens who didn't even live in our neighborhood. Most of the people who lived in the neighborhood were fine; it was usually others from outside the neighborhood who liked to hang out there and cause trouble.\nWe moved to the country and never looked back. I have noticed, however, when I shop in Easton that the atmosphere is safer and more family-friendly since Frank Gunsallus has been Town Council president. The fact that Frank is endorsed by Sheriff Joe Gamble says a lot in his favor as someone who sees law and order as the key to prosperity.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

James Clark Emergency Services Training Campus is well underway — and project leaders even had the chance to show Gov. Wes Moore around the construction site last week.Brett Whitehead, president of Friends of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, has spearheaded fundraising efforts for the state-of-the-art training campus, which will be used by firefighters, police officers and EMS workers when it opens.\nWhitehead said construction teams have made \"unbelievable progress.\"\nThe 7,200-square-foot campus is located on Mistletoe Drive. Once complete, Easton Volunteer Fire Department Assistant Chief Daryl Caldwell said it will include a 4,200-square-foot classroom building, a burn building for search-and-rescue and active shooter simulations, and two pads for car fire and extrication training.\nThe burn building won't be damaged, project leaders say, since it's going to be a metal building with concrete floors and stairs. It will have movable walls to provide a variety of room configurations during trainings.\nCaldwell said the training campus will keep on-duty first responders centrally located. The campus also will reduce long travel times that local first responders often incur when going to Salisbury or the western shore for necessary training.\nGround was broken in December on the project. As of Monday, significant work had been done to both the classroom and burn buildings. Whitehead said the goal of opening by the end of the year still remains.\n\"If weather holds up, permits get approved,\" he said.\nWhitehead said more than $4 million has been raised, which leaves less than $1 million remaining of the project's $5 million fundraising goal.\nAs the name indicates, the A. James & Alice B. Clark Foundation was fundamental in fundraising efforts. Last September, the foundation donated $1 million to the training campus. Overall, the foundation has contributed $1.9 million to the project.\nThe project also has received $300,000 in state grant funding.\nOn April 29, Moore toured the training campus as part of a private visit in Easton.\nCaldwell said Moore was \"very attentive\" and asked many questions. Caldwell, Whitehead and other members of the department, along with town leaders, were present for the governor's visit.\n\"Governor Moore's visit to the A. James Clark Emergency Services Training Campus site in Easton highlights his continued commitment to public safety, and ensuring Maryland is providing our law enforcement and first responder personnel with the best resources available,\" Moore's office said in a statement. \"The governor is proud to work alongside so many local electeds and community leaders in supporting this project.\"\nWhitehead believes the Easton training campus will be a model for future first responder training facilities where personnel can train separately or together.\n\"This is the only one of its kind in the Mid-Shore period,\" Whitehead said. \"Where you have real-time training opportunities. You have all first responders training together. No other site does that in the Mid-Shore.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This means the state will not prosecute for those charges.\nIn an interview Monday, Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said the charges against Greene and Turner will be recharged in the Talbot County Circuit Court. Coale said this process is standard practice for more complex district court cases that move to the circuit court.\nAccording to Maryland Court records, the charges against both Greene and Turner have been filed in the circuit court.\nThe charges stem from an incident on Dec. 30 where deputies responded to a report of an attempted vehicle break-in in the 3800 block of Seymour Drive in Trappe. According to a Jan. 3 news release from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, deputies determined after further investigation that three men wearing all black clothing and masks attempted to enter multiple vehicles, stealing various items.\nPolice said the same day, deputies were dispatched to Harrison Circle in Trappe, where a resident noticed three men dressed in black clothing and wearing masks looking into vehicles.\nPolice said the three men barricaded themselves in a residence in the 3900 block of Main Street and after a short time, deputies were able to make contact with them. Police identified the three men as Greene, Turner and a 16-year-old boy, who was not named by the sheriff's office.\nIn January, the Sheriff's Office said the 16-year-old was charged with the same offenses as Turner and referred to the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services, where he was released to a guardian.\nThe Sheriff's Office said Greene attempted to resist arrest and assaulted a deputy as he was being detained.\nAccording to the news release, deputies found evidence during the investigation that also connected the three teens to vehicle break-ins that occurred in Easton earlier in 2024.\nAs of Monday afternoon, hearings or trials had yet to be set for Greene and Turner's circuit court cases. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Whether you're a boater, angler or water sports enthusiast on the Eastern Shore, please remember to be responsible around the water. May 17-23 is National Safe Boating Week. The Safe Boating Campaign, led by the National Safe Boating Council, offers these tips for practicing social distancing and safety while boating:Wear a life jacket. No matter what activity you have planned on the water, always remember to wear a life jacket every time you are on the water. Accidents on the water can happen much too fast to reach and put on a stowed life jacket.Make sure your life jacket is U.S. Coast Guard approved, appropriate for your water activity and fits properly. A life jacket that is too large or too small can cause different situational problems.Know state boating laws. Rules and laws can differ from state to state and violations can result in ticketing, fines or jail time.Take a boating safety course.Learn valuable tips that can help save your life in unexpected situations.Make sure your boat is prepared. There are many items that need to be checked and rechecked on any boat. Schedule a vessel safety check with your local U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary or U.S. Power Squadrons before you hit the water. Every vessel safety check is conducted at no charge.Always file a float plan. File a float plan before you leave shore with someone you trust that includes details about the trip, boat, persons, towing or trailer vehicle, communication equipment, and emergency contacts.Check the weather, including the water temperature. Know the latest marine weather forecast prior to going out, and keep a regular check for changing conditions.Don't drink while you boat. Where the primary cause was known, alcohol was listed as a leading factor in boating-related deaths.Beware of carbon monoxide poisoning. Gasoline-powered engines on boats, including onboard generators, produce carbon monoxide (CO), a colorless and odorless gas that can poison or kill someone who breathes too much of it. Be sure to install and maintain a working CO detector, never block exhaust outlets, and always dock, beach or anchor at least 20 feet away from the nearest boat that is running a generator or engine.Keep in touch. Communication devices can be the most important piece of emergency equipment on board a vessel, especially in case of emergency. Be sure to have and know how to use at least two communication devices that work when wet, such as satellite phones, emergency position indicating radio beacons, VHF radios and personal locator beacons.\nBy following these tips, you can enjoy your boat, the water, sunshine and fresh air responsibly.

All counts are misdemeanors.\nAccording to charging documents, Cristaudo allegedly placed six swastika stickers on political signs and 16 stickers with red lines through swastikas on town property, such as light poles and stop signs.\nThe six stickers placed on Gunsallus signs were all in \"high-minority areas,\" according to charging documents prepared by Detective Cory Schuch.\n\"The placement of a hate symbol, such as a swastika on campaign signs in these areas is a clear indication that Cristaudo's motivation was to intimidate minority voters in the Town of Easton to not vote for Frank Gunsallus,\" charging documents stated.\nPolice say the placement of the stickers began in late March and continued through early May. The election was held May 6.\nAccording to the Easton Police Department, on March 26, officers located three swastika stickers on Gunsallus signs. They reviewed surveillance video, which showed a woman driving a blue Subaru as the person placing the hate symbols.\nOn April 1, police discovered another defaced sign. April 28, officers found two more Gunsallus signs defaced near the Easton Amish Market.\nPer charging documents, police later found 16 swastika stickers with red lines throughout town, with 10 reported on April 1 and 2, and six reported between April 30 and May 6.\nAccording to court documents, a town official told police removing the stickers causes \"permanent damage\" to the signs, \"rendering them unusable.\" The town's public works department estimated $21,000 in replacement costs.\nIn addition to video footage linking Cristaudo to the stickers, court documents state police found a \"large roll of matching swastika stickers\" in Cristaudo's residence.\nMatching clothing and more stickers were found in her car, police said in charging documents.\nDuring the campaign, Gunsallus and his then-opponent Don Abbatiello both spoke out against sign vandalism. Gunsallus told The Star Democrat in March that \"these types of things shouldn't happen during a campaign.\"\n\"This act of hate has escalated the situation into a deeply troubling reality that demands our collective attention,\" Gunsallus wrote in a letter sent to The Star Democrat, local police and various local officials in March.\nRabbi Fred Scherlinder Dobb, interim rabbi for Temple B'Nai Israel and Satell Center for Jewish Life on the Eastern Shore, said he was \"disappointed\" but not \"shocked\" by the use of hate symbols.\n\"I would say Easton and Talbot County are mostly a wonderful refuge from some of that national division,\" he said. \"But sadly, and maybe inevitably, pieces of that creep in.\"\nDobb said the placement of hate symbols is \"utterly unacceptable\" no matter the intent. \"Full-on continental devastation and genocide — which is the ultimate Nazi legacy — needs to be reserved for issues far greater than Town Council,\" Dobb said.\nLt. Milton Orellana, special operations commander for the Easton Police Department, said Monday that the department had also received a report of a Ku Klux Klan hood being placed on a Gunsallus sign during the campaign. Police were not sure who was behind that incident.\nOrellana said police are actively investigating both incidents. A preliminary hearing for Cristaudo is set for June 20.\nGunsallus declined to further comment on the situation, citing the ongoing investigation. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Upon arrival, deputies found the elder Meyer deceased under \"suspicious circumstances.\"\n\"Deputies were familiar with the area due to a previous well-being check,\" Deputy State's Attorney Christine Dulla Rickard said during Monday's proceedings.\nFurther investigation revealed that Wayne Meyer had numerous laceration wounds consistent with sharp objects, prosecutors said.\nThe Queen Anne's County Sheriff's Criminal Investigation Unit led the investigation and identified the younger Meyer as the primary suspect.\nThe accused's brother provided Meyer's description and phone number, as well as information about a potential vehicle, claiming there had been an argument between Meyer and his father earlier that day, officials said.\nInvestigators noted that Auckland Way neighbors reported hearing yelling and screaming coming from the residence.\nThrough cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, authorities tracked the vehicle to Roanoke, Virginia, where Meyer was detained with bloody clothes and scratches on his hands, according to Dulla Rickard.\n\"Meyer had to be tracked from Roanoke, which brought logistical challenges,\" Queen Anne's County State's Attorney Lance Richardson said.\nMaryland State Police crime scene investigators found male DNA consistent with Meyer's on knife handles in the kitchen. Blood was found throughout the house, including a dried shoe imprint, and cleanup efforts were identified through towels, Dulla Rickard said.\nNo signs of forced entry were found at the property, according to prosecutors.\nThe State is recommending 40 years, suspend all but 30 years to serve to be followed by probation. This recommendation is over the Maryland Sentencing guidelines which are 12 years to 20 years, according to Dulla Rickard.\nMeyer's sentencing hearing is scheduled for July 21 at 1:30 p.m.\nQueen Anne's County Circuit Court Judge Lynn Knight presided over Monday's hearing. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Anton Black's cause of death should be ruled homicide, audit finds\n\n May 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WENDY WEITZEL wweitzel@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 674\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In 2018, the state medical examiner ruled that Anton Black's death at the hands of police in Greensboro was an accident. An audit report released by the state attorney general's office Thursday says the cause of death should have been ruled a homicide.The recommendation, one of dozens, comes after a four-year review of cases from between 2003 and 2019, during which time former Medical Examiner Dr. David Fowler was in office. The audit ultimately evaluated 87 cases, reclassifying the cause of death from accidental, unknown or natural to homicide in 36 of them.\n\"The audit also validated concerns that bias may have affected death investigations in Maryland,\" Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a letter to Marylanders included with the report. \"Addressing those concerns benefits everyone in our system of justice — including the vast majority of law enforcement professionals who perform their duties with integrity and deserve clear, consistent standards.\"\nThe audit, led by Towson University psychology professor Jeff Kukucka, began in 2021 after Fowler's testimony in the trial of Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin sparked outcry. Chauvin, who was convicted of murder for the 2020 death of George Floyd, knelt on Floyd's neck for up to nine minutes during an arrest.\nDuring his testimony, Fowler, who was called as an expert witness, said Floyd's death could be attributed to causes other than police restraint, including \"excited delirium,\" a term used to describe agitation and aggression related to mental health or substance abuse that has been disavowed by leading medical authorities. Over 450 medical experts co-signed a letter to former Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh and others condemning Fowler's testimony.\n\"This audit marks the beginning of a long conversation — one that must be handled with honesty, delicacy, resolve, and deep consideration,\" Gov. Wes Moore said in a letter included in the Thursday report. Moore went on to highlight reforms in the medical examiner's office that have been underway for several years.\nThe 2023 settlement of a case brought by the Coalition for Justice for Anton Black and Black's family demanded changes including a policy addressing how medical examiners handle deaths in custody, including those involving law enforcement restraint, according to the ACLU of Maryland.\nThe policy incorporates and models guidelines from the National Association of Medical Examiners for determining how such deaths are investigated and how examiners determine causation.\nOn Sept. 15, 2018, Black, 19, and a 12-year-old family friend were walking around Greensboro when Black began pulling and dragging the child, who called out for help, garnering attention from onlookers that led to a 911 call.\nA chase that ensued ended outside Black's home, where Greensboro Police Officer Thomas Webster IV, off-duty Ridgely Police Chief Gary Manos, Centreville Police Officer Dennis Lannon and a civilian pinned Black against a wooden handicap ramp for six minutes while handcuffing and shackling him.\nBlack, who had severe bipolar depression, stopped breathing and became unresponsive after being handcuffed and shackled. He was taken to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center in Easton, where he was pronounced dead that evening.\nFowler ruled Black's cause of death was a sudden cardiac event. A later examination by a Johns Hopkins University cardiologist determined asphyxiation was the cause. No one was charged in the incident.\nFor those who have advocated for change in the way in-custody deaths are handled by the state since Black's death, the report released Thursday marked a potential turning point.\n\"This 70-page independent report vindicates what family members and communities — mostly Black and Brown Marylanders — have been saying for decades: the truth. That the entire system has been complicit in making police-involved deaths seem inevitable,\" said ACLU of Maryland senior staff attorney Sonia Kumar, who led the team that litigated the 2023 settlement, in a statement Friday.\nAn executive order issued by Moore Thursday called for the attorney general and the state's attorney's office to examine whether any cases should be reopened for investigation as a result of the report's findings. The executive order also established a task force to examine the handling of in-custody deaths.\nStar Democrat reporter Lily Tierney contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mother gets six years for Christmas Day fire that killed daughter, 10\n\n May 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1001\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The mother of a 10-year-old girl who was killed in a townhouse fire near Elkton on Christmas Day 2023 has received a six-year prison term for involuntary manslaughter — an offense relating to overloaded electrical outlets, hoarding conditions and a lack of smoke detectors that contributed to the youngster's death.Cecil County Circuit Court Judge William W. Davis Jr. imposed a maximum 10-year sentence on the defendant — Theresa Ann Moats, 41 — during a May 12 courtroom proceeding and then suspended four years of the penalty.\n\"It was totally preventable. I'm not doubting that you love your daughter, but the care wasn't there,\" Davis told Moats after remarking, \"This is the exact definition of a difficult case. You have the tragic loss of a young person and there his zero intention for this to happen. It's the nature of the charge.\"\nMoats' daughter — Kyleigh Nicole Treadway — perished in the swift-moving, two-alarm blaze that started accidentally inside 317 Willow Dr. in the Winding Brook neighborhood, northeast of Elkton, shortly before 7:30 a.m. on Dec. 25, 2023.\nKyleigh, who had been sleeping in a second-floor bedroom, was trapped inside that burning townhouse after her mother, her grandmother, her two older brothers and her mother's boyfriend — Kevin Neal Summerfield, now 42 — had escaped.\nInvestigators reported that as many as 35 pets, mostly dogs and cats, lived inside the townhouse with the family and that the floor was coated in animal feces, saturated with urine and covered with trash, clothing and other combustibles.\nThose unsanitary conditions and the hoarding situation made walking passage difficult. Those extreme conditions also exacerbated the overloaded electrical outlets marked by long runs of extension cords powering everything, including heavy-duty appliances like the refrigerator and freezer.\nThe investigation also revealed that Kyleigh's hair and clothing emanated the smell of animal waste every morning she arrived at Cecil Manor Elementary School in Elk Mills, where she was a fourth-grader, and that fellow students avoided her because of the pungent unpleasant odor.\nIn addition, the investigation revealed that the school nurse routinely washed Kyleigh's clothes and washed and brushed the girl's unkempt hair and that attempts to interact with Moats about the situation were futile.\nThe evidence of neglect prompted school officials to make referrals to the Cecil County Department of Social Services, after Kyleigh moved with her family from Delaware and started attending that school, court records show.\n\"It was the saddest fact pattern I've ever read,\" Davis commented from the bench Monday before sentencing Moats. \"Her existence seemed to be miserable and her demise was miserable. It does make me want to cry.\"\nMoats will serve her six-year term in a Maryland Department of Corrections prison. She was taken into custody inside the courtroom directly after sentencing. The judge gave Moats credit for 424 days that she already served, initially as a pre-trial jail inmate and later on house arrest on a $50,000 unsecured bond.\nShe tearfully addressed the judge moments before sentencing.\n\"Living without my daughter has been like a mental prison. I miss her. I can't hug her. I can't play games with her. Life is dull. She was the shining star of the family. Kyleigh was everything to me . . . I can't look at her picture. I wish she was here,\" Moats said.\nIn addition to the six-year prison term, Davis ordered Moats to serve five years of supervised probation once released. The judge ordered her to submit to any mental health treatment and counseling deemed necessary.\nAssistant State's Attorney Gavin Patashnick sought the full 10 years of incarceration for Moats, whom he accused of minimizing her gross negligence. The judge agreed with Patashnick's assessment of Moats' mindset.\n\"The defendant flatly refuses to accept any responsibility . . . The house was in shambles . . . Kyleigh didn't have any friends. No one would touch her. Her only friends were teachers. This child was essentially forgotten,\" Pataschnick told the judge.\nThe prosecutor remarked that Kyleigh \"died horribly\" because of the squalid dwelling conditions that caused the blaze and then fueled it. The state medical examiner attributed Kyleigh's death to smoke inhalation and burns over 90 percent of her body.\n\"She did not die peacefully. She had soot in her mouth, smoke in her lungs. She burned. She was breathing in gases,\" Patashnick outlined.\nAs for his recommendation of the maximum 10-year sentence, Patashnick told the judge, \"I'm here to stand up for this girl.\"\nMoats' lawyer, Assistant Public Defender Emily Gillis, recommended that the judge sentence her client to time served, approximately 16 months. Gillis categorized the townhouse fire that killed Kyleigh as a \"tragic accident\" and reported that Moats has been suffering — and will continue to suffer — from the loss of her daughter.\n\"She lives with that. Parents aren't suppose to bury their children,\" Gillis told Davis.\nCourt records indicate that two Cecil County Department of Animal Services officers went to 317 Willow Dr. on Dec. 20, 2023 — five days before the fatal fire there — and impounded 14 dogs and four cats that showed signs of neglect and abuse after receiving a complaint.\nAfter impounding the 18 animals, officers, \"planned to make a report to Child Protective Services, as the children in the home were subjected to poor living conditions,\" according to court records.\nAt Monday's sentencing, Gillis questioned why Social Services did not remove Kyleigh and her minor sibling from the dwelling at that point and arrange for foster care or a similar program.\n\"There was no shelter plan, no safety plan . . . The Department of Social Services failed. They (social services) would have had Kyleigh with them if they had done their job properly,\" Gillis asserted.\nIn January, as part of a plea deal, Moats entered an Alford plea to involuntary manslaughter, the most serious charge in the case. In an Alford plea, the defendant maintains his or her innocence but, at the same time, he or she does not dispute the incriminating evidence possessed by the state.\nProsecutors, in return, agreed to drop 11 related charges against Moats, including reckless endangerment and neglect of a child. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Several trees were uprooted and snapped at the trunk.\n\"There was really extensive damage in multiple areas in Northern Dorchester and I'm told in Delaware as well,\" said Dorchester County Council Vice President Mike Detmer.\nThe tornado continued along Indiantown Road, where it left little damage, until reaching Eldorado Sharptown Road, where the storm continued to damage trees.\nThe most destruction occurred in Galestown, where the tornado reached its peak width of 600 yards, lifting an elongated farm building completely off of its foundation. Trees were uprooted, snapped and twisted from their foundation, damaging homes and power lines.\n\"Miraculously, there were no injuries,\" Detmer said.\nThe storm then crossed over into Sussex County, Delaware damaging more trees and destroying the roofs of two commercial structures in Laurel.\nDetmer was impressed with how the Dorchester County community responded to the disaster. \"I mean Public Works worked until 3 that night and hit it again the next morning,\" he said.\nResidents lost power until the following afternoon and are continuing to work with the county, the volunteer fire service and utility companies to fix damages and clean up debris. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Judge Karen Dean handed down a 10-year sentence with all but 18 months suspended.\nAccording to a Cambridge Police Department press release after his arrest last October, police determined Holland had a sexual relationship with a 13 year old.\nHolland had previously faced eight total charges: two counts of second-degree rape, two counts of sexual solicitation of a minor and two counts each of third- and fourth-degree sex offense. The state entered nolle prosequi for seven of those charges, meaning the state will not prosecute for them.\nAccording to court records, the victim's mother provided an impact statement as a state exhibit.

Darling, who arrived at the scene with Kent EMS Paramedic 11.\nFirst responders initially used garden hoses from the property and a neighboring home to combat the flames before additional units arrived. A second alarm was called due to staffing needs and the size of the house, bringing in additional resources including a tanker task force, though some were later deemed unnecessary, according to fire officials.\nFire crews deployed two hand lines upon arrival, with one targeting the roof fire and another addressing flames in the attic. The fire was contained to the second-floor attic and the section of roof containing the solar panels, the fire department said.\nThe Maryland State Fire Marshal's Office determined the cause was related to the solar panels. Tesla, the apparent manufacturer of the system, was notified, and representatives met with homeowners at the scene.\nNo injuries to civilians or firefighters were reported.\nEight volunteer fire companies and emergency services from Kent and Queen Anne's counties responded to the incident.\nOfficials from the fire department advised, \"As more homes install solar panels, it's important for homeowners to understand the potential fire risks and how to reduce them. While solar panels are generally safe and highly regulated, like any electrical system, they can pose hazards if improperly installed, damaged or affected by environmental factors.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Then, city staff will begin implementing traffic safety measures.\nRoche says he is anxious to get residents' feedback on this year's pilot programs and that he understands it will be a transition for some.\nRoche says they have the resources for the program and are ready to get underway as soon as possible. \"Summer is the perfect time to do it,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Local K-9 units work to overcome retirements from cannabis law\n\n May 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 917\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — In just a handful of months, K-9 Knox is making an impact at the Easton Police Department.The nearly 2-year-old black lab completed training in January. In 2025's first quarter alone, she was deployed 17 times, making six drug arrests alongside her handler, Pfc. Mark Schinault.\n\"She has that drive for her reward, her toy after she does a good scan,\" Schinault said. \"That means the world to her, so she's very driven to work.\"\nKnox is part of Easton's new guard of K-9s. Last year, three dogs trained in marijuana detection were forced into early retirement due to the legalization of recreational cannabis use legalization in Maryland, which took effect July 2023.\nEaston is not the only agency looking to rebuild its K-9 team in the wake of the legislation. Across the state, law enforcement agencies are working to fund and fill their K-9 units, which serve crucial roles not only in deterring crime, but also in connecting with the community.\nPolice officers largely agree that dogs trained to sniff marijuana can't be used to detect drug offenses any longer, nor does the dogs' expertise hold up in court.\n\"I really didn't want to go down the road because I didn't want to be challenged in the courtroom,\" Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said.\nKnox joined K-9 Waylon in Easton, and soon two other young dogs not imprinted on marijuana will fill out the town's K-9 unit. Lt. Tim Larrimore said it has been a \"complete rebuild\" for the unit since the law passed.\nTrained dogs can sometimes cost around $14,000, Larrimore said. Younger, untrained pups are significantly less, though they require major time commitments for training and certification.\nAcross the state, the work of K-9 dogs — depending on their training — often includes drug sniffing, tracking of suspects or missing subjects, and explosives detection. Knox is certified in drug detection and on her way to certification in tracking.\nSchinault and Knox completed more than 60 hours of one-on-one training before she was certified in drug detection. Easton opted to go with untrained dogs to save costs and build rapport between K-9s and officers.\nWhile Maryland K-9s are no longer sniffing for marijuana, Larrimore says their work is more important than ever in combating drug offenses.\n\"This odor of marijuana was enough before 2023 to give us probable cause to search. Now that's out,\" Larrimore said. \"So now you need the ability to smell something that the human nose isn't necessarily good at detecting. It's the dog that gets you there.\"\nPLAYING CATCH UP\nKent County Sgt. Scott Lockerman has a passion for not just his K-9 partner, Khari, but for all police dogs across the state. He is president of the Maryland Police K9 Foundation, a nonprofit that helps police agencies buy, train and protect their four-legged workers. The foundation paid for one of Easton's new dogs.\nLockerman said that after the legalization of cannabis, there was roughly a 60-40 split of agencies that could quickly get their K-9 units back on track versus those that were more affected by unexpected retirements. But he said progress is being made across all departments.\n\"Most of the agencies were able to replenish the dogs,\" Lockerman said.\nAt the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office, one K-9 retired early after the cannabis law was passed, while multiple dogs retired shortly before. The agency worked ahead to bring in replacement dogs not trained to detect marijuana so the state legislation didn't present too many challenges.\n\"We saw it coming,\" Sheriff James Phillips said. \"It was on the horizon.\"\nSix K-9s currently work for the Dorchester Sheriff's Office. Three can assist in patrols and narcotic detection, two work in narcotics only, and one bloodhound specializes in tracking. Phillips said the office has adequate funding to fill its seventh and final spot for a K-9 trained in detecting explosives.\nFunding often comes from grants, local donations, organizations such as the K9 Foundation and county councils. Phillips said it's \"mind-boggling\" how generous people have been in donating dogs to the Sheriff's Office.\nIn addition to purchasing the dogs, agencies pay for safety equipment (like bulletproof vests) and health payments. Departments are also on the hook for vet costs incurred by retired dogs, per state law. For a retired K-9, departments could pay up to as much as $2,500 a year, capped at $10,000 per dog.\nLarrimore, the Easton lieutenant, says that hasn't yet presented a major funding challenge, though it could down the road.\n\"It hasn't hit us yet,\" he said. \"These dogs are just retired last year. They're young, they're healthy.\"\nCOMMUNITY IMPACT\nWhen the highly-skilled dogs aren't working a case, they're often out in the community showing more of their friendly side.\nIn Dorchester County, Sgt. Steve Twilley says the K-9 unit bridges the gap between the Sheriff's Office and the community. The dogs especially help police build trust with kids.\n\"Next thing you know, that kid's come to you for help instead of lashing out or doing something at school,\" Twilley said.\nSchinault and Knox attended a recent Coffee with a Cop event this spring. Schinault said they're very involved with community policing efforts.\nPhillips and Twilley say the same is true in Dorchester County. Whatever dollar amount is spent on police dogs, Phillips says, comes back to the Sheriff's Office \"10 times over because of the relationships that we build with the kids and the people.\"\n\"I think an agency that's trying to do today's police work and doesn't have the K-9 ability out there, I don't think they're a full police agency,\" Phillips said. \"I think it completes the police agency by having the K-9s.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Joseph Schinault still remembers the first time his K-9 partner Murph tracked down a suspect.The Belgian malinois and German shepherd mix located a residence in the Doverbrook Apartments an unarmed robbery suspect ran to with stolen items. It was the dog's first tracking mission and far from his last.\nStarting in 2018, Murph served as an integral part of vehicle searches and the Easton Police Department's crisis response unit.\nBut Maryland's legalization of recreational cannabis use put an end to Murph's career in 2024, Schinault said. Two other Easton K-9s trained to detect marijuana also retired.\n\"It was a huge hit to our unit,\" Schinault said.\nThe police department is filling its K-9 spots with a new guard of police dogs. Meanwhile, Schinault has moved up the ranks and is no longer a K-9 handler. But he still looks fondly on his time working alongside Murph.\n\"It is truly an honor to work with them,\" Schinault said of the skilled dogs.\nMurph, 7, still lives with Schinault and his family. He's become the \"best of friends\" with Schinault's son, who is just six months younger than Murph.\nSchinault said it took a while for Murph to adapt to staying home instead of jumping in the police car when it started. \"He lives to have a purpose,\" Schinault said.\nSchinault's younger brother and fellow Easton police officer, Mark, is the handler of one of Easton's new K-9s, Knox. Joseph Schinault says it's amazing what K-9s can do, emphasizing the importance of police dogs in solving crime.\n\"Who's to say we (would've) ever solved that?\" he said of Murph's first tracking.\nFor the Easton police officer, having a partner like Murph was a source of daily motivation.\n\"There's not a day that you bring a K-9 to work that they don't want to work,\" Schinault said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Brown imposed a maximum 10-year sentence on the defendant — Ernest Anthony Vuocolo, 64 — for second-degree assault and then suspended all but four years of the penalty, court records show.\nIn addition, Brown imposed a consecutive one-year sentence on Vuocolo for carrying a dangerous weapon with intent to injure.\nThe judge also imposed a concurrent four-year sentence on Vuocolo for reckless endangerment.\nBrown ordered Vuocolo to serve three years of supervised probation after completing his five-year term in a Maryland Department of Corrections prison.\nA jury convicted Vuocolo of those three charges in March after a two-day-long trial. The jury, however, acquitted Vuocolo of the criminal case's most serious charge, first-degree assault, a felony offense that carries a maximum 25-year sentence.\nAssistant State's Attorney Gavin Patashnick prosecuted Vuocolo, who was represented by Elkton-based defense lawyers Tina Harris Schlecker and C. Thomas Brown, and Brown presided over the trial.\nThe defense maintained that Vuocolo acted in self-defense and that he was at a disadvantage during the confrontation with his stepson because Vuocolo has a history of medical issues, including suffering multiple heart attacks, and that he is 20 years older than his stepson. Vuocolo testified in his own defense.\nThe incident leading to Vuocolo's convictions and five-year prison term occurred at approximately 10 p.m. on Nov. 23, 2023 at his residence in the unit block of Stirrup Drive after a family Thanksgiving dinner, police reported.\nVuocolo assaulted his 41-year-old stepson when the stepson confronted Vuocolo regarding \"sexual comments\" that Vuocolo purportedly had made about his stepson's wife, according to court records.\nAn ambulance crew drove the victim to Christiana Hospital in Delaware, where doctors treated him for a stab wound to one side of his chest, court records show.\nCecil County Sheriff's Office deputies rushed to the Stirrup Drive residence at 10:14 p.m. Nov. 23, 2023, after receiving a complaint regarding a \"physical domestic involving a knife,\" police said. Deputies found the victim \"bleeding heavily\" from his left side, police added.\nFamily members who witnessed the incident told investigators that Vuocolo assaulted the victim with a knife during an argument, according to court records. At the scene, deputies recovered the knife, which investigators described as being about six inches long with a \"thick blade,\" court records show. (At trial, the term \"field clever\" was used to describe the knife.)\nBecause Vuocolo complained of chest pain at the scene, an ambulance crew drove him to ChristianaCare's Union Hospital in Elkton, where doctors treated him before releasing him back into direct custody of police, according to court records.\nDuring an interview conducted by CCSO Det. Joseph Laspina at Christiana Hospital, the victim alleged that Vuocolo had made sexual comments about his wife on Nov. 21, 2023 — two days before the stabbing occurred, according to court records.\nThe victim told investigators that he confronted Voucolo about those purported comments after Thanksgiving dinner and that he requested an apology from him, court records show. The victim told investigators that, at that point, Vuocolo attacked him with a knife, stabbing him in the side of his chest while holding him in a headlock, according to court records. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Altair staff complied and removed the chains but kept the gates closed, according to Lewis-Sisco.\nAltair Apartment staff did not respond to a request for comment.\nAccording to the notice distributed to residents, the measures were put in place for an unauthorized \"Freaknik\" event scheduled to take place in the area.\nEight arrests were made at a Freaknik event held at the same location last year. Police said in a news release following the 2024 event that officers deployed pepper spray and departmental-issued tasers \"to affect arrest and to keep hostile crowds back from officers.\"\nThough this year's event was cancelled, police maintained a heavy presence in the area for the next few days. Todd said the increased presence was due to social media rumblings of a large crowd for the \"Freaknik\" event. He said the department wanted to ensure the safety of residents and visitors.\n\"You know, our main goal and our presence, which we always try to keep our presence in all of our higher crime areas or where we've experienced major crimes to keep our residents safe and that's our number one goal and our number one priority,\" Todd said.\nHowever, Lewis-Sisco said many Ward 2 residents felt differently about the police presence. \"The increased police presence and safety precautions that were put in place and implemented on Saturday definitely made residents feel inferior,\" she said.\nTraffic diversions and police presence made navigating the area difficult, Lewis-Sisco said. Some residents informed Lewis-Sisco that they went the entire weekend without medication or aid because health care workers could not reach them due to the gates being closed.\n\"I think the other part was that residents were infuriated that these precautions were taken for an event when there has been unresponsiveness about complaints that regard their living conditions,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prior to law enforcement arrival, a large party had been held at a residence in the area.\nAccording to a statement released by the sheriff's office, witnesses reported that upon hearing gunshots, attendees fled the scene. Deputies located three individuals suffering from gunshot wounds. One victim was pronounced deceased, and the other two victims were transported to area hospitals, where they remain hospitalized.\nMid-day Sunday, police confirmed Christopher Parsley, 19, of Centreville is the deceased victim. Police said they would not release the names of the other two gunshot victims at this point in the investigation.\nThrough witness interviews, investigators believe the suspect or suspects were present at the party before the shooting occurred.\nDispatch reports indicated that at 1:19 a.m., emergency medical teams, including units from Talbot and Caroline counties and two Maryland State Police helicopters, were dispatched to the scene. At 1:35 a.m., EMS personnel advised a Mass Casualty Incident response. By 2:06 a.m., the incident was placed under control, with EMS and fire units clearing the scene shortly afterward.\nSheriff Gary Hofmann expressed his condolences: \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim whose life was tragically taken, as well as with those who were injured. This kind of violence has no place in our community. We are working diligently to identify and apprehend those responsible. I encourage anyone with information to come forward, your help could make all the difference in delivering justice for these families.\"\nThere is no suspect in custody at this time, Public Information Officer Kaitlyn Briselli said.\nThe Queen Anne's County Sheriff's Office is leading the investigation. Anyone with information related to this incident or the identity of those involved is urged to contact the Queen Anne's County Office of the Sheriff at Sheriff-Info@qac.org or by calling the Anonymous Tip Line at 410-758-6666.\nFurther updates will be provided when released by the investigating authorities.\nThis story was updated at 10:10 a.m., June 1. This story was updated again at 2:11 p.m. with the name of the deceased. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Trial begins for Cambridge man charged in fatal shooting last October\n\n June 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Crime \n \n 491\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Testimony began Monday afternoon in the jury trial for a Cambridge man charged in the shooting death of a 26-year-old man last year.Jo'Mir Norman, 18, is charged with first- and second-degree murder, among other offenses, in the fatal shooting of Virgil Simms on Oct. 20, 2024.\nOn Monday, the jury heard opening statements from Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard, the lead prosecutor, and defense attorney Margaret Fox, as well as testimony from witnesses.\nNorman sat at the right of Fox dressed in an all-gray suit. He faces nine total charges, three of which are felony charges — the first- and second-degree murder counts and a count of first-degree assault.\nLeonard recounted the \"senseless killing\" in which she said Norman and another shooter acted together to murder Simms on Pine Street, firing many rounds at Simms before fleeing the scene. She said no matter who landed the fatal shot, they are both responsible for the crime.\n\"One doesn't get exonerated because they had better or worse aim,\" she said.\nLeonard told jurors to expect lots of video evidence and expert testimony about how surveillance cameras work. Prosecutors are also expected to bring forward \"distinctive clothing\" worn by Norman on the day of the murder as evidence.\nFox argued the state will present no forensic evidence nor an eyewitness placing Norman at the scene.\n\"The state's case is not resting upon direct evidence. ... It's completely circumstantial,\" Fox said. \"This case comes down to what you can see with your eyes,\" the defense attorney added.\nLeonard and Fox's arguments to the jury both acknowledged a hiccup in the early days of the murder investigation — the misidentification of the other main suspect. Initially, police charged then-15-year-old Brian Wongus Jr. in connection to the murder.\nMaryland State Police announced the arrests of Norman and Wongus in an Oct. 28 press release. But Wongus was misidentified by police, the attorneys said.\nAn MSP spokesperson said Tuesday that \"in consultation with the Office of the State's Attorney in Dorchester County,\" charges against Wongus were dropped in late October or early November.\nIn the courtroom Monday, Fox looked to poke a hole in the state's case, telling the jury that prosecutors are depending upon \"the same video evidence that led to the misidentification of somebody.\"\nLeonard said \"police readily and quickly\" discovered the misidentification. Surveillance cameras linking Norman to the crime stand true, she said.\n\"All of the evidence always pointed at Jo'Mir Norman,\" Leonard said.\nProsecutors brought three witnesses to the stand Monday afternoon: a police officer and EMT who responded to the shooting, as well as Simms' mother Yolanda Hernandez.\nHernandez provided a brief but emotional testimony as prosecutors asked her about her son.\nHernandez said she and Simms had grown closer since he had two young children. She said he liked to cook, grill and joke around. \"He was a decent guy,\" Hernandez said.\nJurors are expected to hear from a number of expert witnesses in the coming days. The trial is scheduled to run through Thursday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

(Have) safe trip,\" the tugboat Bridget McAllister responded.\nLess than 20 minutes later, around 1:25 a.m., the Dali's command center was sent into chaos as the vessel lost power.\nA transcript released by the National Transportation Safety Board in April, which was first reported by The Baltimore Banner on Monday, notes the first 25 minutes of the Dali's voyage as unremarkable.\nHowever, the initial power outage, signified in the transcript by a sound \"similar to Automatic Power Change Over Circuit\" and multiple blaring alarms that continued throughout the collision, threw the crew into a state of alarm.\nWhat followed the power outage is a series of internal and external communications between Dali crew members, the Dali's tugboats, the Maryland Transportation Authority Command Center. To better lay out the events leading to the collision, The Dundalk Eagle has organized the communications between calls for external help, attempts to lower the anchor and attempts to use bow thrusters.\nCALLS FOR HELP\nImmediately upon losing power, the pilot asked the second officer and helmsman if they had steering, to which both responded yes.\nAs the crew attempted to maneuver the ship away from the Key Bridge, the pilot communicated to the second officer and helmsman again at 1:25:24 p.m.\n\"(Just) let me know if you can't steer,\" the pilot said.\nSeconds after the pilot's command, another sound similar to an automatic power change is noted in the transcript. The pilot then communicated with the AMP Pilot Command Center.\n\"@[AMP Pilot Dispatcher] have them shut down the Bay Bridge. I just lost steering — not the Bay Bridge — the, uh ... Key Bridge,\" the pilot said.\nAt 1:26:10 a.m., the helmsman reported that they were \"swinging to starboard.\" Soon after, the pilot can be heard asking for a \"mac boat,\" referring to the Dali's two tugboats, the Bridget McAllister and Eric McAllister.\n\"Calling the Mac boats — anybody out there?\" the pilot asked at 1:26:38 a.m. Just seven seconds later, the Eric McAllister responded.\n\"Hey Eric [IMO 9707413] it's the Dali — I need ya over here quick. I've uh just lost power (heading to the Key Bridge),\" the pilot said.\nSimultaneously, as the pilot called the Eric McAllister, the pilot's command center contacted the MDTA.\n\"No there's a vessel — I'm calling for the pilot. There's a ship heading toward the Key Bridge. He lost steering. We need to stop all traffic on the Key Bridge,\" the pilot's command center said to the MDTA Command Center at 1:26:57 a.m.\nAs the captain attempted to lower the anchors, the training pilot made a call over very high frequency (VHF) radio to alert other ships at 1:27:25 a.m.\n\"Security call. Security call. Container ship Dali has lost power. Approaching the Key Bridge — I repeat — the container ship Dali has lost all power approaching the Key Bridge — Dali,\" the training pilot said.\nThis was the final external warning call.\nATTEMPTS TO LOWER ANCHOR\nAfter the pilot's command center asked to close traffic on the bridge, the captain can be heard asking the forward crewman to let go of the port anchor.\n\"Sir I cannot * * *,\" the forward said. According to the NTSB, the rest of the forward's response could not be made out over shouting on the ship's bridge, marking the obscuring with asterisks.\nThe captain again called for the anchor to be lowered at 1:27:14 a.m., shouting, \"Fast, fast let go port anchor.\"\nAs the pilot attempted to use the bow thrusters, the captain continued to command the forward to lower the anchor, imploring the crewman until he received another response at 1:27:55 a.m.\n\"I tried to open the break. Break is not able to open up,\" the forward said.\nAt 1:28:42, the frontman told the captain that he opened the break.\n\"Let go. Let go,\" the captain said in response.\nAfter not receiving a response, the captain checked back in with the forward at 1:29 a.m. exactly before delivering what would be the final words before the crash is marked on the transcript: \"Let go, yes.\"\nLAST-RESORT ATTEMPTS\nThe pilot made one final attempt to prevent the ship from colliding with the Key Bridge.\nAt 1:27:42, the pilot asked the crew if the ship had bow thrusters. According to The Baltimore Banner, the device helps guide ships laterally while docking.\nAfter the crew confirmed to the pilot that the ship had bow thrusters, the second officer delivered devastating news: \"No. It's not working.\"\n\"Not working #,\" the pilot said, with an expletive marked by a pound sign in the transcript. These would be the pilot's final words before the collision, which is estimated by the transcript to have occurred at 1:29:06 a.m.\nWhat followed was a story that Dundalk knows well: six construction workers dead and a span that connected Baltimore left twisted in spirals of steel.\nAs the collision is still under investigation, around 12 Dali crewmen remain in Baltimore. This June marks a year since the crew was allowed to leave the ship, as cleanup efforts, expired visas and maritime law complicated their departure.\nTo read the full transcript, including the events before and after the Dali lost power, visit the docket at ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA24MM031.aspx \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The programs effectively curbed traffic hazards in targeted areas through raised crosswalks, four-way stop signs and bump-outs also known as curb extensions.\nAfter continued complaints regarding traffic concerns, council members plan on tackling the issue through another round temporary pilot programs that may become permanent if effective.\n\"A majority of our emails are about traffic calming needs,\" said council member Brett Summers.\nEach council member identified two to three areas of concern in their ward at the council's meeting Monday. Roche then compiled the information from council members and residents into a spreadsheet that lists the streets and intersections of concern along with a map that pinpoints those locations.\nSome of the areas identified by the City Council include Robin Street at the intersection of Pine and Center streets, Stone Boundary Road and Route 16, and a multiple others.\nCouncil members expressed major concern over lighting issues on Route 16, which is owned and maintained by the state. The council has provided the state with a resolution to this issue, but has not received a response. The council did not say what that resolution is.\nAt the next regular City Council meeting on June 9, council members will vote to determine which areas will be the best candidates for the pilot program. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He noted that many attendees at the party have not come forward, and some individuals may be hesitant to share information out of fear of legal consequences related to underage drinking or drug use. \"Let us be clear: We are not seeking to prosecute anyone for those actions,\" he said.\nHofmann encouraged the public to provide any information, stressing that failing to do so could hinder the investigation. \"This shouldn't happen here,\" Hofmann stressed, \"We're not going tolerate this happening here.\"\nHaving information that could aid in the investigation and withholding it, is definitely not helpful to the family of individual that you were friends with, Hofmann reiterated. It is hope that the person/s involved in this incident will soon be held accountable.\nThe Sheriff also warned that social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat have exacerbated the problem, with parties being posted online drawing unwanted attention.\nIn addition to the ongoing investigation, Metro Crime Stoppers of Maryland is offering a cash reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for Parsley's death. All tips submitted through Metro Crime Stoppers are anonymous and eligible for a reward. Anyone with information is encouraged to call 1-866-7LOCKUP or submit an anonymous tip online at www.metrocrimestoppers.org.\n\"Christopher wasn't just a 'good kid' — he was the best,\" said friends of the family. \"He was the kind of young man who would drop everything to help a friend, offer a smile to a stranger, and light up every room he walked into.\" A GoFundMe page has been created to help with funeral expenses, help support his family during this tragic time, and to pay off his truck loan, a symbol of something Christopher was proud of.\nThe Sheriff's Office continues to work diligently to solve the case and bring those responsible to justice. \"We're very hopeful and committed to finding closure for this family,\" Hofmann said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The main entrance is in Country Hills.\nThe 8.5-acre park contains walking trails but otherwise is preserved in its natural state.\nThe inspection found that the tree canopy near the entrance to the park consists of many black locust trees that are structurally compromised by fungal decay and pose a significant risk of falling.\nThe walking paths are eroded and surrounded by dense thickets of greenbrier, multiflora rose and poison ivy.\n\"These thorny species have overgrown the area and become entangled with large woody debris from fallen trees and limbs,\" City Manager Tom Coleman wrote in a memo to city council. \"Significant land clearing and tree removal must be completed before we can reopen the park.\"\nThe city does not have funding for such work in the 2025 budget, according to Coleman, who did not provide any indication as to when the park might reopen.\nThe city's five-year capital improvement plan includes plans for broader improvements to Coleman Park, such as building a turf/meadow area, planting new trees and possibly paving the trails. However that $50,000 in funding, which is dependent on a state grant, is not budgeted until 2027.\nColeman Park was created in 1993 when Newark purchased the land for $180,000 and annexed it into the city. It is named for the family that previously owned the property. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Cambridge man found not guilty of murder in shooting last year\n\n June 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 775\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — After just over an hour of jury deliberation Thursday afternoon, a Cambridge man was acquitted of charges in connection to the fatal shooting of 26-year-old Virgil Simms last year.Jo'Mir Norman, 18, was found not guilty on all counts, including first-degree murder, assault charges, and firearm and handgun charges. Family and friends of Norman embraced outside the court room. Norman's father, Joseph Norman, said his son was wrongly accused and said it was relieving to hear the not guilty verdict.\nDuring the trial, Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard relied on video evidence to piece together Norman's whereabouts and the clothes she said he wore the day of the murder.\nOn Oct. 20, 2024, Cambridge Police Department officers responded to the area of Pine Street just after 7 p.m. for reports of a shooting. Investigators determined 19 rounds were fired by two different shooters. Simms was pronounced dead on the scene, sustaining a gunshot wound to the chest.\nOn Thursday, jurors rewatched videos that had been closely examined during the four-day trial. Leonard argued camera evidence showed Norman and the other shooter flee from the scene and enter a house on Camelia Street, where clothes allegedly worn by Norman the day of the murder were found by investigators.\nBut defense attorney Molly Fox told jurors that prosectors relied too heavily on circumstantial evidence and had glaring holes in their arguments, such as the fact that surveillance video meant to bolster clothing and vehicle evidence jumped from a 1 p.m. convenience store video to a 6 p.m. video an hour before the shooting.\nFox called the state's case against Norman \"a circus\" like she's never seen before.\n\"There was a lot they didn't even try and present,\" Fox said in an interview after the verdict was announced. \"It just seemed like it was thrown together last second.\"\nFox cited a lack of direct witness testimony, missing videos and issues during the discovery process leading up to the trial as reasons why \"the evidence did not point toward my client.\"\nProsecutors encountered some specific challenges during witness testimony.\nOn Monday, an EMT who responded to the scene testified that she saw Simms with a gunshot wound to the head, though it was established during trial that he sustained a chest wound. And during the trial, a state's witness who allegedly dropped off the two shooters the day of the murder did not confirm that Norman was one of the men she drove that day. Leonard called that witness \"young\" and dealing with a \"very packed court room.\"\n\"Don't be fooled by the shaved head here today,\" Leonard noted to jurors, referencing Norman's buzz cut Thursday compared to longer hair he had when arrested.\nFox also reminded jurors of a key mistake in the early days of the murder investigation: Maryland State Police wrongly arrested then-15-year-old Brian Wongus Jr. at the same time they charged Norman in October.\nAttorneys on both sides acknowledged police misidentified Wongus as one of the shooters. An MSP spokesperson said Tuesday that charges against Wongus were dropped in late October or early November.\nLeonard said the evidence investigators used when wrongly charging Wongus was \"very different\" from the evidence presented against Norman at the trial. She said jurors received \"no testimony at any time that Jo'Mir Norman was misidentified.\"\nFox said while video evidence can be useful, it can also lead to wrong identifications.\n\"You have nothing more than what they had when Brian Wongus was arrested,\" Fox told the jury.\nThe lead-up to Thursday's verdict and the reaction afterward was emotional but civil on both sides, with family of both Simms and Norman attending. When the trial began Monday, Simms' mother Yolanda Hernandez took the witness stand.\nHernandez provided a brief but emotional testimony as prosecutors asked her about her son.\nHernandez said she and Simms had grown closer since he had two young children. She said he liked to cook, grill and joke around. \"He was a decent guy,\" Hernandez said.\nLeonard told The Star Democrat after the verdict that she respects the jury but was \"disappointed\" in the outcome. She declined to comment further, citing an active case against the man police arrested after misidentifying Wongus, 19-year-old Jahmere Bryan.\nBryan, from Cambridge, faces the following charges in connection to the Simms shooting: first- and second-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault, use of a firearm while committing a felony, and three other firearm and handgun charges.\nA May 19 hearing for Bryan in the Dorchester County Circuit Court was postponed. A jury trial is scheduled for next month, but Leonard said Thursday that trial is expected to be pushed back due to a change of Bryan's defense attorney.\nThis report has been updated to correct the date of the fatal shooting. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Five other counts levied against Juarez — including second-degree murder and first-degree assault charges — will not be prosecuted.\nThe morning of the murder, police responded to Howell Point Road in Trappe for a reported shooting. Merina, 33, was found outside her home and pronounced dead on the scene.\nA few days later, following an investigation, Maryland State Police issued a warrant for Juarez in connection to the murder.\nPer the recent state's attorney's office press release, investigators traced a phone found at the scene to Juarez. They also worked with police in Virginia — where Juarez lived at the time — to match a vehicle driven by Juarez to what was found on nearby security footage the night of the murder, according to court documents.\nJuarez was located by Mexican authorities for an unrelated crime in Oaxaca, Mexico in 2022. The U.S. Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs worked with Mexican prosecutors to request Juarez's provisional arrest. Extradition was granted later that year, but was deferred pending completion of Juarez's sentence in Mexico.\nLast October, Juarez was extradited to Maryland. His 75-year sentence will credit back to February 2023. Juarez is being held without bond. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Nineteen rounds were fired and Simms sustained a fatal gunshot wound to the chest.\nOn Thursday, though, a jury acquitted the other main suspect, 18-year-old Jo'Mir Norman, of all charges in relation to the case. Prosecutors relied heavily on video evidence and clothing in trial, but dealt with challenges during witness testimony and the fact that the murder investigation started off with a significant mistake.\nBryan was arrested by police last November, but it came after police misidentified 15-year-old Brian Wongus Jr. as one of the two suspects. Maryland State Police wrongly arrested Wongus and charged him with first-degree murder, among other offenses. Charges were dropped in late October or early November, according to an MSP spokesperson.\nThe misidentification of Wongus as one of the two shooters came up in Norman's trial this week. Attorneys on both sides acknowledged the error, though offered different opinions on how the evidence leading to the misidentification compared to the evidence presented against Norman.\nAs for Bryan, a jury trial previously slated for mid-July was postponed. A future trial date has not yet been released.\nCharging documents allege Bryan fled from the shooting scene just after 7 p.m. on Oct. 20, 2024. Investigators reviewed surveillance video and allege clothing worn by Bryan earlier that day was found in a house on Camelia Street where the suspects allegedly fled to after the shooting.\nAccording to court documents, investigators interviewed a witness who identified Bryan and provided his street name, \"Krunch.\" The witness saw Bryan on Camelia Street before the murder, per court documents.\nBryan is being held without bond at the Dorchester County Department of Corrections. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — St. Michaels commissioners announced live Zoom meetings for the town government would be \"discontinued for the foreseeable future\" after second security incident in 2025.Both incidents involved disruptions caused by meeting attendees, town officials said.\n\"Both the February and June incidents were the same or similar with intentions of disrupting the open format forum,\" Town Manager Don Richardson said in a email to the Star Democrat on Tuesday. \"A Zoom attendee took control of the screen and displaying an indecent video clip along with hate text. They also took control of audio playing loud sounds and noises. Staff caught this quickly, shut down the online display, and the Historic District Commission completed the meeting as schedule.\n\"On Friday, the town issued the Constant Contact to notify the public that meeting participation would be changing to keep our town meeting safe and accessible.\"\nThe announcement came after the June 5 meeting, where the Zoom feed was interrupted. Commissioners President Alfred Mercier described the contents of the video displayed by the person disrupting the meeting as \"propaganda associated with foreign countries and explicit graphic presentations of individuals.\"\n\"This came with a lot of thought because we certainly want full transparency in what we present and how we present to the town, and we certainly want to be cognizant of the fact that everything that we present and the information that we display out there needs to be communicated effectively to our to our residents,\" Mercier said to the Star Democrat on Tuesday.\nSt. Michaels is not the only town that have stopped Zoom meetings, the Town of Greensboro also stopped recording meetings via Zoom after an incident in February.\n\"These graphic obscenities that have have been occurring not only in St. Michaels, but in many towns throughout the U.S., have presented a challenge for a lot of these towns,\" Mercier said.\nSt. Michaels plans to record the meetings as they occur and to have a question and answer session for residents to ask questions. Town officials are currently looking for more secure softwares to conduct town meetings. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to The Star Democrat's request for details about the incident.\nSince President Donald Trump's inauguration, ICE raids have looked different. Washington, D.C., immigration attorney of over 25 years Matthew Famiglietti said the legal gray area has grown significantly due to rapid policy changes such as getting rid of safe spaces like churches, courts, hospitals and schools.\n\"Talking about what's legal and what's not legal, that's changed quite a bit since Trump,\" Famiglietti said.\nTrump campaigned on stepping up immigration enforcement, promising to deliver the largest mass deportation in American history. ICE arrests have increased by 25% since he took office, according to the most recent ICE detention data.\nTo make this possible Trump signed five immigration-based executive orders on his first day, instated enforcement and structural changes within federal agencies like Customs and Border Control and ICE, conducted mass arrests including in safe spaces, and enacted travel bans from 12 countries, according to the White House's website.\nFamiglietti said ICE agents and the Department of Homeland Security are under no legal obligation to let local law enforcement agencies know of their actions.\nCambridge police Capt. Antoine Patton and Dorchester County Sheriff Jimmy Phillips both said they were not aware of the arrests made on June 4.\nThe Cambridge Maryland Police Department's official Facebook made a post regarding the arrests saying, \"We have received several phone calls and inquiries regarding photos passed through social media showing subjects being detained/arrested within the city limits by law enforcement. The law enforcement in the pictures is not anyone associated with the Cambridge Police Department, and we have no knowledge of the incident(s) that took place.\"\nMartinez said around 7:15 a.m. June 4, four unmarked cars surrounded a work truck and began making what she called \"unclear\" announcements through a speaker while arresting the four individuals on Maryland Avenue.\n\"As you can see in the video, they didn't even give them time at all to even explain or say why you're getting pulled over,\" Martinez said. \"It was very quick, so when I saw it, my first thing was 'oh my gosh, there's no way this is happening.'\"\nFamiglietti said ICE agents do not have to show their faces or ride in marked cars, but they have to wear some sort of identifying detail. Martinez said the agents' bulletproof vests said \"Police,\" but that was the only identifying mark.\nMartinez said she immediately pulled out her phone and began recording. She said she's always recording because \"you never know what could happen, especially right now.\"\nThe video quickly caught traction, with 554 shares, 176 reactions and 135 comments on Facebook. The post made its way to the family members of the detained individuals, who, according to Martinez, were not aware of the arrests before the video.\nOut of the 135 comments on Martinez's post, multiple alluded to further ICE actions around Cambridge. However, those actions were not verified.\nFamiglietti said concerned residents and those looking for family members who may be detained should call their senators and representatives for information.\n\"That's the No. 1 thing,\" he said.\nOn June 14, demonstrations will be held across the nation on what protesters are calling \"No King Day\" in response to the administration's immigration policies and the actions of ICE agents. Protests are planned in Easton and Cambridge on that day, according to posts made on social media.\nMartinez said the immigrant community has to be especially careful right now.\n\"Drive at the speed limit. Do everything you're supposed to be doing,\" she said. \"You know we contribute to this country a lot, and unfortunately, we can't stay home. We can't do much but to keep going forward, but definitely stay more on the low.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He's being held in the Cecil County Detention Center on a $75,000 bond.\nDinkins body — described in charging documents released Thursday as \"consistent with an emaciated child and were completely wrapped in saran (sic) wrap\" — was found in the unit block of Dune Drive in North East inside a blue suitcase.\nRandle and Dinkins were living in Britten's home when the alleged crime took place, according to police. The pair shared a room in the home on Elk Nest Road\nCharging documents indicate Randle beat the child 15-20 times Monday with a belt. When the child fell to the ground, she noticed the child was no longer breathing.\n\"Randle stated that Britten attempted CPR ... but eventually realized (Nola Dinkins) was deceased,\" the documents filed in Cecil County District Court of Maryland read.\nBecoming upset, Randle told police that the body was placed in Britten's vehicle — a BMW — and the couple drove around for awhile.\n\"Randle stated that once they returned to the residence she placed (the body) in a dark blue suitcase belonging to Britten,\" the court documents read. The suitcase was placed on the third step of the basement stairs overnight. She checked on the suitcase one time, then asked Britten to take it from the house.\nBritten told investigators he took the suitcase away, later sending Randle a photo of a park.\nOn Tuesday, Randle told New Castle County Police the child had been kidnapped from her vehicle at gunpoint; a story later determined to be false. While searching for Dinkins, police questioned Britten, who was described as having \"little to no reaction\" to word that the child had been reported missing.\nAt the home, investigators noticed a distinct odor of bleach. Blue nitrile gloves were found during a search; one pair in a downstairs trash can and another pair in the room that Randle and Dinkins shared.\nInvestigators searched Perryville Community Park in response to the photo of a park, but ultimately located Dinkins' body — still in the suitcase — on a vacant lot near Britten's home.\nRandle, being held by New Castle County Police on a $1 million bond for a charge of filing a false police report, is now facing numerous charged in Maryland including first- and second-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, child abuse resulting in death, neglect, failure to report a child death and unauthorized disposal of a body.\nBritten is charged with eight counts including accessory after the fact to first- and second-degree murder, neglect of a minor, unauthorized disposal of a body, and failure to report a child's death.\nThe body has been taken to the Office of the Medical Examiner for an autopsy and positive identification.\nPolice officials have yet to say when Randle will be extradited from Delaware to Maryland. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dobson.\nThe A. James Clark Emergency Services Training Campus, located on Mistletoe Drive, will be 7,200 square feet and provide state-of-the-art training opportunities for all first responders.\nAs the rendering showed, a building on the training campus will be named after Paul Prager and his wife, Joanne. The Pragers donated $500,000 to the project.\nForte said Thursday that $4.5 million has been raised in the last two-and-a-half years, nearly all of the project's $5 million goal. Project leaders hope for the campus to open by the end of this year.\n\"(It's) taken many, many years; many, many people; many hours; many ideas,\" Forte said. \" … Raising the money was the hardest thing.\"\nAfter the event, Brown said in an interview he's impressed with the coordination between the different first responder agencies in Talbot County.\n\"Often people think small, rural community on the Eastern Shore, 'how busy does it get?'\" Brown said. \"But clearly the numbers show that they're busy. It's important to stand ready. The facility that is going to be built is going to help them do that.\"\nWhen asked afterward if the First Responders Celebration is becoming a tradition, Prager had no hesitation.\n\"It's gotta be, absolutely,\" Prager said. \"These people do thankless jobs. And there's not a whole lot you can do to enable them to make their lives better. So I think if you at least just say thank you, that goes a long way.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, has dropped jaws across the country. The couple was gunned down in their home by someone masquerading as a police officer. Obviously, he was able to fool them long enough to kill them. Moments before and only five miles away he had visited the home of Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, shooting them multiple times, most likely thinking he was leaving them for dead.At this writing they are expected to survive.\nSuch an intrusion scares people because criminals copy the acts of other criminals. How do we know if a legitimate policer officer is knocking on our door whether it's the middle of the night or the middle of the day?\nTwo officers should make the visit and announce themselves as police loud and clear. They should clearly state the reason for the visit before entering a home. Flashlights or outside lighting should be on to help with visibility and identification. Uniforms should be visible with badges and IDs. The knock pattern should be a firm knock or doorbell press then they should announce themselves as police again. There should be a 30-second to one-minute wait for a response from the resident before knocking or ringing the doorbell again. For a search warrant, the warrant should be shown before entry. Your local sheriff or city chief of police may have a different protocol, and it needs to be made known.\nUnfortunately, this still doesn't keep a criminal from copying the protocol to achieve their criminal endeavor.\nI believe 99 percent of Americans are good law-abiding people. However, no one wants to be caught off guard by a criminal invasion. Rep. Hortman would not have wanted to mistakenly shoot a real policer officer who might have been doing his job to protect her. Sadly, the man was there to kill her and her husband. He succeeded. This is why door knocking after dusk is a bad idea unless you have a pre-arranged appointment, and everyone knows who everyone is and the reason for the visit.\nWhen I was 12 years old, I was home alone while my parents were at church. About 8 o'clock it was pitch black with darkness and a man started knocking on our front door. He then went to the back door and started knocking. He then came back to the front door and continued pounding the door. I was terrified. I didn't know who it could be. I loaded our 12-gauge shotgun and aimed it at the front door in fear he would soon be coming through.\nLike a fool, I opened the door but knew the outer storm door was locked. I had the shot gun close by. The man asked if my dad was home to which I replied, \"No. he's gone to church.\" The man then inquired if my father still had hogs for sale to which I replied, \"Yes, but you'll need to speak to him about that.\" The man said he would come back later.\nTo this day I don't know who that man was, but I'm glad I didn't shoot him. It's too bad Rep. Hortman or Sen. Hoffman didn't shoot the man knocking on their door in the middle of the night.\nKnocking on doors at night is a bad idea. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — Firefighters across the Mid-Shore worked together to put out a large town house fire in St. Michaels on Saturday. No injuries were reported.Around 1:20 p.m. Saturday, the St. Michaels Fire Department responded to a fire at a six-unit town house complex on Martingham Circle. Assistant Chief Phil Jones said a second alarm was requested. Agencies from Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester and Queen Anne's counties assisted, with at least 70 people on the scene.\nThe fire was caused by an electrical failure with an HVAC system in the attic, according to the Maryland Office of the State Fire Marshal.\nJones said two of the six units will be \"displaced for some time.\" A third unit incurred small fire damage, a fourth unit sustained water damage and the other two units were unharmed, he said.\nThe fire marshal's office estimates $1 million in damages to the structure and contents.\nFirst responders were able to extinguish most of the fire in the first hour of efforts. Jones said firefighters were on scene for over four hours Saturday to fully handle the blaze. They had to be mindful of the hot conditions.\n\"With the heat, it makes it twice as hard for us,\" Jones said. \"Usually a firefighter can only work five to 15 minutes in the heat\" without taking a break, he added.\nAll firefighters were required to receive a medical check on their vitals, Jones said. Crews went through over 20 cases of bottled waters.\nJones emphasized that the firefighters on scene were all volunteers. He expressed appreciation for the responding units from surrounding counties, as the additional manpower was necessary for such a hot day. Jones said there was good cooperation with the homeowners and between fire agencies.\n\"We all work together to complete everything,\" Jones said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland's new standards on worker safety bring added protection amid heat wave\n\n June 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 571\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — With a major heat wave in full swing, Maryland's new heat safety standards for workers are being put to the test, including in Easton.Dustin Otto, construction division manager for the Town of Easton, helped create a health safety and prevention plan for Easton's public works employees. It outlines the steps the town will take to protect its outdoor workers during periods of extreme heat, incorporating the state's new standards.\nOtto says whether it's the use of 32-ounce water bottles, additional breaks or monitoring heat indices more, the added layers of protection work toward a common goal.\n\"It's all about safety,\" he said.\nLast September, new heat stress rules from Maryland Occupational Safety and Health, which operates under the Department of Labor, went into effect for all workplaces with a heat index of 80 degrees or higher.\nStatewide discussion of heat safety peaked last summer when Baltimore Department of Public Works employee Ronald Silver died from heat illness on the job.\nThe new state standards require employers to develop heat-related illness prevention and management plans. Those plans must detail how employers will protect workers in 80 degree heat or higher and how employees will receive proper training and preventative measures.\nDepartment of Labor Secretary Portia Wu said the new regulations stem from legislation passed by the General Assembly a couple years ago.\n\"These are common sense. They rely on tools we all know about,\" Wu said. \"But having a written plan and making sure you're training everyone on it is really important.\"\nIn addition to shade and hydration requirements, the following rules are in effect for outdoor workers:\nIn a heat index above 90 degrees and below 100 degrees, workers must rest at least 10 minutes every two hours.\nIn a heat index above 100 degrees, workers must rest at least 15 minutes every hour.\nEaston officials say they're used to observing best practices regarding hydration, shaded areas and rest times.\n\"We've always had that in place,\" Otto said.\nBut the town's new heat illness safety plan spells it out more clearly and makes sure employees receive the proper training and education on working in the heat.\nThe town builds on the state standards by requiring the 15-minutes-per-hour rest at at heat index of 98 degrees or higher, along with providing water to employees.\nOtto emphasized that the town's public works and construction employees perform work critical for Easton residents. He noted the toughest days come when asphalt paving happens and that the department leaders take extra precautions on those days to protect staff.\nThe state standards also place an emphasis on acclimating employees not previously exposed to heat, or those who spent a period of time away from working in high temperatures.\nEmployers must monitor acclimating employees through regular checks as well as create a schedule of \"gradual introduction and alternative cooling\" measures.\n\"You really need to ramp up people's exposure to heat,\" Wu said.\nWu added that the state is providing guidance to industry leaders with specific questions for areas of work that may be unique. The MOSH rules don't apply to \"emergency operations and essential services.\"\nWu said the state also provides a template of a plan for businesses, especially helpful to smaller operations who may not have dedicated staff to put together the required heat illness prevention plan.\n\"I think businesses want to do the right thing. Hopefully it's helpful to them to have these tools now,\" Wu said. \" ... We thought giving really concrete guidelines actually makes it easier to know what to do.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was pronounced dead at about 2:06 p.m., the town said.\nGreensboro Police Department requested dispatch to notify a forensic investigator and have them respond to the location.\nEMS then placed two sheets over the man, preventing him from being viewed by the public. The forensic investigator arrived on the scene at about 4:30 p.m., then they consulted the medical examiner's office in Baltimore that an autopsy would be needed.\nThe forensic investigator contacted Springbok to transport the body to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore. The estimated time of arrival was initially an hour and a half, but due to a 16-mile Bay Bridge back-up, the transport was delayed and didn't arrive until 7 p.m.\nEMS, the forensic investigator and the Greensboro Police Department offered to moved the man out of the environment, back inside the residence or place him in a body bag.

So, when I got out of high school, I thought, 'I'll join Talbot County Corrections.'\n\"That way in corrections, it teaches you how to talk to people, interact with the people. Just because they got locked up and you see them in the jail, you realize they're not a bad person. They're just people like us.\"\nDyott, now 21, is looking forward to being an officer in Federalsburg. So far during his required 240 hours of field training, Dyott has enjoyed introducing himself to the community.\nDyott wants the community to know he will treat them with respect.\n\"I'm going to be fair, 100%,\" Dyott said. \"I believe in respect goes a long way. You respect me, I'm going to respect you anytime… No matter what, I'm going to be fair, and I'm going to try to step up on community policing.\"\nLt. Michelle Schuerholz said the police department is happy to have such a young officer on staff.\n\"We're proud to welcome Officer Dyott to our department,\" Schuerholz said. \"Being so young, he brings a strong commitment to community and public safety, and we're confident he will be a great asset to both our department and the residents we serve. We look forward to seeing the positive impact Officer Dyott will make in our community.

Police are actively conducting a homicide investigation.\nJust after 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday, police responded to a shooting in the area of Hudson Road (Route 343) and the Westside Bypass. Officers found Dennis lying in the roadway with a gunshot wound to the chest, according to a press release.\nA civilian and off-duty officer attempted CPR, later joined by the responding officers, police said.

Stone, 46, of Aberdeen — fatally shot Christopher Blaine Thomas, 46, in his chest and Thomas' cohabiting girlfriend, Ashley Dove Brown, five times on July 1, 2023 inside the bedroom of an abandoned house in the 100 block of Bethel Church Road.\nShot in the chest, abdomen, thigh, arm and wrist, Brown was murdered on her 34th birthday.\nStone's co-defendant — Jordan Patrick Perry, 28, of Elkton — is scheduled to be sentenced on July 14. Perry is facing three life sentences and a significant humber of additional years after a jury convicted him of two counts of first-degree murder and 31 related charges on May 1 at the conclusion of a four-day-long trial, after deliberating about 90 minutes.\n\"I hope you both rot in Hades and that God . . . not . . . have . . . mercy . . . on . . . your . . . souls,\" Jerry Brown, the father of Ashley Brown, remarked Monday during his victim impact statement while standing at a courtroom podium a few feet away from Stone, seated at the defense table in a jail uniform.\nBrown purposely left pregnant pauses between the last few words of his comment for emphasis. Brown told the judge that he still cries frequently over the senseless taking of his daughter's life. \"They murdered a big part of me,\" he said.\nMoments earlier, his 64-year-old wife, Bonnie Brown, who discovered the bodies of her daughter and Thomas, commented, \"I have a life sentence of PTSD, and they have shown no remorse,\" during her victim-impact statement in the courtroom. (The Browns have been married for 38 years.)\nThomas' surviving family members also read victim-impact statements with similar sentiments aloud in the courtroom, including his mother and son, who listed his high school graduation and his senior walk off the football field as some of the milestones that his murdered father missed. Thomas' daughter submitted a written victim-impact statement to the judge and appeared on courtroom screen via Zoom.\nAssistant State's Attorney Scott Lewis described the murders of Brown and Thomas as a \"very senseless crime\" while making his sentence recommendation. Lewis also told the judge that he is still taken aback by the \"brutality of it,\" noting that bullets lethally damaged the hearts of both victims and that the fatal gunshot for Brown was fired while she was prone on the floor, already wounded.\n\"What compassion was shown? Where is the sense of humanity?\" Lewis asked rhetorically.\nCecil County Circuit Court Judge William W. Davis Jr. imposed sentences on Stone that matched Lewis' recommendation.\nDavis imposed a life sentence on Stone for first-degree murder relating to Brown; a consecutive life sentence for first-degree murder relating to Thomas; and a consecutive life sentence for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.\nIn addition, the judge imposed a consecutive 25-year sentence on Stone for home invasion and then suspended 15 years of the penalty, leaving Stone with an additional 10 years of incarceration.\nDavis also imposed two consecutive 20-year sentences on Stone for armed robbery and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence, before suspending 10 years of each of those penalties. The judge noted that the use-of-a-handgun conviction carries a mandatory five-year sentence.\nOn April 4, at the conclusion of a four-day-long trial, a jury deliberated approximately five hours before convicting Stone of all 45 charges against him. The majority of those convictions merged into other convictions during Monday's sentencing.\nStone maintained his innocence at sentencing and, through his defense lawyer, Michael J. Halter, he indicated that he planned to file an appeal.\nPrefacing that Stone does not lack \"sympathy and empathy,\" Halter told the judge, \"He had nothing to do with this crime. He has been adamant since Day One that he did not participate in these crimes.\"\nHalter noted that Stone's convicted co-defendant, Perry, had \"a grudge with Thomas over a drug sale\" and that Stone had had no interactions with Thomas.\nThe defense lawyer stressed that, on the morning of the double murder, Stone unwittingly accompanied Perry and one other man in a convoy from their Aberdeen residence to the abandoned house where Brown and Thomas were living.\n(Brown and Thomas were recovering drug addicts, and they had been squatting in that abandoned house with boarded-up windows and no electricity for approximately eight months, according to trial testimony, which indicated that Thomas sometimes borrowed a generator to power the place.)\n\"He (Stone) was with them, but he did not know what they were going to do. He was at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people,\" Halter assertively summarized.\nHalter asked the judge to run the sentences concurrently, opining that, otherwise, Stone would have \"no possibility to see the light of day.\"\nStone stood at the defense table and maintained his innocence during his allocution, telling the judge, \"The events that happened, I had no part in it. No life should be (taken).\"\nFrom the bench, Davis reminded Stone that the jury had spoken.\nThe judge reviewed that the evidence that Cecil County Sheriff's Office detectives, deputies and crime-scene technicians collected included Stone's registered handgun — one of firearms used in the double murder — and that it had Stone's DNA on it. (Investigators recovered the stolen cell phones belonging to Brown and Thomas inside Perry's bedroom, in the same Aberdeen house were Stone was living.) Incriminating text messages also were gathered.\nCollected evidence also included distinctive masks matching those described by an eyewitness who saw an unmasked Perry accompanied by masked men on that Bethel Church Road property on the morning of July 1, 2023. Moments after that group arrived on a motorcycle and in a car, the eyewitness heard someone kick in the front door of the abandoned house, a scream and then a gunshot, which prompted him to run into the wood in fear.\nIn addition, the judge reviewed that CCSO investigators had tracked down several videos gleaned from security-cameras between Aberdeen and North East and that those videos showed Stone traveling in that caravan to that Bethel Church Road property on the morning of the double murder and directly after it occurred.\n\"It's hard not to listen to the jury and to what the (surviving) family (members) said,\" Davis told Stone from the bench. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Residents are advised to follow certain protocols to keep celebrations safe.\nMaster Deputy State Fire Marshal Oliver Alkire recommends residents to go to public fireworks shows. For those who are dead-set on setting fireworks off themselves, Alkire doesn't recommend going over state lines to purchase fireworks.\n\"If you are going to be using any fireworks, just to keep in mind that you should only be purchasing and using fireworks that you are buying within your county or your area,\" he said. \"... Anything that you can purchase at a roadside stand, I can assure you, has been inspected, or anywhere in any retail stores.\"\nThe most important thing Alkire emphasizes is only adults should handle fireworks.\n\"If you're going to light fireworks, only allow the adults to light the fireworks, only light one firework at a time, and also keep all children and pets away from fireworks,\" he said.\nFor those handling fireworks at home, Easton Volunteer Fire Department Chief J.R. Dobson recommends to have a water hose nearby and ready in case of a fire.\nFor fireworks that light and don't work, Alkire recommends putting the fireworks in a bucket of water for 24 hours, then disposing of them properly.\nThe state fire marshal's office recommend not putting fireworks anywhere on the body. In 2023, there were two deaths in Maryland resulting from people holding fireworks to their chest or head.\nIn the event of an emergency, people are advised to call 911 for assistance. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bowen, based out of Greensboro, was sentenced to six months in prison through a guilty plea entered in Sussex County Superior Court in Delaware.The sentencing follows an investigation into multiple instances in which Bowen accepted payments for projects that were never completed.\n\"Jeremy Bowen's deceitful actions didn't just hurt his victims financially — they caused a great deal of emotional and psychological distress to several families across our state,\" said Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings. \"Delawareans throughout the state pour their life savings into buying and then improving their homes; they need to be able to trust their contractors and that their funds will be used as promised. My white collar crime unit will continue to hold contractors who breach that trust accountable.\"\nOn April 7, Bowen pleaded guilty to three counts of felony home improvement fraud, one count of issuing a bad check and one count of misdemeanor home improvement fraud.\nThe plea resolves complaints alleging that Bowen had taken funds, then failed to perform in 13 contracts throughout Delaware's Kent and Sussex counties. Many of the projects involved contracts for swimming pool construction; several of the victims were seniors.\nIn addition to his prison sentence, Bowen is ordered to pay approximately $270,000 in restitution to his victims. Once released from prison, he will be subject to an additional year of home confinement and is barred by the Superior Court from working in home improvement for 4½ years. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

No further details were provided.\nPolice earlier this week released a short account of the incident, which occurred around 7:30 p.m. on Sunday.

A MealTrain link shared on Facebook earlier this week has raised over $5,000 in donations for the family.\nMichael Puckett, the father of the two boys, shared the family's deep appreciation for the community's support in a statement.\n\"We are completely overwhelmed with the love, support and kindness that has surrounded us during the most unimaginable time of our lives,\" Puckett wrote. \"Losing our babies has broken our hearts in ways we never thought possible — but we have felt every prayer, hug, message and meal that's been shared with us.\"\nResidents and local businesses are planning a funeral fundraiser for Sunday, July 13, at 1 p.m. at the Greater Impact Greensboro church. Greensboro resident Victor Reynolds has spearheaded the event. He says it will be a chance for the community to help the family financially.\n\"Nobody expects to have to afford that,\" Reynolds said.\nPuckett said the community's compassion has helped the family through its \"hardest days.\"\n\"Please know how deeply grateful we are for every act of kindness,\" he said. \"We may not have the strength to respond to everyone individually right now, but we see you, we feel you, and we appreciate you more than words can ever express.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Their actions reflect the highest ideals of civic duty, human compassion, and personal integrity,\" the proclamations stated.\n\"These acts of bravery serve as powerful reminders of the strength and unity within our community,\" said the Commissioners.\nA Governor's Citation of Appreciation showing esteemed respect and appreciation by the state, was also presented by Del.

Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md. 1st) wants to secure federal funding to help.The Trappe Volunteer Firehouse was completed in 1951 and has not been updated since. \"We probably have the oldest one in the county,\" Assistant Secretary Treasurer of the Trappe Volunteer Fire Company Cheryl Lewis said.\nLewis said a new firehouse is necessary because the current building is no longer suitable for the modern equipment.\nBecause Trappe has a volunteer fire company, like many towns on the Eastern Shore, projects like this rely heavily on government and local support, Lewis said.\n\"We've been in the process of trying to get assistance,\" Lewis said. \"In the last budget year, the federal budget that was just approved, we had successfully worked with Andy Harris's office to be included in the budget. But with the cuts that were done early on this year, it was removed.\"\nHarris said the appropriations bill to provide funding for the project failed due to negotiations in Congress leading to a continued delay, but she said the project has been reapplied for in the current year's legislation.\n\"We hope the appropriations process has a better outcome, but then that's not up to us because it involves the minority party as well,\" he said in an interview with the Star Democrat.\nIn order to qualify for federal grants, the company must match 25% of the projected project cost of $6 million. The company set a goal of $1,500,000 and set aside $450,000 to begin the efforts.\nFundraising efforts include The Trappe Volunteer Fire Company's upcoming annual fair, held on July 31 through Aug. 2 at the firehouse. The event begins at 6 p.m. and ends at 10 p.m. each day and will include fire truck rides, hay rides, food, games and prizes, and live entertainment, according to the fire company's Facebook page. Saturday's event will open with a parade.\nHarris said the outcome of federal funding depends on the successful bipartisan negotiations in Congress to pass this version of the appropriations bill.\n\"In the end, this is going to depend on the minority party. And you know, if they're not willing to negotiate in good faith, that could end up being a problem,\" Harris said. \"The people in Trappe have to know that their member of Congress was working hard to get that money to the fire company.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We also love getting to introduce new people to the hobby at such a high-profile event,\" Ruth said.\nWith what is essentially the equivalent of a single lightbulb and no permanent infrastructure, ham radio operators can talk to people around the world.\n\"It's definitely important to have that as a backup and maintain that knowledge of how to use it, \" Ruth said.\nThe public event helps serve as validation to the numerous ham radio volunteers who spend countless hours providing emergency communications, public service work and other benefits throughout the community and region, Ruth said.\nThis year's event was also notable as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted a more active hurricane season than normal and saw the first named storm of the season already, he said.\nWhile incredibly important and useful, smartphone technology is often taken for granted and relies on a multi billion dollar infrastructure that, whether storms or computer glitches, doesn't take a lot to knock down, he said.\nRadios are more than just an old fashioned means of communication, according to Ruth, with new technologies and capabilities always being added that can function on older equipment.\n\"It doesn't always have to be the latest and greatest equipment,\" he said.\nThe club recently introduced a program called WinLink Global Radio Email that, by connecting to pathways, essentially allows emails to be sent through ham radio, he said.\nThe area in Tuckahoe the field day event operated in was essentially a cell phone dead zone and a highlight of the event is showcasing to visiting groups including Scouts how the radios can connect with other operators across the country.\n\"Their eyes light up,\" Ruth said.\nThe Radio Club is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the promotion of amateur radio and service to the community and provides communications support to other local non-profit groups during public events.\nFurther supporting emergency preparedness education, the group also recently donated handheld Family Radio Service radios and tabletop weather radios to Homeland Security classes at Kent Island High School and Queen Anne's County High School, as well as sponsoring an Enrichment, Extension and Intervention class at Stevensville Middle School.\nThese classes are part of a broader initiative offering the Community Emergency Response Team program to students, in partnership with Queen Anne's County Department of Emergency Services.\nThe donated radios will be used to help provide hand-on experience for students to become familiar with radio communications, a vital component of public safety and emergency response training, Ruth said.\nDonations were made possible through a grant by the Amateur Radio Relay League Foundation to promote knowledge and interest in ham radio among youths.\nHappy to welcome anyone curious about ham radios, the Queen Anne's Amateur Radio Club meets monthly and regularly provides demonstrations at community events including all weeklong at the upcoming Queen Anne's County Fair.\nMore information can be found by contacting qso@qaarc.org or visiting qaarc.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He's charged with 13 counts, including first- and second-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault, and other firearm and armed robbery charges.\nPolice identified Fletcher as an alleged participant in the June 8 shooting that killed 23-year-old Alyson Elien, of Seaford, Delaware. Just after 8:30 p.m. that night. Officers responded to the 900 bock of Camelia Street and found Elien lying outside of a vehicle in a driveway with a gunshot wound to his head. He was transported to the hospital and pronounced dead.\nVideo surveillance was used to identify Fletcher, as well the other suspect already charged with first-degree murder, according to court documents.\nJakai Wilson, 15, was arrested two days after the shooting. Wilson, who's being charged as an adult, is facing similar counts of murder, assault and firearm crimes.\nCharging documents for Fletcher indicate that investigators used multiple city cameras to link Fletcher, Wilson and three unnamed \"co-conspirators\" in the lead up to the shooting.\nPolice allege that an unnamed person approached Elien's vehicle at 903 Camelia St. That person appeared \"to either look into the vehicle to verify the victim's presence or potentially make contact,\" police wrote.\nThe person returned to where Fletcher, Wilson and others were, police say. Wilson approached the driver's side of the vehicle, followed by Fletcher and the three others, court documents state.\nCharging documents allege Wilson opened the driver's side door and shot Elien in the head with a handgun. Elien fell to the ground and Wilson, Fletcher and the others fled, police said.\nInvestigators found a handgun on the scene and allege it was left by Wilson — court documents state that \"Wilson was observed dropping an object from his possession onto the ground\" after the shooting.\nA co-conspirator returned to where Elien was lying and potentially removed an object from his body, detectives alleged.\nPolice wrote in charging documents that \"there is probable cause to believe\" Fletcher, Wilson and the three unnamed people \"formed a plan\" to rob and shoot Elien.\nFletcher is being held at the Dorchester County Department of Corrections on no bond. A bond hearing is slated for July 16 and a preliminary hearing Aug. 5.\nThe Cambridge Police Department said in a press release last month that Wilson was being held without bond. Court scheduling information for Wilson, 15, was unavailable on Maryland's court records database. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He came into the position with a military background, and he had been serving the Town of Federalsburg for almost 30 years.\nRidgley has maintained a contract with the Caroline County Sheriff's Office to have assigned officers covering the town since last year. In March 2024, the town suspended its police department amid a state investigation.\nMore recently, Ridgley has agreed to continue the memorandum of understanding with the sheriff's office for the next fiscal year. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Officials said he was on the water for \"several hours\" and around three miles from home.\nUsing thermal imaging cameras, a Natural Resource Police aviation unit quickly found the lost person — in around five minutes, according to Sgt. John Buchanan, chief pilot for NRP. Buchanan was in the aircraft with tactical flight officer Christian Helwig.\nBuchanan said the kayaker left out of Grace Creek.\n\"I think it got dark on him, and he didn't know where he was,\" Buchanan said.\nOnce located, police used a spotlight to direct a rescue boat from the Tilghman Island Volunteer Fire Company toward the juvenile.\nA video posted to Facebook by Natural Resource Police shows the aircraft hone in on the kayaker and direct the fire boat to retrieve the juvenile.\nBuchanan said such a rescue isn't too common, but it become somewhat prominent during boating season.\n\"(The) Chesapeake Bay and the tributaries are very large,\" Buchanan said. \"When you start thinking about the different rivers and creeks and stuff off the Chesapeake Bay, we go out on different search missions like that probably a few times a month.\"\nThe pilot emphasized Helwig's expertise is crucial to such rescues. Helwig handles the thermal imaging camera, which can expose subjects in dark conditions, as well as a mapping system to pull up addresses and latitudes and longitudes.\n\"He's gotten really good with it, he's worked really hard at it,\" Buchanan said. \"He's made us as a team very successful going out and doing these search missions.\"\nBuchanan advises those going out on the water, especially alone, to be prepared with a charged cell phone and other equipment in case of emergency.\n\"Have a life jacket if you're out at night,\" he said. \"Obviously have some kind of flashlight. And know the area, that's probably the biggest thing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

He said there was tree damage in northern parts of the county, but no serious incidents.\nIn Caroline County, a few trees were downed but mostly cleared out of roadways by mid-Wednesday morning.\nAn Easton Utilities spokesperson said two customers experienced power outages Tuesday night. Easton Utilities President and CEO John Horner cited the organization's efforts to provide reliability.\n\"Every upgrade we make strengthens our system, reduces outages, and ensures we're prepared to meet growing demands,\" Horner wrote in a statement.\nThunderstorms in the area are expected to continue Wednesday. According to a briefing from the National Weather Service's Mount Holly/Philadelphia office, Caroline and Talbot counties are under a flood watch alert from 5 p.m. Wednesday to 2 a.m. Thursday.\nLeCates stresses residents should avoid driving through flooded waters and take precautions even when home during thunderstorms.\n\"Prepare your homes for loose objects that will be blowing around,\" LeCates said. \"Secure loose objects.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When Saathoff arrived, he eventually found four trucks doused with gas — one of them significantly burnt.\n\"The seats were soaked, they had gas running out of the floor,\" Saathoff said. \"Then the very last one, we could tell when we open it, it had burned.\"\nDamages are estimated at $100,000, per the fire marshal. Saathoff said surveillance cameras show two actors — one driving a vehicle outside the fence and another person inside the business' fence where the trucks are parked, he said.\nThe fire marshal's office is actively investigating the arson attempt. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Upper Eastern Regional Office at 410-819-3500.\nSunnySide Energy — which delivers bulk loads of fuel, retail and pool water — is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to an arrest, Saathoff said.\nHe added that the damage to the trucks is a big financial dent.\n\"The loads that were lined up for the trucks, we have to get them back and you have lost revenue,\" Saathoff said. \"But we still got the same expenses.\"\nThis story has been updated to correct the name of the business fire officials say was targeted in an arson attempt. The company is SunnySide Energy, formerly Murphy Transport and America's Best Oil. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Each of those charges carries a maximum 25-year sentence.\nUnder the original charges filed last month against Britten, the most serious of the eight counts he faced — accessory after the fact relating to first-degree murder — is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\nThe indictment retains some of the original charges against Britten, including burying/disposing a body in unauthorized place, neglect of a minor and failure to report a child's death, court records show.\nAfter the additional charges, Britten is being held in the Cecil County Detention Center on no bond.\nBritten's co-defendant — his girlfriend, Darrian Lynnelle Randle, 31 — remains in a Delaware jail in lieu of $1 million bond.\nShe is awaiting extradition to Cecil County, Randle is accused of fatally beating her 3-year-old daughter, Nola Dinkins, inside their shared bedroom at Britten's residence in the 300 block of Elk Nest Road in North East, Md., during the daytime hours on June 9.\nShe also told investigators that, after picking up Nola, she called for Britten, who also was inside the residence, according to court records. Britten attempted CPR on Nola, but eventually realized that the girl was dead.\nRandle told police that she and Britten placed Nola's body in his black 2019 BMW X3 and that they then drove around for a while, before returning to their Elk Nest Road residence.\nThen, according to the documented account that Randle gave police, she and Britten placed the girl's body in a dark blue suitcase that belonged to Britten and placed the luggage on the third step of the basement stairs, where it remained overnight. Randle said she checked the suitcase once overnight.\nRandle told police that she asked Britten to take the girl's body \"somewhere,\" court records show.\nRandle then drove to Delaware and called police to falsely report Nola had been kidnapped at gunpoint on Gender Road.\nRandle's abduction complaint triggered an Amber Alert but after further investigation, Randle admitted that she had killed Nola, according to court records.\nPolice later found Nola's body inside the suitcase on a vacant property near the house where Randle and Britten live in North East. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He quickly located the dog, named Lainey, and brought her to safety.\nLainey was unresponsive and in cardiac arrest when she was handed to personnel from Kent and Queen Anne's Rescue Squad. Crews performed CPR and administered oxygen using a pet-specific oxygen mask.\nShe eventually revived and was treated on scene for smoke inhalation.\nThe dog was transported to an emergency veterinary facility in Dover, Delaware, but the owner later canceled the transport after Lainey became extremely anxious. In a follow-up post, the owners reported that she is currently receiving care at a veterinary hospital.\nWhile Lainey was being evaluated, Engine 6 arrived on scene, deployed a 1¾-inch hose line and located the fire at the front of the home. Firefighters extinguished the blaze, which caused significant fire, heat and smoke damage.\nThe fire was discovered by the homeowner and drew a response of about 40 firefighters and a tanker task force, though tankers were not needed. The blaze was brought under control in 31 minutes.\nThe Office of the Maryland State Fire Marshal determined the preliminary cause of the fire to be natural — a lightning strike. Estimated damages were $200,000 to the structure and $60,000 to contents.\nNo injuries were reported besides Lainey's.\nThe fire department noted all of its vehicles are equipped with pet oxygen kits, including masks in three sizes to fit small to large dogs — part of the department's readiness for animal rescues during emergencies. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chester woman sentenced in 2024 multi-vehicle crash on Bay Bridge\n\n July 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STAFF REPORT | Section: Local News \n \n 558\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — The woman responsible for a 20-plus vehicle crash on the Bay Bridge has been sentenced in Queen Anne's County Circuit Court.On July 8, Gwendolyn Persina, 49, of Chester, was sentenced to three years of jail time with all but 315 days suspended, which is the time Persina has served in jail from the time of her arrest.\nAccording to the Office of the State's Attorney, Persina was sentenced for causing a life-threatening injury to another while operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. This was the most serious charge that Persina was charged with and the maximum penalty for the offense is three years in jail and a $5,000 fine.\nPersina was also sentenced to five years of supervised probation, ordered to have a mental health evaluation and complete any recommended treatment, to abstain from alcohol and drugs, to get an alcohol evaluation and complete any recommended treatment.\nPersina pleaded guilty by way of an Alford guilty plea, by not admitting guilt but by acknowledging that the state had sufficient evidence that she could be found guilty of the charge.\nThe case was prosecuted by Lance G. Richardson, state's attorney for Queen Anne's County, assisted by Carolynn Grammas, assistant state's attorney from Anne Arundel County, appointed as a special prosecutor for the case.\nThe state said the sentence fell within the recommended sentence range as calculated by the Maryland Sentencing Guidelines, which recommended a sentence ranging from six months to three years of active incarceration.\nPersina's conviction was based on a Jan. 27, 2024, incident when at approximately 7:46 a.m. she was operating a Honda Civic passenger vehicle at a high rate of speed in heavy fog traveling westbound on the Bay Bridge on the Queen Anne's County portion of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. Persina rear-ended another vehicle, which disabled her vehicle in the travel portion of the bridge, resulting in a 23-vehicle chain reaction collision.\nThe collision resulted in a victim having his arm severed from his body. The man's arm was unable to be reattached. Persina suffered serious injuries in the collision and was transported to the hospital.\nThrough the course of their investigation, police determined at the time of the collision, Persina's blood alcohol content was between 0.24 and 0.27 — three times greater than the legal limit.\nAlthough the accident occurred on Jan. 27, 2024, Persina wasn't criminally charged until August 2024. The state reported the delay in formally charging Persina was due to the incredible amount of vehicle data that had to be reviewed for the more than 20 vehicles involved.\nAccording to State's Attorney Lance Richardson's chief of staff, Rob Penny, medical records had to be obtained and then the large volume of records had to be reviewed.\nAdditionally, a large volume of other evidence, and information from witnesses, had to be reviewed and analyzed. All of this investigative information took months to be collected and examined, Penny said.\nOnce Persina was formally charged, she was arrested and held without bail. Her attorneys ultimately filed a notice of incompetency to stand trial due to her inability to assist in her defense or an inability to understand the nature of the proceedings.\nExperts from both the state and the defense examined Persina. After many delays, the state doctor from the Maryland Department of Health deemed Persina competent to stand trial on July 2.\nThe Office of the Public Defender represented Persina. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County Sheriff's Office to place cameras in patrol cars\n\n July 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 465\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot County Sheriff's Office is planning to add cameras to its patrol vehicles, a move that Sheriff Joe Gamble said will increase transparency with the public.Earlier this month, Talbot County council members approved the purchase of 30 in-car cameras for $415,000, spread across a five-year period. Body-worn cameras have their limits, Gamble said, only showing the steering wheel during situations like police chases.\nThe sheriff said the in-car cameras have two main benefits.\n\"One, it's another level of transparency with the public,\" Gamble said. \"And the other is evidence gathering.\"\nBut Gamble noted that a state investigation into a fatal police-involved chase last year factored into the decision.\n\"It definitely played a role in it,\" he said.\nIn July 2024, Talbot County deputies and an Easton police officer engaged in a pursuit of a vehicle on U.S. Route 50 in Easton after the driver failed to pull over for a traffic stop. Police reached speeds over 100 mph, and the chase ended with the vehicle crashing into a tree on Black Dog Alley. An 18-year-old passenger died.\nThe Independent Investigations Division of the Maryland Attorney General's Office reviewed the incident, as it does for all fatal police-involved chases statewide. Body-worn camera footage was eventually released in September. It wasn't until January when state investigators determined they wouldn't seek charges against any of the involved officers.\nAt the time, Gamble said it shouldn't have taken that long for the state to complete its investigation and clear his deputies. Now, the in-car cameras will better show the actions taken by vehicles being pursued by police, he argues.\n\"You couldn't see the egregious disregard for public safety by the driver in that car,\" Gamble said in an interview this week, referencing the limited view of the chase provided by body-worn cameras.\n\"It protects our deputies in the sense that, this is what they did,\" he added. \"And if there's allegations they did something else, it's on footage.\"\nOther sheriffs on the Eastern Shore concur with the effectiveness of the cameras.\nQueen Anne's Sheriff Gary Hofmann said most patrol vehicles have had the in-car cameras for a few years. Complaints are down, and it's increased trust with the community, Hofmann says.\n\"It's been extremely beneficial for us to avoid any type of complaints or allegations,\" he said.\nDorchester Sheriff James Phillips said he would love for his agency to buy them, although cost is a problem — the in-car cameras are more expensive than body-worn ones.\nIn Caroline County, the vehicle cameras were purchased under a former sheriff, current Sheriff Donnie Baker noted. They are key in providing a better perspective for traffic stops and other incident, he said.\n\"I think that they make a good cop better,\" Baker said, \"and they limit false reports.\"\nGamble said the Talbot County Sheriff's Office hopes to install all 30 in-car cameras by 2026. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Court records show that police used an eyewitness account from an off-duty officer, a recovered handgun at Sampson's residence and surveillance cameras to identify the 18-year-old as their suspect.\nJust after 8:30 p.m. the night of the shooting, police responded to Hudson Road (state Route 343) and the Westside Bypass. Officers found Dennis lying in the roadway with a gunshot wound to his chest, police say.\nAn off-duty Dorchester County Sheriff's deputy and a civilian attempted CPR, as did responding officers. EMS, though, declared Dennis dead at the scene.\nThe sheriff's deputy provided Cambridge police an account of the shooting. He saw Dennis running down Westside Bypass approaching a silver Nissan, according to court records. The deputy then heard a gunshot and saw the Nissan drive past him and turn onto Hudson Road, charging documents state.\nAs the car drove by, the deputy \"observed a black male driver leaning out the (window) holding a handgun,\" court records state.\nA second witness told police that Dennis followed the Nissan and went up to the car's window, and \"'then they popped,'\" the witness said.\nFollowing an anonymous tip, Cambridge detectives began to look into Sampson. Police had already been investigating Sampson in connection to an armed robbery. Detectives visited the teen's residence two days after the shooting and saw a silver Nissan, according to court records, and matched witness descriptions of the tags to what they saw.\nLater that day, investigators searched Sampson's home, finding a handgun matching the casing found on the scene, charging documents say. A family member of Sampson's told detectives that the 18-year-old was driving the silver Nissan since graduating in May, according to court documents.\nPolice said in charging documents that \"several different cameras\" show the routes allegedly taken by Sampson toward the site of the shooting.\nSampson was arrested for murder Wednesday at the Dorchester County Detention Center — he was being held there since June 27 on unrelated charges in connection to an armed robbery of three teens in Cambridge on May 24.\nSampson faces 32 counts in connection to the armed robbery, court documents show. Charges include armed robbery, first- and second-degree assault, and other firearm and theft counts. Police say they are still searching for a second suspect in the May robbery.\nThe 18-year-old is being held without bond on both the murder and armed robbery cases. A preliminary hearing for both cases is scheduled for July 24. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

She also told investigators that Britten later sent her a photograph of a park, after driving away from residence with the suitcase inside his car, police added.\nCharging documents further allege that, during an interview at MSP's North East Barrack on June 11, Britten \"produced a map of where he believed that Randle may have disposed of\" Nola's body, a statement that appears to allege that Randle got rid of the body.\nBased on that map, investigators found human remains \"consistent with an emaciated child\" inside a suitcase found in a vacant lot in the unit block of Dune Drive near North East, close to Britten's residence, court records show.\nRandle remained in a New Castle (Del.) County jail in lieu of $1 million bond on Monday, after her arrest there last month. She is awaiting extradition to Cecil County, where she will be served court papers charging her with several offenses, including first-degree murder, burying/disposing a body in an unauthorized place and neglect of a minor, according to the Cecil County State's Attorney's Office.\nBritten remained in the Cecil County Detention Center on no bond Monday, after a Cecil County grand jury handed up an 11-count indictment against him on July 2. Included in those charges against Britten are felony first-degree child abuse resulting in a death of a child under 13 years old and a mirroring conspiracy count, both of which are punishable by up to life in prison if convicted.\nBritten also is charged with first-degree child abuse resulting in severe injury and an additional conspiracy count relating to that felony offense — each of which carries a maximum 25-year sentence if convicted — and accessory after the fact relating to first-degree murder, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison if convicted. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The state is not prosecuting previously levied charges against Todd for attempted murder and assault.\nTodd was the last of four people to enter pleas for an incident that occurred in April 2024. Three others accused of assaulting Todd during the incident — 21-year-old Tucker Eason, 19-year-old Blake Dorman and 18-year-old Navelie White — have pleaded guilty to assault charges. They were each handed sentences that they are currently serving.\nThe incident occurred in the parking lot of the Kohl's on April 16, 2024. The Easton Police Department said Todd fired a gun after an assault took place, according to a press release from when Todd was arrested in October 2024. Police spoke with a person whose truck had been hit by a bullet, allegedly from Todd's handgun.\nAccording to police, Todd told them that while in the parking lot that day, Eason hit him on the head with a beer bottle. Another person had a tire iron, Todd told authorities. Todd also told police he was punched several times.\nDetectives interviewed a witness who identified Eason, Dorman and White as the people who attacked Todd.\nAt the time, Easton police said video showed the attack during which Todd fired his gun after the assault ended with people fleeing the area.\nOn June 26, Judge Philip Cronan sentenced Todd to one year for reckless endangerment with the full term suspended, and two years for the handgun charge with all but 212 days suspended. Todd was credited with 212 days served dating back to last November. Cronan ordered Todd to serve two years on probation and perform community service, among other conditions.\nWhite, of Easton, entered an Alford plea for first-degree assault on March 21. He was sentenced to eight years with all but 18 months suspended, dating back to January.\nEason, of Easton, pleaded guilty in December 2024 to second-degree assault and was sentenced to a three-year term with all but 18 months suspended. The 18 months date back to October 2024.\nDorman, of St. Michaels, pleaded guilty on June 4 to second-degree assault and rioting. A three-year sentence for the rioting was fully suspended. For the assault count, Cronan delivered a three-year sentence with all but 18 months suspended, dating to June 3. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jones, who lives in the 200 block of Hollingsworth Manor, which is one block away from where the incident occurred.\nThe investigation leading to Jones' arrest and the charges against him started at approximately 10:50 a.m. on Sunday, when Elkton Police Department officers rushed to a residence in the 300 block of Hollingsworth Manor after receiving a dispatch regarding a knife-related incident in progress, police reported.\nAs officers arrived at the house, Jones moved from the living room into a rear bedroom and closed the door, police said. Officers arrested him, after they ordered him to exit the bedroom and he obliged, police added.\nInvestigators found a \"large knife\" inside the bedroom where they had located Jones and collected it as evidence, court records allege.\nIn addition, investigators found an unspecified amount of suspect heroin, suspect crack cocaine and \"unknown prescription pills\" on a coffee table in the living room, where Jones was first seen by arriving officers before he fled into the back bedroom, according to the charging document, which indicates that they also seized those substances as evidence.\nOne of the women who lives at that residence told investigators that she awoke to find Jones, whom she does not know, and that she then \"raised her voice\" at him, police said. At that point, Jones allegedly pulled a knife and demanded that she apologize to him, police added.\nThe woman's sister told investigators that Jones — uninvited — entered the residence through a back door and demanded that she drive him to New Castle, Del., according to the charging document. She also told investigators that this marked the third time that day that Jones had entered the residence, court records allege.\nA man described in court papers as a \"witness\" told investigators that he was awakened by the sound of one of the female residents arguing with Jones who, according to the witness' account, was \"waving a blade\" at that woman, police reported.\nThat man told investigators that he told Jones to lower his voice and to calm down, police said. He also told investigators that Jones \"swung the knife back and forth,\" which is what he was doing when officers arrived at the residence, prompting Jones to retreat into the back bedroom, police added.\nJones is facing eight charges, including first-degree assault, reckless endangerment, fourth-degree burglary and three counts of possession of a controlled and dangerous substance, court records show.\nHe spent one night in the Cecil County Detention Center on no bond, before gaining his pre-trial release by posting a $5,000 bond on Monday after his bail review hearing, according to court records, which indicate that Cecil County District Court Administrative Judge Clara E. Campbell presided over that proceeding. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Though harmless, the scare triggered a lockdown, rattled parents and tied up emergency resources.\n\"This is an example, when you don't have the owner's permission and individuals try to run a cat colony without really having that open communication with the property owner,\" Neel said.\nShe noted schools, government land and private properties are off-limits for colonies without the explicit permission and oversight.\nWhile the county lacks a formal trap-neuter-return, or TNR, program, animal control collaborates with the Humane Society and Rescue Angels to implement humane alternatives.\nOne such initiative is the Barn Cat Program, which relocates semi-feral or feral cats to places where they serve as natural pest control — farms, barns or wineries — in exchange for shelter, food and vaccinations.\nPatricia \"Pat\" Parrish, president of Help For Pets and a former veterinary technician, later told commissioners that TNR is the only proven way to reduce cat overpopulation.\n\"Trap and kill does not work,\" she said, arguing that taxpayer money is wasted when nonprofits, like hers, are ready to assist.\nParrish shared a personal story from her first volunteer case with the Humane Society a decade ago in Nanjemoy, where a woman was overwhelmed by a colony of 30 cats.\n\"I said, 'Well how about if I come out and trap all these cats for ya, get them all spayed and neutered and vaccinated and bring them back? Then, could you keep them?'\" Parrish said. \"She started crying. She said, 'I love my cats. ... They give me a reason to get up in the morning.'\"\nParrish helped eventually reduce that colony from 30 cats to three.\n\"That's what I've done for hundreds of colonies all over Charles County,\" she said.\nParrish said her group has spent over $200,000 in the past decade to reduce feral cat populations and wants to partner with animal control on a formal TNR program.\nAt the care center, Neel said cats with a tip of one ear cut off — an indicator that they have been neutered — are logged and local TNR groups are notified.\nAnimal control handles a wide range of responsibilities, including managing nuisance reports, responding to livestock issues and preventing rabies.\nNeel emphasized the importance of staying current on vaccinations, calling it essential.\nAnimal control Lt. Katy Rosche noted a recent milestone — over 560 animals (between dogs, cats and ferrets) were vaccinated during two clinics held between May and early June.\nMeanwhile, Parrish holds firm to her belief: \"If we can get on board with this [TNR], we can make a big difference.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Nathan Funchion, patrol bureau commander for the Calvert County Sheriff's Office, told Southern Maryland News during a recent telephone interview.\nDebora Harris, president of Calvert's NAACP chapter, noted that over the years the local organization has frequently fielded calls from citizens, in particular African Americans, who have sensed they were being profiled by county law enforcement when driving. She said those number of calls have dwindled somewhat.\n\"We don't get complaints, not lately,\" Harris told Southern Maryland News.\nHarris said it was Calvert's NAACP chapter that engaged the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland in researching questionable encounters among local deputies and African Americans. While traffic stops are part of the study, a major focus is what the state union calls \"invasive police searches,\" which occurred from 2020 through 2024.\nThe state union's request for documentation reached a stalemate when sheriff's officials insisted on remittance of a $12,000 in exchange for the requested records. The ACLU challenged the hefty charge, citing the Maryland Public Information Act, and prevailed in both circuit and appellate courts.\nSouthern Maryland News made calls and sent emails to the state ACLU seeking an update on their study, plus basic information on how citizens should, within their rights, interact with law enforcement. No response was received.\nWhen things go wrongLast December, a Prince George's County man with ties to Calvert County reached out to Southern Maryland News to share his story of a bad encounter with a Calvert County deputy.\nOn Dec. 18 William Jacks, 41, of Clinton was traveling with his wife, Kimberly, in Prince Frederick. The couple was traveling in their 2013 Ford Edge and Kimberly was driving.\nAround 9:30 a.m., the vehicle was pulled over in the area of Prince Frederick Boulevard and Chapline Place. The officer conducting the stop is identified in court documents as Deputy Gavin Shuart of the Calvert County Sheriff's Office.\nIn his lengthy statement recalling the incident, Jacks said he put his passenger side window down \"about 3½ inches. Once the officer walked up on the passenger side, his first words were 'wind your window all the way down.'\"\nJacks said he refused the deputy's order, telling him, \"You can see me, you can see inside my car, you can hear me, I can hear you and if I need to pass you something or if I need to receive something from you we are able to.\"\nJacks claimed in his statement that the deputy threatened to break the window if it wasn't rolled all the way down. When, according to Jacks, the deputy \"proceeded to reach his arm in from his forearm up to the mid-bicep through my window\" a cup of hot coffee in the vehicle's middle console spilled out on the two men, who were in a struggle for the vehicle's door handle. After the deputy managed to gain entry into the vehicle, Jacks said he demanded to speak with the officer's supervisor, which he eventually did, followed by the filing of a complaint with Calvert's Police Accountability Board.\nAccording to the board's complaint tracker, the complaint filed Dec. 19 alleging \"abuse of authority\" was investigated, with the probe being completed Feb. 13. The final result was no administrative charges for the deputy.\nKimberly Jacks, identified in court documents as Kimberly Pilkerton, 44, was cited for displaying an expired registration plate, driving a vehicle on a highway without current registration plates, failure to maintain and to provide on request required security, and knowingly driving an uninsured vehicle.\nAll of the traffic citations were placed on the district court stet docket after a February hearing presided over by Judge Robyn Riddle.\nIn a followup phone call last week, Jacks expressed doubts that the board investigators reviewed Shuart's body camera footage when weighing the merits of the complaint.\nIn his statement provided to Southern Maryland News, Jacks said, \"I truly feel that this officer had broken entry into by vehicle\" and \"assaulted me fighting over a door handle.\"\nIn another matter, Harris shared with Southern Maryland News that the local NAACP chapter \"received a complaint last year by an elderly woman\" who claimed Calvert police pulled her over and \"charged her with drunk driving, and took her license.\"\nHarris said subsequent sobriety tests showed \"she was not driving under the influence.\" However, the woman, according to Harris, has not been able to get her license back.\nRecommendations made\nFunchion told Southern Maryland News, \"in this county in particular, most interactions are positive.\"\nThe Calvert sheriff's office captain's advice for motorists is if they see a flashing light behind you \"turn on your turn signal to indicate you are going to pull over. Keeping hands in sight is highly recommended. It's highly recommended\" that you \"roll your window down.\"\nFunchion said the officer will identify themselves and let you know they are wearing an activated body camera.\n\"Be polite and courteous, provide documents,\" Funchion said, adding that if the vehicle's registration is in the glove box, \"let the officer know you want to retrieve it.\"\nThe captain said the information provided will be run through a computer the deputy has in his or her patrol vehicle.\nA citation or a warning will be provided to the motorist, who then \"may pull back onto the road.\"\nOccasionally, law enforcement officers also issue repair orders to motorists, who may not be aware that a brake light or tag light is out. Calvert's sheriff's office, said Funchoin, on average only issues 50 to 60 repair orders annually to motorists.\nThe national NAACP advises motorists on their website that they \"have the right not to consent to a search of your vehicle. If the police state they have probable cause, they may begin to search your car without your consent. Do not interfere but clearly state your lack of consent. If you are given a ticket, sign it. You can always fight the case in court later.\"\nThe latter advice is also recommended by the American Civil Liberties Union, which states on its national website that anyone stopped by the police has a right to ask, \"'Am I being detained or am I free to go.' If you wish to remain silent, you should say, 'I don't want to talk to you without a lawyer.'\"\nThe union also advised, \"You have the right to refuse to consent to a search of yourself, your car or your home, with certain exceptions.\"\nDriving forward\nOverall, in 2024 the Calvert County Sheriff's Office received a total of 33 complaints, with five resulting in administrative charges, which mostly resulted in letters of reprimand and one with suspension and loss of leave.\nSo far in 2025, 10 complaints are currently under investigation by the county's Police Accountability Board and four have been completed, resulting in a letter of reprimand given to an officer.\nHarris said the local NAACP chapter does receive complaints about the way the two panels — police accountability board and administrative charging committee — do business.\n\"It's very limited to what can happen,\" Harris said. \"Police are really governing themselves.\"\nAs to the low number of complaints resulting in punitive action, Funchion said he believes the body cameras each deputy is equipped with are making a difference.\n\"We felt like we were disliked and getting a bad rap,\" Funchion said. \"The perception has changed.\"\nFunchion acknowledged the county has seen \"an uptick\" in \"roadside interactions,\" which he said is part of a strategy implemented due to the county's higher number of road fatalities in 2024.\nThe captain explained motorists who see police interactions tend to drive slower, so the increased traffic stops, due to their visibility \"slows traffic.\"\nTwitter: @MartySoMdNews \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But because they have had to re-route their delivery vans, deliveries have been taking longer.\nThe sinkhole at the cross section of Cedar Street and Peachblossom Avenue will hopefully be fixed by Friday, but it may take longer, according to Ward 3 Commissioner Frank Stout.\nThe pipes necessary to fix the sinkhole have been ordered, but Stout said he did not know the order status.\n\"I'm not sure the status on the pipes, but hopefully they will be here soon,\" he said.\nCity Officials are asking residents to plan accordingly and seek alternative routes this weekend in case the project is not completed. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton minister detained by ICE\n\n July 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Local News \n \n 507\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A beloved Easton minister was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, taken to Salisbury and is now at the Baltimore ICE detention center where he is awaiting his next transfer, according to his daughter.Honduran born Daniel Fuentes Espinal has lived in the United States since 2001 and has served as the minister of Iglesia del Nazareno Jesús Te Ama since 2015. According to his daughter, Clarissa Fuentes Diaz, Espinal was arrested by ICE agents early Monday morning after stopping by Lowe's to pick up material for a job site.\n\"He didn't see anything suspicious. He put the material in the car, but then when he went to McDonald's to get something for breakfast, he saw a car behind him that looked kind of weird,\" Cordero said.\nICE agents followed Espinal to the Easton pool, ultimately arresting him on Route 322. He was taken to the Salisbury holding center. \"He preached to them all the way to Salisbury,\" Diaz said.\nFrom 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., Espinal's family had no clue of his whereabouts. \"We were about to do a report on a missing person because we didn't find out until almost 12:30,\" Diaz said.\nDiaz said Espinal had no criminal record.\nSince President Donald Trump took office in January, immigration arrests have doubled in the state of Maryland. More than 600 immigrants arrested during this time had no former criminal charges, according to the Deportation Data Project.\nEspinal has three children and a large extended family that he cares for, Diaz said. Tred Avon Strategies principal Len Foxwell referred to him as a pillar of the community.\nEarlier this month, Espinal spoke at Foxwell's son Darren's funeral. Diaz said Darren and her brother were best friends and his death has been hard on Espinal and the family.\nDiaz said she has received over 10 character letters on her father's behalf since his arrest yesterday morning, including one from Foxwell.\n\"It wasn't until I got to know him, however, that I saw how he honors and embodies the values of Christ in every aspect of his life,\" Foxwell wrote in a letter to ICE.\nEspinal's family has tried obtaining citizenship legally for years, but due to backlogs and expenses, Espinal remained undocumented, Diaz said.\n\"He's contributing to this country, and we're just trying to do it the right way,\" Diaz said. \"You know, unfortunately, with everything going on, everyone's a criminal apparently, but we're just hoping for the best and just to get him out of there.\"\nDiaz said each phone call Espinal makes from the detention center costs $50 for a 20-minute call and bond amounts for release currently range from $10,000 to $15,000.\n\"I've heard stories that people say, 'But why didn't you do it the legal way? Why aren't you doing it the legal way?' It's not easy,\" Diaz said. \"You know, if you're not in that person's shoes, you shouldn't be judging, and you shouldn't be criticizing.\"\nEspinal's family is relying on their faith and are hopeful that he will return home.\nICE could not be reached via phone to comment on this incident. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Rodney Helmer visited the White House for President Donald Trump's signing of the HALT Fentanyl Act.Baker said Fentanyl has been a large issue for his office, prompting his attendance at the bill's signing.\n\"Fentanyl is a huge issue all over the nation, including the state of Maryland,\" Baker said. \"We deal with a huge amount of overdoses, many of them fatal within Caroline County. So this absolutely was a big push from law enforcement to the White House, and the president listened and pushed this through Congress.\"\nBaker and Helmer were invited by the National Sheriff's Association, along with multiple sheriffs from around the country.\nAlong with law enforcement officers, there were families of victims of fentanyl overdoses.\nThe HALT Fentanyl Act will permanently classify fentanyl related substances as Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. Baker said that the reclassifying fentanyl can reduce loopholes that traffickers can exploit.\nTrump said in a statement that the legislation is \"delivering another defeat for the savage drug smugglers and criminals and the cartels.\"\nBaker said he felt the bill would be effective in helping curb overdoses and crime.\n\"Fentanyl is claiming lives in the communities across our nation, specifically Caroline County,\" Baker said. \"Classifying fentanyl related substances as a schedule one drug will eliminate drug loopholes that traffickers can exploit treating the drug with the severity that it warrants.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Along with Talbot County vehicles, the colorful display featured fire trucks from Sudlersville, Federalsburg and several other Maryland towns.\nThe event was more than just a tribute to the fire company; it was a celebration of community.\n\"It really gets everybody out,\" volunteer firefighter Charles Lomax of Tilghman said. \"People that don't get along, people that don't necessarily agree with each other, all come out and support one cause.\"\nLomax started volunteering with the fire company when he was 16, following in the footsteps of his father, who had been with the fire company for over 20 years. He said the fire company has always been a meaningful part of his life and the community. The parade, he added, is a way for the town to honor the work of generations of volunteers.\n\"I've only been in it six years, eight years, something like that,\" Lomax said. \"But seeing some of these older members and how much it means to them, it's awesome.\"\nThe celebration attracted not only the local community, but visitors from beyond Tilghman.\nMatthew Tucker from northeastern Pennsylvania watched the parade with his family, including his brother, a volunteer firefighter in Oxford.\n\"I think it's important to celebrate anything that helps protect and serve the community. It's all volunteer, and that's wonderful,\" Tucker said. \"A parade like this symbolizes generations of families coming out and supporting community, local health and the people that are providing service to us as volunteers.\"\nTucker's mother, Christine, added to his remarks: \"It's a thankless job, and it can really be dangerous.\"\nThe day ended with a fireman's contest, in which volunteer firefighters from different locations demonstrated their skills in a simulated emergency, followed by a parade trophy ceremony.\nThe celebration emphasized the importance of such service in a small town, like Tilghman, where the fire company is a lifeline to its residents.\nAfter 100 years of service to Tilghman Island, the celebration honored the legacy and dedication of generations of residents who have volunteered their time to protect their community.\nRichard Childers, a former Tilghman firefighter who lives in Preston, returned to Tilghman to attend the celebration with his 9-year-old son, Noah. Inside the firehouse, Richard and Noah examined a large display of photos, including several generations of volunteers and fire trucks, along with newspaper clippings about the fire company's history dating back over 70 years.\n\"It's just an accomplishment to have a volunteer department that long — that has stayed volunteer for 100 years,\" Childers said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Initial reports indicate one person was able to extricate themselves, while two others were pronounced dead at the scene.\nAccording to Maryland State Police, the driver and the passenger of a Toyota Camry, identified as Valerie Haines, 63, and Patricia Mead, 86, of Ridgley, were pronounced deceased on the scene by Queen Anne's emergency medical services personnel. The driver of a utility truck, a 39-year-old male, was reported uninjured in the crash. The preliminary investigation indicates the utility truck was traveling south when it struck the Toyota, which was attempting to cross U.S. Route 301.\nOn Tuesday morning, July 22, another two-vehicle crash at the same intersection claimed the life of Mickie Mowbray, 58, of Greensboro, who was driving a Kia. Police said a southbound Mazda struck the Kia as it attempted to cross Route 301, causing it to overturn. The 22-year-old male driver and 20-year-old female passenger in the Mazda were flown to R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore in critical condition.\nIn that crash, one person was ejected and two others required extrication. Emergency crews from the Maryland State Police, Queen Anne's County Fire and EMS, and the Maryland Department of Transportation responded. Southbound lanes were closed for roughly three hours.\nAccording to the Maryland State Highway Administration, the intersection has a troubling safety record. Between January 2019 and December 2023, 76 crashes were reported at the site — 62 of them involving the southbound lanes. Most were attributed to driver inattention or failure to yield.\nDespite several mitigation efforts — including pavement realignment, rumble strips, and enhanced signage — crashes have continued. In July 2024, the SHA closed the MD 405 median crossover at US 301 to all traffic movements, citing ongoing safety concerns. The closure was since lifted and reopened to crossing.\nHighway officials were not immediately available for comment.\nThe Maryland State Police Crash Team is leading both investigations. Findings will be submitted to the Queen Anne's County State's Attorney's Office for review. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton man receives 18 years for sex assault of daughter, other crimes\n\n July 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Crime \n \n 660\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — An Easton man received an 18-year sentence on Thursday for third-degree sex offense against his then-3-year-old daughter, among other offenses.Kevin Manning, 34, appeared in court to hear his fate after entering a guilty plea for the felony sex offense and nine other counts, including witness intimidation, electronic communication harassment and violation of a protective order. Those nine counts were levied for actions he took against his daughter's mother after the Sept. 2024 assault of the daughter.\nTalbot County Circuit Court Judge Phil Cronan handed down the 18-year sentence — a term exceeding the recommended five- to 13-year range — for what he called a \"vicious and heinous\" crime.\nBefore Cronan delivered the sentence, Deputy State's Attorney Chelsea Endzel asked the court for a 30-year sentence.\nEndzel cited Manning's past sex assault convictions: a fourth-degree sex offense in Anne Arundel County in 2016 and second-degree rape in Talbot County in 2022 stemming from a 2009 incident involving Manning and an underage female living with him at the time.\nThe rape conviction was dismissed in 2023 after it was determined that the judge who postponed Manning's trial date was not designated to do so.\nEndzel argued for the extended sentence, in part, due to Manning's \"repeated harassment\" of the child's mother, Emily Hiester, beginning last September. Endzel wrote in a memo to the court that Manning contacted Hiester nearly 200 times through emails and phone calls, violating a protective order.\nEndzel read a written impact statement from Hiester, in which the mother said she couldn't bear to be in a courtroom with Manning. Hiester wrote that she has secluded herself from others and that she \"can see the pain\" in her daughter's eyes.\n\"I can't see others the same when someone I thought I knew I could trust did something so horrible,\" a portion of the statement read.\nHiester asked for Manning's sentence to be \"as much time as the court will allow.\"\nEndzel also argued that an open District Court case in which Manning is accused of assaulting an inmate at the Talbot County Detention Center factors into the danger he poses to society. The alleged assault occurred May 24.\n\"The question is not whether he will reoffend, but when,\" Endzel said.\nManning's defense attorney, Holly Brownley of the public defender's office, asked Cronan to deliver a sentence within the pre-sentence recommendations.\nManning \"had some serious traumas in his young life,\" such as the murder of his mother and being exposed to drug and substance abuse, Brownley said.\nThe 34-year-old defendant, in an orange suit, handcuffs and wide black glasses, spoke for a few minutes at the hearing Thursday. He said he wants to go to a maximum-security prison, Patuxent Institution in Jessup, to receive treatment.\nManning acknowledged his daughter was the victim and said what occurred was an accident. He disagreed with Endzel's claims that he has shown no remorse.\n\"To ostracize me from society, I don't believe's appropriate,\" Manning said, noting that since 2019, he doesn't feel he's been a \"trouble or menace\" to society.\nCronan disagreed with that assessment.\nThe judge said Manning's behavior has escalated the last 15 years. The dismissed rape conviction is \"certainly something ... in this court's mind,\" Cronan said. He added that the sex offense conviction and a related burglary crime from 2016 as well as the pending assault case from two months ago played a role.\n\"That doesn't sound to me that you haven't been any trouble,\" Cronan told Manning. \"Quite the opposite.\"\nThe judge said the facts of the case were clear: Manning assaulted his daughter and \"manipulated the mother of your child\" to try to get her to lie in court for him.\nCronan said the daughter \"should have the comfort\" to be with her father without such a thing happening.\nIn addition to the 18 years, Manning is ordered to be on probation for five years after his release, make no contact with Hiester or the daughter and not visit their residences, schools, places of employment or daycares. He will register as a Tier III sex offender. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Over 150 people came out.Rally goers expressed fear, anger and concern that a pastor has been \"ripped\" from his congregation, three children and wife. Espinal, originally from Honduras, has been in Easton for 24 years.\nJim Bruce, a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum communications committee, attributed the crowd size on the corner of Route 50 and Dover Street to the incredible media attention Espinal's case has received. Bruce said he normally knows a majority of the people who attend these events, but he saw new faces Friday night.\n\"There are some I don't recognize at all. So, I mean, I think the press is what did this,\" Bruce said.\nReligious leaders and concerned citizens came out to show their support, including the Rev. Jessica Stehle of Easton Christ Church, who said she felt called to action to come support Espinal.\n\"It's hurting our hearts, and it's calling us to action,\" she said.\nICE said in a statement to The Star Democrat that Espinal overstayed a six-month visa by 24 years.\nEspinal has no other criminal record and has been attempting to obtain citizenship legally for years, according to his daughter Clarissa Fuentes Diaz.\nEspinal's arrest comes amid a push by the Trump administration to step up immigration enforcement. President Donald Trump has repeatedly stated he is out to get \"the worst of the worst,\" promising a mass deportation that targeted criminals.\nMany in attendance Friday pointed to Espinal's lack of criminal record.\n\"President Trump told the American public 'we're going to go for the worst of the worst,' and clearly they're not doing that,\" Bruce said.\n\"He needs impact, so he's picking people who've been here a long time, who are well known in the community,\" he said.\nU.S. Customs and Immigration data from June 29 shows a recent shift from focusing mainly on those with criminal records to arresting those without a record. Out of 57,861 people detained by ICE, 41,495 had no criminal convictions.\nMembers of the Trump administration have said since the data's release that their priority remains deporting those who have committed crimes.\nThose at the protest Friday raised signs that read \"MELT ICE stop the kidnappings,\" \"'WORST OF THE WORST?' Rev. Daniel = BEST of the BEST,\" and \"YALL KNOW JESUS WAS BROWN RIGHT?\"\nSydney Bradner Jacobs, chair of the Dorchester County Democratic Central Committee, said she and the rest of the committee canceled happy hour to be there.\n\"We decided to come out here and support and stand in solidarity with our friends in Talbot because it's not a happy hour when one of our own is deported without due process,\" Bradner said.\nEspinal was initially taken to Salisbury, transferred to Baltimore and is now in an ICE detention center in Louisiana where he is waiting for his first hearing where his family hopes he will be released on bond.\nA GoFundMe to support the pastor's mounting legal fees was created on Thursday and has already far surpassed its initial goal of $15,000. The new goal is set for $40,000 and the fund currently stands at $26,033 as of 8:30 p.m..\nThese fees, in other circumstances, can often be provided by local nonprofits.\nThe Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center keeps an emergency fund for situations like Espinal's that is typically kept at $10,000. President of the Talbot County Democratic Forum Michele Dappert said the funds have been significantly depleted due to the drastic increase in ICE-related arrests.\n\"We need help,\" Dappert said. \"People should also donate to the MRC (multicultural resource center). If you have legal expertise, they could also use volunteers to serve as lawyers.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was pronounced dead at about 2:06 p.m., the town said.\nGreensboro Police Department requested dispatch to notify a forensic investigator and have them respond to the location.\nEMS then placed two sheets over the man, preventing him from being viewed by the public. The forensic investigator arrived on the scene at about 4:30 p.m., then they consulted the medical examiner's office in Baltimore that an autopsy would be needed.\nThe forensic investigator contacted Springbok to transport the body to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore. The estimated time of arrival was initially an hour and a half, but due to a 16-mile Bay Bridge back-up, the transport was delayed and didn't arrive until 7 p.m.\nEMS, the forensic investigator and the Greensboro Police Department offered to moved the man out of the environment, back inside the residence or place him in a body bag. The family declined all options, the town said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Second fatal crash in three days prompts re-closure of Price Station Road crossover on U.S. 301\n\n July 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STAFF REPORT | Section: Local News \n \n 565\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHURCH HILL — Following two fatal crashes in three days, state transportation officials have ordered the closure of the MD 405 (Price Station Road) median crossover at U.S. Route 301 in Queen Anne's County.The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration announced Friday, July 25, that the crossover will be closed beginning Saturday, July 26. Emergency vehicle access will be maintained, and alternate crossovers are available at MD 19 (Roberts Station Road), two miles north, and Hayden Clark Road, 1.7 miles south.\n\"This is a safety-focused decision,\" said State Highway Administrator Will Pines. \"This closure is necessary to save lives and make the corridor safer for the tens of thousands of travelers and residents who use it every day.\"\nThe announcement follows two deadly collisions at the intersection this week, resulting in three fatalities.\nOn Thursday, July 24, a two-vehicle crash occurred around noon, leaving two people dead at the scene.\nJust two days earlier, another woman was killed when her vehicle was struck by a southbound car as she attempted to cross Route 301. The impact caused her car to overturn. The other vehicle's two occupants — a 22-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman — were flown to R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore in critical condition.\nThe State Highway Administration had previously closed the crossover in July 2024 due to a high number of crashes. Between January 2019 and December 2023, there were 76 reported crashes at the site — 62 of them in the southbound lanes, most attributed to driver inattention or failure to yield. Despite safety upgrades such as restriping, rumble strips, additional signage, and channelizing devices, collisions have continued at an alarming rate.\nTroopers from the Centreville Barrack of the Maryland State Police, Queen Anne's County Sheriff Gary Hofmann, and first responders from the Church Hill Volunteer Fire Company have all voiced strong support for the closure.\nThe Church Hill Volunteer Fire Company confirmed Friday that it had been notified of the closure and has coordinated with SHA to ensure continued emergency access to communities east of Route 301, including Price and Bridgetown Estates.\n\"As we did in July of 2024, the department leadership reached out to SHA to ensure emergency access would be available to Fire, EMS, and Police units responding to emergency calls on the east side of Route 301,\" the fire company said in a statement. \"We have been assured by SHA leadership that they intend to use the same process as before and that emergency access will be available.\n\"While this will create a slight delay in response times, we appreciate the willingness of SHA to work with us to keep those delays as short as possible while long-term solutions for the crossover are worked. The leadership of the Church Hill Volunteer Fire Company is committed to providing the most timely and efficient emergency response possible and will continue to monitor the situation and be a partner with SHA for a permanent solution.\"\nSen. Steve Hershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) also voiced support for the re-closure, stating, \"Given the dangerous track record at this intersection — and now two fatal accidents in just three days — it is clear that further action is urgently needed. While I understand the temporary inconvenience to motorists, public safety must come first.\"\nThe Maryland State Police Crash Team is leading both crash investigations. Findings will be submitted to the Queen Anne's County State's Attorney's Office for review. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One day later, Tilghman was charged with one felony count and one misdemeanor count of possessing a shotgun after having been convicted of a crime.\nAccording to charging documents written by a sheriff's deputy, an argument between Tilghman and her daughter Shadaira Harris, 32, occurred on July 16 at their home in Easton.\nHarris told the deputy that she went into her bedroom to make a family phone call after a verbal argument. Harris said her mother kicked the door, hit her and \"tried to bite her knee,\" per court records.\nCourt records state that Harris then \"heard the sound of (Tilghman) racking a shotgun, and heard (Tilghman) state, 'I will pump a hot one in you.'\"\nHarris told the deputy \"she was in fear of her life,\" barricaded the door and called 911, documents state.\nMeanwhile, Tilghman told police that her daughter \"attacked her and put her hand around\" her neck, according to court records. Tilghman said she racked a shotgun to \"intimidate\" Harris, police wrote.\nThe shotgun wasn't loaded when police recovered it, court records indicate. Harris had \"visible signs of injury\" and Tilghman had scratches around her body, the deputy wrote.\nInvestigators from the Maryland State Police Gun Center found that Tilghman isn't permitted to possess a firearm due to a prior conviction on assault, battery and dangerous weapon charges in 1989, according to charging documents.\nHarris submitted a letter to the court on July 17, stating that she doesn't believe her mother poses a threat to her or anyone else. Harris said she's moved out of Tilghman's home.\nTilghman posted $10,000 bond on July 17, according to online court records. A preliminary hearing is set for Aug. 11. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The deputies were then dispatched to CalvertHealth Medical Center after it was learned the 32-year-old woman who had been reported missing had been located.\nViens was also at the hospital, investigators reported.\nIn charging papers filed by Deputy Ryan Gough, the woman claimed she had been held against her will by Viens, who was her boyfriend at the time.\nGough said Viens' accuser had bruises on her face, lacerations on her arms, neck, hands and legs, which were the result of an alleged assault by the defendant. That assault reportedly occurred while the two were riding in Viens' truck.\nGough stated in court documents that the woman told him Viens exhibited strange behavior during the ride and kept insisting the truck was being followed. She said at one point she tried to flee the truck, which led to Viens assaulting her.\nAnother sheriff's officer, Detective Thomas Buckler III, confirmed Viens was making strange remarks about being followed.\nA search of Viens yielded four packages of suspected Suboxone.\nThe July 21 indictment charges Viens with one count each of kidnapping, first-degree assault, second-degree assault, possession of contraband in a place of confinement and false imprisonment.\nViens initial circuit court appearance was Monday before Judge Andrew S. Rappaport.\nA pre-trial conference is scheduled for late August with a plea hearing scheduled for late September.\nProsecution of the case will be handled by Anthony R. Navalaney of the Calvert County State's Attorney's Office.\nViens is being represented by the public defenders office. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A. McGonigle wrote in the charging document, \"I have personally made dozens of arrests in reference to violent crimes and narcotics in this area. Additionally, this area has recently been inundated with violent crime, including a homicide and shooting.\"\nAlong those lines, shortly before midnight on July 18 — some eight days earlier — a 14-year-old boy was stabbed to death while he and \"five or six\" companions purportedly were attacking a one-armed man in his 30s on the street of Road C in Hollingsworth Manor, according to an EPD spokesman and Cecil Whig archives.\nThe spokesman, who also serves as an EPD detective, reported that the disabled man stabbed the teen in the neck with a knife amid the attack and that the teen and his companions of varying ages were armed with \"knives, sticks or clubs.\"\nIn addition, the spokesman commented, \"It looks like a pretty strong case of self-defense, which would make this a justifiable homicide,\" and then qualified that the case would be reviewed by the Cecil County State's Attorney's Office.\nAs of Tuesday, no arrests had been made in the homicide, nor in the alleged group assault that occurred moments before the fatal stabbing.\nOutlining the traffic stop that led to the confiscation of the Molotov cocktail early Saturday morning, McGonigle reported that Dickerson was Perkins' right-seat passenger and that Santana was her middle-seat passenger.\n\"I know Santana and Dickerson to be violent offenders through previous incidents with both of them. Additionally, dispatch advised the vehicle had been involved in the recent homicide,\" the officer wrote in court records, noting, \"As I spoke to both Dickerson and Santana, whom I have a rapport with; I noticed they were acting in an unusual manner. Typically, both Dickerson and Santana are very talkative and often joke with me. However, they were unusually quiet and could not maintain eye contact.\"\nThe officer dispatched a K9 Unit handler and his specially-trained scent dog from a different police agency to the traffic-stop scene and the canine made a \"positive alert\" during a sniff-scan of truck's exterior, court records show. The officer explained in court records that he summoned the K9 Unit \"due to the high crime area, the time of night and the observed behavior.\"\nDuring the probable-cause search of the truck, investigators seized a glass E&J liquor bottle that was filled approximately three-quarters with gasoline and was covered by a blue paper rag soaked in gas, after finding it on the vehicle's floorboard, court records allege.\nInvestigators also confiscated a Bic-style lighter, after finding it \"shoved inside the seat cushion, in close proximity to the glass bottle full of gasoline,\" according to the charging document.\nThe three suspects agreed to speak with the officer, police reported.\nPerkins told the officer that Dickerson and Santana had been with her at her Elkton residence on Mackall Street, before she drove to the Wawa near Hollingsworth Manor — where she filled the liquor bottle with gasoline that she planned to pour into the fuel tank of the dirt bike on Mackall Street, police said. But Perkins then told McGonigle that the dirt bike wasn't on Mackall Street, police added.\nCourt records allege that Dickerson and Santana told McGonigle that the dirt bike was located on Mallard Court, which is part of a neighborhood that is directly adjacent to Hollingsworth Manor. But according to the officer, \"All three subjects were traveling from the opposite direction from Mallard Court when stopped.\"\n\"When asked about about the incendiary device, Santana advised the rag was being used to stop the gasoline from spilling. However, the cap from the glass E&J bottle was located in the bed of the truck, conveniently located on the rear wheel well. Dickerson advised he filled the bottle with gasoline,\" according to the charging document.\nThe officer noticed that Santana was wearing a key chain designed to attach a Bic-style lighter and that the lighter was missing, police reported. McGonigle also noticed that the front of Santana's pants was \"soaked in a liquid,\" police said. Santana attributed the soaked front of his pants to rain, although, according to the officer, there hadn't been any precipitation since about 10:45 p.m. on Friday, about 90 minutes earlier, police added.\nInvestigators reported the Dickerson was in possession of a blue torch-style lighter and that no cigarettes or other \"smoke-able objects\" were located during the search.\nArrested at the traffic-stop scene, Dickerson, Perkins and Santana are each charged with possession of a destructive device, which is a felony that is punishable by up to 25 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted, court records show.\nAll three remained in the Cecil County Detention Center on no bond Tuesday, one day after their bail review hearings in front of Cecil County District Court Administrative Judge Clara E. Campbell, according to court records. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

In the meantime, SHA is evaluating additional safety measures for the US 301/MD 405 intersection.\nThe action follows two deadly collisions at the site last week, resulting in three fatalities.\nOn Thursday, July 24, a two-vehicle crash occurred around noon, leaving two people dead at the scene.\nJust two days earlier, on Tuesday morning, July 22, another woman was killed when her vehicle was struck by a southbound car as she attempted to cross Route 301. The impact caused her vehicle to overturn. The other vehicle's two occupants — a 22-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman — were flown to R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore in critical condition.\nThe State Highway Administration had previously closed the same crossover in 2024. That closure remained in effect for nearly two months and was lifted after SHA implemented sight distance improvements at the intersection, including reconfiguring the westbound MD 405 approach to slightly turn vehicles to the right and trimming roadside trees.\nBetween January 2019 and December 2023, there were 76 reported crashes at the crossover, 62 of which occurred in the southbound lanes. Most were attributed to driver inattention or failure to yield.\nAccording to Gischlar, SHA staff remain in direct communication with local emergency responders. The current median closure configuration was originally recommended by the Church Hill Volunteer Fire Department and has been effective in maintaining emergency access.\nSome residents have expressed concerns about redirecting traffic to the MD 19 crossover and the safety risks associated with increased turning movements or U-turns there. SHA acknowledged those challenges.\n\"There are challenges with at-grade crossings along a major highway, especially as we observe traffic volumes, speed and distracted driving behaviors continue to increase,\" Gischlar said. \"Crossings such as MD 19 and Hayden Clark Road are well-marked with flashers to alert drivers to potential cross traffic.\"\nAdditional long-term improvements are under evaluation.\n\"SHA is committed to improving safety for motorists along this corridor,\" Gischlar said. \"We are evaluating larger safety improvements; however, our immediate focus is addressing the safety concerns with near-term projects that improve safety conditions and assist motorists in making good driving decisions.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Kenny Tull led a drill Thursday afternoon, showing me just how critical it is that first responders from different counties to work together cohesively under stress.\nAnd the results were enlightening: officers and EMTs didn't always make the correct decision every split-second, but they did confer with each other on what steps to take during the next drill, learning how to get better along the way.\nTo learn more about the training, read my story below.

Officers entered the school to take down a mock shooter. They joined with paramedics and EMTs to locate mock students in classrooms, assess their injuries and evacuate them from the building in a safe manner.\nResponders often communicated with one another on how to follow the proper incident command tactics, at times acknowledging the improvements they could make to their decisions during the drill. Caroline County Cpl. Kenny Tull said the drills will help improve all aspects of emergency response if a school shooting occurs on the Mid-Shore.\n\"It's a learning experience for everyone,\" Tull said.\nIn previous years, active shooter training took place at schools in Talbot and Caroline counties.\nRecently, the drills have included a team of both law enforcement and EMS personnel called the Rescue Task Force. Once a hallway or area is cleared, officers will protect unarmed EMTs and paramedics in \"warm zones,\" where danger may still exist even if the main threat is eliminated.\nThat practice is life-saving in a real situation, Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said.\n\"Before, (EMS personnel) didn't go in until the building got cleared, which caused more deaths,\" he said. \"The quicker we can get treatment for people, the quicker we can get paramedics in there with us, the more people that hopefully will survive.\"\nStill, the top priority is eliminating the shooter or main threat.\n\"The initial driving force is stop the killing, because the statistics will show you that an assailant can kill more people than you can treat,\" Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey said.\n\"Their driving force is stop the dying,\" Lowrey said of EMTs and paramedics. \"You toggle between those two driving forces.\"\nGamble said first responders have taken FEMA-required incident command training, which serves as a common baseline for members of different agencies.\n\"A lot of this stuff spawned out of 9/11, getting fire, police, paramedics everybody on the same page. Square up communications,\" Gamble said.\nHaving so many agencies on hand Thursday was an opportunity for first responders to acclimate with one another and become more comfortable working together during an emergency response, agency leaders said.\nCaroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker emphasized that local agencies already share a solid rapport.\n\"You'd be surprised how much there is interaction between counties and agencies,\" Baker said.\nPlus, the geography of Mid-Shore counties sometimes means Caroline County police may be first on the scene to a Talbot County emergency, or vice versa.\n\"For something that happens at Preston Elementary, Talbot County will be the first ones there,\" Talbot County Maj. Steve Elliott said. \"If something happens at Chapel Elementary, Caroline County will be the first ones there.\"\nTina Kintop, EMS division chief for the Talbot County Department of Emergency Services, said it's most important for EMTs and paramedics to be disciplined and properly trained to participate in the rescue task force with police.\nOn Thursday, the drills didn't stop when the mock shooter went down. First responders secured students, assessed the severity of their injuries and evacuated them from the building. The job doesn't end there, Kintop said.\nPolice and EMS focus on locating a site for reunification of families. Gamble said different schools already have plans in place for reunification spots, some of which have been used for fire drills or bomb threats in the past.\nBy practicing these processes Thursday, agencies worked to create a streamlined plan they hope they will never have to use.\n\"It's all about organization and accountability,\" Kintop said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ronald Odom, an EPD detective and spokesman.\nA driver and an unspecified number of passengers accompanied the boy to ChristianaCare's Union Hospital in Elkton in a private vehicle, after he had gone to a nearby house seeking help in the wake of suffering his stab wound, and they dropped him off at that medical center, Odom reported.\n\"When hospital security said they would have to call police, the people in that vehicle left. We had to investigate to find where the attack and stabbing occurred.\" Odom said, noting that a hospital representative informed EPD that physicians there were treating a stab-wound patient.\nThe teen was pronounced dead at that hospital, after emergency room doctors tried to revive him, Odom reported.\n\"He suffered the stab wound during a group assault on a single person — a man in his early 30s who is physically disabled. About five or six people of varying ages, including the teen, were in the group that was assaulting him,\" Odom outlined.\nThe man is missing his left arm from the elbow down, Odom confirmed Tuesday.\n\"A person who is not physically disabled would have had a hard time in that situation; this guy is physically disabled,\" Odom said.\nAmid the group attack, the disabled man pulled a knife and stabbed the teen in the neck.\n\"It looks like a pretty strong case of self-defense, which would make this a justifiable homicide. We also have reports that the people in that group had armed themselves with knives and sticks or clubs,\" Odom commented. \"We are still investigating to determine a motive for the group attack.\"\nThe overall investigation is continuing, according to Odom.\nOdom reported that investigators will consult with Cecil County State's Attorney James Dellmyer to determine what, if any, charges should be filed against the disabled man and also what, if any, charges should be filed against the people in the group that was attacking him\nNo arrests have been made. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Police identified them as suspects in the June 8 shooting of 23-year-old Alyson Elien of Seaford, Delaware.\nJust after 8:30 p.m. the night of the shooting, officers responded to the 900 block of Camelia Street in Cambridge. They found Elien lying outside of a vehicle in a driveway with a gunshot wound to his head. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.\nPer court records, police allege Kane and Johnson acted as two of the \"co-conspirators\" in a five-person operation to rob and kill Elien.\nCourt records identify 15-year-old Jakai Wilson as the alleged shooter. Police say Wilson, followed by four others, walked up to Elien's car, opened the driver side door and shot him, the victim falling out of his vehicle. The five people then fled, court records say.\nCharging documents for Kane allege he returned to Elien's body shortly after Elien was shot.\n\"After Elien was shot and lying on the driveway with life threatening injuries,\" Kane allegedly took \"something off Elien\" and ran away, per court records.\nLater, a crowd formed near the scene, and two other subjects — not any of the five main suspects — allegedly stole a bag from Elien's vehicle, police wrote.\nCharging documents show police identified Kane and Johnson through video footage. Johnson was also identified during witness interviews, court records state.\nKane faces 12 total counts, including first- and second-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault, robbery, firearm use and more. He's being held without bond. A preliminary hearing is set for Aug. 25.\nJohnson, meanwhile, faces 13 counts, including first- and second-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault, robbery, firearm use and more. He's being held without bond. A preliminary hearing is set for Aug. 28.\nWilson was arrested June 10, two days after the murder. He was charged with first- and second-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault, and other firearm and armed robbery counts. Wilson is being charged as an adult and held without bond; however, court dates for Wilson are not publicly available since he is a minor.\n18-year-old Nisiah Fletcher, of Cambridge, was arrested on July 6. Fletcher faces similar murder, firearm and robbery charges to Wilson. Fletcher is being held without bond. A preliminary hearing is set for Aug. 5.\nPolice have not announced an arrest of the fifth suspect in connection to the shooting. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Built in a hurry, it is made up of cages for imprisoning humans and tarps for walls that freely allow mosquitos in and, not to mention, the elements of summer in Florida. People who have been imprisoned there have reported maggots in the food, a lack of clean water, denial of medical care, legal access and other basic human needs. The ACLU declared this \"state-sponsored cruelty\" and filed suit. Thank goodness for the ACLU.\nThe setup is plainly sadistic. And Donald Trump apparently approved when he visited. This denigration is OK with him, but is it OK with you? Is that what we are now? Is this America?\nMy mother served as a WAC in World War II. She often told us how relieved enemy soldiers were to be captured by the U.S. military — as opposed to being captured by Russian soldiers who would just kill them. Americans were big-hearted, kind, compassionate. I was so proud when she spoke of this.\nWhy is this abuse of fellow humans still standing? If we don't protest, are we complicit? We might not be guilty of overt cruelty, but we are guilty of casual cruelty where we carelessly, with little empathy, maybe with a bit of superiority, blame the victim and shrug the thought aside. It's a problem someone else can fix. Do you say to yourself, didn't those illegals put themselves in this mess after all? It's on you. Right?\nJust type \"cruelty Trump\" into your search engine. Maybe the article title from the National Catholic Reporter will come up. It reads, \"Silence in the face of Trump's cruelty is complicity.\" The headlines should be enough to make you weep. I hope so.\nMARION O. ARNOLD\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Sheriff warns of rising scams targeting local businesses, residents\n\n August 6, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Headlines \n \n 510\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE — The Queen Anne's County Chamber of Commerce welcomed Sheriff Gary Hofmann on July 30 as part of its ongoing seminar series, where he provided an in-depth look at the latest scams affecting businesses and individuals — and the steps they can take to protect themselves.Speaking at the Kent Island Library, Hofmann emphasized the importance of awareness and vigilance in a county he described as \"very trusting and generous,\" where numerous worthwhile charities and nonprofits operate.\n\"Benefactors should always verify the legitimacy of an organization before donating,\" he said.\nHofmann outlined how small businesses, which often lack training and robust IT resources, are frequently targeted. Scammers may use stolen credit cards to place large orders, leaving businesses unaware until it is too late. To reduce risk, Hofmann recommended printing invoices and verifying identification when fulfilling pickup orders.\nHe also warned of phishing emails and fake invoices that can appear legitimate but include malicious links or fraudulent payment requests.\n\"If you find something out of the ordinary or that looks suspicious, take a breath,\" Hofmann said. \"Scammers often use fear or urgency tactics — like threatening to cut off power — to compel quick action. It's important to slow down.\"\nOne common scam involves demands for payment via prepaid gift cards. In other cases, scammers impersonate tech support, offering to fix nonexisting issues in exchange for access to personal data.\nHofmann said data harvesting can occur almost anywhere. Fake job postings often request personal information or payment for background checks. \"Check washing\" is also on the rise — criminals steal checks from mailboxes and alter them to commit fraud. Hofmann advised residents to walk checks directly into the post office to minimize risk.\n\"Using secure payment methods and monitoring accounts regularly is key,\" he said. \"Set up alerts for check clearances and large withdrawals, and implement internal controls like requiring two signatures.\"\nWhen writing checks, Hofmann recommended pressing firmly into the paper to make alterations more difficult. He also urged residents to shred sensitive documents before disposal to avoid \"dumpster identity theft.\"\n\"We don't think about how much information we're putting out there when we throw things away,\" he said.\nWith the rise of contactless payments, Hofmann encouraged people to cover the front of their credit cards at checkout to prevent nearby cameras from capturing card numbers. He also warned about credit card skimmers — devices that mimic real readers and can steal information from magnetic strips using hidden cameras or overlays.\nOther scams include:\nOverpayment scams, where fraudsters send more than the owed amount and request a refund before the original check bounces.Malicious QR codes that direct users to phishing sites or install malware.Tax scammers impersonating government agencies.Ransomware attacks that encrypt a victim's data until payment is made.\nHofmann stressed that education and prevention are the best tools to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated criminals. Staff training, multi-factor authentication, and careful scrutiny of digital communications are essential.\n\"Taking the extra time to assess and validate links is imperative,\" he said. \"Multi-factor authentication might be inconvenient, but it can save you a lot of headaches down the line.\"\nHe also encouraged reporting suspicious activity. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Maryland State Police are investigating the report of abuse and neglect.\nBaker and Caroline County State's Attorney Sloane Franklin met with the secretary of Human Services about a year ago to address long CPS response times.\n\"We were promised a lot of changes, and unfortunately, those changes have not come to fruition,\" Baker said.\nThe Caroline County Department of Social Services, which oversees CPS, did not respond to requests for comment.\nBen Shnider, director of communications for the state Department of Human Services, which oversees the Caroline County department, wrote in an email to the Star Democrat, \"The safety and well-being of Maryland's children is our highest priority, and local departments of social services respond to every report of alleged child abuse or neglect.\"\nAccording to Department of Human Services policy, the Caroline County Child Protective Services response times fall within the guidelines for responding to reports for the examples that Baker cited.\nThe policy calls for:\nAnswering calls of physical or sexual abuse within 24 hours.Answering calls for reports of neglect within five calendar days.Answering calls for cases of substance-exposed newborns within 48 hours.\nBut Baker and Franklin said this policy leaves law enforcement to act as a middle man, but addressing the problem is complicated.\nThe Caroline County Department of Social Services is a state-run agency over which the county has no control, making it difficult for local agencies and officials to affect change, Franklin said.\n\"I have no power to enforce changes, I can only make recommendations,\" Franklin said.\nBaker and Franklin said there have been unfulfilled promises of solutions since the problems began during the pandemic but were vague as to what those problems and promises were, saying they wanted to preserve their working relationships with CPS.\nBoth said they want a better working relationship with Child Protective Services. State law mandates law enforcement agencies working with CPS.\nAfter-hours reports of child neglect or abuse can be handled in a few different ways. In cases involving high or even moderate risks, a Child Protective Services case worker should be automatically dispatched, but if they cannot respond, law enforcement, generally the sheriff's office, will be sent.\nBecause of the mandated joint investigations, Baker said law enforcement officers have been picking up the slack when the case workers do not arrive, leading to increased frustration by the officers on the scene.\nPart of the problem may be vacancies in the state Department of Human Services, where there is a 7% vacancy rate, although Baker said he thinks the root cause stems from procedural and cultural issues that start with upper management.\n\"I would say that everything starts from upper management and works its way down as far as a cultural issue,\" he said. \"And I think that there are some procedural issues within the agency itself.\"\nBaker spent a majority of his career working in child abuse investigations and said they are near and dear to his heart.\n\"I know how hard that is, so it's very disheartening to me when we do not have good partners,\" Baker said.\nShnider, the Department of Human Services communications director, said his agency \"is committed to holding ourselves accountable.\" His email statement said the department will address any systemic issues that are identified through the investigation.\n\"Any failure to respond to a report of abuse or neglect in a timely manner is unacceptable,\" Shnider said. \"When mistakes are made, we hold ourselves accountable and take action to ensure we do better moving forward.\"\nIn the meantime, Baker and Franklin hope the investigation will bring systemic change that will enhance their partnerships and the safety of the children in Caroline County.\n\"I hope that some accountability and changes will come to better protect the kids,\" Franklin said.\nThis report has been updated to clarify that MSP and DHS are conducting separate investigations. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The immigrant community was largely missing.\"A lot of our community right now is feeling scared, not wanting to come here,\" said Peters, executive director of the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center. \"If you were here last year and the year before, our community looked different.\"\nSpeaking to families at Moton Park in Easton, Peters asked them to keep the local immigrant community in their minds. His appeal comes amid a ramp-up in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity on the Eastern Shore, which has spurred similar calls to action by local governments in Easton and Cambridge.\nFeelings of fear and uncertainty have been vocalized early this week by many Eastern Shore residents on social media, who have shared hundreds of posts containing photos, videos and reports of unconfirmed ICE arrests.\n\"ICE was here today and made some arrests. I mean, it seems like they're here more often than ever,\" Easton Councilmember the Rev. Elmer Davis said at last week's Town Council meeting.\n\"It's deeply troubling that such actions have caused young immigrants to fear attending school, worried that their parents might be taken away,\" Davis said. \"No one should live in fear in Easton or in this country, and every person deserves safety and opportunity and a chance to live without the shadow of oppression.\"\nAs local officials speak out on residents' concerns, it's still unclear just how many arrests immigration agents are making day-to-day. ICE's Baltimore field office did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.\nNationwide, immigration arrests have surged since President Donald Trump took office in January. Trump campaigned on stepping up immigration enforcement, promising a mass deportation that targeted criminals.\n\"Across the country, arrests of criminal illegal immigrants have soared as President Donald Trump makes good on his promise to rid our communities of these threats to public safety,\" the White House said in a press release on July 22.\nAccording to the press release, ICE arrests in Maryland have jumped 290% since Trump took office. U.S. Customs and Immigration data from June 29 shows a recent shift from focusing mainly on those with criminal records to arresting those without a record. Out of 57,861 people detained by ICE, 41,495 had no criminal convictions.\nMembers of the Trump administration maintain that targeting criminals remains the administration's priority.\nINCREASED ICE ACTIVITY\nCambridge Mayor Lajan Cephas and Cambridge Police Department Chief Justin Todd each issued statements indicating increased ICE activity in city limits.\nCephas said in a statement the city was made aware of last week's activity \"after the fact.\" In an interview, she added that she's contacted Gov. Wes Moore (D), Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.). Cephas said they have been in communication and are collecting information on whether constitutional rights may have been violated in interactions with ICE.\n\"You don't have to be a U.S. citizen to have constitutional rights,\" Cephas said. \"It's for everybody that has stepped foot anywhere in the U.S. territories.\"\nTodd said in an interview last Wednesday that Cambridge police have received phone calls and video footage from residents of the unconfirmed ICE activity. The department wasn't previously aware of the activity, he said.\nEaston police have indicated they're aware of ICE activity. But Deputy Chief Greg Wright said the department hasn't been involved in arrests and cannot provide specific details.\nCephas urged residents not to engage with immigration agents. In a statement, she asked residents to send her photos or videos of \"perceived inappropriate actions\" by immigration agents, details she plans to forward to Congress members.\nElected officials in Easton shared similar thoughts at Monday's meeting. Town Council President Don Abbatiello encouraged residents to reach out to Harris, Alsobrooks and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.).\nFEARS\nFears from the immigrant and Hispanic communities in Easton have gained national attention since the arrest of Honduras-born Daniel Fuentes Espinal, a longtime pastor of Iglesia del Nazareno Jesús Te Ama, on July 21.\nICE confirmed Espinal, who came to Easton in 2001, was arrested for overstaying a six-month visa. He is being detained in Louisiana, his daughter Clarissa Fuentes Diaz said. A hearing for Espinal had not been scheduled as of Tuesday, she said.\nProtesters calling for Espinal's return have gathered in Easton the last two Fridays, many of them appealing to Harris, whose congressional district includes the Eastern Shore, to take action.\nHarris maintained on Wednesday that his office is in the process of determining what power U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem holds \"in stopping deportations.\"\n\"Once we figure out exactly what the secretary can do, (Espinal's) will be one of a number of cases where we will ask the secretary to exert the discretion we think she has,\" Harris said after an unrelated press conference in Tilghman Island. \"But we're going to determine that first before she makes her ask.\"\nAt recent protests, residents have expressed fear and anger that the pastor was taken from the community. Now, those sentiments are spreading among residents across the Eastern Shore.\nAt the National Night Out in Easton on Tuesday, Peters said it's key to continue supporting immigrant communities, especially at events including local officials like police and first responders.\n\"A lot of people are scared right now,\" he said. \"And I think at events like this, we got to keep these going to show the solidarity we have with our entire community.\"\nReporter Lily Tierney contributed to this story. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He drove the short distance to the burning house and banged on the door to alert the woman inside to the fire.\nAfter assisting her and one of her dogs out of the house, Mercado ran into the burning home in search of the woman's other dog.\n\"I thought, go to the worst part of the house first, because that's where the dog might be,\" he said. \"So I went upstairs. It was pitch black. I couldn't see in the room, there was so much smoke. I had my shirt over my face.\"\nHe could hear the dog barking and finally located it.\n\"I saw the dog downstairs when I was looking around, and I threw a blanket over him, and I wrapped him up, and I took him outside,\" he said.\nMercado went back into the house to look for the resident's car keys in an attempt to move the vehicle so it wasn't damaged by the fire, but he was unsuccessful in finding them.\n\"We are grateful for his courage and selfless act during this situation — and the positive outcome for both the resident and Mr. Mercado,\" said Lawrence Tan, spokesman for Aetna Hose, Hook and Ladder Company.\nMercado left the scene without seeking recognition, and the fire department only learned of his actions after being notified by another neighbor, Tan said.\nMercado said he was just in the right place at the right time.\n\"Thankfully, I was there to see,\" he said. \"No one else saw it. It was just wild. It's perfect timing for me.\"\nMercado said he has young kids and would hope someone else would do the same thing to help them.\n\"It's how people should be,\" he said.\nWhile Tan praised Mercado's actions, he made sure to note that the fire department does not encourage witnesses to enter burning buildings.\n\"Entering a burning structure places an individual into an environment that is immediately dangerous to life and health,\" he said. \"It only takes seconds for someone to become overwhelmed by smoke or heat and lose consciousness — making the situation worse. Persons entering a burning structure without the appropriate training and protective equipment can actually further endanger someone who is trapped, since firefighters would need additional resources and time to find and rescue both the original victim and a well-intentioned bystander that was overcome by smoke, heat and poisonous gases.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Community Fire Company of Perryville served as the on-scene command unit, fire officials added.\nApproximately 30 firefighters battled the blaze for about 45 minutes before bringing it under control, fire officials reported.\nThe fire caused an estimated $250,00 in structural damage to the two-story house, according to an MOSFM spokesperson, who further reported that relatives are assisting the family that has been displaced.\nNo one was injured, the spokesperson said. The home was equipped with smoke detectors; however, the blaze \"originated on an unprotected exterior area,\" the spokesperson added.\nDuring their on-scene investigation, MOSFM detectives determined that the fire started on an exterior porch, according to fire officials. But as late Friday morning, the cause of the blaze remained under investigation, fire officials added. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

On several levels, from economic to public safety to morally and ethically, the Trump Administration's aggressive deportation campaign does not serve us well.Over 8 million unauthorized US workers contributed $73 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2022 through the use of ITIN numbers, a voluntary process since they are not eligible for Social Security numbers. Additionally, these workers paid $33.9 billion in payroll deductions to Medicare, Social Security and unemployment insurance, programs for which they are not eligible to receive benefits. Tracking down unauthorized taxpaying residents for deportation discourages the voluntary payment of taxes and drives otherwise lawful persons underground.\nResidents fearful of deportation are less likely to cooperate with law enforcement if they become witnesses to or victims of crime. This allows criminals in our community to flourish as a segment of the population becomes vulnerable to extortion, abuse and human trafficking.\nFrom a moral and ethical standpoint, the U.S. has allowed over 10 million unauthorized immigrants to remain in this country for decades – working, raising families and otherwise contributing to the strength of our communities. For most of these residents there is no path to legal residency and citizenship.\nImmigration enforcement has shifted wildly from administration to administration because we lack consistent, rational and comprehensive immigration reform. Recent attempts at bipartisan immigration policy have been scuttled by extremists who see political benefit in the current dysfunctional system. To suddenly snatch long-standing residents off the street as they go about their daily lives, as has happened in this community and many others, is cruel and places us as U.S. citizens in moral jeopardy.\nEach of us has an obligation to speak out to our elected leaders and let them know how we feel about this policy.\nMARY M.

Cline, 23, pounded on a door of a residence in the unit block of Upland Court, which is part of the Buckhill Farms community in eastern Elkton, and repeatedly yelled threats to kill the occupant, police reported.\nCourt records indicate that the victim does not know Cline and, as of Tuesday, information regarding why Cline allegedly targeted that home and the person inside of that dwelling was unavailable. The charging document also alleges that Cline was attempting to break into the home.\nDuring a lull — before the suspect allegedly started pounding on the door again and screaming threats to kill — the resident inside of the dwelling called his \"longtime friend and neighbor\" and alerted him to the real-time situation, police reported.\nThe occupant then opened a second-floor window and looked outside to investigate, police said. At that point, he saw Cline, who allegedly said, \"Come out here; I want to kill you\" after noticing the occupant peeping out the window, police added.\nMoments later, the occupant grabbed a baseball bat for protection and went outside after he saw his neighbor walking toward his targeted home, court records show. The occupant heard his neighbor warn the suspect, \"Don't move — I have a gun,\" police reported.\nThe neighbor told investigators that he instructed his wife to call 911, after he grabbed his gun, and then headed toward the targeted home to confront the suspect, police said. As officers with the Elkton Police Department rushed to the scene, a dispatcher reported that the suspect was being \"detained by a neighbor of the victim at gunpoint,\" police added.\nCourt records indicate that, according to his account, the neighbor told the suspect, \"I have gun, lay down.\"\n\"He reported that Cline complied and even put his hands behind his back at one point. He reported that while they were waiting for the police to respond, Cline was saying all kinds of things that did not make sense. He reported that they tried to talk to him and calm him down. (The neighbor) reported that he held his gun behind his back, out of view of the suspect, to help him remain calm,\" according to the charging document, which indicates that no physical contact was made during the incident.\nOfficers arrested Cline after they arrived at the scene, police reported.\nCline is facing six criminal charges, including attempted home invasion, attempted fourth-degree burglary of a dwelling, trespassing and disturbing the peace, court records show.\nHe spent two nights in the Cecil County Detention Center on no bond, before gaining his pre-trial release Monday on an unsecured $5,000 bond after his bail review hearing in front of Cecil County District Court Judge Denise Winston, according to court records. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Small town on Eastern Shore grapples with increasing ICE presence\n\n August 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 960\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n MARYDEL — Positioned directly on the Maryland-Delaware state line, Marydel is a quiet town. But last Wednesday, its sidewalks and businesses were unusually empty.\"This morning felt like a ghost town,\" said Karen Bamaca, 18, of Marydel on Aug. 6.\nThat morning, social media posts containing photos, videos and reports of unconfirmed immigration arrests in the town were widely shared. Many of the town's residents said people didn't feel safe going to work or nearby gas stations, and some resorted to communicating exclusively through Facebook and texting.\nAround 50 people, including Bamaca, gathered on the Maryland side of the border that evening as the dust settled to protest against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They marched down Route 311, past local businesses and churches and through a mobile home park, eliciting cheers and claps from the neighborhood largely made up of Hispanic families.\nThe loud but peaceful display was a stark contrast from that morning's silence.\nProtesters, many of whom were young Hispanic residents, said they were motivated to speak out for those they say don't have a voice.\n\"We're just here for those who can't be,\" said Ashley Oliver, 24, of Greensboro.\nIn the days since, the impact of the immigration arrests hasn't evaporated. The town's Hispanic and immigrant communities are afraid, many say, and families and businesses are left to grapple with the effects of the Trump administration's goal to increase ICE arrests.\nNationwide, immigration arrests have surged since President Donald Trump took office in January. Trump campaigned on stepping up immigration enforcement, promising a mass deportation that targeted criminals.\n\"Across the country, arrests of criminal illegal immigrants have soared as President Donald Trump makes good on his promise to rid our communities of these threats to public safety,\" the White House said in a press release on July 22.\nAccording to the press release, ICE arrests in Maryland have jumped 290% since Trump took office. U.S. Customs and Immigration data from June 29 shows a recent shift from focusing mainly on those with criminal records to arresting those without a record. Out of 57,861 people detained by ICE, 41,495 had no criminal convictions.\nAn ICE spokesperson did not respond to questions from The Star Democrat on Tuesday regarding arrest numbers and whether immigration officials have increased enforcement in Caroline County, where Marydel is located.\nMarydel, Maryland, operates a small town government. The town is unincorporated on the Delaware side of the border. Census data from 2020 shows Marydel, Maryland's population as 176. Of that mark, 115, or 65%, were Hispanic or Latino.\nMany of the town's Hispanic residents or immigrants in the area have been hesitant to work, shop or walk the streets like they're used to doing, business owners and residents say.\n\"They're scared. They don't know what's gonna happen,\" said Alfonso Ortiz, owner of a corner store on the Delaware end of town.\nVISIBLE IMPACT\nA handful of businesses serve as the go-to stops in Marydel. On the Maryland side, there are two gas stations with grocery storefronts, a post office and a popular taco truck. In Delaware, there's a Family Dollar, Marydel Ag Supply and a few restaurants.\nIn the days after last Wednesday, Ortiz says business at his grocery store, Tienda Frontera Variety, drastically slowed.\n\"They were scared for a couple days, and they stopped coming,\" he said on Monday. It's rebounded a bit since, but foot traffic hasn't returned to normal, Ortiz said.\nFamilies are grappling with immigration arrests, too. Adrian, 17, who asked to share only his first name, said four of his family members — his dad, brother, uncle and cousin — were all detained last week.\n\"I woke up to my mom banging on my door\" at 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 6, Adrian said. His family is from Guatemala, and his uncle, dad and cousin had clean criminal records, he said.\nAdrian said his dad was on his way to work for a local roofing company before being arrested. Adrian and an uncle retrieved his father's truck, which had been left on the road, as well as several cars for other families.\n\"To take the dad, to take the mom, what happens to the children?\" asked Alex, 35, a neighbor of Adrian's who preferred to only share his first name. Since last week, many in the neighborhood haven't been going to work, he said.\nProtesters last Wednesday said they feel immigrants are crucial to Marydel's community and the entire Eastern Shore.\nIt's \"very important, no matter how small their job is,\" Oliver said.\n'SPEAKING FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T'\nMany of those protesters aimed to give voice to their family members who were scared to speak out. One sign read, \"My parents fought for my future now I will fight for theirs.\" Another person wrote on a poster, \"I'm speaking for those who can't.\"\nSelvin Cordova, 27, of Marydel, helped organize last week's protest. Seeing the fear that developed across the community that day, he was compelled to lead a show of support.\nMany who came to protest were young Hispanic residents like Cordova. He said a new wave of immigrant families is driving increased involvement and activism of the local youth.\n\"Definitely over the last year, our Hispanic community has grown so much more,\" Cordova said, noting that more Hispanic families are moving to the area.\nLast week's protest wasn't just for the families and businesses in Marydel impacted by surging arrests. It was for all of the small towns nestled within Caroline County's rural north corridor, protest leaders said.\nSmall towns on the north end of Caroline County are home to much of the county's Hispanic population. Per 2020 census data, Templeville and Henderson have Hispanic/Latino population rates at 70% and 65%, respectively.\n\"Viva la Henderson, viva la Marydel, viva la Templeville, viva la Greensboro,\" a protester shouted into a megaphone. The crowd cheered and some joined. The chant continued on.\n\"Viva la Guatemala, viva la Maryland, viva la Delaware.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot's advanced life support pioneers reflect on program's 40-year mark\n\n August 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 722\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS — Pioneers in Talbot County's advanced life support services gathered this week to reminisce on the 40-year anniversary of their revolutionary effort to improve emergency response on the Mid-Shore.Five Easton firefighters began volunteering to man a new advanced life support, or ALS, program on Aug. 13, 1985. They had just one vehicle from the fire department. They sacrificed time at home and kept up constant communication to ensure someone was ready to respond to a cardiac emergency at any given moment.\nThe \"first five,\" as they're often called, were Wayne Dyott, Kevin Knussman, Marc Stockley, Ray Taylor and the late Gary Jones.\nWednesday afternoon inside the Harrison's Harbour Lights restaurant in St. Michaels, the four men shared laughs and memories of the effort they spearheaded four decades ago to the day.\n\"It was quite a haul,\" Stockley recalled. \"And unfortunately, in the past five years, I've been able to use this (ALS) system several times. And seeing the changes. It's been interesting to see the advancements. The care level is always there.\"\nThey were joined by others integral to the early success and soon-to-come expansion of paramedic services in Talbot County: Margie Callahan, then-nurse coordinator at Easton Memorial Hospital, and Buddy Harrison IV, former County Council president and the first director of Talbot County Advanced Life Support.\nThey all took time to reflect on Jones' integral role in the effort.\nJones, former director of cardiovascular services at the Easton hospital, died in 2021. Dyott said Jones joined the fire company in the 1980s knowing the ALS program was about to kick off.\n\"Ultimately, he was a good bridge between hospital staff, them accepting us and bringing the whole program together,\" Stockley said.\n'SKEPTICISM AT FIRST'\nJones and others worked to show people the importance of pre-hospital cardiac care and why countywide ALS services were needed.\nA half-decade ago, response times for heart emergencies could sometimes be 20 to 30 minutes. First responders typically reported to the fire station, then traveled to the location of the emergency.\nTaylor said it was hard at first for fire companies to even accept EMTs back in the 1970s. The five men, certified as cardiac rescue technicians, aimed to change that.\n\"We kept hearing the same thing: 'you're not doctors, you don't need to play doctor on the ambulance,'\" Taylor said.\nFire department and hospital leaders eventually warmed up to the ALS program, Taylor said. It didn't come without questions from the community, Stockley noted.\n\"I think there was skepticism at first, but I think it came around eventually when they started seeing positive results,\" he said.\nOn Wednesday, Taylor recalled what may have been the first of those positive outcomes. In 1985, he and Dyott rode in the ALS vehicle to the scene of an overturned truck and a man lying down. Taylor successfully defibrillated the man, and that began to turn heads in the right direction.\n\"It's a good feeling,\" Taylor recalled.\nIMPACT FELT TODAY\nSince 1985, the modest five-person, volunteer venture in Easton has transformed to a countywide staple. The Talbot County Department of Emergency Services operates six ALS units and one \"chase vehicle\" for rapid response. Over 50 paramedics and EMTs staff the units, some full-time and others volunteers.\nThe hard work of the original five was done with the hope of having a comprehensive system like the one that exists today, Dyott said.\n\"That's what we started. That was our goal, our ambition,\" he said.\nTina Kintop, Talbot's EMS division chief, said the division's current success and bandwidth wouldn't be possible without those pioneers. Crews responded to around 6,800 calls last year, she noted.\n\"We are better prepared and educated more than ever in the life-saving business,\" Kintop wrote. \"Thank you to the visionaries 40 years ago and to those advancing ahead today.\"\nCallahan similarly credits the first five for persevering through the doubts and paramedic funding struggles in 1985 and the years after.\n\"They were a part of seeing this all come to fruition,\" she said.\nOver the last 40 years, it has always been about saving lives, said Talbot County's original ALS leaders. Knussman said all the vehicle swaps and early morning phone calls were well worth it.\n\"I think all of us would agree that the people on the street today are better trained, better educated, better equipped and better organized,\" Knussman said. \"That's something that all four of us, and Gary if he were here, that's something to be proud of.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Much that was familiar and consistent is now gone. I recall years ago being on an airplane going to give a speech in Alabama when I saw a woman wearing a Dilbert sweatshirt. Above Dilbert was written \"Change is Good!\" and below Dilbert was written \"You go first!\"While I thought at the time that what was written spoke to me, much of the change that is happening now is not perceived by many as being good, but it is happening anyway. Those who disagree with the change need to think about how they might make change to confront or address the current change that is happening daily if not in some cases hourly.\nYears ago, after I moved to Cambridge, I thought that one change that needed to be considered was how the county, Cambridge, and Hurlock address the challenges of crime in Dorchester County with separate police forces and the sheriff's office. There is, of course, the sheriff, who is elected and two cities with police forces that have police chiefs and staff who are hired by the cities. There are in Maryland and elsewhere in the country, countywide police forces that also work within the cities in those counties. There are also sheriffs in those counties who oversee the safety of the courthouse and the local jail as well as serve court process both civil and criminal.\nWhen I was on city council, I learned that Cambridge alone spent more for its police department than the county did for the sheriff's office. At the same time, the residents of Cambridge and Hurlock are paying county taxes, some of which paid for the sheriff and its staff that do not work full-time in the cities, although they do collaborate with the state and local police on some joint task forces.\nGiven our current times with less federal and state money coming to the counties and cities and the burden on city taxpayers who also pay county taxes, would it not be a good time for the County Council and the city councils of Cambridge and Hurlock to take a look at the cost of these departments, duplication of staff leadership positions and current areas of need to see if there might be a more efficient and less expensive way to protect all of the residents of Dorchester County than currently exists.\nIf that study were undertaken by the county manager who has expertise in this area and the city managers with a report back to elected leadership, some \"change\" that could be \"good\" could be accomplished. By finding a new and separate way to respond locally to the unexpected and significant changes that are coming to counties and cities because of how federal and state monies are being diverted, some new ways to address the needs of local communities might be found in this area and others.\nAt the very least is it not worth a conversation? \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Grassroots lobbying derails Maglev train plans\n\n August 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 772\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Until recently, Maglev trains were being considered for passenger service between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore and eventually between Washington, D.C., and New York City.Unlike traditional passenger trains with locomotives pulling steel wheeled cars on steel tracks, Maglev trains use a powerful combination of electromagnets and levitation.\nAs a result, Maglev trains can run at top speeds between 250 and 300 miles per hour. That is significantly faster than Amtrak's soon to be launched NextGen Acela, a high-speed passenger train between Washington, D.C., and Boston with top speeds of 160 miles per hour.\nAfter seeing and riding Maglev trains on a trade trip to Japan, Gov. Moore expressed great enthusiasm and strong support for Maglev passenger trains in Maryland.\nDespite Moore's enthusiasm and support, Maglev trains are not in Maryland's immediate future, and most likely never will be.\nRecently, U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the Federal Railroad Administration is canceling more than $26 million in federal grants to study a Maryland Maglev project.\nDuffy noted this project has seen nearly a decade of poor planning, significant public opposition, tremendous costs overruns and nothing to show for it. He noted the project would result in significant unresolvable impacts to federal agencies and federal property, including national security agencies and Fort Meade.\nSome will say this decision is comparable to previous Trump administration decisions that negatively impact Maryland such as keeping the FBI headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C., instead of moving it to Maryland and recent news reports about relocating a U. S. Department of Agriculture research center from Maryland.\nThat is simply not the case with the Maglev decision.\nThe Maryland Coalition for Responsible Transit (MCRT) has strongly opposed Maglev trains running through Maryland for many years.\nThe all-volunteer MCRT was formed in January 2020 by a group from Prince George's County and Anne Arundel County to evaluate transportation proposals from a broad array of perspectives, then communicate their findings and recommendations to government decision-makers and also educate the public.\nMCRT launched a grassroots lobbying effort with a concise message — stop the proposed Maglev service from being built and operating in Maryland.\nUltimately, their message was heard by and resonated with a wide range of current and previous Maryland Republican and Democratic local, state and national elected officials.\nGov. Hogan, a former and current resident of Anne Arundel County, originally supported the concept. After it generated widespread public opposition, he changed his stance to oppose it.\nMembers of the Prince George's County Council sent a letter to the Federal Railroad Administration urging rejection of the Maglev proposal.\nAngela Alsobrooks, now one of Maryland's U.S. senators, signed that letter when she was a member of that council.\nU.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen has said: \"Concerns about the project and its impact on Maryland communities were long running. While its potential was promising, the devil lay in the details, and those details were never fully fleshed out — including how the project would affect residents, our environment and nearby federal agencies.\"\nDespite his enthusiasm for the Maglev project, even Gov. Moore has accepted the Federal Railroad Administration decision. His spokesperson recently said in part, \"… this project had challenges that were insurmountable.\"\nFollowing the decision, Susan McCutchen, a board member at MCRT said the decision brought her a mixture of excitement and surprise.\nHer surprise was based in part on the MCRT prevailing despite an enormous amount of lobbying done on behalf of the company that planned to bring a Maglev project to Maryland.\nAccording to media reviews of the company's disclosure reports filed with the Maryland State Ethics Commission, they spent $575,000 on lobbying in 2023 and $603,000 in 2024.\nMcCutchen has said humbly, \"We worked very, very hard — and all volunteer — but it's for our communities, that's the bottom line.\"\nAffirming that the MCRT effort was the result of \"very, very, hard work, Maryland state Sen. Alonzo Washington and Maryland state Dels. Anne Healey, Ashanti Martinez and Nicole Williams issued a joint letter saying, \"The outcome did not happen by accident. It is the result of relentless and unified opposition from our community and elected leaders — a coalition of residents, advocates, faith leaders, council members and state legislators who stood together to protect our neighborhoods, homes and environmental legacy. We made it clear: Our communities are not for sale, and infrastructure should uplift communities — not divide them.\"\nMCRT's successful efforts are a case study of the awesome power and effectiveness of grassroots citizen lobbying.\nThose efforts confirm that in the legislative arena a group of committed, energized, and mobilized citizens can prevail even when they are engaged in a dealing with an opponent who spends in excess of a million dollars to secure a win for their cause. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Are we spending too much to arrest immigrants?\n\n August 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 462\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The tax and spending bill passed by Congress and signed by President Trump on July 4 allocated $45 billion over four years to snatch undocumented migrants and some legal immigrants off the street or from their jobs and to lock them up. This is far more money than any previous president spent on removing undocumented migrants. Those doing the snatching are the masked, unidentified ICE agents, or Trump's new \"secret police\" who will balloon in numbers.This \"secret police\" force, reporting to the Department of Homeland Security and, therefore, to the president is bigger than most countries' military force. It is reminiscent of the Brown Shirts under Benito Mussolini in Italy before and during World War II. A police force reporting to the president of a country is out of character for any democracy in modern times.\nThe new detention centers for the unfortunates snatched up, who seldom have committed a crime, are being deliberately built in the worst locations. We all saw photos of President Trump visiting \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" a tent camp (so far) built on an unused airfield in the middle of the Everglades in Florida. This part of the Everglades is populated by big snakes and alligators.\nAccording to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem, the camp will be paid for by FEMA and will cost $450 million per year to maintain. It can so far accommodate 5,000 people, but it can only withstand a Level 2 hurricane. More severe hurricanes occur in this part of Florida occasionally. The disregard for human life and the dehumanization of migrants who only came to the U.S. to build a better life for themselves and their families is extraordinary.\nMigrant advocates have raised concerns about the living conditions in tents, but President Trump likes these unsafe structures with poor ventilation, as tents can be erected quickly. (Even the Nazis provided wooden housing in their concentration camps.) Apparently, Homeland Security needs 100,000 beds quickly. They are looking into using old prisons such as Alcatraz in San Francisco. At least 10 migrants died while in ICE custody in the first half of 2025.\nThe Big Beautiful Bill also includes $46.5 billion for building the famous wall toward Mexico and $6 billion for border technology and surveillance, along with other border security and immigration measures.\nWhy are we agreeing to spend such a large amount of money on a nearly non-existing problem? Trump has closed the border, so few new migrants are coming into the U.S. According to most experts undocumented and documented immigrants are committing many fewer crimes than U.S. citizens. We also need these people to do jobs that most citizens do not want to do. Here in Maryland the jobs tend to be picking crab meat and harvesting farm products that would otherwise rot on the vine. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Young is charged with first-degree assault, home invasion, reckless endangerment and four firearm charges.\nAdkins faces two handgun charges, accessory after the fact to a felony, altering physical evidence and making a false statement to an officer.\nAround 1:40 p.m. on Aug. 12, police were dispatched to a first-floor room in the hotel. According to court documents, 58-year-old James Terrell Jr. told police he and Adkins were in the room when Young knocked at the door.\nA few minutes later, Young allegedly pointed a gun at his chest, Terrell told police. Terrell grabbed Adkins and left the room before \"Young grabbed Adkins and took her back\" into the room, per court records.\nA woman in a room on the second floor later told police that Adkins \"knocked on her door and handed her a handgun.\" Adkins allegedly told the woman, \"'Take this 'cause I don't want to get in trouble,'\" court records indicate.\nAn officer saw Adkins on the second floor and approached her. Adkins told officers \"there was no gun\" and soon after \"doubled down\" on that assertion, court records state.\nOfficers found a gun in the second-floor room, which was allegedly the same one hidden by Adkins and held by Young during the incident on the first floor.\nAdkins was released on $25,000 unsecured personal bond on Aug. 14. A preliminary hearing is set for Sept. 2.\nYoung posted $1,000 cash bond on Aug. 3.

    "content": "Easton pastor reunited with family after ICE detention\n\n August 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 881\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — When Daniel Fuentes Espinal walked out of an ICE detention center in Louisiana on Thursday, his oldest daughter shed tears before hugging him.In an interview with The Star Democrat Sunday afternoon, Clarissa Fuentes Diaz recounted the emotional reunion with her father. It came nearly a month after he was arrested by ICE agents in Easton while heading to work the morning of July 21.\nDiaz and her husband flew to New Orleans on Thursday morning after a judge ordered bond and Diaz posted it the day prior. They made a four-hour drive to the ICE detention center southwest of Winnfield, about 160 miles northwest of Baton Rouge.\nAround 4:30 p.m., Espinal and his oldest daughter embraced.\n\"When (the guard) told me he is getting released, I started obviously tearing up,\" she said. \"And then when we finally went in there, I was already crying. This is actually happening, after a month. I'm actually gonna hug my dad again.\"\nThey stopped at a restaurant that night for dinner, then flew back to Maryland, where Espinal was reunited with the rest of his family Friday night.\nDiaz said her sister and brother, Daniela and Daniel, are holding up well. Daniela will soon move into her dorm at the University of Maryland. Her \"worst fear\" was her dad not being there, Diaz said, a worry that's now gone.\nEspinal's case has garnered national attention in the weeks since his arrest, as have its impacts on the Easton community. Services at the Iglesia del Nazareno Jesús Te Ama, where Espinal has been pastor since 2015, were temporarily halted. Maryland representatives in Congress, Town Council members and protesters rallying weekly since his arrest called for Espinal's release.\nBorn in Honduras, the 54-year-old pastor has been in the country since 2001 and has no criminal record, his family has said. Following his arrest, ICE said he was arrested for overstaying his six-month visa.\n\"Fuentes entered the United States on a 6-month visa and never left in 24 years,\" ICE wrote in a statement last month. \"It is a federal crime to overstay the authorized period of time granted under a visitors visa.\"\nDiaz acknowledged that the family has tried to fix Espinal's status. She said it's been hard to find a \"pathway,\" but this year they had plans to apply for naturalization.\n\"Whoever says that it's easy, it's not,\" Diaz said. \"It really isn't.\"\nCONTINUING TO PREACH\nReturning from Louisiana, Espinal told his family it wasn't all doom-and-gloom. Conditions were \"not ideal,\" Diaz said, but her father had a bed, a private bathroom and received some medications.\nThe experience led to a medical discovery. His family knew Espinal was pre-diabetic; a nurse at the Winn Correctional Center officially diagnosed him with diabetes.\n\"He's like, 'I can't say anything bad about Louisiana,'\" Diaz said of what Espinal has conveyed. \"'They treated me with respect. They gave me what I needed.'\"\nEspinal told his family about his experience with the detention center's church.\nThe center's chaplain saw Espinal on the news and invited the pastor to preach and lead Bible studies, Diaz said. Sparsely attended services and studies grew enormously.\n\"He said that from 13 people that he preached on that first day, the last day that he was there, 85 people started attending,\" Diaz said. \"And he said not just Christians ... Muslims, Hindus, people from Ethiopia, just different ethnicities wanting to hear the gospel.\"\nThe chaplain told Espinal \"he's never seen anything like this\" in around 10 years at the facility, Diaz said.\n\"Being the light in someone else's darkness during your process is amazing to see, not because he's my dad and not because I'm his daughter,\" Diaz said on Sunday. \"But when God uses you as a vessel, that's when people come at you the most.\"\nWHAT'S NEXT\nEspinal appeared at his church on Sunday, though he's not back to leading services. Diaz said this week will include a medical visit given his new diabetes diagnosis.\nEspinal's case remains in Louisiana, although Diaz said the family and their attorney are asking to have it moved to Maryland. She said they are waiting to be notified of the next court hearing.\nMaryland politicians in Congress have taken mixed stances on Espinal's case, largely along party lines.\nIn a statement Monday, Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st) said he views Espinal's bond release as \"appropriate\" pending a court appearance. The congressman, though, said federal law on overstaying a visa \"is clear.\"\n\"Under that law Mr. Espinal is subject to deportation,\" Harris' statement read. \"As the process moves forward, I will continue to be in contact with (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi) Noem's office about whether an exception to deportation is possible in this case in the event the immigration judge rules against Mr. Espinal.\"\nOn Saturday, U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) called Espinal's return home \"an important victory\" and said \"there are many more like him\" in a post on X.\nDiaz says \"words are not enough\" to thank the community, politicians and family friends for their support over the last weeks. Espinal and his oldest daughter released a video statement on Sunday.\n\"I'm very happy to be home with my family and my community,\" Espinal said.\n\"I'm just happy, my heart is full. My dad is home,\" Diaz said. \"Just praying for whatever outcome, or whatever happens. Just keeping our faith. The faith that we had at the beginning won't break.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The statement reported that a full and independent investigation would be handled by the Wicomico County Sheriff's Office.\nIn an interview Tuesday, Capt. Rich Wiersberg of the Wicomico County Sheriff's Office, who handled the investigation, confirmed that K-9 Ender's death was heat-related due to being left in a car.\nThe investigation is now in the hands of Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard. Wiersberg said he finished his investigation and handed it over to Leonard on Aug. 11. The state's attorney's office will review the file and decide whether to refer it to another office or keep it.\n\"We are happy to help Dorchester County Sheriff's Office with the investigation and hope to reach a conclusion soon,\" Wiersberg said.\nThe Dorchester County sheriff declined to comment on the open investigation.\nThe dog's death has left the Throw Away Dog Project, a dog training company that donated Ender to the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office in 2022, with many questions.\n\"I actually found out from an outside source once Ender passed, which prompted me to call the sheriff's office,\" founder Carol Skaziak said. \"So no phone call from the handler at all, no phone call from the county or the sheriff's office.\"\nThe Throw Away Dog Project has placed 70 dogs nationwide, four of them on the Eastern Shore. The organization trains the K-9s, covers the cost of handler training and donates the animals to join the line of duty.\nThey provide specific instructions on what to do when a K-9 dies.\n\"As an organization, I said, we have a contract. You signed our contract. And I said, one of the stipulations in the contract is upon the death of the dog, the dog must go to a veterinarian and an autopsy must be done,\" Skaziak said.\nSkaziak said she was told by the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office that Ender's body was taken straight from the handler's house to be cremated.\n\"You cremated an officer's body without finding out what was wrong because he is an officer of the law,\" Skaziak said. \"No proper ceremony, no honoring this dog that served his county. Why wasn't this done? Why?\"\nSkaziak said Ender died while his handler was off-duty. She said she was told by the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office that there was a mechanical issue with the vehicle in which the dog was left.\n\"What I do know is the vehicle was equipped with a Hot-N-Pop system, which is a heat alarm,\" Skaziak said.\nThe Hot-N-Pop system is a K-9 heat alarm that is accompanied by an app that notifies the handler of real-time temperature status.\nAccording to Skaziak, if the handler does not respond to a warning or alert, a loud alarm will blare and the windows will automatically be lowered. Skaziak said she was told there was nothing wrong with the heat alarm in the handler's vehicle.\nThe death of K-9 Ender has prompted Skaziak to advocate for new legislation in his honor. The \"K-9 Ender Law\" she proposes is state legislation that would mandate working, tested heat alarm systems in all K-9 police vehicles with recorded tests and penalties for non-compliance.\n\"We're going to hopefully start it in Maryland where every K-9 police car is to have a working heat alarm system that is tested and those tests need to be recorded with their department,\" Skaziak said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge Police Department presents second quarter report\n\n August 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Events \n \n 439\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Capt. Shane Hinson of the Cambridge Police Department presented the department's 2025 second quarter report at the Aug. 11 Cambridge City Council meeting.The report presents a snapshot of police data from April to June of this year, which reveals that overall crime has decreased. But there are still concerns regarding homicides, robberies and juvenile violence, Hinson said.\nHinson said during the meeting that adopting the \"policing with a purpose\" procedure last year has been effective at catching crime quickly or preventing it before it happens.\nPolicing with a purpose uses \"analytics and statistics to determine which areas of the city need more attention,\" Hinson said. When officers go into these areas, they are encouraged to interact with the community and stay for a minimum of 15 minutes.\n\"We're able to look at those numbers and say, 'okay, we need an officer to be here at least 15 minutes every two hours,'\" said Cambridge Police Chief Justin Todd in an interview. \"It allows people to be seen, engaged, and I truly believe that that's what's helping.\"\nBecause of this procedure, the total cost of services has increased while the number of calls made to the department remained about the same, per the quarterly report.\nHomicides, assaults, larceny and motor vehicle theft all increased from the second quarter in 2024. The homicide rate rose 200%, with two homicides that both led to arrests. One of the homicides was committed by a juvenile.\nAssaults slightly increased by 2.1% with one more than last year, larceny offenses increased by 78.5% from 14 to 25 cases in the past year, and motor vehicle thefts increased from 12 to 15 over the same time period.\nHowever, the total number of offenses decreased by 5.5% from 109 in the second quarter of 2024 to 103 in the second quarter of 2025.\nCambridge continues to see stable statistics regarding juvenile delinquency, with 42 juvenile charges in the past three months, some of which are serious and violent crimes like homicide, second degree assault and motor vehicle theft, according to the report.\n\"These are unprecedented times in our community,\" said Council President Sputty Chephas on the state of juvenile violence in Cambridge.\nThe Cambridge teen court deals with minor offenses \"like if a kid is vaping at school,\" said Todd. The teen court program was launched in May, and Todd said it is showing early promises of curbing juvenile offenses.\n\"They have to go before their peers and be judged by a jury. And then they get found in sentence, whether it be guilty, not guilty, and they get a punishment handed down to them, such as community service hours, such things as that,\" Todd said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The intention is to allow inspectors onto property the town deems pose a public safety risk.\nThe now more permanent administrative search warrant ordinance is related to the emergency version issued earlier this year.\nThe ordinance's initial draft received considerable public outcry but no public comment was presented at the hearing.\n\"So that feels like a good sign,\" Council President Ashley Kaiser said.\nThe council has made significant progress in ordinance developments to make it more palatable but public education will be needed before initiating any type of robust enforcement, she said.\n\"I think it is a step in the right direction and puts us in line with a lot of towns around us,\" Kaiser said.\nIn other business, three applications have been received for the two chairs open in the council's upcoming October election.\nThe Ethics Board will review applications before considerations are brought to the Board of Supervisors of Elections.\nAlthough currently on the ballot for re-election, Council Member Jim Beauchamp noted he intended to withdraw if both other candidates move forward.\nBeauchamp has served off and on the council for 10 years, \"It's been a good 10 years,\" he said.\nThe Centreville Town Council will next meet Sept. 4 at 7 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The equipment, fully funded by the county, was purchased to reduce costs for local stations and increase safety for emergency responders.\nUntil now, fire companies had to pay for individual fit testing services, which added up in cost and required outside scheduling. With the new AeroFit system, once staff are trained, the tool can be used at any station, as well as other local emergency responders, to test firefighter masks, N95 respirators, gas masks and more.\nThis flexibility means the system will not only help volunteer fire departments but will strengthen readiness across all county emergency responders.\nProperly fitted masks are essential for protecting firefighters and other emergency personnel from hazardous smoke, chemicals and airborne particulates. With AeroFit's advanced technology, firefighters will know their equipment is performing as intended before entering dangerous environments.\n\"Providing our firefighters with the right tools is critical,\" stated Jimmy Eason, President of the Talbot County Volunteer Fire & Rescue Association \"With the county's support, this system ensures that every responder, whether volunteer, law enforcement, or emergency services staff, can be confident their protective equipment will keep them safe.\"\nThe purchase of the AeroFit system is part of Talbot County's ongoing investment in the safety of both residents and first responders. Each year, the county provides funding for the seven volunteer fire companies through its annual budget appropriation. Funding is distributed to each department by the Talbot County Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association.\n\"This is about taking care of the people who take care of us,\" said council President Chuck Callahan. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Kennedyville Volunteer Fire Company was the primary responding agency, with 40 firefighters bringing the fire under control in 20 minutes. Damages were estimated at $50,000.\nThe previous fire at the same property also occurred in the early morning hours, around 2 a.m. on Feb. 28. Twenty firefighters responded and contained that blaze before it spread further.\nAt the time, officials said the vacant building was in poor condition and the compromised first floor forced crews to use ground ladders to access the second floor and attic. Damages were estimated at $20,000. The origin of that fire was determined to be the rear of the residence. Several firefighters responding to that call received medical evaluation from the Kent and Queen Anne's Rescue Squad and Kent County EMS.\nLike then, as now, the property had no smoke alarms or sprinkler system, officials said.\nA description of the suspect was not made available by the Office of the State Fire Marshal. However, Deputy Chief Fire Marshal Caryn McMahon confirmed they believe the suspect to \"live within the local area.\" McMahon said they are actively investigating the incident with the assistance of the Kent County Sheriff's Office.\nAnyone with information is asked to contact the fire marshal's Upper Eastern Regional Office at 410-819-3500. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The third — later identified as Meadows — was not wearing a ski mask, and that helped EPD investigators identify him, court records show.\n\"While walking away from the (victim) and nearer to the camera, the unmasked male with long brown curly hair is clearly identifiable as Aiden Meadows,\" according to the charging document.\nThe lead investigator, EPD Detective J. Jollie, notes in his written statement of probable cause that he is familiar with Meadows because of his \"prior encounters and interactions\" with him during his law enforcement career, court records show.\nIn that court document, Jollie also reports that he is familiar with Diebold.\n\"I am familiar with Aiden and his associates because of prior investigations regarding the theft of firearms and the theft of vehicles. One of the associates Aiden is known to commit these types of crimes with in the past is Landon Diebold. Diebold has a thin build and tall frame, similar to that of the perpetrator in the video that retrieves, displays and points the firearm toward (the victim),\" court records allege.\nIn addition, according to the charging document, Diebold's distinctive tattoos, which could be seen on the security-camera footage, helped investigators identify him as a suspect — despite him wearing a ski mask.\n\"Diebold has tattoos on his hands. I then accessed Diebold's Instagram account . . . and reviewed his profile picture. Within this picture, Diebold's hand tattoos are visible and tattooed on his left hand is red lettering, directly next to a dark arch, which also is close in proximity to a dark round figure,\" Jollie explains in the written charging document.\nEPD officers and detectives worked throughout the better part of Friday to identify, locate and arrest Diebold and Meadows, according to police. During a court-approved search, investigators found and confiscated two guns, police reported.\nAs of Tuesday, investigators still were trying to identify the third suspect. Anyone with information that might help in this investigation is asked to email EPD Detective Jollie at jjollie@elktonpd.org. EPD officials posted a press release about the alleged attempted carjacking on the agency's Facebook page on Monday morning, along with mugshots of Diebold and Meadows.\nDiebold is facing 11 criminal charges, including first-degree assault, armed robbery, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence, handgun on person and attempted carjacking, according to Cecil County District Court records.\nMeadows is facing 10 criminal charges — all of them the same as those filed against Diebold, court records show. Meadows, however, is not charged with handgun on person — the additional charge that Diebold is facing, according to court records.\nBoth remained in the Cecil County Detention Center on no bond Tuesday, one day after their bail review hearings in front of Cecil County District Court Judge Clara E. Campbell, court records show. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Her first handler was Officer Keith Collison.\nWhen Collison left the department in June 2015, Officer Gordon Geesey became Keita's new handler. Geesey and Keita had a seven-year career of service together.\n\"Throughout her career, Keita proudly and enthusiastically served the residents of Ridgely and the surrounding communities,\" the town said in a press release. \"Keita assisted in numerous successful narcotics investigations, drug scans, and tracks for the Ridgely Police Department, The Greensboro Police Department, the Federalsburg Police Department, the Denton Police Department, the Caroline County Sheriff's Office, the Maryland State Police, the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office, the Queen Anne County Sheriff's Office, the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, and the Maryland Transportation Authority Police.\"\nKeita retired in the fall of 2022 and transitioned from working dog to house pet with Geesey's family.\nThe decision to euthanize Keita was made after she suffered a serious medical emergency at her home. Keita peacefully died in the arms of her partner, Geesey, at 9 a.m. on Aug. 12.\nAnyone wishing to honor the K-9's service is encouraged to make a memorial donation to the Caroline Veterinary Clinic, which is located at 9 Central Ave. in Ridgely. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge Police Chief proposes extending juvenile curfew\n\n August 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 500\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — At the Cambridge City Council meeting on Monday evening, Police Chief Justin Todd proposed extending the city's juvenile curfew, which first went into effect in 2023.The curfew was initially a five-month pilot program. The City Council extended the curfew for an additional year in September 2023 and again in 2024. On Monday, Todd introduced an ordinance that would extend the measure for a for another year.\nThe new ordinance maintains the same curfew for children under 16, with hours of 10 p.m. to 5 a.m Sunday through Thursday and 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. on Friday and Saturday. It also incorporates the new Cambridge Teen Court.\n\"I think it's a good way that we'll be able to work even closer with our juveniles and their parents for better outcomes down the road,\" Todd said.\nThe teen court program was established in May to identify and recognize early delinquent behavior and to work with first-time misdemeanor offenders and their guardians to develop a strategic plan to keep them out of the juvenile justice system.\nRather than facing a judge, juveniles appear before a court of their peers, where they are given a verdict of guilty or innocent.\nThe purpose of the curfew is not to hand out violations but to target children in the community who may need help and provide resources, Todd said. Curfew violations allow the authorities to connect with schools and social services to address underlying issues.\nThe implementation of the curfew has not significantly reduced crime, but Todd said it has helped identify children who may need additional support or resources.\n\"I can say that I've seen a better investment into the children alone. In other words, when we do have violations, we're able to incorporate that with Corporal Jones (school resource officer) out at the middle school to say, 'You know, is this child having issues at school as well?'\" Todd said.\nTodd said the new provisions added with the most recent curfew ordinance will help his department do more to connect children to resources.\nThis ordinance replaces the previously used \"local care teams,\" with the newly founded Cambridge Teen Court so the police department can continue as an agency with keeping track of the behavior of youth instead of requesting that other agencies work to help find solutions.\nThe second reading of the ordinance will occur at the Sept. 22 city council meeting. Public comment and council discussion will follow the second reading before the council can vote on the measure. If passed, the curfew will go into effect on Oct. 1 and will expire Sept. 30, 2026.\n\"A lot of what we saw when we put the curfew in effect was that a large population of the juveniles that were out on the streets were obeying their curfew,\" Todd said. \"It was only a small number that was not and that was an immediate indication to me that this alone is worth having into place because it's keeping our kids safe, it's putting them in the house when they need to be.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Nine other charges, including first- and second-degree attempted murder, first- and second-degree assault and firearms counts, will not be prosecuted by the state as part of the plea agreement.\nThe shooting occurred on Feb. 12 in the parking lot of the Save A Lot on Greensboro Road. Police did not identify any victims immediately following the incident.\nAfter Smith was arrested, police said he was identified as a suspect through surveillance footage.\nCaroline County State's Attorney Sloane Franklin said in an email Tuesday that the lack of a victim \"played a big role\" in the choice not to pursue the attempted murder and assault charges. Franklin wrote that otherwise, \"justice was served.\"\nSmith entered an Alford plea on the reckless endangerment charge, a plea that allows a person to maintain their innocence while acknowledging the state had enough evidence to obtain a conviction.\nJudge Brett Wilson sentenced Smith to a one-year prison term, with credit dating back to Feb. 24. Smith will be held in the Caroline County Detention Center, according to online court records. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Casula Creese, who is facing seven criminal charges, including first-degree assault, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence and illegal possession of a regulated firearm, court records show.\nFirst-degree assault is punishable by up to 25 years in prison and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence carries a maximum 20-year sentence, with a mandatory five-year penalty. Illegal possession of a regulated firearm is punishable by up to 15 years in prison and it, too, carries a mandatory five-year sentence.\nCreese remained in the Cecil County Detention Center on no bond Tuesday, one day after her bail review hearing in front of Cecil County District Court Judge Clara E. Campbell, court records show.\nThe investigation leading to Creese's arrest and the criminal charges against her started at approximately 6:30 p.m. on Saturday, Aug. 23, when Maryland State Police troopers rushed to a residence in the unit block of Cecil Avenue after receiving a dispatch regarding a domestic-related incident involving a firearm, police reported.\n\"The male caller stated that his wife had his gun and had threatened to shoot him,\" court records allege.\nPolice said Creese's 53-year-old husband was outside of the residence when troopers arrived. He told troopers that his wife still was inside the dwelling, on the second floor, and that she still had his firearm, police added.\nProviding information about the incident, the husband told investigators that he was using his phone inside the den when he heard a \"loud thunk\" that came from the staircase, prompting him to investigate, court records show. He then saw a bowie knife and his loaded Smith & Wesson Bodyguard .380 caliber semi-automatic handgun on the landing, near his wife's feet, court records allege.\nWhen he asked Creese why she had his gun, according to the account the suspect's husband gave investigators, she replied, \"Who the (expletive) are you talking to?\" court records allege.\nCreese then picked up the gun and started to walk back up the stairs, according to the charging document, which further alleges, \"Ammie had the gun in her hand and stated, 'I'll (expletive) shoot you with it',\" before continuing up the stairs.\nHer husband tried to find the gun, so he could remove the firearm from the home, but she had hidden it, police reported.\nShortly after arriving, troopers went upstairs, stood outside a closed second-floor door and gave \"callouts\" for Creese to exit that room, police said. After Creese obliged, a trooper conducted a pat-down search on her and no weapon was found, police added.\nMoments later, while searching the room that Creese had occupied, an MSP trooper found the handgun in a closet, on top of a clothing rack, police reported. \"The Smith&Wesson was loaded with one round in the chamber and five rounds in the magazine. The safety was on,\" according to the charging document.\nPolice arrested Creese at 7:05 p.m., about 35 minutes after arriving at the residence, court records show.\nDuring the follow-up investigation, a trooper contacted the Maryland Gun Center and learned that Creese is prohibited from owning or possession a firearm, court records allege. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

By the time they arrived, the fire was too advanced to hear any smoke detectors, McCarter said.\nThe call came in to dispatchers as a working porch fire, which quickly spread to the rest of the home. McCarter said the fire took about an hour to put out.\nMcCarter said the Red Cross is working with the residents who were displaced by the fire while the fire marshal's investigation is underway.\n\"Support your local volunteers,\" McCarter said. \"Smoke detectors save lives.\"\nOnce the fire was extinguished, the Rescue Fire Company purchased 20 pizzas from Carmela's Cucina.

But prosecutors opted not to pursue the rape charges he was facing.\nOn Aug. 19, Rodriguez was newly charged with seven misdemeanor counts and one felony count of causing/threatening a subject to engage in a visual representation or performance of sexual activity.\nDorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard confirmed the eight new counts stem from the same 2024 incidents with a woman that led to Rodriguez being charged with the now-dropped first- and second-degree rape counts, among other sex offense, assault and firearms crimes.\nAccording to court documents for the sextortion charges, Rodriguez is accused of demanding a then-18-year-old woman produce photos and videos sexual in nature on four separate occasions between March 16 and April 1, 2024.\nCambridge Police Department investigators obtained message logs between Rodriguez and the woman. Rodriguez threatened to have the woman \"physically assaulted by other parties for her failure to comply with his demands,\" police allege in court records.\nIn two instances, the woman did \"acquiesce to the demands,\" police wrote.\nInvestigators interviewed the woman and reviewed social media messages, which they said reveal \"her declining mental state and depression.\"\nThe threats \"inflicted emotional distress,\" court records state.\nRodriguez was released on his own recognizance on Aug. 19. A hearing in district court is scheduled for Sept. 29. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Grassroot and AstroTurf protests in America\n\n August 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 738\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Bill of Rights in the United States Constitution prohibits Congress from restricting the right of the people to assemble peacefully and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.This provision is a fundamental reason that, while America is not perfect, it is one of the few places in the world that explicitly provides for and embraces the concept that everyone has a right to challenge their government.\nProtests in America have been the norm since we were founded and secured independence from Britain, which was driven in large part to a failure by Britain's leadership to provide a path for the colonists to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\nNotable and successful protests that made a difference in American society are beyond counting.\nThey include protests for women's voting rights, for civil rights for Black Americans and against military actions like the war in Southeast Asia.\nHistorically, these protests are known as \"grassroots\" protests.\nA hallmark of grassroots protests are groups of volunteers who are energized and mobilized by a shared commitment to addressing a grievance of deep concern to them. Their goals are to educate the public and generate public support for ideas on how to address that grievance.\nA perfect example of grassroots protests done right were recent protests organized and executed by a group of Mid-Shore volunteers. Their peaceful protests helped secure the release of Pastor Daniel Fuentes Espinal from detention by U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nUnfortunately, America is experiencing fewer grassroots protests and more AstroTurf protests.\nAstroTurf protests do not include volunteers who are energized and mobilized by a shared deep commitment to and sincere concern about a grievance. They include paid protestors who are energized and mobilized solely by a shared commitment to receiving payment for services rendered.\nTheir goals are to help create an often-false perception that there is significant public support for addressing the grievance for which they are being paid, either directly or indirectly, and often by limited transparency on exactly where funds are coming from to pay them.\nTheir carefully orchestrated protests are especially appealing to some in the national media, who feature reports on AstroTurf protests to attract readers and viewers and also promote a perception there is widespread public support for addressing AstroTurf protesters grievances and their proposed solution on how to do so.\nA perfect example of AstroTurf protesting is now occurring in Washington, D.C., which not coincidentally, is the center of the political universe for almost all the national media.\nThese AstroTurf protests are focused on the Trump administration's decision to deploy military troops to help address crime in Washington, D.C.\nThis decision is very contentious in large part because of conflicting and unresolved questions on the accuracy of past and current reports on the actual levels of serious crimes there.\nIn any event, these protests confirm the growing use and problems of AstroTurf protests.\nAdam Swart is president of Crowds on Demand, a nationwide company that provides clients with hired actors to serve as paid protesters.\nHis business in Washington, D.C., is booming.\nIn a recent interview, Swart said, \"Right now, D.C. inquiries are up roughly 400% compared to the same period in 2024.\"\nSwart also said his company always sees a spike in requests during what he calls \"high-stakes political moments.\"\nMost revealing is Swart's candid acknowledgement that the \"vast majority\" of people at political or advocacy events in D.C. are in some way paid.\nThis affirms their actions are based more on what they are paid to say and do, rather than on an understanding of and commitment to addressing the protest's stated grievance.\nSuch motivations were certainly not what was envisioned by America's national leaders when they adopted the Bill of Rights as amendments to the U.S. Constitution in 1791.\nThese amendments have served America well. Until now.\nComparable to the years before and during the War Between the States, our society is deeply divided, politically and socially.\nAstroTurf protests do nothing to help heal our divisions. In fact, they make them worse.\nThat said, our constitution allows for carefully scripted AstroTurf paid protest performances, even if the protesters are making a mockery of true grassroots protest principles.\nAccordingly, the public, elected officials, and the national media must continuously exercise due diligence in evaluating the motivation and commitment of paid AstroTurf protesters performing in nothing more than political stunts.\nAt the same time, we must listen to and respect the grievances of legitimate volunteer grassroots protesters, even if we may disagree fully or partially with those grievances or how to address them. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

'National News' is a secondary fit due to the national scope, but the focus on crime and protest dynamics makes 'Public Safety' the strongest match."

    "content": "Ex-officers sue Ridgely, sheriff over disbanding force\n\n September 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Push \n \n 568\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n RIDGELY — Former Ridgely police officers have filed a lawsuit against the town and Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker, claiming the defendants \"orchestrated a coup\" to disband the now-defunct Ridgely Police Department.The lawsuit was filed Aug. 13 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland by seven former officers, including former Police Chief Jeff Eckrich, and a civilian employee. Named as defendants are Baker, Chief Deputy Rodney Helmer, current and former town officials and a former Ridgely officer, as well as the State of Maryland and the Town of Ridgely.\nThe lawsuit includes 13 counts, claiming the defendants violated due process and the 14th Amendment, committed civil conspiracy and committed defamation.\nOne count claims the Ridgely Town Commissioners at the time — John Hurley, John Buckle and Anthony Casey — wrongfully discharged the police officers. Hurley is an active commissioner; Casey resigned in June 2024 and Buckle lost a reelection bid in April.\nBaker declined to comment on the lawsuit when reached Tuesday evening, citing legal advice. Patrick Thomas, an attorney for the Town of Ridgely, wrote in an email that he can't \"comment on pending litigation involving\" clients.\nEckrich and former police department employees ask for the town to pay economic damages for lost wages and benefits, among other items. Plaintiffs are also seeking the court to demand the town reinstate its department and employees.\nIn March 2024, Ridgely commissioners suspended Eckrich and the entire department with pay pending an investigation by the state prosecutor. At the time, the town didn't indicate reasons for the investigation.\nAt a closed session meeting in April, the town laid off the dismissed officers and support staff, a move that took effect July 1, 2024.\nLater that July, the Maryland Office of the State Prosecutor released a report in which it investigated Eckrich for \"suspected\" perjury and misconduct in office. The report found \"no sufficient evidence\" of the alleged criminal activity, closing its investigation into Eckrich.\nOther officers were not investigated in that state prosecutor's report.\nIn September 2024, Ridgely commissioners stuck by their plans not to reinstate the police department despite heavy criticism from residents at town meetings.\nBy that time, the town had already sold police vehicles and equipment to nearby agencies, including the Caroline County Sheriff's Office. Those transactions were made in the days leading up to and following July 1, 2024, the effective date the officers were laid off.\nThe lawsuit alleges that the investigation by the Office of the State Prosecutor was based on allegations made by former Ridgely police officer James Joles, also named as a defendant. Joles, according to the lawsuit, blamed Eckrich for his threatened termination from the Ridgely force in January 2024 that led Joles to resign from the department.\nThe lawsuit claims Joles met with Baker, the sheriff, \"and the two devised a plan that would eliminate the RPD and allow Sheriff's Office to assume responsibility for law enforcement in the Town of Ridgely.\"\nThe town has been under contract with the Caroline County Sheriff's Office for police coverage since. Currently, three county officers are dedicated to Ridgely patrol.\nThis May, the town opted to continue its memorandum of understanding with the Sheriff's Office, agreeing to pay $493,000 for policing services, according to the town's fiscal year 2026 budget.\nThis story has been updated to clarify the plaintiffs and defendant listed in the lawsuit. As of Sept. 2, this story has been updated to correct John Buckle's title as a former Ridgely commissioner. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hayes, U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland, announced the indictment with Special Agent in Charge William J. DelBagno, Federal Bureau of Investigation Baltimore Field Office; Special Agent in Charge Charles Doerrer, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Col. Roland L. Butler, Maryland State Police; James A. Dellmyer, state's attorney for Cecil County; and Bryan DiGregory, state's attorney for Kent County.\nAccording to the 13-count indictment, Westcott produced sexually explicit images of a young child under the age of 5. Westcott also communicated and distributed child sexual abuse materials over various internet platforms including Snapchat, Discord, and Telegram while maintaining a collection of child sexual abuse material on his personal electronic devices.\nIf convicted, Westcott faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for each count of Sexual Exploitation of a Child, and a mandatory minimum sentence of five years and a maximum sentence of 20 years for each count of Distribution of Child Pornography. Additionally, Westcott is facing a maximum sentence of 20 years for each count of Possession of Child Pornography and a maximum 10-year sentence for the count of Possession of an Unregistered Silencer.\nAccording to the press release issued Sept. 4, by the U.S. Attorney's Office, actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge determines sentencing after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. An indictment is not a finding of guilt. An individual charged by indictment is presumed innocent until proven guilty at a later criminal proceeding.\nThis case is also part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse. Led by the United States Attorney's Offices and the Criminal Division's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who sexually exploit children, and to identify and rescue victims.\nU.S. Attorney Hayes commended the FBI, ATF, and MSP for their work in the investigation, and the Manistee County Sheriff's Office and FBI Detroit for their valuable assistance. Hayes also thanked Assistant U.S. Attorney Colleen E. McGuinn who is prosecuting the federal case.\nFor more information about the Maryland U.S. Attorney's Office, its priorities, and resources available to help the community, visit justice.gov/usao-md and justice.gov/usao-md/community-outreach.\nFor more information about Project Safe Childhood, go to www.justice.gov/psc.

An ambulance crew drove the child to Christiana Care Union Hospital in Elkton, according to police officials, who further reported that the child is expected to recover.\nOfficers arrested Hutchins at that Dill Court residence and charged her with neglect of a minor and reckless endangerment, police said. Hutchins has been released on a $3,000 unsecured bond, police added.\n\"The investigation is far from over and the child has been removed from his mother's care while this investigation continues,\" the spokesperson said, adding, \"We thank our partners with the Cecil County Department of Emergency Services, Child Protective Services and Christiana Care Union Hospital for their response and assistance in the rescue and treatment of this child.\nAnyone with information that might help in this ongoing investigation is asked to email EPD Det. J. Beamer at jbeamer@elktonpd.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The man was transported by Maryland State Police Aviation to Tidal Health Peninsula Regional Medical Center in Salisbury, where he later died.\nThe man, described in the release as a \"30-year-old Caucasian male from Cambridge,\" has not been publicly identified. The police officer who shot the man has also not been publicly identified.\nAccording to the release, shortly after 5 p.m. Thursday, officers responded to the Deep Harbor development around Seaway Lane and Riverview Wharf in reference to a report of a male subject chasing a female subject with a knife.\nWhen officers arrived, they encountered a male subject who was armed with a knife, police said. Cambridge Police Chief Justin Todd said three officers were on the scene.\n\"Officers on scene attempted to deescalate the situation and have the subject drop the knife,\" the release said. \"The subject refused and advanced on officers. Officers gave warnings for the subject to stop as they were attempting to retreat.\"\nPolice said the subject continued to engage and approach the officers, leading to one officer shooting the man.\n\"Officers immediately rendered life saving measures to the subject awaiting EMS arrival,\" the release said. \"After EMS arrived, the subject was transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Cambridge prior to being flown by Maryland State Police Aviation to Tidal Health Peninsula Regional Medical Center in Salisbury.\"\nAccording to Todd, this is Cambridge's first fatal police shooting in approximately 15 years.\nThe incident is being investigated by the Maryland attorney general's office's Independent Investigations Division, which investigates all officer-involved fatalities in the state. Todd said the officer who discharged their weapon has been placed on paid administrative leave until the investigation is complete.\nTodd said press releases and body-worn camera footage will be released to the public as part of the transparency process.\n\"I think the main thing I want to say is my condolences to the family of the subject that succumbed to his injuries. Unfortunately, it's a sad situation,\" Todd said. \"And speaking with some of the family, I just feel there needs to be thoughts and prayers kept for them as well.\"\nThis report may be updated. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The findings are now with the state's attorney's office, which will decide if further action is needed.\nThank you to the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office and Throw Away Dogs Project for their commitment to a thorough review. Ender wasn't just a working dog — he was a partner, protector and hero.\nHis loss reminds us that these animals deserve dignity, even in death.

    "content": "Woman charged for graffiti acts at Sts. Peter and Paul Elementary\n\n September 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 719\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A woman is being held at the Talbot County Detention Center after being accused of spray-painting graffiti around town, including at Sts. Peter and Paul Elementary School.Sian Radaskiewicz-King, 32, was arrested Friday by Easton police on charges of malicious destruction of property and use of a hate symbol. She was later charged with defacing religious property and disturbing school operations, among other counts.\nAccording to court documents, King allegedly spray-painted the transgender symbol on dumpsters, the sidewalk and a step outside the Catholic school off of Route 50. Other spray-painted symbols were found on a fence at the Hampton Inn next to the school, per court records.\nThe symbols were found elsewhere in town, including outside East End Liquors, The Market at Dover Station and other businesses. The transgender symbol, often used to encourage gender inclusivity, is a combination of the male and female signs.\nAt an unusually crowded bail hearing on Monday afternoon, Talbot County District Court Judge Karen Ketterman ordered King to be held without bond in the Detention Center. A trial is scheduled for Oct. 28.\nMany parents and school officials from Sts. Peter and Paul filled the courtroom. School Board Chair Peggy Wilson asked Ketterman to not approve King's release. Wilson cited the Aug. 27 shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, which killed two children and injured 18 people, as a reason why the school community is concerned for the safety of students.\n\"Our fear is not the symbol itself, but the possibility of a copycat situation,\" Wilson said.\nKing, according to public legal representation, is transgender. She previously attended Sts. Peter and Paul School.\nThe Minneapolis shooter, Robin Westman, was referred to as transgender by federal officials. Westman's gender identity wasn't clear, according to The Associated Press.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook said in a statement this weekend that the graffiti incidents are \"especially painful\" given the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting.\n\"It reminds us of the responsibility we all share to ensure our children's safety and well-being,\" Cook wrote. \"We condemn such acts of intimidation, they have no place in our community.\"\nIn a statement Sunday, the Delmarva Pride Center condemned the graffiti acts as a \"misuse\" of the international transgender symbol.\n\"We are deeply troubled that an LGBTQIA+ symbol was misused in a way that could be construed as hateful,\" the statement read. \"Symbols such as the Transgender Symbol exist to affirm identity, celebrate diversity, and foster belonging — not to spread fear or division.\n\"This incident occurs at a time when Transgender people continue to face targeted attacks in society. We call on our neighbors, allies, and community members to stand together, to reject hate in all its forms, and to embrace the values of acceptance, compassion, and love.\"\nOn Monday, Easton Police Deputy Chief Greg Wright said the agency will increase patrol this week at Sts. Peter and Paul School and other schools in town. He said police \"have no reason to believe that there was any attempt or desire to harm anyone.\"\nBOND DECISION\nBridgette Lane, an assistant at the Talbot County public defender's office, argued in court on Monday that King should be granted release based on the low severity of charges, an otherwise clean criminal record and the Detention Center's recommendation.\nLane said King has \"expressed remorse\" and understands \"she can't be acting out in these ways.\"\nKing, who is listed as having a Baltimore address, was recently staying in Easton with her mother, Lane said. If released, the expectation was for King to stay with her mother.\nTalbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said the graffiti incident is concerning due to the context of the Minneapolis shooting last month, as well as the fact that King's mother's house is close to the school.\n\"Here we have this clear warning sign,\" Coale said. \" ... We don't know if the defendant is capable of carrying out something worse. But the state doesn't want to find out.\"\nKetterman said both sides made good points, but she hammered home that there are \"no conditions of release\" that would ensure the safety of the community. The judge said she's concerned about the location of the graffiti and King's documented mental health diagnoses, which include bipolar disorder and PTSD.\n\"I don't think the court has another choice,\" Ketterman said after ruling no bond and ordering the defendant complete a mental health evaluation.\nInformation from The Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

For example, there are very few high rises in Kent County.That works both ways though.\nCity firefighters do not typically have to go into grain or corn silos for rescues. But Kent County firefighters may have to.\nAnd they have the equipment to do it. They are called grain rescue devices and because of a grant, Kennedyville Volunteer Fire Department now has one in addition to the devices already at fire departments in Millington and Rock Hall.\n\"Kent County, Maryland, is noted for a few things,\" retired firefighter Larry Slagle said, speaking for the Chestertown Volunteer Fire Company.\n\"Among those, is our agricultural interests. We have any number of farmers whose primary interest is growing and processing grain products,\" he said. \"And for efficiency, these farmers maintain grain bins, aka silos, on their farms.\"\nSlagle said that occasionally, especially during grain harvest season, personnel may have to enter the silo, perhaps to clear a blockage or discern what the problem may be.\n\"This is one of the most dangerous things they will ever do,\" he added.\nSlagle's post indicated that that the suction of the grain material as it's being unloaded at the bottom, is as dangerous as the riptide or undertow at the ocean.\n\"Across the United States and even the entire world, many farm workers have entered this environmen … and lost their lives.\"\nFire official experts concur with Slagle and Chestertown fire company, saying that about 55 grain bin entrapment events happen around the United States, many in Midwest states. Farmers and workers can get caught in equipment, submerged in grain or experience a medical event while working.\nThat is why the training with the equipment was instrumental for local firefighters.\nOn July 21, Slagle reported that fire companies from Chestertown, Galena, Betterton, Chestertown, Millington, Rock Hall and Marydel attended a regional training program, hosted by the Kennedyville Volunteer Fire Company with the topic: \"Grain bin emergencies and how to safely mitigate them.\"\nClasses were conducted by members of the National Education Center for Agricultural Safety.\nSlagle said, \"This training is especially invaluable to us, as sometimes emergency responders are sometimes the victims themselves.\"\nAfter a period of classroom discussion, the activity transitioned outside to the training trailer.\nThrough specialized engineering, a grain bin was fashioned, and the \"suction\" phenomenon duplicated, in a safe manner, he pointed out.\nFormer member of the Kennedyville firefighter, farmer and owner of Philips Trucking, Josh Philips said that the equipment is a series of 6-8 aluminum panels, interconnected tubes with an auger, a spiral tool used to drill.\nDuring the training, the tube was placed around the mock accident victim and the auger extracted the grain that was simulating suffocating them.\nFirst responders practiced methods like ropes; confined space operations; patient care and packaging.\n\"At any time during the exercise, should something with the training go sideways, instructors could terminate the process and drain away the grain product,\" Slagle pointed out.\nEverything was conducted safely and first responders left with a sense of confidence in the training, he added.\nKennedyville Assistant Chief Mark Dixon thanked Philips who had nominated Kennedyville for the grant to make the equipment possible.\nSlagle said, \"In the fire service, we have a mantra. 'It is not acceptable for anyone to be injured, or even die, because of training. It's the purpose of training to prevent that very serious, even tragic outcome … during a real emergency.'\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

No further information about Garcy was released Monday.\nCpl. Jacob Weber was identified as the officer who shot Garcy. Weber has been with the Cambridge Police Department for six years and is with the patrol division, according to the attorney general's office.\nWeber has been placed on paid administrative leave until the investigation is finished, according to Cambridge Police Chief Justin Todd.\nAccording to a release from the Cambridge Police Department, Weber shot Garcy multiple times after Garcy allegedly \"advanced on officers\" with the knife. The attorney general's office said last week that officers unsuccessfully deployed tasers twice before Garcy was shot.\nGarcy was transported by Maryland State Police Aviation to Tidal Health Peninsula Regional Medical Center in Salisbury, where he later died.\nAccording to Todd, this is Cambridge's first fatal police shooting in about 15 years.\nThe incident is being investigated by the Maryland attorney general's office's Independent Investigations Division, which investigates all officer-involved fatalities in the state. Todd said press releases and body-worn camera footage will be released to the public as part of the transparency process. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Phillips described the scene as a \"melee.\"\nPhillips said three sheriff's deputies were spat on and the school safety monitor was taken to the hospital. Two boys, ages 14 and 15, were arrested following the incident.\nThe 15-year-old boy, Jaheem Mortaz Brown, was released to his step-father's custody. Three days later, the Brown allegedly shot his step-father in the face. The extent of the step-father's injuries has not been disclosed.\nIn addition, Phillips said Cambridge police received a call this weekend that juveniles around 11 years old were shoplifting from the Wawa on Sunburst Highway.\n\"They're shoplifting because they know they (the juvenile system) can't do nothing with them,\" Phillips said.\nPhillips said the problem of juvenile crime will continue until the \"broken juvenile justice system\" is changed.\n\"The juvenile justice system in the state of Maryland is broken; it's not working,\" he said. \"We're not holding anybody accountable.\"\nThe former Secretary of the Department of Juvenile Services, Vincent Schiraldi received intense backlash from Mid-Shore sheriffs, including Phillips. The Maryland Sheriffs Association sent a letter to Gov. Wes Moore calling for Schiraldi's immediate resignation last year. Schiraldi stepped down from the position in June.\n\"Consistently in Maryland, juveniles have been charged with serious violent crimes,\" the letter states, \"only to be turned right back over to a parent or guardian, and back out on the streets to commit more crimes.\"\nAfter an in-person community meeting with the secretary around two years ago, Phillips said \"He had the audacity to tell us, 'The data that I'm receiving doesn't support your claim of increased juvenile crime,'\" Phillips recalled. \"And our reply to that was, 'Well, obviously the numbers are going to go down because you're not allowing us to charge (them) anymore.'\"\nIn 2022, the Maryland General Assembly passed a juvenile justice reform bill stressing rehabilitation rather than punishment in addressing juvenile behavioral issues, according to its proponents. The reform took effect in 2024.\nIn August, the Cambridge Police Department presented its quarterly report, which revealed that overall crime decreased, but there were concerns regarding homicides, robberies and juvenile violence.\nHomicides, assaults, larceny and motor vehicle theft all increased from the second quarter in 2024. The homicide rate rose 200%, with two homicides that both led to arrests. One of those homicides was committed by a juvenile.\nPhillips said this level of violent crime in Cambridge is not normal.\n\"I mean, it's not normal anywhere, but I think the biggest contributing factor we had last week is the failure of our juvenile system,\" he said.\nLast school year, students in Dorchester County saw 1,682 long- and short-term suspensions with 1,232 of those suspensions related to violence, according to Dorchester County Public Schools Superintendent Jymil Thompson.\nIn an attempt to curb suspensions, Dorchester County Public Schools launched a violence prevention initiative course for students, teachers, parents and staff to ensure there is community participation. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Police said they were made aware of the shooting by Brown's mother, who drove to the police department and reported that her son had shot her husband in the face.\nBrown was arrested the Tuesday before at Cambridge-South Dorchester High School for allegedly assaulting the school safety officer, but he was released the same day to the custody of his step-father according to Dorchester County Sheriff Jimmy Phillips.\n{p class=\"p1\"}\"He was one of the people involved in this melee at Cambridge-South Dorchester High School last week,\" Phillips said.\nAccording to the press release from the Cambridge Police Department, a witness, who was sitting in a vehicle on Skinners Court, alleges Brown struck her vehicle before his step-father exited the residence. Brown allegedly brandished a firearm and shot the step-father in the face before fleeing on foot to High Street.\nUpon arriving at the scene, officers found Brown exiting the family's residence, where he was arrested. They also found one spent shell casing, but police did not recover the weapon, the press release said.\nPolice said officers and detectives were flagged down near the Park Lane and Camper Street area, where a man was hunched over and bleeding from his mouth. The 34-year-old man was identified as Brown's step-father.\nHe suffered a gunshot wound to the right cheek, and Dorchester County EMS transported him to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Cambridge. He was then flown to Shock Trauma by Maryland State Police Aviation. The severity of his injuries has not been disclosed.\nDue to current Maryland Juvenile Reform Laws, Brown was not able to be questioned following the incident, police said. The reason for the crime and the whereabouts of the gun are still unknown, they said.\nBrown has been turned over to the Dorchester County Department of Corrections without bond and is being tried as an adult. He is facing nine charges: attempted murder in the first and second degree, assault in the first and second degree, reckless endangerment, handgun on person, loaded handgun on person, firearm use in a felony violent crime and the possession of a firearm for a minor. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She had been charged in May for placing swastika stickers on political signs and stickers with red lines through swastikas on town property during the lead-up to Easton's election.\nJudge Karen Ketterman handed out one-year and 60-day sentences for the two misdemeanors, respectively. Both of the jail terms are fully suspended, meaning Cristaudo won't serve time.\nThe state will not prosecute the remaining charges: 20 counts of using a hate symbol, one count of malicious destruction of property and one count of defacing property in a race/religion crime.\nThe six swastika stickers were all placed on signs of former Town Council President Frank Gunsallus, according to court documents. At the time, both Gunsallus and his opponent, current Town Council President Don Abbatiello, spoke out against sign vandalism.\nAs part of the plea, Cristaudo was placed under a two-year probation. She is ordered to pay $300 in restitution to the Town of Easton and $100 to the Friends of Frank Gunsallus.\nOther probation conditions include a no-contact order and 150 hours of community service. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The sprinkler system activated, limiting fire damage to the room where it started.\nAccording to the Office of the Maryland State Fire Marshal, the fire originated in a rear first-floor office. The preliminary cause was deemed accidental, the result of \"an unspecified electrical event of a power surge protector.\"\nThe fire marshal estimated about $30,000 in structure and content damages. No injuries were reported.\nA total of 36 firefighters responded, with Goodwill Volunteer Fire Company the primary agency in charge. The fire was brought under control in about 30 minutes, the fire marshal said.\nThe fire alarm company contacted 911, and the school custodian also discovered the fire after the alarm activation.\nWater collected in a back hallway, one special education classroom, an office and a conference room as the sprinkler system ran for about 20 minutes, Kibler said.\nThird-party contractors were brought in to evaluate and assist. Normal operations resumed Sept. 11, after the school was closed to students and non-essential personnel Wednesday to allow cleanup and assessment. Other Queen Anne's County Public Schools were not affected.\nQACPS expressed gratitude to first responders, the Queen Anne's County Fire Marshal's Office, the Maryland State Deputy Fire Marshal, and its custodial and maintenance staff for their work in returning the building to use.\nOn its Facebook page, QACPS wrote: \"We are thankful that there were no injuries, and our fire suppression system worked appropriately.\"\nQuestions should be directed to Principal Lou Sheppard, Kibler said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Perry is charged with first- and second-degree attempted rape, first- and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and false imprisonment.\nAccording to court records, the woman ran to a neighbor's house after the alleged sexual assault incident occurred and spoke to emergency dispatchers.\nThe victim told a detective from the Cambridge Police Department that she was speaking to Perry on a patio outside her house, then she went inside and said goodbye to Perry. He allegedly \"pushed her inside the house and threw her onto the bed, and then got on top of her,\" court records state.\nThe woman \"advised that (Perry) put his hands on her face\" and attempted to undress her, then he attempted to have sexual intercourse with her, the records allege.\nThe woman kicked Perry in an attempt to get him off of her, per court documents. At one point, court records state Perry \"locked the front door and dragged her.\"\nThe victim told police that \"she could not breathe\" during the assault. \"(She) advised that she was fighting for her life and she thought that (Perry) was trying to kill her,\" court records state.\nThe records indicate the victim unlocked the back door and ran to a neighbor's house. She told police that Perry \"chased after her\" but then \"stopped and ran away.\"\nPerry is being held at the Dorchester County Department of Corrections on no bond. On Sept. 2, the court ordered a Maryland Department of Health competency examination for Perry, according to online court records. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Both teens received two years of supervised probation, according to online court records.\nIf they successfully complete probation, the probation before judgment disposition means there will be no formal conviction.\nGreene also entered a plea, under the same disposition, for one count of resisting or interfering with arrest.\nThe vehicle break-ins and thefts occurred at the end of December 2024, in the La Trappe Heights community. In addition to Greene and Turner, a 16-year-old boy was charged at the time with the same offenses. He was referred to the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services, according to a news release from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office following the arrests.\nThe state won't prosecute other charges previously levied against Greene and Turner, including fourth-degree burglary, malicious destruction of property and obstructing and hindering.\nAccording to a Talbot County Sheriff's Office news release from after the arrests, Greene was accused of assaulting a deputy as he was detained. A second-degree assault charge initially levied against Greene will not be prosecuted. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Attorney takes on ICE on Eastern Shore\n\n September 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 933\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Criminal defense attorney Ivette Furneisen has made it her mission to stand between federal agents and some of her clients.From courtrooms to detention centers, she is fighting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on behalf of families across the Eastern Shore.\nHaving gone through the immigration process herself, she understands what it entails. Lately, she said, the road has gotten more difficult under the Trump administration.\n\"In general, I see that people are being picked up and detained for minor traffic offenses,\" she said.\nThis was not so during past administrations, she said. Under other administrations, felonies and misdemeanors such as assault, theft, neglect of a minor and sex crimes would lead to deportation since they are crimes of moral turpitude.\n\"Under Trump however,\" she said, \"people are being picked up for minor offenses and then targeted by ICE.\"\nThat's the distinction.\nIn a recent case, her client was charged with driving under the influence by local police for having open alcohol containers in the back seat. He was acquitted, she said, but it put a target on her client for ICE.\nFurneisen recalled that her client was leaving the hospital between Kent and Talbot counties after his wife's medical checkup when he was stopped by ICE. She said agents busted out the windows while his pregnant wife was in the car and detained him. Furneisen and his loved ones did not know where he was for three days.\nShe said that level of apprehension is heightened by more ICE presence, including in courtrooms.\nIn her first case of this happening recently, two undercover ICE agents approached her client in court, asked their name, then hauled them into a van.\n\"I am seeing a lot of failure to appear in court, especially for minor traffic violations, and that makes things worse for those facing charges,\" she said. \"I tell them they need to show up for court with a lawyer.\"\nIt could mean the difference between paying a fine and being detained by ICE.\n\"That's why I fight so hard for them,\" she said. \"If I can get them out of jail at the bail review, they will have a better chance to stay with their families. If they go to jail, their life in the U.S. is over.\"\nShe said these are not isolated incidents.\n\"I am swamped with work of this nature,\" she said, noting cases from Kent to Talbot and Queen Anne's counties.\nThe attorney has built her practice around these kinds of challenges.\nFurneisen has worked hard all of her life, immigrating from Spain, establishing herself as a prominent immigration attorney on the Eastern Shore. She is half of the law firm of Campbell and Furneisen, located on Cross Street in Chestertown.\nThe firm's expertise earned Furneisen the 2024 Women to Watch recognition, an honor sponsored by the Kent County News' parent company, Adams MultiMedia. She is one of the only Spanish-speaking attorneys on the Eastern Shore, dealing with criminal, traffic and immigration cases.\nFurneisen received her law degree from the University of Barcelona Law School. After becoming a United States citizen, she received her master's degree in U.S. law from George Mason Law School. She is admitted to practice in both state and federal courts in Maryland, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and the Executive Office for Immigration Review.\nThat background and the multiple courts where she is admitted have come in handy in the past year as a criminal attorney that handles some immigration cases.\nIn the past, anyone could request a bond hearing. Now, she said, the federal government wants to limit or eliminate bond eligibility for many immigrants detained by ICE, particularly those who entered the U.S. illegally.\n\"The problem is that this will lead to indefinite detention because there is a backlog in immigration court,\" she said. \"These people could be detained for years before they have their immigration hearing.\"\nFurneisen described one client who was told not to plead guilty to theft and he would receive probation before judgment ©, which is not considered a conviction under immigration law. Her client pleaded not guilty and paid full restitution.\nThe judge ordered the detention center to release her client, but the center did not comply. She filed a writ of habeas corpus to release him, but ICE picked him up and gave him an option: get deported or sign a voluntary departure.\nHe chose the latter and went back to an area where his brothers and cousins were tortured before being beheaded by a gang.\n\"That's why I fight so hard to keep them here, but sometimes everything goes against you and you lose those battles,\" she said.\nShe said some of her clients, the ones who are undocumented, pay taxes through special IRS rules.\n\"They work in the county, they pay taxes and they are contributing, but they are still getting deported,\" she said.\nHer view aligns with Maryland Attorney General Anthony G. Brown, who has said that immigration violations are a federal civil matter, not a state-level criminal offense.\nKent County Sheriff Dennis Hickman said his office's stance on ICE has not changed since March.\n\"In the past ICE has placed a detainer on illegal immigrants who were being held on local charges,\" Hickman wrote, \"but when the sentence was over they were required to come get them. That practice has not changed.\"\nFurneisen sees positive changes happening within the justice system as cases like Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was deported to El Salvador earlier this year before being brought back, gain national attention.\n\"Just because you're being charged with a crime doesn't mean you did it,\" she said. \"I love my job in helping those who don't have a voice and being an advocate for them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dorchester County K-9's death ruled accident: no criminal charges pending\n\n September 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 424\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The investigation into Dorchester County Sheriff's Office K-9 Ender's death has concluded and did not find anyone criminally responsible.After the sheriff's office announced Ender's death in June, an independent investigation was handled by the Wicomico County Sheriff's Office. When that investigation concluded last month, findings were turned over to Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard, who said that to avoid conflict of interest she sent the report to the Worcester County State's Attorney's Office so they could do an independent review.\nThe review concluded that Ender's death was a tragic accident caused by equipment failure and inadequate fleet maintenance, not criminal conduct by the handler.\nDorchester County Sheriff Jimmy Phillips said the handler has been devastated since the death of Ender and has only worked one day since. \"To say that he is devastated is an understatement,\" Phillips said.\nThe investigation found that the handler, who has not been identified, left Ender kenneled in his patrol vehicle with the engine running, windows closed and air conditioning on while the handler went inside his home and fell asleep. When he returned around 5 p.m., he found Ender dead. The outside temperature that day reached 100 degrees.\nCarol Skaziak, CEO and founder of the Throw Away Dogs Project, which donated Ender to Dorchester County, said she is \"very distraught with the findings.\"\nSkaziak said the report attributed Ender's death primarily to mechanical car failure and air conditioning issues while overlooking the handler's decision to leave the dog in the car to sleep for three hours.\nThe vehicle's Hot-n-Pop heat alarm system did not go off during the time Ender's handler was asleep. The Hot-N-Pop system is a K-9 heat alarm that is accompanied by an app that notifies the handler of real-time temperature status.\nThe investigation revealed that the Hot-N-Pop safety system worked properly when tested after the incident, the air conditioning had only been temporarily repaired weeks earlier and required a new condenser.\nSupervisors noted that the handler was visibly distraught when they arrived.\n\"They blamed it on a faulty car. So I get that, but what if none of it had happened? What if the handler didn't put the dog in the car off duty and then went to sleep? He'd still be alive. But no one brought that to light, and that was a huge mistake, a huge error. And now he's dead, and no one is going to be held accountable for it,\" Skaziak said.\nSkaziak said she plans to have a public memorial for Ender in Dorchester County in the near future to honor and celebrate his life and service. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Drivers need patience on roadways\n\n September 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 428\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As a senior driver of 70 years driving experience I have finally reached my frustration point in what I (correctly or incorrectly) perceive as unwarranted impatience, if not absolute rudeness and discourtesy, on the part of drivers in Talbot County.I am a competent, not perfect, operator of a motor vehicle, and I do not understand the needs of many other drivers, younger ones in particular, to honk their horns, pass on the right side, ride your bumper or even pass on a double line when I take a needed extra second or two to double check when I am making a turn, entering an intersection, leaving a stop light, or driving at what I consider a safe 40 mph on the narrow, winding and crowned blacktop roads here, many of which have no shoulders only ditches.\nYou drivers who are speeding and tailgating in our county — and you, in my experience are many —will get where you are going without putting me or yourselves in danger. An absolutely unneeded honking horn is startling and rather than achieving its likely objective of hurrying me along and making me drive in the manner in which you think I should be driving actually slows me down when I look once more to reassess the situation around me before I move away from that light or stop sign or turn against traffic.\nYou will be senior drivers someday yourself, and you will understand certain facts — namely your reaction time slows a touch, your hearing and vision, though adequate for the task, are not what they used to be and your trust in your own cognition in discerning what is happening around you is quite naturally slightly diminished.\nTalbot County and the town of Easton today present challenging driving conditions. The sheer volume of traffic, the narrow streets in town with double parking, and the plethora of large sized pickups and SUVs plying streets and roadways here that were not designed for these types of vehicles are factors, as well as the presence of some dangerous intersections lacking traffic controls — one of these is one I use daily, the intersection of the Parkway and Tristan Drive. I do not need an accident at my age, whether my fault or not. This is a major reason I (and many others of my age) need that extra moment of time to cope safely and competently with the driving situations already mentioned. And I can cope if I get just a minimum amount of cooperation from all of you others on the road.\nJOEL S.

The vehicle appears to have been stolen, according to police.Shortly before 6 p.m. Sunday (Sept. 14), deputies from the Calvert County Sheriff's Office were alerted to a stolen vehicle entering Calvert County.\nAccording to a sheriff's office release, the vehicle, a Kia Optima, had been reported stolen out of Prince George's County and was detected traveling on Route 260.\nDeputy Justin MacWilliams located the vehicle on Route 260 and investigators reported the driver \"accelerated at a high rate of speed, passing vehicles on the shoulder and operating recklessly.\"\nAttempts were made to stop the fleeing vehicle and a pursuit was initiated, with additional units responding to assist. The pursuit continued eastbound on Route 260 to westbound on Mt. Harmony Road.\nStop sticks were deployed in an effort to end the pursuit. However, the driver swerved the vehicle toward officers and continued fleeing.\nAccording to the sheriff's office, the pursuit ended when the vehicle failed to negotiate a turn on Mt. Harmony Road near Alyssa Way, left the roadway, struck a telephone pole, traveled through a yard and ultimately crashed into a residence a residence.\nThe vehicle was occupied by four individuals. Three occupants sustained injuries, while one fled on foot into a wooded area.\nDeputies, along with responders from Dunkirk, Huntingtown and North Beach volunteer fire departments, rendered medical aid at the scene and police established a perimeter.\nWith the assistance of agency personnel, K9 units, and drone resources, the fleeing suspect was located and detained.

    "content": "Easton, other Eastern Shore towns host vigils for Charlie Kirk\n\n September 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 657\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Communities on the Eastern Shore have been hosting vigils for political activist Charlie Kirk after last week's shooting, including in Easton, where Republican officials organized a gathering in front of the Talbot County Courthouse.Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble, council member Dave Stepp and state Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico), among other Republican officials, joined with around 200 people for a vigil late Sunday afternoon.\nGamble said the idea for the vigil came from a conversation he, Stepp and Mautz had on Sept. 11, the day after Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University.\nGamble and Stepp said Sunday's event drew people from \"all walks\" of life. Gamble said he saw people attend with \"all types of political backgrounds.\"\n\"Call for a time of prayer, a time of reflection, a time to try to come together as a community and lower the temperature,\" Gamble said of the vigil's purpose.\nKirk, founder of the youth conservative organization Turning Point USA and a close ally to President Donald Trump, spoke at the Utah college on Sept. 10. Police have since arrested suspect Tyler Robinson, 22, who is accused of fatally shooting Kirk from a rooftop.\nThe Kent County Republican Central Committee hosted a vigil earlier Sunday for Kirk in Chestertown. In Denton, the Caroline County Republican Central Committee is hosting a vigil on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. on the courthouse steps, according to the group's Facebook.\nStepp said the recent trend of political violence seen nationwide is \"unacceptable.\" Kirk's death came less than three months after Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, and her husband were assassinated in their home on June 14.\nIn a statement, Talbot County Democratic Central Committee Chair Phil Jackson said the killings of Kirk and Hortman and her husband \"are not only assaults on individuals but on the democratic principles we all share.\"\n\"This moment demands that we show it's possible to disagree fiercely without resorting to violence,\" Jackson wrote. \"When leaders exploit and weaponize a tragedy like this, they dishonor the victims, deepen the divide, and fail to solve the problem of political violence. At the same time, gun violence — in our schools, our neighborhoods and in our politics — is a scourge on our nation, that we must confront with honesty, courage and a shared commitment to do better.\"\nSunday's vigil included a lot of prayer, Stepp said. He said it was successful in bringing people together and that the large gathering was \"God's work.\"\n\"We are so thankful for the hundreds of Talbot County and other Maryland residents of all ages who, with very short notice, filled the courthouse lawn for the emotional and moving prayer vigil for Charlie Kirk and other victims of violent crime,\" wrote Shari Wilcoxon, chair of the Talbot County Republican Central Committee, in a statement.\nGamble said the discourse on social media since the shooting has been intense. He released a statement on the Sheriff's Office Facebook page the night of the shooting stating he was \"saddened and angry.\"\nIn an interview Monday, Gamble said he's a taken \"a lot of phone calls\" from residents in regard to social media harassment and threats made in recent days. Sunday's vigil had no disruptions, he said, but he's hoping the online chatter tones down.\n\"We need to lower the temperature. We need to talk more,\" Gamble said. \"We have a history here of hashing out our differences through public debate.\"\nIn Ridgely, an employee at The Benedictine School was seemingly fired after making a social media post about the shooting, though the school provided only some details. In a press release Monday morning, the school said the employee \"referenced the murder of Charlie Kirk in a repulsive manner.\"\n\"This matter has been addressed in accordance with the organization's policies and the employee is no longer associated with Benedictine,\" the release stated. \"No further information be provided.\"\nThis story has been updated to include a statement from the Talbot County Democratic Central Committee. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trial begins for Cambridge man accused of murder, kidnapping of woman\n\n September 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 615\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Witness testimony began Tuesday in the jury trial for a Cambridge man charged with murdering and kidnapping a woman last year.Kenneth Bradley, 43, is charged with first- and second-degree murder and kidnapping, among other counts, in connection to the disappearance and presumed death of Tiyavauna Britt on Feb. 7, 2024, at the Gerry Boyle Park at Great Marsh in Cambridge.\nOn Tuesday, prosecutors made their first appeal to the jury, asking for first-degree murder and kidnapping convictions. The defense is vying for not-guilty verdicts on those counts, contending that second-degree murder or manslaughter are more appropriate charges.\nBradley and Britt, a 31-year-old mother of three, had been dating, according to multiple accounts provided during trial Tuesday and prior court documents. They were allegedly together in the parking lot of the park on Feb. 7, 2024, before Britt disappeared.\nEaston police put out a missing persons report for Britt six days later. Family had found her car abandoned in an Easton parking lot.\nCambridge police, along with state homicide detectives, assumed the investigation from Easton authorities following the review of cell phone location data placing Britt at the park.\nBradley was initially arrested on kidnapping charges in February 2024. Review of camera footage at the park from Feb. 7 revealed \"sounds of loud thuds ... consistent with forceful strikes,\" police wrote in charging documents. Later that night, footage showed a man \"carrying and dragging\" a woman's body to a vehicle, police wrote.\nBradley was indicted and arrested on murder charges in March 2024. Britt's body was not found.\nDorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard, the lead prosecutor, and public defender Matt Connell, who is representing Bradley, provided opening statements Tuesday.\nLeonard told the jury the case is full of \"rage, control, domestic violence.\" Evidence shows Britt's relationship with Bradley was \"toxic,\" she said.\nLeonard said Bradley's former employer and a close friend will testify later this week. Bradley confided in them, she said, confessing to the murder and the disposing of Britt's body.\n\"She vanished,\" Leonard said. \"She was never seen or heard from again. No phone calls or text messages.\"\nLeonard said jurors will see video footage from the park. The audio is \"chilling,\" she said, showing Bradley drag Britt and throw her in the trunk of a car.\nBefore jurors took their seats to listen to openings, Connell objected to some of the audio evidence, arguing that Bradley could have a \"reasonable expectation\" for privacy during some of the conversations.\n\"We are fine acknowledging that that was him in the video,\" Connell said. \" ... 90% of the verbal communication occurred inside the vehicle.\"\nLeonard disagreed with the 90% assessment. Connell said, \"it's possible I'm mistaken.\"\nWhile the full video and accompanying audio wasn't admitted as evidence Tuesday, Judge William Jones sided with the prosecution. It's \"quite likely\" the court will allow its admission during trial, the judge said, especially if the conversations included yelling.\nIn Connell's opening statement, he acknowledged Bradley's involvement in Britt's death. But he said prosecutors must show Bradley intended to kill Britt in order for the jury to deliver a guilty verdict on first-degree murder.\n\"He lost it. He hit her too hard, and she died,\" Connell said, adding that Bradley tried to resuscitate Britt. \"He didn't mean to do it.\"\n\"Hold him responsible for what he's really guilty of, not above and beyond that,\" the defense attorney said.\nThirteen witnesses testified Tuesday, including close family of Britt and police detectives who worked the case.\nLinda Harris, Britt's mother, recalled Feb. 12, 2024 during an emotional testimony. It was her other daughter's birthday, and Britt didn't show up.\n\"She wouldn't miss anything,\" Harris said of birthday parties and holidays. The mother said she last saw Britt a week before she disappeared.\nTrial is scheduled to continue through Friday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Jury finds Cambridge man guilty of murder, kidnapping\n\n September 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: News \n \n 801\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — A jury on Friday declared Kenneth Bradley guilty of murdering and kidnapping 31-year-old Tiyavauna Britt last year in Cambridge.Bradley, 43, was found guilty on all counts, including first-degree murder, kidnapping, false imprisonment and assault, for beating Britt to death at a Cambridge park on Feb. 7, 2024.\nBradley burned and disposed of Britt's body in the days after, according to witness testimony and facts established during the trial. He was arrested by police over a week after the murder, following a missing persons report for Britt in Easton. Police tracked Britt's last known location to the Gerry Boyle Park at Great Marsh in Cambridge and identified Bradley as the suspect.\nBritt's remains have not been found.\nFriday's verdict came after three consecutive days of witness testimony and evidence. The 12-person jury deliberated for just under two hours before reaching a unanimous decision.\nDorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard, the lead prosecutor, relied on video footage from the park as well as key witness Adam Kinnamon, Bradley's friend who worked with police to obtain a confession and details about the disposing of Britt's body.\nOver an hour of the graphic video was shown during trial. The accompanying audio revealed loud thuds from inside a parked vehicle over the course of around 20 to 30 minutes, during which a female voice can be heard screaming intermittently.\nBradley, who was at the time in a relationship with the victim, yelled at one point, \"'B----, you about to die.'\"\nAfter the repeated thuds and yelling, video shows a man of Bradley's stature put a small female figure in the trunk of the car before driving away.\nOn Thursday, Kinnamon recounted the phone calls he had with Bradley in the days following the murder. Four of those calls were recorded by Maryland State Police Sgt. Scott Sears, the case's lead investigator. The calls occurred later that February as Bradley attempted to hide evidence and avoid arrest.\n\"He said he hit her twice and tried to bring her back but couldn't,\" Kinnamon said. Bradley became violent that night with Britt due to his accusation that she cheated, according to investigators and witnesses.\nIn an interview after the verdict was announced, Leonard said the video evidence was crucial, and added that Kinnamon's testimony \"pretty much sealed the deal.\"\nPublic defender Matt Connell, who represents Bradley, asked the jury to consider the lesser charges of second-degree murder or involuntary manslaughter. Connell said the defendant didn't mean to kill Britt.\n\"Mr. Bradley was in a zone, he couldn't pull out of it. He was in a rage,\" Connell said.\nThe attorney encouraged the jury to choose false imprisonment over the more serious kidnapping charge.\nConnell acknowledged Bradley's acts as \"horrific\" and \"awful,\" and he apologized to the jurors that they had to watch the video of the incident. But he said Bradley exhibited \"blind rage\" and could not control his behavior, contending the killing wasn't premeditated.\nLeonard disputed those points.\n\"Twenty minutes of beating is more than enough time to rethink your actions,\" she said during a closing statement to the jury.\nLeonard added that repeated texts and calls from Bradley to Britt throughout the day show the escalating nature of his anger at her. Leonard said Bradley had ample time to think about his actions, an argument the jury ultimately backed.\n\"Tiya can't speak for herself any longer, but the evidence sure does,\" Leonard said.\nBritt's family packed the courtroom on Friday. Close family members took the witness stand earlier in the week. Mother Linda Harris said Britt and her three children had a close relationship and that Britt was \"very active in their lives.\"\nAn aunt said Britt was always there to support everybody in the family. She checked on everyone \"even when she needed people checking on her,\" the aunt said.\nLeonard said the state will seek life without parole at Bradley's sentencing, which is not yet scheduled.\nShe commended Britt's family for maintaining composure during the jarring week-long trial. Leonard said she'd love to be able to provide the family with information about Britt's body or remains, but she indicated that it's unlikely to happen.\nSears, the lead investigator on Britt's murder, was the final witness to take the stand Thursday afternoon. He recalled extensive searches carried out by police for Britt's body, all of which came up empty.\nHe said he contacted the FBI to consider bringing the agency in to search local landfills, which had been mentioned by Bradley to Kinnamon during the recorded calls with police. But so many days after the potential disposal, digging up the landfills wasn't feasible, the sergeant said.\n\"The amount of time that had gone by, that would not be fruitful,\" Sears said on the stand, noting that police \"put every resource\" into the case.\nDuring cross-examination, Connell at one point asked Sears if had recovered a body or had any new leads.\n\"I do not,\" Sears said. \"I wish I did.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said the Moore administration believes everyone deserves safe shelter and called for collaboration across all levels of government. Day highlighted the Maryland Shelter and Transitional Facilities Grant Program, which funds improvements to emergency shelters and creation of transitional housing, and said the department will partner with The Shelter Alliance to bring resources to Kent County.\nGoodall brought the conversation local, noting Kent County ranks third in Maryland for adolescent homelessness. While single men comprise the largest group experiencing homelessness nationally and locally, she said, many single women, mothers with children and a growing number of older adults are also facing uncertain futures.\nGoodall outlined The Shelter Alliance's mission to provide a shelter operating 24 hours a day, year-round, paired with individualized, wraparound support. The organization has an eight-member working board, an executive director and a case manager, and coordinates with partner agencies and community organizations to streamline intake and tailor services to each guest's needs. She said the board plans to expand and invited attendees to apply.\nDuring a Q&A, attendees asked about Goodall's vision for a future facility. She said the ideal site would be an existing structure that can be safely adapted to meet diverse guest needs and is near public services, including substance use and mental health support, partner agencies and everyday amenities.

MICHAELS — During the St. Michaels Commissioners meeting on Wednesday, St. Michaels Police Chief Jeffrey Oswald said the police department will lose an 18-year veteran officer to another municipality. The officer, he said, is leaving for better pay.\"I'm coming up on my 24th year here, three as chief, and during this time, I've seen 43 officers come and go in our agency,\" Oswald said. \"Obviously, there are several factors that contribute to some of the turnover, but the prominent and consistent driver from the exit interviews has been paying upward mobility.\"\nStarting on Thursday, the St. Michaels Police Department will be operating with only four officers, excluding Oswald.\nOswald mentioned one of the reasons that officers leave besides salary is opportunities larger departments can provide.\n\"They have criminal investigation divisions, they have training divisions dedicated solely to ensure officers meet certifications, qualifications and criminal updates… and remember, each of these on their own is a full-time specially trained position,\" Oswald said. \"... Every St. Michaels Police Department (officer) must be able to perform every one of these rules at any given time, and therefore, after a few years, an officer builds a strong resume and they take it to another agency who's more than happy to pay them some extra money.\"\nOswald suggested potentially hiring a police recruiting firm and raising wages commensurate to officers' total years of service.\n\"We're a good place to have an opportunity to do a reset because there's only four of us remaining,\" Oswald said.\nAccording to Town Manager Don Richardson, the police department has four openings with two each at the corporal and sergeant level.\nWith potential salary raises, the cost would be north of $200,000 for the town to properly recruit and retain officers, Richardson said.\nCommissioner Alexis Roiter mentioned accommodation taxes, which are paid by tourists who stay at hotels or rental properties, as a potential revenue source for police department needs. Commissioner David Wojciechowski mentioned allocating funds from town events.\nThe commissioners agreed to draft legislation allowing for salary amendments so the St. Michaels Police Department can become competitive in hiring and retention. The measure would have to go through the town's typical legislative process, which would include public hearings, before it can be adopted.\n\"Thank you for supporting this important need for the town of St. Michaels and our community,\" Richardson said. \"It will ultimately require some level of budgeting amendment that will absolutely go through a public comment period and a legislative ordinance.\"\nThe town encourages anyone interested in joining the St. Michaels Police Department to contact the town for further instruction. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The victim was 65-year-old Robert Daywalt, according to court records.\nTyler Davis, 22, of Ridgely, is accused of physically assaulting Daywalt on or around the night of Sept. 28, according to police. Davis is Daywalt's great-nephew, court records indicate.\nDavis was taken into custody without incident and charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter, first- and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment, causing physical injury to a vulnerable adult and other abuse counts.\nPolice say Davis and Daywalt lived together. Davis was a state-certified care provider for his great uncle, per court records.\nIn a statement of probable cause, police said Davis admitted to them during an interview that he assaulted Daywalt overnight on Sept. 28 or Sept. 29. Davis told police he \"had consumed alcohol and did not recall the event\" that night, court records state.\nDavis said he made a comment he shouldn't have made to Daywalt, \"at which time (Daywalt) punched\" him, per court records. Davis told police he grabbed Daywalt's arms and then assaulted him.\n\"(Davis) advised during the assault, he was pushed into the dresser, at which time he 'blacked out' and the assault\" continued, police wrote.\nDavis is being held without bond at the Caroline County Detention Center. Online court records show he is set to appear for a preliminary hearing in Caroline County District Court on Oct. 28.\nThe Maryland State Police Crime Scene Unit and Caroline County State's Attorney's Office assisted the Sheriff's Office during this investigation.\nAnyone with information related to this incident is asked to contact the Caroline County Sheriff's Office at 410-479-2515.\nThis story has been updated to identify the victim and include information from court records. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The sentence was at the high end of Maryland's sentencing guidelines, according to the Queen Anne's County State's Attorney's Office.\nInvestigators launched a probe in February after receiving a report that a child had been physically assaulted at Kiddie Academy of Kent Island, where Jones had worked for about four years. Surveillance footage revealed Jones had assaulted three children, all under age 2, Deputy State's Attorney Christine Dulla Rickard said.\nDay care employee Mandy Pettis first reported concerns to police after witnessing Jones kick and yank a child in the infant room. A search warrant uncovered footage showing Jones pushing and forcefully seating the toddlers, though no injuries were reported, Rickard said.\nUnder Maryland law, assault includes intentionally frightening someone with a threat of immediate physical contact or making offensive physical contact through an intentional or reckless act that is not accidental, legally justified or consented to. Rickard described the conduct as \"assaultive, but not abusive\" and said it amounted to \"poor treatment of children.\"\nAssault can mean several things from tripping someone, punching someone, attempting to punch someone or hitting someone, Rickard said, explaining that the legal threshold differs from child abuse, which requires a higher standard of harm or injury.\nJones was arrested Feb. 21, one day after the initial report. She received three consecutive 10-year sentences with all but six months suspended on each count. Upon release, she will serve three years of supervised probation and complete 50 hours of community service. A condition of her probation prohibits Jones from engaging with children in a supervisory role.\nParents of all three victims were consulted before Jones entered her plea, Rickard said.\n\"Parents expect 100 percent care, not 98 percent,\" Rickard said. \"Jones crossed the line, and the court held her accountable.\"\nSeparately, day care owner Dana Barnhart was charged with failure to report child abuse or neglect after Jones' actions were brought to her attention. Her case was postponed indefinitely on Sept. 19. Under those terms, Barnhart will continue in administration but cannot be actively involved in caretaking or supervising children at the facility.\nSheriff Gary Hofmann said the case served as a warning that such behavior would not be tolerated.\n\"Parents place their trust in those who care for our most vulnerable, our children,\" Hofmann said in a statement. \"When that trust is broken, it sends a profound shock through the community.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A K-9 search discovered \"suspected heroin/fentanyl mix,\" crack cocaine and ecstasy, police wrote.\nDuring the stop, police said Black was on his phone. Investigators eventually determined that Black called Wilson during that time. Black had Wilson make a call to 911 and report a fake shooting at the Easton Walmart, police said.\nOfficers went to the Walmart but found no evidence of shots fired.\nAccording to online court records, Black and Wilson both posted $10,000 unsecured personal bond since their arrests, meaning they will only have to pay the full amount if they fail to appear for a court date or break other conditions imposed by the court.\nWilson has a trial scheduled for Nov. 5 in Talbot County District Court. She faces four total charges: obstructing and hindering, making a false statement to officers, and two counts of possession with the intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance.\nBlack's trial is scheduled for Nov. 3 in District Court. He faces the same four counts as Wilson.\nBlack, in a separate case in Talbot County Circuit Court, is also facing two felony, six misdemeanor and 11 traffic counts in connection to the same April 4 traffic stop. A jury trial for those charges is scheduled for Dec. 8.\nIn that case, he's charged with two felony counts of possession with the intent to distribute narcotics. Black posted $10,000 unsecured bond for those charges back in July. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

As site work begins and the station's main structure is erected, officials placed shovels in the dirt for a ceremonial groundbreaking.\nResidents in Cordova and across northern Talbot County will reap the benefits of the station once it's completed, said Brian LeCates, director of the Talbot County Department of Emergency Services.\n\"We always try to make sure that we are to our calls within eight minutes, at least 95% of the time,\" LeCates said. \"And this is an area that was underserved by that.\n\"The (Talbot County Council), they really took note of that. We gave them information. We gave them data.\"\nCouncil members fully funded the $2.1 million project, which will be the county's sixth paramedic station. It will include space for a 24/7 paramedic and EMT unit.\nCouncil President Chuck Callahan said the project comes at an important time as renovations are progressing at the elementary school across the street.\n\"It's kind of the perfect storm here when it comes to having safety, kids,\" Callahan said. \"It makes the whole community feel a little bit safer.\"\nJimmy Eason, president of the Talbot County Volunteer Fire and Rescue Association, said the station is welcomed \"with open arms.\"\n\"Unfortunately for us in Cordova, we're facing almost a 100% failure to respond rate,\" Eason said. \"But not to any fault of anybody's, it's just a sign of the times. So this station means so much more to this area than some people might believe.\"\nCallahan thanked the Gannon family for giving a piece of their farmland up for the project. Siblings Greg and Celeste Gannon attended Monday's groundbreaking.\nLeCates shouted out their mother, Sylvia Gannon, for her continued loyalty to Talbot County's EMS efforts. Gannon, a former County Council member, was a founding member of the Talbot Paramedic Foundation.\n\"Every step of the way, she always stepped up and tried to help us,\" LeCates said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After confirming the active warrant, deputies arrested Wolfe at his Stevensville residence. He was charged as a fugitive from justice and held pending extradition to Kentucky to face the charges.\n\"This case highlights the value of interagency cooperation,\" public information officer Kaitlyn Briselli said in a statement. \"By working closely with our partners in other jurisdictions, we were able to locate and apprehend a fugitive whose actions threatened the safety of our community and, most importantly, our children.\"\nIn an unrelated case, the sheriff's office said Jamie Lee Overton Jr., 23, of Essex, was arrested on Sept. 24 in Baltimore and held without bond following an investigation into a report received Aug. 30. A county resident alleged an unknown adult male contacted their child, younger than 12, for sexual purposes, according to the sheriff's office.\nAfter reviewing evidence, investigators obtained a warrant Sept. 19 charging Overton with sexual solicitation of a minor, two counts of child pornography and two counts of obscene telephone misuse, the sheriff's office said.\nBecause the investigation is ongoing, the sheriff's office said it could not release specifics on how the child was contacted.

Wilmer asked to use the woman's bathroom, and upon seeing a backpack of another person inside her house, carried out the assault, court records allege.\nThe victim told police that Wilmer \"knocked her down in the living room\" and \"dragged her by the hair\" into the bathroom, according to court documents. Per the victim's account, Wilmer pushed her against a wall and strangled her. She told police she was \"in fear of her life\" and believed she passed out momentarily during the incident.\nAt one point during the incident, Wilmer allegedly pulled a pocket knife and held it \"to the left side of (the woman's) throat,\" court records state. The victim eventually escaped to a neighbor's house.\nIn charging documents, police said they observed bruising on the woman's throat and neck.\nWilmer is being held without bond at the Dorchester County Department of Corrections.

    "content": "Mother charged in killing of daughter, 3, extradited back to Maryland\n\n October 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 694\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A woman charged with murder in the beating death of her 3-year-old daughter inside their North East residence in June remained in the Cecil County Detention Center on Thursday, Sept. 25.— two days after her extradition from Delaware and hours after her bail review hearing.Cecil County Circuit Court Judge Robert Sentman concluded that the defendant — Darrian Lynnelle Randle, 31 — should be held without bond, as recommended by Assistant State's Attorney Gavin Patashnick during Thursday afternoon's proceeding. (From the county jail, Randle appeared in the courtroom on a closed-circuit television screen.)\n\"The state cannot think of any (allegations) more heinous . . .\" Patashnick told the judge.\nThe prosecutor opined that Randle poses a flight risk because she has no ties to Cecil County, noting that her relatives reside in Indiana and that her boyfriend — Cedrick Antoine Britten, 44 — owns the home in which they were living at the time of killing.\nBritten also remains in the county jail on no bond, charged with first-degree child abuse resulting in death of a child under 13 and 10 other offenses relating to his alleged role in the incident.\nIn addition, Patashnick emphasized that an agreement between the governors of Maryland and Delaware allowed for Randle's extradition to Cecil County from Delaware, where she had been jailed since June on making a false report, and that the State of Maryland must ensure that Randle will be returned to Delaware to face that felony charge.\nAfter allegedly killing her daughter — Nola Dinkins — Randle purportedly reported to Delaware police that the girl had been kidnapped in an attempted carjacking near Newark, to explain why the youngster was missing.\nThe agreement between the two governors allows the Cecil County State's Attorney's Office to try Randle in the murder case first. And then, regardless of the outcome — even if Randle is acquitted of all charges — the agreement calls for her return to Delaware to be tried in the felony false report case.\n\"Both governors in Delaware and Maryland signed the agreement. She must go back to Delaware immediately (after the adjudication of her Cecil County murder case),\" Patashnick told the judge.\nRandle's defense lawyer, Michael Halter, had asked the judge to allow Randle to remain free on home-monitored release until her murder trial. Halter reported in the courtroom that Randle \"vehemently denies the allegations\" against her and the she \"looks forward to her day in court.\"\nOn Wednesday, a Cecil County grand jury handed up an 11-count indictment against Randle, charging her with first-degree murder, first-degree child abuse resulting in death and nine related charges, according to court records.\nCourt records allege that Randle admitted that she beat Nola to death inside their shared bedroom of Britten's residence in the 300 block of Elk Nest Road during the daytime hours on June 9 and then made arrangements to get rid of the girl's body.\nRandle told investigators that she struck Nola 15 to 20 times with a belt all over her body, causing the girl to collapse to the floor and to stop breathing — a confession given after she allegedly had falsely reported that her daughter had been kidnapped, triggering an Amber Alert, according to the original charging document.\nIn addition, Randle told detectives that she asked Britten to get rid of Nola's body, which they had placed inside a dark blue suitcase, police said. She also told investigators that Britten later sent her a photograph of a park, after driving away from the residence with the suitcase inside his car, police added.\nCourt records further allege that, during an interview at the Maryland State Police North East Barrack on June 11, Britten \"produced a map of where he believed that Randle may have disposed of\" Nola's body, a statement that appears to allege that Randle got rid of the body.\nBased on that map, investigators found human remains \"consistent with an emaciated child\" inside a suitcase found in a vacant lot in the unit block of Dune Drive near North East, close to Britten's residence, court records show.\nThe remains were positively identified as those of Nola, based on an autopsy performed by the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore, police reported. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Michael Eugene Stone, the attorney general's office is asking the high court to overturn a Maryland Appellate Court decision in favor of Stone, a Washington County man found guilty of controlled dangerous substance charges.\nThe charges stem from a traffic stop police initiated on Stone in May of 2023. Police observed Stone \"manipulate a cell phone that was attached to his windshield,\" which led to a search and discovery of the substances.\nAttorneys for Stone filed a motion to suppress before his trial in Washington County Circuit Court, arguing his Fourth Amendment rights were violated. The Circuit Court denied the motion, but the Appellate Court ruled in January that the Circuit Court should've granted the motion.\n\"There is insufficient evidence in the record from which the trial court could properly conclude that the officers had reasonable suspicion to conduct a traffic stop,\" a majority opinion from the appeals court read.\nIn Maryland, handheld cell phone use and texting while driving is illegal. Exceptions include 911 calls and use of a GPS system.\nOn Friday, the Maryland Supreme Court dug in on the matter. They did so inside the Easton High School auditorium, part of a special off-site oral argument endeavor to reach students in high school and college.\nHundreds of students, as well as members of the public, listened in.\nJillian Chieppor, assistant attorney general, asked the Supreme Court to reverse the Appellate Court's decision. She argued officers had reasonable suspicion to pull Stone over, as they reported he pressed his phone in a manner \"consistent\" with typing a text message.\nShe said Maryland law statutes are intended to prevent the dangerous consequences of distracted driving and that forcing officers to wait until the consequence occur goes against the law's purpose.\nJustices asked Chieppor if officers would have reasonable suspicion any time a driver touches their cell phone.\n\"It seems like if we accept the state's position, any time somebody touches a cell phone device, that would constitute reasonable suspicion,\" Justice Brynja Booth said. \"Wouldn't we be casting a really wide scope?\"\nStone's public defender, Douglas Nivens II, said the case isn't about texting and driving.\n\"This is a case about Mr. Stone … reaching up to touch the screen of his cell phone mounted on his dashboard,\" Nivens said.\n\"One touch being the grounds for a traffic stop is a bridge too far,\" he added.\nJustices asked Nivens to provide his view of what officers would need to show reasonable suspicion based on the General Assembly's passage of laws to bar dangerous distracted driving.\nNivens said where the phone is located inside the car should matter, as well as how long the officer has looked at the driver's behaviors.\n\"We don't want officers just stopping people at random because they have a hunch,\" he said.\nA decision from the Maryland Supreme Court on the matter is expected at a later date. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Garcy, who was naked, can be seen slowly approaching Weber's police vehicle before pausing and asking Weber, \"Will you just f------ shoot me?\"\nGarcy can then be seen rapidly approaching Weber. Weber is seen deploying a Taser, which is ineffective, then running from Garcy before firing five shots in Garcy's direction.\n\"I can say that I'm very proud of the officer that, from what I see, with all his training and knowledge of the job, he did what he, unfortunately, had to do to survive, and that's about all I can say about that for now,\" Cambridge Police Chief Justin Todd said Friday.\nGarcy was transported by Maryland State Police Aviation to Tidal Health Peninsula Regional Medical Center in Salisbury, where he later died.\nWeber, who has been with the police department for six years, has been placed on paid administrative leave until the investigation by the attorney general's office is finished, Todd said.\nAccording to Todd, this is Cambridge's first fatal police shooting in about 15 years.\n\"I can say my condolences for the family of Mr. Garcy having to go through that and have that video out there. I can't imagine the pain and heartache,\" Todd said. \"Mental health is a real problem.\"\nTodd said he has been in contact with Garcy's family via email since the incident and considers the experience traumatic for both the family and the officers involved.\n\"We all sign up to do this job, and yes, we know it can come to that, but I don't think anyone can speak for it until you actually have been through something like that,\" Todd said.\nTodd does not know when the investigation from the independent investigations division will conclude, but he said the investigators have been in touch and have been great to work with.\nThis article was updated to add comments from Cambridge Police Chief Justin Todd. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Police are still searching for the suspect vehicle.\nThe crash occurred at U.S. Route 50 and Woodridge Drive.\nOn Monday, Town Council President Don Abbatiello implored residents to drive safely.\n\"We already have enough people who come through town speeding. We don't need to add to that,\" Abbatiello said.\nThe fatal crash occurred just north of the Immanuel Lutheran Church and across from Saints Peter & Paul High School. Slightly north of the crash location is an overhead sign instruction drivers of the traffic light ahead, reading: \"urban area stay alert.\" The speed limit reduces to 45 mph as drivers funnel toward the Route 50 and Dutchmans Lane intersection.\nSaturday's crash is the second fatal collision on that stretch of road this year. In February, a car struck and killed a 35-year-old man near Route 50 and Woodridge Drive.\nIn response to questions about Route 50 safety in Easton, State Highway Administration spokesman Danny Allman said pedestrian activity near Woodridge Drive \"is not encouraged as there are no sidewalks nor shoulders\" on that side of the highway.\n\"We always emphasize visibility for pedestrians and cyclists on any road,\" Allman wrote in an email statement Tuesday. \"Pedestrians and cyclists should always wear reflective apparel, especially in areas with no separation or lighting.\"\nSaturday's fatal crash is also raising the question of whether speed cameras should be placed along Route 50 in Easton. Abbatiello said the cameras are needed.\n\"I also am pleading with the state to consider adding speed cameras on Route 50,\" he said during Monday's meeting. \"We are talking about adding two crosswalks, one at Dover, one at Goldsborough, hopefully within the next year. We're going to have people walking across Route 50. It needs to be safe for them to do so. And so I hope that the state will seriously consider a request for a speed camera on Route 50.\"\nEaston has its own speed enforcement program to deter speeding in school zones. School zone signs with \"photo enforced\" written under them indicate where the cameras may be active.\nTown Engineer Rick Van Emburgh said speed cameras on town streets and roads have been successful. There are cameras near the YMCA and The Country School, he said.\n\"I think that speed cameras help change behavior,\" Van Emburgh said.\nWhile Saturday's crash didn't occur on a town-operated road, Easton engineers are in communication with their counterparts at the state level, he said.\nAllman said SHA doesn't have \"enabling legislation\" to install speed cameras in non-work zones. Per state law, jurisdictions can install cameras in school zones and sometimes residential and other areas, he said.\nFor a camera to be placed on a state route, Allman said a jurisdiction would have to submit a request to SHA and receive a permit to place the camera.\nAbbatiello said in an interview Tuesday that the next step for the town to consider requesting a speed camera permit for Route 50. The precedent is already set in Salisbury Abbatiello noted, pointing to speed cameras on the highway near Wicomico Middle School.\n\"It's a real issue in Easton,\" Abbatiello said of Route 50 safety.\nEaston Police Chief Alan Lowrey said on Wednesday that the police department is working with a speed camera vendor to assess safety on the highway. \"There's a lot of work to be done\" before officially submitting a speed camera request to SHA, Lowrey said. Work includes gathering crash data.\n\"The goal is safety, the goal's not revenue,\" Lowrey said. \"That's how the state looks at it, too.\"\nAccording to SHA, sidewalks and pedestrian crossings are in the works for two Route 50 intersections — Dover and Matthewstown Roads, or Routes 331 and 328, respectively. Construction will begin in early- to mid-2026, Allman said Tuesday.\nFor roads maintained by the town, a draft comprehensive \"Complete Streets\" study is expected to be presented to town officials in the coming weeks. It will outline target speed limits, assess the need for sidewalks or bike lanes and, overall, put \"safety first,\" Van Emburgh said.\n\"It's gonna tell us what we want our roads to look like,\" he said.\nTalbot Thrive, a local nonprofit that advocates for pedestrian and bicycle safety, said in a statement on Monday that the town's Complete Streets study and similar safety efforts by Talbot County officials are important.\n\"These efforts need to be, at their core, about saving lives,\" the statement read.\nTalbot Thrive's statement also addressed Saturday's fatal crash.\n\"This tragedy is a stark reminder of the vulnerability of those who travel by foot, bicycle, or wheelchair in our community — and of the urgent need to make Talbot County's roads safer and more connected for everyone, not just for those in cars,\" the statement read.\nThis story has been updated to include comment from Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "‘High-risk targets’: New normal at churches, houses of worship after deadly attacks\n\n October 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: News \n \n 1448\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Security at churches, synagogues and other houses of worship is being increased significantly after recent deadly attacks.Since late August, there has been fatal, targeted violence aimed at a Catholic school during mass in Minneapolis that killed two young kids, a Mormon church in Michigan and a Jewish synagogue in Manchester, England.\nThe assassination of conservative Christian influencer Charlie Kirk has also raised concerns about political and religiously motivated violence.\n\"Places of worship are meant to be sanctuaries of peacemaking, prayer and connection,\" said Doug Andersen, a spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints after a man shot up and burned down a church in Michigan in September, killing four.\nThere were 900 \"acts of hostility\" (including vandalism, arson and gun-related incidents) against U.S. churches in 2023 and 2024, according to the Family Research Council (an Evangelical Group).\nThose are up significantly from previous years.\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has reported more than 27,000 antisemitic incidents in the U.S. since 2023, in the years after the Oct. 7, 2023 terror attacks and as Israel's two-year war in Gaza against Hamas has drawn significant international criticism.\nThat includes incidents on college campuses.\nA new ADL survey of American Jews shows 55% say they experienced antisemitism over the past 12 months and 57% \"believe that antisemitism is now a normal Jewish experience.\"\n\"All of the houses of worship should consider themselves to be high-risk targets at this point,\" said Dan Skoczylas, vice president of CLS Background Investigations and executive director of Hawkeye Active Shooter Response (both based in Illinois.)\nHe said that should prompt more religious groups to look more proactively at security, including engaging congregations and staff.\n'VIGILANCE & SECURITY'\nPolice across the country have increased their presence and patrols at churches and other houses of worship as well as at higher profile events.\nOn Sept, 30 in Venice, Florida, police responded to threats against the Jewish Congregation of Venice and determined those to be a hoax or \"swatting.\"\nThose types of threats have been increasing nationally.\nIn nearby Lee County, the local sheriff's office \"continues to maintain vigilance and security\" at houses of worship after the Sept. 10 killing of Kirk and other attacks.\nKirk, an ally of President Donald Trump who was popular with Evangelical Christians and young conservatives, was shot by a sniper Sept. 10 during a rally at Utah Valley University\n\"We have hundreds of individual places of worship and religious centers within Lee County. Deputies are familiar with those in their patrol sectors and conduct frequent area checks — this is standard practice,\" said Julie Sin, public information officer for the Lee County Sheriff's Office.\nSin said deputies receive active shooter training and the agency deploys surveillance towers and increases patrols during religious holidays and large gatherings.\nIn Madison, Wisconsin, the First Congregationalist Church of Christ had an LGBTQ pride banner vandalized in June. In December 2024 a mass shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison killed three (including the 15-year-old shooter who police said took her own life).\nAnother shooter targeted a Christian school in Nashville in 2023, killing three young children and three adults before being shot and killed by police.\nAnthony Vogel, a spokesman for the Madison Police Department, said local law enforcement has \"threat assessment\" and \"criminal intelligence\" to investigate threats and disseminate those leads to officers on patrol.\n\"The Madison Police Department offers the option of hiring officers for Special Duty to provide police presence and security,\" Vogel said of options for religious and other groups putting on events.\nBut Cathal Walsh, vice president and chief security officer for Guidepost Solutions (a New York-based security firm) said increased police presence can be temporary, centered around holidays, weekly services or special events as well as after high-profile incidents or threats.\n\"The police presence is always temporary,\" Walsh said, noting law enforcement can't be at churches 24/7.\n'VERY SERIOUSLY'\nThere have also been increased police and security footprints at Jewish synagogues during the recent High Holidays and the anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks in Israel (which occurred on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah / the Feast of Tabernacles).\n\"We take security very seriously,\" said David Holtz, Temple administrator for Temple B'nai Israel in Easton, Maryland, citing \"the considerable uptick of anti-Semitic threats violence.\"\nThat includes the killing of a couple who worked at the Israeli Embassy in Washington D.C. and the attack on elderly demonstrators at a rally for Oct. 7 hostages in Boulder, Colorado, earlier this year.\n\"We have a gate that requires a code or approved entry for access to our parking area. We have magnetic locks on both the exterior entrance vestibule doors and the interior doors to our temple's lobby,\" Holtz said. \"We have security cameras throughout the interior and the exterior of the Temple. We have both off-duty sheriff's officers (armed and in uniform with marked vehicles) and private security personnel available for every service, Religious School or gathering event.\"\nHoltz said for the Yom Kippur holiday on Oct. 2 guards were posted both inside and outside the Maryland synagogue \"both as deterrent against any malicious actions and as peace of mind for our members and congregants.\"\n'I'M GOING TO BURN IT DOWN'\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has published a best practices guide for mosques and security.\nIts recommendations include having a \"vigilant\" security / usher staff that can give early warnings to congregants, approach suspicious individuals before they enter the house of worship and do their best to keep erratic or violent behavior outside.\n\"Unknown males with bulky, camouflage, or combat-type clothing, for example, need to be approached and asked if they can be helped, Should the attacker engage persons outside the mosque, every effort must be made to keep the intruder from getting inside the mosque in order to minimize casualties,\" the CAIR guide reads.\nSome of the vandals and shooters have some kind of animus towards a specific faith or church. Others hold some kind of personal grievance or grudge.\nOn Oct. 1, police in Dearborn Heights, Michigan received a threat from a man in Texas saying he would burn down a local mosque.\n'I'm going to burn it down,\" the caller said, according to Michigan police.\n'TARGET NO. 1'\nSecurity experts are seeing houses of worship upping their security efforts via increased staffing, surveillance and physical barriers. Some religious venues are considering or have deployed metal detectors at entrances.\n\"Many houses of worship are increasing security presence in response to recent shootings, including posting off-duty law enforcement officers, trained volunteers, or professional armed security,\" said Gene Petrino, CEO of Survival Response LLC, a Florida-based security consulting firm.\n\"Some facilities are adjusting access points, adding fencing, controlled entrances, or security checkpoints,\" he said.\nOthers are adding surveillance cameras, motion detectors and alarm systems.\nSkoczylas, a former law enforcement officer, said larger churches and dioceses have more resources and money than smaller congregations to have paid security guards or to buy security cameras and other equipment.\n\"They're not going to have the funds to hire a security force,\" Skoczylas said.\nHe said small churches and other groups can look at training volunteers.\nSkoczylas said that can cost in the range of $1,500 for a security training versus hiring off-duty cops or security, which he said can regularly cost thousands of dollars.\nHe said the reality for security personnel (paid or volunteer) is to be armed.\n\"A security agent who is unarmed is nothing more than target number one,\" Skoczylas said.\nThat can run up against churches and other houses of worship wanting to be welcoming places.\n\"The goal is a visible deterrent while maintaining a welcoming environment,\" said Petrino, a former SWAT commander.\nWalsh agrees it's a balancing act between security and feeling like a welcoming place.\nRoman Catholic churches, for example, have long prided themselves on having sanctuaries open for those who want to come in and pray or meditate.\nBut Walsh said parishioners now will be concerned if they don't see some security, especially during holidays and big events.\n\"They kind of get a little bit worried,\" he said.\nASSESSMENTS & SOLUTIONS\nWalsh suggests houses of worship look at entrances and exits and parking lots for vulnerabilities and how they fit into security plans and emergency responses.\nHe also said religious groups could look at having attendees register in advance for some events.\nWalsh also said there are federal grants available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and U.S. Department of Homeland Security for nonprofits and religious venues to upgrade their security infrastructure.\n\"You might receive the funding to install more security cameras,\" Walsh said. \"Those opportunities are out there.\"\nSome houses of worship are looking at how much to advertise events on social media and are looking more at potential threatening individuals making menacing online comments.\nThat is also a balancing act with social media serving as a primary conduit for religious groups connecting with local communities.\n\"Social media is very touchy,\" Skoczylas said. \"It's the conduit of all things good and bad.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Life-saving measures were initiated; however, Parsley was pronounced dead at the scene.\nIn a statement issued by the Sheriff's Office Wednesday, Oct. 8, police said detectives from the Sheriff's Office Criminal Investigation Unit immediately launched an investigation, working closely with multiple federal, state and local partners. The investigation was conducted with the collaborative support of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Baltimore-Annapolis Field Office, the Chesapeake Bay Safe Streets Task Force, Homeland Security Investigations' Baltimore Eastern Shore Field Office, the Maryland State Police Centreville Barrack, Centreville Police Department, Delaware State Police, Delaware Information and Analysis Center, Delaware State Police Governor's Task Force, Delaware Probation and Parole, Seaford Police Department and the Queen Anne's County State's Attorney's Office.\nAfter an extensive investigation, the case was brought before a Queen Anne's County grand jury. The grand jury returned indictments, and on Oct. 6, arrest warrants were issued.\nAndrews, of Seaford, Delaware, is charged with attempted second-degree murder (two counts), manslaughter, first-degree assault (four counts), second-degree assault (four counts), reckless endangerment (four counts), firearm used in the commission of a crime of violence (four counts), handgun on person (two counts), handgun in vehicle, loaded handgun in vehicle, and possession of a firearm as a minor.\nLawson, of Queenstown, is charged with attempted second-degree murder (four counts), manslaughter, first-degree assault (five counts), second-degree assault (five counts), reckless endangerment (five counts), firearm used in the commission of a crime of violence (five counts), conspiracy to alter physical evidence to avoid criminal prosecution, handgun on person (two counts), loaded handgun on person, possession of a firearm as a minor, and possession of a firearm without a serial number.\nLissau, of Centreville, is charged with attempted second-degree murder (four counts), manslaughter, first-degree assault (five counts), second-degree assault (five counts), reckless endangerment (five counts), firearm used in the commission of a crime of violence (five counts), conspiracy to alter physical evidence to avoid criminal prosecution, loaded handgun on person (two counts), and possession of a firearm without a serial number.\nAll three were taken into custody and held without bond.\nSheriff Gary Hofmann said, \"This has been an incredibly difficult time for Chris' family and for our entire community. The effects of this tragedy have been deeply felt, and our thoughts remain with those who continue to grieve. This investigation reflects the strength of collaboration between our community and our law enforcement partners.\n\"As the investigation continues, every tip, video, and witness account remains vital to bringing closure for Chris's family and our community. We have zero tolerance for crime in Queen Anne's County and will always stand up for victims who no longer have a voice.\"\nThe investigation into the death of Parsley remains ongoing. Investigators continue to seek information from the public and encourage anyone who may have details related to this case to contact the Anonymous Tip Line at 410-758-6666 or email Sheriff-Info@qac.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dobson said they hand out plastic fire hats to the children, and Walters distributes coloring books intended to reach kids' families and reinforce safety messages.\nThe theme of this year's prevention week is \"charge into safety — lithium-ion batteries in your home.\"\nWalters and Dobson said lithium-ion batteries pose a significant fire risk when not handled properly.\nThe batteries can be found in everyday items like laptops, medical devices such as pacemakers, digital cameras, e-bikes and even some children's toys, according to a press release from the Office of the State Fire Marshal.\nAccording to the press release, in 2023 the fire marshal's office began tracking lithium-ion battery-related fires. So far, 102 incidents have been recorded.\nWalters said that in Cambridge, they have had five lithium-ion related incidents within the last six months. Dobson said these incidences in Easton have been \"few and far between\" but can occur with lithium-ion batteries as small as those that go in hand-held power tools.\nThe campaign emphasizes three key safety actions when handling lithium-ion batteries: buy safely, charge safely and recycle safely.\nThe fire marshal's office suggests only purchasing devices and batteries with a safety certification mark, only using manufacturer-approved charging equipment, steering clear of overcharging, and never charging on soft surfaces like couches, beds or pillows.\nThe office said it is also critical to recycle these batteries at designated recycling centers, which can be found at call2recycle.org.\nAccording to the National Fire Prevention Association, signs there are problems with a lithium-ion battery include an odor, change in color, change in shape, too much heat, odd noises or leaking. If it is safe to do so, the association suggests moving the battery away from anything flammable and calling 911 if necessary.\nWalters said beyond lithium-ion safety measures, families should communicate, maintain a home exit plan and practice everyday fire prevention awareness.\n\"And if you have any questions, reach out to your local fire department, and if you're willing to come volunteer, reach out to your local department,\" Walters said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Greensboro Town Manager Cindy Yost said the sewer line is connected from Greensboro to Goldsboro. Friday evening, she said the town had asked Goldsboro residents to use less water while repairs were underway.\n\"We've had to go in and shut down the pump station to Goldsboro, and hopefully that'll keep it from coming forward,\" Yost said. \"Then we've got some trucks coming in, too, to help with that load. So, hopefully we can manage that with Goldsboro and not create any issues for them at the current time.\"\nShe said the town hoped to have the issue resolved by the morning.\nAfter investigation, the town discovered that a subcontractor from Sure Shot Drilling was boring on the property. Yost said the subcontractor hit the main sewer pipe, then covered the pipe with plywood, put an orange flag around the pipe and left the scene without contacting the town.\nAccording to Yost, the town contacted Sure Shot Drilling after discovering the break, and the company said workers had contacted Miss Utility, the company responsible for marking the location of power lines, sewer lines and water lines ahead of construction work.\nThe town manager said Sure Shot Drilling officials told her the area was not marked, so the contractor boring in that area was unaware the pipe was there.\nSure Shot Drilling could not be reached for comment due to the office being closed at the time the Star Democrat called.\nYost said the town was not contacted by Miss Utility ahead of Friday's construction work and was unaware of boring being done in the area that day.\n\"This is a huge sewer main. We should have been contacted. We were not,\" Yost said. \"So, right now we've got emergency crews out here. We've got our local police out here on the road. We've called MDE because of the sewage going into the creek. So, we're hoping that we can get this fixed tonight.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

That's a big part of what makes our community so vibrant. But it also means we all share a responsibility to keep our streets safe. One of the simplest and most important ways we can do that is by slowing down.The town continues to invest in projects that improve safety for everyone who uses our streets. We've added new sidewalks and crosswalks, updated trail crossing signage, improved lighting and installed electric speed signs in several neighborhoods. We're planning even more improvements in the months ahead — from better pedestrian crossings to infrastructure upgrades that make it easier and safer for everyone to get around.\nBut no matter how many improvements we make, the truth is that safety ultimately depends on how we drive. Speed and distraction are two of the biggest factors in crashes, and both are within our control. A pedestrian has a significantly better chance of surviving a car collision at lower speeds. When we slow down — especially in residential areas and near schools — we give ourselves more time to react, protect our neighbors and prevent accidents before they happen.\nSo as we continue working to make Easton safer through careful design and investment, I hope everyone will do their part behind the wheel. Put the phone down. Watch for pedestrians, wheelchairs, cyclists, scooters and skateboarders. Ease up on the gas.\nTogether, through thoughtful planning and careful driving, we can keep Easton a safe and welcoming place for everyone who calls it home.\nSafe travels. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Our hearts go out to the victim's family, friends and all those affected by this horrific incident.Every life lost on our roads is one too many. This tragedy is a stark reminder of the vulnerability of those who travel by foot, bicycle or wheelchair in our community — and of the urgent need to make Talbot County's roads safer and more connected for everyone, not just for those in cars.\nAt Talbot Thrive, we advocate for a future where people can move safely and efficiently — whether they drive, walk, bike or take transit. We believe that investing in complete, connected neighborhoods and better infrastructure for people without cars is essential to building a community that is equitable, healthy and resilient.\nThis moment underscores the importance of thoughtful implementation of the Town of Easton's Complete Streets Plan and the county's Safety Action Plan, including expanding transit options and designing streets that prioritize safety for all users. These efforts need to be, at their core, about saving lives.\nWe extend our condolences once again to the victim's loved ones. May this loss strengthen our shared resolve to make Easton and Talbot County safer and more accessible for everyone.\nHEATHER GRANT\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Trams said he has been on a mission to grow the department with solid officers. He believes he has another one in Eckel.\n\"I was by myself for a while, and then I've recruited a second officer and I'm continuing to want to build, so having a third officer actually feels pretty good,\" Trams said. \"I would only hire the best. I have told the Town Council and the citizens, please be patient with me, I will build the agency but I'll only hire the best and it really feels good to hire the best.\"\nEckel, 27, is from Edgewater. He served in the Marine Corps from 2015 to 2021, two years in the reserves and four years active, and he is currently in the Army National Guard.\nAfter his service, Eckel joined the Federalsburg Police Department from June 2023 to Oct. 1. After the Federalsburg Police Department was absorbed by the Caroline County Sheriff's Office, Eckel joined the Greensboro Police Department.\nGreensboro is one of two towns in Caroline County that still has its own police department. Last year, Ridgely turned over policing duties to the Sheriff's Office after laying off the town's six officers amid an investigation into the police department's chief. The investigation did not find any wrongdoing by the chief.\nThe Federalsburg Police Department was disbanded this month due to the town's financial constraints.\nIn Federalsburg, Eckel said he gained experience in small-town policing and learned how to build a relationship with the town's residents.\n\"When it comes to small-town policing, there's a different mindset you have to have,\" Eckel said. \"It's not Maryland State Police, where you're going to see that person one time out of your 20, 25 years. You're going to be interacting with these people all the time. So getting to know these people, getting to essentially humanize the badge, I learned a lot of that in Federalsburg.\"\nWhile Eckel mentioned his tactical experience as a plus for the town, Trams said he was most impressed by Eckel's passion and his drive to be out in the community.\n\"Jeremy is not going to just hang around the office and put his feet up and wait for a call to come in,\" Trams said. \"He did tell me that he likes to be out there and ride around. So, the town is going to go through more gas because he's going to be out there and visible. That's exactly what the residents has asked for.\"\nEckel said when he interacts with residents, they can expect, \"kindness, compassion and definitely some knowledge.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This week's Star Democrat headlines make that clear.In Ridgely, town employees and officials have filed a motion to dismiss a federal lawsuit brought by the town's former police chief and officers. The plaintiffs argue the town violated their due process rights when the entire department was laid off last year, while the town maintains it was acting according to its charter and applicable laws.\nMeanwhile, in Greensboro, the police department has tripled in size this year. Police Chief Lenox Trams, who in January was the department's sole officer, welcomed a third officer this month who joins the department from the now-defunct Federalsburg Police Department.

Anthony Lenzi, lead detective, for conducting the initial three-month-long investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect — Harold Joseph Lahr, of the 1400 block of Perryville Road — and for the continuing probe during the past two and a half months, which resulted in the identification of the six additional victims and six other states. Lenzi reportedly was assisted by fellow officers while serving as the lead investigator.\n\"These types of investigations are especially complex due to the involvement of multiple financial institutions and jurisdictions,\" Nitz commented. \"This case highlights that crime knows no boundaries. I'm extremely proud of the dedication and persistence shown by our officers in bringing justice to the victim. The Perryville Police Department remains committed to protecting our community and (to) working with partners across the country to hold criminals accountable.\"\nThe local investigation leading to Lahr's arrest and the criminal charges against him started in May, when detectives with the Orange County (Cal.) Sheriff's Office contacted the Perryville Police Department regarding an elderly resident in their jurisdiction who had been defrauded by someone in Cecil County, police reported.\nThat spurred a three-month-long investigation, culminating in the arrest of Lahr on July 30 and the charges against him, according to Nitz, who declined to specify the ruse that Lahr allegedly had used to steal the woman's money, citing the pending trial.\nNitz reported that the woman used cashier checks to pay Lahr and, on one occasion, overnighted $8,000 in cash to Lahr through the U.S. Postal Service.\n\"The investigation revealed that the victim had been defrauded of approximately $163,000 through a series of financial transactions. Through search and seizure warrants, subpoenas, and multiple interviews, Harold Lahr was identified as the suspect,\" Nitz explained.\nThe police chief further outlined, \"Investigators gathered transaction logs, video surveillance footage, and other supporting evidence before submitting the case to the Cecil County State's Attorney's Office for review.\"\nInvestigators arrested Lahr after the Cecil County State's Attorney's Office filed 11 charges against him on July 16 by way of a criminal information document, Nitz outlined.\nThe criminal charges against Lahr include four counts each of exploitation of a vulnerable adult to steal more than $25,000 and less than $100,000 and theft of more than $25,000 and less than $100,000, according to Cecil County Circuit Court records. Theft scheme to steal more than $100,000 also is among the charges against Lahr, court records show.\nLahr remained in custody on no bond Wednesday, according to court records, which further show that, on Sept. 5, Lahr was found to be incompetent to stand trial. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The ads falsely claim to be associated with Fresh Cannabis, the licensed medical and recreational marijuana dispensary on Ogletown Road.\n\"The impostors are attempting to mislead potential customers into purchasing marijuana products illegally,\" said Jon Peterson, a spokesman for DATE.\nOne of the ads includes a cartoon of a marijuana leaf character holding a joint and targeting UD students with the words \"UDEL-iver? Yes we do!\"\n\"Quick delivery for on-campus students only! (DoorDash/Uber Eats Style!),\" reads the ad, which includes the Fresh Cannabis logo and a promise of a free sample of marijuana for students who sign up.\nAnother ad also includes the Fresh Cannabis logo and shows a menu of offerings. It notes that the business delivers 24/7.\nPeterson emphasized that no licensed marijuana dispensary in Delaware is permitted to deliver marijuana or marijuana products.\n\"Any business claiming to offer delivery services is operating illegally,\" he said. \"Delaware's adult-use marijuana marketplace includes strict regulations and testing standards designed to ensure consumer safety. Products sold through illegal channels bypass these safeguards and may contain dangerous contaminants such as mold, pesticides or heavy metals.\"\nThough Delaware legalized recreational marijuana, it remains illegal to sell it outside of licensed dispensaries.\nTips about this or similar cases can be sent to Cpl.

James Diggs said they need donations and are optimistic to reach the goal, but they also need volunteers for the shelter: some cooks, but more importantly they need hosts and sleepers. The host, Diggs explained, meets and greets the guests, ensures they are comfortable and safe while the sleepers stay the whole night.\nDiggs announced this year they are aiming to open the shelter in December, a first.\nThat is up to the amount of volunteers that sign up. Diggs said that they have to have 85% of December filled to accomplish this, with volunteers especially needed Christmas Eve, Christmas, New Year's Eve and New Year's.\n\"Let's make this month a recruiting month. Help us do it because I think we certainly can. We're excited to be able to add December and maybe next year, add another month.\"\nAs winter approaches, the need increases to care for Kent County's homeless population he stated.\nAs their mission describes, the Samaritan Group of Kent County work with local agencies, churches, businesses and organizations and individuals to keep them warm and also providing financial assistance.\nDuring the rally with refreshments and ice cream served by Marcia Stoltzfus and family, Diggs listed the shelter's accomplishments and gave out certificates and awards to the hardworking, caring volunteers which make it possible each year, adding a fun family event along the fundraising.\nIn the early winter months of 2025, they served 21 clients, seven women, two children and 12 men, 661 bed nights total. In 2018 they served 21 people as well, 1,033 bed nights and that next year, 28 people and 921 bed nights.\n\"The number of people we serve is unpredictable. We just don't know from year to year. The point is to be ready and all of you volunteers make that possible.\"\nHe thanked some of the volunteers that helped get the shelter ready.\nReceiving the Laverne and Shirley Award was dynamic duo Annie Woodall and Andrea Nieman. Top Chef, and also supplying that tasty soft serve ice cream was Marcia Stoltzfus and family. The Host with the Most was Allison Brieske and Volunteer of the Year, who dedicated time cooking/ inspiring her whole church to cook, and hosting, was Anne-Marie Walters.\nMany other certificates given as well, some of whom were not in attendance.\n\"They may not be here, but they were when it counted,\" joked Diggs.\nGiving her testimony about the rewards of volunteering was Melanie Keller, who was recruited by Woodall and Nieman years back and was the volunteer coordinator for a time.\nKeller said that after her third child, part of what kept her volunteering was her two children who also volunteer. They play hide-and-seek with guests and see other people's experiences, their suffering and joys and practice reaching out with compassion.\n\"We are a community and I hope to see some of you as hosts,\" she told attendees.\nDiggs said hosts have a very important role, stay from 5:30-10 p.m. and are in pairs. Diggs personally greets the hosts each night and briefs them on what they need to know, ensuring they are comfortable.\nSleepers stay into the night and see guests off in the morning.\nDiggs encouraged the audience to not only sign up but to become recruits, sharing the joys of volunteering at the shelter where Mid-Shore Community Foundation, United Way of Kent County, the Good Neighbor Fund and Kent County Department of Social Services partner in this important mission.\n\"We need your help,\" Diggs said to the community. \"With it we can open up in December...one month at a time.\"\nTo contact them go to: info@samaritangroupofkentcounty.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Easton police, with help from the U.S. Marshals Capital Area Regional Fugitive Task Force, located Washington at a residence in Ellicott City.\nThe victim, Kendall Wooten, was transported to Shock Trauma with \"at least five stab wounds\" on his neck, chest, arm and back, according to court documents. Easton Police Department Deputy Chief Greg Wright said on Thursday that Wooten had since been released from the hospital.\nWashington is charged with attempted first- and second-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and use of a dangerous weapon with the intent to injure.\nCharging documents indicate that Washington and Wooten shared an apartment inside The Gratitude House, an addiction recovery home on Dover Road. The manager of the home witnessed the stabbing, police said in charging documents.\nPrior to the stabbing, the manager told police that Wooten and Washington \"got into a verbal altercation that turned physical.\" The manager prepared to give Wooten a ride to leave the apartment, police said.\nWhile in the parking lot, Washington allegedly approached Wooten and stabbed him multiple time, court records state.\nThe manager told police he \"never saw a knife, so he initially thought that Washington was punching Wooten, until he saw blood spurting from Wooten's neck,\" court records state.\nThe manager applied aid to Wooten while Washington left the scene, per court records. Police arrived on scene and observed blood near the vehicle where the stabbing occurred, charging documents state.\nWashington is being held without bond at the Talbot County Detention Center. A preliminary hearing in Talbot County District Court is set for Nov. 4. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Bikes, scooters need to show caution\n\n October 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 398\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last week, I met and spoke with Easton Police Department Officer Hugo Galan while walking on the Rails to Trails. We talked after he spoke to a man riding a motorized bicycle about keeping safety in mind as he traveled the trails.I told him my concerns about more and more riders of electric bikes, scooters and skateboards whizzing along on the trails with seemingly little regard for pedestrians. If these riders were on the street, the speed probably wouldn't be as noticeable, but when you're walking, it feels really fast as they zip by, startling because you often don't hear them until they're next to you.\nAnd, it happens without warning, like signaling with the ringing of a bicycle bell behind you, or, as some kindly people do, call out to let you know what side they're passing on. Careless riders will zig-zag at top speed between older adults walking dogs, little kids on bikes and scooters, or moms pushing strollers with small children in tow. It's frightening to watch because one misstep could result in something terrible.\nThe Rails to Trails through Easton is a pedestrian highway for hundreds of people. Some without transportation use it to get to jobs. Schoolchildren use it to get to and from school. And for others, it's a daily exercise routine or a way to simply enjoy the outdoors. But with more motorized bikes, scooters and even skateboards, the safety and peacefulness of walking on the trails has changed. Walkers have to factor in the possibility of being hit, adding a lot more caution to each stroll.\nEaston residents have been speaking up about the uptick of speeding on the trails, expressing concerns to the police department and to town officials. Officer Galan said the Easton Police Department has expanded its outreach and patrols to increase safety awareness among riders, urging them to slow down as they approach walkers and runners. I applaud these conversations, the extra patrols and other actions the police take each day, particularly at night when no one should be on the trails or in the parks, to keep all of us safe.\nIt is reassuring to see officers on the trails engaging with the public in positive ways to increase everyone's awareness. But most importantly, riders need to show more courtesy to walkers and slow down. We all use the trail and we want to enjoy it safely.\nBARBARA SAUERS\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Man who shot co-worker sentenced to 50 years\n\n October 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Crime \n \n 277\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A man has been sentenced to a combined 50 years in prison for shooting a co-worker outside a Trappe gas station last year.Antonio Bolden, 37, received consecutive 35- and 15-year terms in Talbot and Dorchester counties, respectively, after pleading guilty to attempted first-degree murder and armed carjacking.\nBolden shot a man in the face and arm at the Freedom Fuel gas station and food mart off of U.S. Route 50 on Sept. 17, 2024.\nThe victim, then-29-year-old Aigner Smith of Salisbury, was identified as Bolden's co-worker. The two were heading to a job site in the same van when Bolden asked the victim to pull over at the gas station.\nSmith has since recovered from his injuries after a number of surgeries, according to a press release from the Talbot County State's Attorney's Office.\nThe day of the shooting was Bolden's second day working for a new company, prosecutors said. Bolden and Smith \"did not have any prior history\" and there was no \"provocation or disagreement\" between them before the shooting, the press release stated.\nAfter shooting Smith, Bolden removed him from the car, left him on the ground and fled the scene in the van, according to the press release. He tried carjacking a vehicle in Cambridge before police arrested him. Bolden later pleaded guilty to armed carjacking.\nAt an Oct. 7 hearing, Talbot County Circuit Court Judge Phil Cronan handed down a life sentence with all but 35 years suspended. Two days later, Dorchester County Circuit Court Judge Karen Dean sentenced Bolden to 15 years for the carjacking.\nThe two sentences will be served consecutively. Following the 35-year sentence, Bolden will be placed under five years of supervised probation. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton officials weigh in on Complete Streets study, pedestrian safety\n\n October 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 640\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Town officials on Monday discussed ongoing efforts to shore up pedestrian and bike safety, including a comprehensive study on the town's roads and streets.In a workshop, Town Engineer Rick Van Emburgh updated the Town Council on an ongoing study into street safety conducted by the engineering firm Wallace Montgomery.\nThe study, known as Complete Streets, aims to create a manual for Easton outlining which types of roads and streets prioritize certain modes of transportation, such as walking, biking and driving. The study itself will not make road safety improvements, though officials see it as a guide to initiating those upgrades.\nThose leading the study are in the process of meeting with local businesses and safety stakeholders to gather feedback on how best to define and classify different streets. Larry Marcus, an associate for Wallace Montgomery, said some classifications include residential, collector, commercial urban and commercial industrial streets.\nRoads are further defined by land use: downtown, residential, commercial and industrial, Marcus said. The categories roads fall into will determine the study's recommendation on which sidewalk, bike lane or vehicular improvements should be taken.\nVan Emburgh added that the manual will make it easier for the town to require certain road safety steps be taken when residential or commercial developers apply for site plan approval. Moving forward, the town will be less likely to give developers breaks or reliefs from ensuring private roads are up to town standards, he said.\n\"It's a very practical document that I can think of a lot of different ways it will be used,\" Van Emburgh said of the Complete Streets study. Guidelines will be drafted and applied to a map of town roads in November.\nDuring the nearly hourlong workshop, many specific pressure points in town were raised, including Port Street and North Washington Street.\nCouncil President Don Abbatiello said telephone poles in the middle of sidewalks on Port Street make it difficult for people to walk safely. Council members Maureen Curry and the Rev. Elmer Davis echoed the concern about the street.\n\"It's gonna (be) awfully difficult to make Port Street pedestrian friendly unless we make some serious improvements,\" Curry said.\nOn North Washington Street, sidewalks are expected to be added. Van Emburgh said the town has funds in its budget already for survey and design work for North Washington Street from Easton Hardware (near the Creamery Lane intersection) to Gay's Seafood (close to the stoplight at the Easton Parkway, or Route 322).\nThe Complete Streets guidance will help determine the specific bike, pedestrian and vehicular safety measures taken for the North Washington Street project.\nPedestrian and bike safety has been an ongoing discussion among town leaders, residents and local advocates. Earlier this month, worries about safety on Route 50 — a state-operated highway — were raised after a man on a bike was struck and killed.\nWard 3 Councilmember David Montgomery shared concerns that the town would sacrifice the efficient flow of vehicular traffic in order to prioritize walking and biking. He said many of the older residents in his ward — including the west side of Easton Parkway — aren't \"interested in bicycling to downtown.\"\n\"Automobile transportation is pretty much what everybody uses in order to get into the center of town,\" Montgomery said. \"So I'm very concerned about our sacrificing the flow of single-occupancy vehicles, sacrificing it to other things, that for my ward, don't do any good at all by way of mobility.\"\nHeather Grant, executive director of Talbot Thrive, a local nonprofit that advocates for pedestrian and bike safety, refuted Montgomery's stance. In a statement, she said residents who \"don't want to drive everywhere\" deserve \"equal access to safe infrastructure.\"\n\"Some council members who mention the difficulties in traveling by car during school drop off and pick up should consider that if we make our streets safer for kids to walk and bike to school, we can reduce vehicle congestion,\" Grant wrote. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
