The forum included a presentation by Cambridge resident and environmental advocate Susan Olsen, a Q & A and a moderated discussion.Olsen's presentation outlined what climate change is and its affects on the Eastern Shore before diving in to discuss Maryland's Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022.\"We are doing a great job in Maryland,\" Olsen said. \"The Climate Solutions Now Act of '22 is the most ambitious greenhouse gas reduction program in our country.\" The act requires the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions through setting new goals and developing emissions reduction requirements.Olsen said environmental justice is a large part of the environmental bills being passed.She said the Climate Solutions Now Act uses tax incentives to encourage community solar for low and moderate income Marylanders.Community solar gives utility customers who rent or are unable to purchase solar panels the option to power their homes with solar energy through a subscription, according to the Maryland Office of People's Counsel.\"It's wonderful,\" Olsen said. \"It really is.\" Olsen ended her presentation by sharing how residents can be a part of the solution in Dorchester County and on the Eastern Shore.She mentioned tree grants from the state's 5 Million Trees Initiative. The grants can pay for trees that are planted in public areas. Olsen said that folks who are interested in getting involved with planting trees can look into the ShoreRivers Tree Stewards program.Other ways to get involved include joining environmental groups or lobbying for the implementation, compliance and enforcement of the Climate Solutions Now Act.Olsen also talked about her experience trying to get Dorchester County Public Schools on board with electric buses. She said the Environmental Protection Agency has been giving out grants to school districts to trade in their diesel school buses for electric, propane or low-emission buses.\"Last year, we were a priority district,\" Olsen said about Dorchester County Public Schools.\"They would pay the full cost of the buses.\" However, Olsen said the Dorchester County Board of Education decided against switching to zero-and low-emission buses.Maris Wicker, who attended the forum, said she remembers when the Board was discussing this.\"I was very disappointed to learn that there was not a move toward electric buses,\" Wicker said. \"I thought it could have been a great learning moment for kids riding school buses.\" Olsen said that while Dorchester County is no longer a priority district for this grant - meaning the EPA would only fund a percentage of the cost of each bus-it is still possible for the district to get involved with the program.Sarah Gavian, chair of the Dorchester Dems Committee, said she could see a group of advocates coming together for this issue.\"I think there probably is a lot of momentum around things that could be done to support at least understanding what Dorchester can win and lose from (with electric) school buses,\" Gavian said. \"I think (we could) probably find some advocates in this room to work with Susan on this.\" Forum attendees also talked about how to improve and increase recycling in the area.During her presentation, Olsen said that recycling correctly can decrease the amount of methane, a greenhouse gas, in landfills.Miriam Zijp said that when it comes to recycling in Dorchester County, the problem is information.\"People don't know how to recycle,\" Zijp said. \"But they don't get taught.\" Zijp suggested creating programs to teach children how to recycle.\"You have to start somewhere,\" she said. \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nMary Dennard-Turner talks about recycling at a forum on climate change hosted by the Dorchester Dems on Aug. 2 at the organization's headquarters in Cambridge. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ocean currents serve as conveyors belts moving water around the globe.The result could be colder waters and climate in the north Atlantic and rising sea levels in places such as low-lying coastal areas in places such as Louisiana, Florida, Panama and Guyana Warmer ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico and Florida Keys have already been threatening coral reefs in Florida and could foster larger hurricane, typhoons and other storms threatening Atlantic hurricane hotspots.Ocean currents across the globe can be impacted, changed weakened by changes in temperature levels, the salinity of water and melting glaciers and ice sheets.Water temperatures already been increasing in the Gulf of Mexico (which propelled the strength and destructive path of Hurricane Ian last year) as well as the Indian Ocean. Citrus and other crops in the southern U.S. have already been impacted by rising temperatures and larger, more A 2018 study by researchers from Busan University and the Center for Climate Physics, Institute of Basic Science in South Korea said that dynamic could create oceanic hot spots in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean south of Pakistan and India.The result could be rising sea levels, more extreme storms and wild shifts in already tumultuous monsoon seasons and impacts on global shipping lanes and farming, especially rice production.Climate changes and its impacts on monsoon seasons have already been impacting rise production in parts of Asia.If the North Atlantic current collapse sounds familiar, it was major plot line in the climate change dystopian scenario in the 2004 movie \"The Day After Tomorrow.\" A collapse of current ocean current sent Europe, Canada and northern parts of the U.S. into a new mini-Ice Age in the Hollywood movie which now almost 20 years old.The Danish researchers said there has been previous evidence of potential shifts in Atlantic currents but the current trend of glacial melt-offs and warming temperatures could hasten a collapse.Other impacts of changing Atlantic and other Oceanic currents could be increased rainfall and sea levels rises in some regions such as Brazil and droughts and less rain in other regions such as Central America and Mexico.All that could change the landscape for agriculture, travel and maritime transport and spark large waves of migration in a contemporary age of migrations from Africa, South Asia, Central America and the Caribbean including countries such as Haiti, Cuba and Pakistan.Mass migrations have been increasingly linked to extreme weather events in developing countries with higher poverty rates. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nBruce Hickey, 70, walks along the waterfront, now littered with debris including shrimp boats, in the mobile home park where he and his wife, Kathy, have a winter home on San Carlos Island, Fort Myers Beach, Fla., on Oct. 5, 2022, one week after the passage of Hurricane Ian.\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nA boat navigates at night next to large icebergs near the town of Kulusuk, in eastern Greenland in 2019.

Donald Ghogomu thinks he has found the way to do just that and he presented his new invention Saturday at the Lexington Park Library.The Lexington Park resident held an unveiling of a prototype of his \"Omni Electric Generator,\" or OEG, prototype - a news release said it is the first of its kind in the U.S and perhaps the world - which would power a vehicle or a home continuously.\"I'm very excited because I know this product is going to help solve the insatiable quest for energy,\" Ghogomu said. \"I know a product of this nature would help recharge and help solve most of the energy problems we have.\" His invention would mean that drivers would no longer need to leave roadways for fuel and homes would never again lose power.There was no independent review of the invention provided as to whether it does what Ghogomu claimed.\"I thought it was quite amazing,\" said Justine Rowland of Prince Frederick, who knows Ghogomu through church. \"He's excited about it, and we didn't really know anything about it and my husband was a bit skeptical, like is it possible [to build something like this] and is it something that's real?\" I find it very interesting,\" said Jonathan Long, who made the hourplus drive from Virginia to support his friend. \"He's taking kinetic energy from one place to another and then bringing it back to keep producing.If what everything he said is true, it's definitely interesting. I'm curious to see what he does next with it.\" Ghogomu, who said he is an inventor and scientist with a background in the aviation and aircraft business, graduated from Oklahoma's Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology.\"It's my hope that the government will take notice and get it to use because it will help the population,\" he said. \"The problem we have with energy supplies, power shortages and the global warming issue this will solve the majority of those problems.\" During his hour-long presentation he said his invention will \"revolutionize the energy sector/industry for green energy globally.\" Ghogomu, who said he lost several jobs and was even homeless for a point, said he was depressed, traumatized and suffering from anxiety during his fruitless job search.But all that changed one night when he had a revelation while living in his car and observing the workings of his wind-up flashlight.\"I observed that mechanical energy was used to produce electricity,\" said Ghogomu, who has a degree in applied sciences from the for-profit institution. \"The Lord revealed in my spirit to explore the fact that if mechanical energy is used to produce electricity, therefore the process is reversible.\" He said the OEG was completed Sept. 22, 2022, in the living room of his Lexington Park home and \"functions under the principle of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy, and then reversing the process of electrical power in a complete energy cycle.\" During his presentation, Ghogomu showed some videos of him working on the 400-pound generator as well as troubleshooting it. He said he spent $5,000 to $6,000 constructing it.\"I would be very interested is seeing how other scientists challenge it,\" said Rowland, who is a project manager. \"For me, risk management is key to any project and I think it's prudent to run it through and make sure it's rigorous. And certainly what are the next steps.\" Rowland said she thought the generator \"was true\" and said she would purchase one if the opportunity arouse. \n \n Caption: MICHAEL REID/SOUTHERN MARYLAND NEWS\n \nInventor Donald Ghogomu of Lexington Park gives a presentation on his Omni Electric Generator Saturday, Aug. 5, at the Lexington Park Library.\n \nMICHAEL REID/SOUTHERN MARY LAND NEWS\n \nInventor Donald Ghogomu of Lexington Park, right, tinkers with his Omni Electric Generator while his brother, Alfred Ghogomu, looks on during a presentation Saturday, Aug. 5, at the Lexington Park Library.\n \nMICHAEL REID/SOUTHERN MARY LAND NEWS\n \nInventor Donald Ghogomu of Lexington Park gives a presentation on his Omni Electric Generator, which he says has the ability to run continuously with recycled energy Aug. 5 at the Lexington Park Library. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Court ruling affirms Md. chicken farm permits are legal, effective\n\n August 17, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A3 | Section: News \n \n 632\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS - The Maryland Supreme Court on Aug. 9 upheld a livestock farm water quality permit written by the Maryland Department of the Environment that had been challenged in court by environmental activists.The appellate court's ruling also found that MDE's best management practices-based regulatory framework for the state's permit was \"reasonable\" and \"consistent with federal and state law.\" The permit in question, Maryland's 2019 general discharge permit for animal feeding operations and concentrated animal feeding operations, had been challenged by the Assateague Coastal Trust, which filed a petition in Montgomery County Circuit Court in July 2020 for judicial review of the permit. ACT argued that the permit didn't do enough to regulate ammonia emissions from farms, and said MDE should go much further, possibly even requiring farm-byfarm installation of expensive new equipment. A Montgomery County judge sided with ACT in March 2021, ordering MDE to rewrite the permit with stricter standards, but MDE appealed that decision, and the Maryland Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal.When ACT filed its petition and the Montgomery County judge granted it, Delmarva Chicken Association recognized this case could have serious implications for chicken growers and the chicken community as a whole. To advocate for members in the closely-watched legal fight, DCA filed a friend-of-the-court brief arguing ACT's reading of the law was wrong, and that the MDE-approved permit was in line with federal law governing farms and clean water regulations.\"We're glad the Maryland Supreme Court recognized this challenge to the 2019 permit lacked merit and mischaracterized the law,\" said Holly Porter, DCA's executive director. \"This is the third consecutive time these activists have tried and failed to persuade courts to overrule science-based, legally sound water quality regulations.\" ACT, the court said, failed to show MDE's decision-making around the CAFO permit was \"arbitrary and capricious.\" In fact, the court's opinion said, Maryland regulators designed \"the same general discharge permit framework established by federal regulations,\" and so the court has no reason to upend it through judicial review.On the matter of ammonia emissions, the court found Maryland's permit sufficiently controlled ammonia pollution through site-specific measures when MDE found they would be called for, and adherence to best management practices required by the general permit.ACT's argument otherwise \"is in direct conflict with the evidence in the administrative record,\" the court ruled.The court ruling comes as agricultural stakeholders in the Chesapeake Bay watershed have reduced their annual nutrient inputs to the Bay, eliminating 39 million pounds of nitrogen and 3.5 million pounds of phosphorus since 1985. Developed areas like cities and suburbs, meanwhile, have increased their annual nutrient contributions to the watershed.In 1985, developed areas were responsible for an estimated 15% of nitrogen loads to the Bay; in 2021, they were responsible for an estimated 26% of the Bay's nitrogen pollution.The opinion in Maryland Department of the Environment v. Assateague Coastal Trust was written by Justice Brynja M. Booth, who has served on Maryland's highest court since 2019. It's the third time in recent years ACT has mounted a failed challenge to the MDE general discharge permit; a previous effort to overturn the 2009 permit was \"rejected at all levels,\" the court noted in Wednesday's opinion, and a challenge to the 2014 permit was also turned back by the courts. \n \n Caption: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO\n \nThe court ruling comes as agricultural stakeholders in the Chesapeake Bay watershed have reduced their annual nutrient inputs to the Bay, eliminating 39 million pounds of nitrogen and 3.5 million pounds of phosphorus since 1985.\n \nHOLLY PORTER \n \n Memo: \"We're glad the Maryland Supreme Court recognized this challenge to the 2019 permit lacked merit and mischaracterized the law.

Gov. Aruna Miller. \"The growth of this program is essential; it not only addresses the urgency required by an escalating climate crisis, but it closely aligns with our administration's commitment to service and to empowering our youth to gain real-world professional skills.\" The Class of 2022-2023 was made up of students from Allegany, Anne Arundel, Caroline, Howard, Montgomery, Talbot, Washington and Worcestor counties and Baltimore City.They were addressed briefly by seven special guests: Miller, Comptroller Brooke Lierman, Maryland Senate President William Ferguson, Maryland Senator Pamela Beidle, Maryland Energy Administration Director Paul Pinsky, BGE Sr. Vice President Alexander Nunez, and Chesapeake Bay Trust President Dr. Jana Davis. Each speaker touched on the potential each of the graduates have to continue the fight to protect Maryland's environment and the restoration efforts of the Chesapeake Bay.Pinsky told the graduates, \"Never doubt what you can do to change things for the better. A group of young people in Wyoming brought action in court to protect the environment there. Those young people are the same ages you are. You do the same thing they did, if the cause arises.\" Beidle also focused on the power of individuals. Quoting Margaret Mead, she said, \"The power and influence of one person has always been the force for change throughout history.\" The CCCC was created by the Maryland General Assembly in 2010. It is administered by the Chesapeake Bay Trust. The multi-faceted expansion of the program to include more intentional climate work is possible due to the additional $1.5 million per year investment from the State of Maryland.CCCC provides career and leadership training for young people interested in environmental careers.Corps members are matched with non-profit and government host organizations and receive firsthand training on a wide variety of topics on the realms of climate, energy, watershed restoration, agriculture, forestry and education.\"The goal of our Corps program is to create future generations of environmental stewards who are poised to address climate change and other environmental challenges, either in their personal or professional lives or both,\" Davis said. \"I am so proud of these amazing young people. Their efforts not only serve the environment, but also boost local economies and revitalize often underserved neighborhoods.\" The 55 selected 2023-24 Chesapeake Conservations and Climate Corps participants will serve this year in Anne Arundel, Charles, Calvert, Garrett, Howard, Kent, Montgomery, Prince George's, Talbot and Worcester counties, and Baltimore City. \n \n Caption: DOUG BISHOP/BAY TIMES AND RECORD OBSERVER\n \nMembers of the 2022-2023 Chesapeake Conservation and Climate Corps receive the symbolic golden shovel from previous graduates following their graduation, Tuesday, Aug. 15, at the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Center in Grasonville.

Van Hollen visits East New Market Farm\n\n August 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 960\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EAST NEW MARKET - After helping to secure federal funding for wildlife habitat restoration projects on the Eastern Shore through the Chesapeake WILD Grants program in 2022, U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen toured Waterloo Farm Thursday morning, Aug. 17, to see the conservation efforts that Eastern Shore Land Conservancy hopes to replicate across Dorchester County using the funding.Van Hollen authored legislation enacted in the America's Conservation Enhancement Act, passed in 2020, that created the Chesapeake WILD Grants program.The tour was made up of members of seven organizations: Eastern Shore Land Conservancy, Choose Clean Water Coalition, Chesapeake Conservancy, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, National Parks Conservation Association and Ducks Unlimited.\"Success requires a good working partnership, and that's what we have here,\" Van Hollen said in an interview. \"The question of course is how do those funds get used, and it's really important to have good stewards of that taxpayer money to make sure it's being well implemented.And that's what you see here.\" Skip Watson, who owns the farm with his wife Barbara, led the tour of his property that is protected in a land trust with Eastern Shore Land Conservancy.\"While the farm we're on today is not protected with Chesapeake WILD funds, we just wanted to show the senator exactly what we have in mind, what a preserved property looks like and what they can look like,\" Steve Kline, the president and CEO of Eastern Shore Land Conservancy, said in an interview.For nearly 30 years, the Watsons have owned their farm that is also a wildlife habitat. Certain plants on the property were planted to feed ducks, geese, deer and turkeys, Skip Watson said.\"We sort of have a nursing home for old trees here,\" Barbara Watson added.\"We try to keep them as long as we can.\" Skip Watson led members of the tour to an area that is a stone's throw from fields of soybeans, corn and sunflowers.On one side of the area is an old pond that Skip Watson said has \"gone natural\" with needle grass growing in it. It's the perfect place for ducks to \"hang out, hide and get some protection from overhead predators,\" he said.On the other side, he pointed to the impoundment he put in this year.Local grasses along with chufa, which deer love to eat, grow in the impoundment.\"In about two months, I'll put the boards into this water control device,\" Skip Watson said about flooding the land with water.Kline explained that these impoundments help mitigate saltwater intrusion, which he said is a big issue in lower parts of Dorchester County.\"The ditches that were designed to get water off the fields,\" Kline said during the tour, \"now because of sea level rise, those ditches are serving the opposite and they're bringing saltwater into these fields and impacting ag productivity.\" Chesapeake WILD funds will be used to help landowners of other private properties in Dorchester County replicate what the Watsons are doing.\"In our minds, we think of the conservation easement as the first step,\" Kline said. \"Once we get the easement in place, we can then do things like funding for restoration to build impoundments, to reforest, (to build) buffers, all kinds of farm bill programs as well, that we can put in place here on these properties.\" Kline said Eastern Shore Land Conservancy has found lots of landowners in the county who are interested in these projects. He said he expects the projects will be \"well on the way\" within the next six months to a year.Implementing conservation and wetland protection in Dorchester County is especially important because of the rising sea level and sinking land.\"All of Delmarva is subsiding, or sinking, six inches every century,\" Kline said.The county's flat topography contributes to this problem as well.Van Hollen said in an interview that the Chesapeake WILD funds can help build resilience.\"Protecting wetlands can not only bring in more wildlife and stop pollutants from directly traveling in the Bay - they act as filtration systems - but they also can help protect against accelerating erosion,\" he said.After the tour, Joel Dunn, the president and CEO of Chesapeake Conservancy, talked about the importance of bringing different groups focused on wildlife habitat preservation together to tour the farm.\"The reality is the size and scope of the environmental challenges we face can be daunting or appear overwhelming and the big dogs can't do it by themselves anymore,\" Dunn said. \"And so now it takes a collective effort, a collective impact, in order to have the landscape scale effect we're trying to achieve for current and future generations to preserve wildlife, restore water quality, enhance the fabric of our communities.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nU.S.Sen.

    "content": "Oxford Community Center plans landscape makeover\n\n August 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A5 | Section: News \n \n 829\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD - It has been over 10 years since renovations were completed for the Oxford Community Center. This year, the interior of the auditorium received some much-needed paint and refreshing. Thanks, in part, to the Fryling Family's grant support, and Mid-Shore Community Foundation, the interior of community center shines again.This \"face-lift\" begged the question about Oxford Community Center's exterior grounds. How was the rain garden holding up? Were the trees thriving and safe? Was this a good time to address those issues as well? The answer was yes.A small committee including a master gardener, a tree expert and a landscape designer was formed to assess the health of the community center landscape.It was agreed that taking a proactive approach would be the best stewardship decision at this time - and a plan was commissioned.Jennifer Connoley Landscape Design was selected to design and implement the project.\"The intent of the Oxford Community Center landscape and buffer management plan is to remove existing trees that are diseased and declining and replace them with thriving native trees and shrubs. In addition, the new landscape plantings will be both native and ornamental,\" landscape architect Jennifer Connoley said.\"They will enhance the building and provide sustenance to the native birds, bees and butterflies.The Oxford community will benefit greatly.\" Included in the project is Bartlett Tree Experts. Arborist representative Mark Eppard was instrumental in the assessment of the health of the trees.His company has treated and protected Oxford Community Center trees for more than 12 years, and he knows the decline that they are now showing.\"Several insect and disease pressures are fast taking the identified trees out of commission and the safest way to handle it is to remove them and replant new trees,\" Eppard said. \"I'm privileged to be able to help with the LEED Revitalization of the Oxford Community Center and to be able to give a gift of gratitude to everyone in the Oxford area.\" According to the University of Maryland Extension, \"The 'Bradford' pear or Callery pear is no longer a recommended tree for planting, it is highly invasive.Its rapid growth, dense foliage and a profusion of flowers made it a highly desirable tree for landscapes, and it was planted widely. But, it forms dense, thorny thickets in wild areas; out-competes and prevents the growth of native plants.\" Change.org states: \"The Callery pear is detrimental to our environment, ecosystem and pollinator population.Over 400 species of bees can be found in Maryland as well as over 150 butterfly species.Because the Callery pear is not native to the United States, it fails to provide adequate resources to Maryland's pollinators and wildlife. The negative effects invasive species such as the Callery pear have on pollinators are becoming more evident as we witness declines in crop productivity, reductions in pollinators critical to maintaining stable ecosystems, and widespread displacement of native habitats.Phyllis Rambo, vice president of the community center Board of Trustees, agrees.\"Ten years ago, our renovation was LEED certified,\" Rambo said. As part of that certification, native plant replacements in the landscape were stressed. With the removal of weak and invasive non-native Callery pear trees and replacement with native trees, shrubs and groundcovers we are not only beautifying our campus, but we are providing better habitat for our birds and other wildlife.\" The problem is nationwide.In March of this year, NBC4, New York, wrote about the issue stating, \"The Callery pear tree's pretty, upward-facing branch structure meant limbs would rip and fly off during storms, threatening to injure people and damage cars and homes. Today, the Callery pear is listed as an invasive species in several states.In January, Ohio became the first to enact a ban on the tree, with Pennsylvania and South Carolina following suit.\" The landscape revitalization project has been underwritten by two private sources, Lee Phillips and the Nancy and Michael Klein Foundation.Bartlett Tree Experts are donating their services.\"For the past 10 years or so, the interior of the community center has undergone a dramatic facelift,\" Phillips said.\"So the time has come for the landscaping and grounds maintenance to come up to the same level. This project should go a long way to accomplishing that goal.\" Michael Klein, a master gardener himself said: \"Having, in the past, worked with the landscape designer, Jen Connoley, I'm confident that OCC's restoration will turn out to be just wonderful.\" The design plans are on display at the Oxford Community Center and soon to be viewable online.The Oxford Community Center building has served as a community resource for over 80 years, first as a grammar school and then a high school and, for the last quarter century, as a cultural center and meeting place. The community center provides to residents and visitors alike a year round schedule of educational, social, cultural and recreational programs and events. It is indeed a Mid-Shore treasure, enriching lives since 1928.

Montana has some of the world's largest coal reserves, which has warped the state's politics toward protecting its fossil fuel industry at all costs.But the court ruled that by specifying that fossil fuel projects' impact on climate change can't legally be considered in the approval process, the state is effectively violating its own constitutional guarantee of a healthy environment to its residents - especially to young people, who will have to live in whatever climate future today's political leaders leave them.The judge didn't just invent the right to a healthy environment in Montana. It's specified in the Montana state Constitution (Article 9): \"The state and each person shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations.\" That may sound like (and may well be) something politicians of the past just tossed in there to hush Montana's environmentalists. But the judge concluded that that language obligates the state to deny permits for fossil fuel projects that would create \"unconstitutional levels of GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions.\" Which strikes us as common sense.Montana argued that anything it does as a state to address climate change would be too miniscule in the global scheme of things to make any impact on global warming. To the extend that's true, it's an argument for more action around America and the world, not less of it by individual states.The novel ruling faces an uncertain future on appeal. But it does inaugurate a legal theory that could survive whatever happens in the current case.If the courts eventually come around to a standard that legally obligates states to specifically protect the health and well-being of young residents when making policy, you have to wonder how Missouri laws will fare.This is, after all, a state that chronically shortchanges health care and education, has allowed its infrastructure to crumble on the altar of tax cuts, and has so loosened its gun laws that its Legislature has refused to even specify that children can't walk around in public with firearms.Talk about denying kids a \"healthful environment.\" REPRINTED FROM THE ST.

Across from the entrance to the complex is an open field about the size of a football field.For most of the years that we have lived here that field was left in its natural state. That meant lots of wild flowers (chicory, daisies, black-eyed Susans, Queen Anne's lace, Joe Pye, milkweed, etc.).Also birds were among the inhabitants, especially redwing blackbirds, as well as many butterflies (swallowtails, monarchs, buckeyes, fritillaries, cabbage whites, blues, morning cloaks).Now twice a year it is mowed down to an ugly field of clumps of vegetation.And why? So I can see the bypass.To destroy such a natural magnet for native flowers, butterflies and birds makes a mockery of leadership that professes to care about the environment.My question is: What government agencies make this decision - town, county or state?

Among them are the traditional Sept. 1 dove season opener - with many wingshooting opportunities afield, particularly on state wildlife areas, the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control announced.Resident Canada goose season opens the same day as dove season, as does the first of Delaware's deer seasons (archery and crossbow), while early teal season runs from Sept. 13-30 for both green-winged and bluewinged teal.What follows is a summary of September migratory bird hunting opportunities on state wildlife areas, how to take advantage of them, and the regulations and procedures to be followed for hunters accessing these opportunities.A complete listing of all the state's hunting seasons, to include daily bag limits, regulations and legal shooting hours, can be found in the 2023/'24 Delaware Hunting Guide.SUSSEX COUNTYDove: Sunflower fields and corn are planted on the Muddy Neck Tract of the Assawoman Wildlife Area on both sides of Double Bridges Road. Permits to hunt these fields are available at the Assawoman Lottery Station beginning at noon on opening day, Labor Day and all Saturdays in September. Hunting hours are 1 p.m. to 6 p.m.Sunflower and corn fields are planted at the Nanticoke Wildlife Area this year for dove hunting and are located on either side of the Main Road running between Old Sharptown and Phillips Landing Roads - the fields are called the George Adams Field and Dirt Pit Field.No permits or check-in are required. Nanticoke is open daily to dove hunting in accordance with all state and federal regulations from ½-hour before sunrise to sunset.All other wildlife areas in Sussex County are open for dove hunting with no permits required and in accordance with all state and federal regulations from ½-hour before sunrise to sunset. Non-toxic shot is required for dove hunting on all state wildlife areas during the early season.Resident Canada Goose: Resident goose hunting is available at the Assawoman Wildlife Area from a field blind on the Muddy Neck Tract south of Double Bridges Road. A hunter-facilitated drawing will occur two hours before sunrise on Mondays and Thursdays during the early season. More information can be obtained at the Assawoman Checking Station or by calling 302-539-3160 in advance of hunting days.September Teal: Prime Hook State Wildlife Area blinds and Prime Hook NWR blind sites will be open for the early teal season.Hunting days are Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday.Permits are free and will be issued using a hunter facilitated drawing 2½-hours before sunrise from the check station located on the Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge.Hunting hours are ½-hour before sunrise to 4 p.m. Hunters should plan to use the Foord's Landing boat ramp within the federal refuge to access the state waterfowl blinds as the new water levels have made the state boat ramp inaccessible. Note that blinds may not be grassed for the early teal season.No other Sussex County state wildlife areas are located within the September teal season zones.More information about hunting in Delaware, including migratory birds, can be found at de.gov/hunting. More information about hunting on state wildlife areas can be found at de.gov/wamaps. Information about Delaware's deer hunting seasons, which run in various incarnations from Sept. 1 through Jan. 31, 2024, can be found in the 2023-'24 hunting guide. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Most complete prehistoric bird skeleton found\n\n August 31, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 488\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Most bird bones are very thin, an adaptation to lighten the skeleton for the purpose of flight. So as a result their delicate bones do not fossilize well, which is why when even a single isolated fossil bird bone is found along Calvert Cliffs, it's a big deal.Now just imagine how excited the paleontologists at the Calvert Marine Museum became when long-time museum volunteer and fossil finder Mike Ellwood found a partial skeleton including a skull of a 12 million-year-old gannet.It is the most complete prehistoric bird skeleton ever found along Calvert Cliffs.What Ellwood first spotted were the ends of a few bones protruding from the sediments at the base of the cliff.Recognizing them as having come from a bird, and with permission from the landowner, he put a cast - also known as a field jacket - around a platter-sized block of sediment and brought it to the museum.Ellwood was unaware that when he collected the block was there was a nearly complete skull hiding in the cylindrical block that he had quarried.Calvert Marine Museum Assistant Paleontology Collections Manager Stephen Groff was tasked to prepare the fossil and as he meticulously worked his way down between the wing bones, he discovered that they framed the skull of an extinct species of gannet.Modern gannets are large seabirds that nest on islands or in coastal environments in temperate oceans like the north Atlantic as well as the Chesapeake Bay.From other fragmentary fossilized gannet bones found along the cliffs, we have known that gannets were here during the Miocene epoch when this area was usually under the coastal waters of the prehistoric Atlantic Ocean.However, a bird find consisting of a skull and bones from one individual has never been found along the cliffs.Not only did the shape and size of the skull confirm that it came from an extinct species of gannet, but also the observation that its snout did not have nostrils.Some diving birds don't have nostrils on the outside of their beak, an obvious and very helpful adaptation to keep water from blowing up their nose when diving into the water at great speed hoping to catch a slippery fish.The fossil gannet partial skeleton can now be seen in the museum's fossil preparation lab and will be there until it is removed for scientific study.For more information or to watch the discovery spotlight video produced by Calvert Broadcast, go to www.youtube.com/watch? v=jelUxYCSo M. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED BY MIKE ELLWOOD\n \nThe site along Calvert Cliffs (not in Calvert Cliffs State Park) where the gannet skull and partial skeleton was found by Mike Ellwood.

The Biden-Harris administration hailed the approval of the fourth major wind turbine project.According to the U.S. Department of the Interior, the project will be located about 15 nautical miles southeast of Point Judith, Rhode Island, and have an estimated capacity of 704 megawatts of clean energy, which can power nearly 250,000 homes. A group of concerned citizens, pointing out that they will not release the biological opinion from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is up in arms. See: https://green-oceans.org/Revolution Wind is one of nine developments slated for the area off the coast of Rhode Island and Massachusetts that will install over 1,000 turbines, each 873-1,100 feet high, over 1,400 square miles of ocean. The four closest projects to Rhode Island, Revolution Wind 1 and 2, South Fork Wind and Sunrise Wind, will severely damage Coxs Ledge, one of the most fertile marine ecosystems in New England.Coxes Ledge is a terminal glacial moraine, a complex geological formation that supports a diversity of marine species equivalent to a coral reef. Teeming with life, it hosts the endangered North Atlantic right whale during the winter months and is the only remaining spawning ground for the Atlantic cod. The construction of hundreds of turbines with miles of interarray cables will demolish this ecosystem. The developers chose Coxes Ledge for financial reasons; constructing turbines in shallow waters costs less.If offshore wind projects could actually mitigate climate change, one might reluctantly accept the destruction of this unique ecosystem. However, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the agency tasked with permitting these projects, acknowledges in their environmental impact statement that they will have \"no measurable influence on climate change.\" These projects will still require 100% capacity of backup electricity generation with natural gas power plants.Rarely discussed, the European experience demonstrates that offshore wind does not reduce reliance on fossil fuels, nor does it diminish carbon dioxide emissions. Instead, the intermittency of the wind causes traditional generators to operate inefficiently, producing less electricity with greater emissions.According to the citizens group Green Oceans, the offshore wind developer of the projects on Coxes Ledge, Orsted, has misled people about the impact. The company maintains two sets of visual simulations. The viewer cannot discern turbines in the publicly available version; yet, in the confidential version, one can. Moreover, the developers will not release 25 out of 51 technical reports to the public, including the emergency response plans, the air emissions calculations and even the economic benefits to Rhode Island.Why hide the economic benefits in a confidential, Freedom of Information Act-exempt appendix?It's a David-against-Goliath fight. Listen to the administration and they'll say we're helping Rhode Island meet its renewable energy mandate and that it's building a clean-energy future. Listen to the community leaders and you'll hear passionate opposition to the status quo, determination to fight the well-financed opposition and a desperate effort to save the ocean.Who do you believe?How can you afford not to take a second look?

But some Burning Man revelers said Sunday that their spirits remained unbroken.Organizers closed the festival to vehicles after one death was reported. Officials provided no details of the fatality.The annual gathering in the Black Rock Desert about 110 miles north of Reno attracts nearly 80,000 artists, musicians and activists for a mix of wilderness camping and avant-garde performances. Disruptions are part of the event's recent history: Organizers had to temporarily close entrances to the festival in 2018 due to dust storms, and the event was twice canceled altogether during the pandemic.More than a half an inch of rain fell at the festival site on Friday, disrupting this year's festival.\"We are a little bit dirty and muddy, but spirits are high. The party still going,\" said Scott London, a Southern California photographer, adding that the travel limitations offered \"a view of Burning Man that a lot of us don't get to see.\" More than half an inch of rain and possibly close to 1 inch fell this weekend in parts of northwest Nevada, which includes the area where the Burning Man festival was being held, said Mark Deutschendorf, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Reno.For the Reno area, which is about 141 miles south of the festival, the average rainfall for the whole month of September would be 0.21 inches, Deutschendorf said.\"Already, everywhere from Reno up to the Burning Man area, Black Rock, we've already exceeded that - and it's only three days into the month,\" he said. Rainfall for the area around the festival was ending on Sunday, he said. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nThe road closures came just before a large wooden effigy was supposed to have been burned Saturday night.

It's the plastic bottles the water comes in that are potentially harmful to our health and environment.The folks at the Mayo Clinic say we need to be concerned about BPA.Exposure to BPA, they say, is a concern because of possible health effects on the brain, behavior and prostate gland of fetuses, infants and children. The Food and Drug Administration suggests that very low-level exposure to BPA is safe; however, the agency is engaged in ongoing research. Sounds scary to me.Health issues are one thing, but the effect on the environment is another.According to the Environmental Protection Agency, in 2018, the U.S. generated nearly 36 million tons of plastic waste. This has been a problem for so long that Concord, Massachusetts, in 2012 became the first municipality in the nation to ban the sale of single-serving water bottles. San Francisco in 2014 implemented one of the strictest bottled water bans in the country by banning the sale of bottled water on public property.Extreme reactions? Perhaps, but 36 million tons of plastic waste is no small matter.If health and environment issues aren't enough to give us pause, consider that single-serve bottled water is not that great for our wealth, either. Do the math. It all adds up.Every day I fill my water bottle at least three times (it has a 24-ounce capacity). I find that I drink a lot more water just because this particular container is convenient, BPA-free and pretty cool, too. What do I like most about it? I don't have to tip it up to drink from it.Think of an adult \"sippy cup\" with a built-in straw and flip top.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n \n Caption: MARY HUNT \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hellish tree of heaven weeds out native plants\n\n September 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Cecelia Shilling; Capital News Service | Page: A4 | Section: News \n \n 688\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS, Md. - As the invasive spotted lanternfly continues to spread nationwide, its proliferation has highlighted an even more worrisome invasive species: the prolific \"stinking sumac,\" or tree of heaven.National Geographic referred to the tree of heaven as the \"hellish invasive species\" in 2021. It is a fast-growing deciduous tree that provides food for the spotted lanternfly, kills native plants and can cause severe damage to infrastructure.Since its introduction in Pennsylvania in the 1700s, the tree has been reported as invasive in at least 30 states, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.The tree, native to China and Taiwan, was commonly sold in nurseries by the 1840s, the CDFW said. Across the country, Chinese immigrants brought the tree to California during the gold rush in the mid-1800s, The U.S. Forest Service said.\"We have invasive plants from all over,\" said Mikaela Boley, University of Maryland Extension principal agent associate.\"They come to the United States or they come to an area they don't belong necessarily, and because they don't have any natural predators or competition, some of their growing habits make them able to proliferate very easily.\" The tree of heaven is often mistaken for native trees like the black walnut, but can be identified by its leaves and strange odor.\"The best way to identify it is by the foliage. It has very large compound leaves.\" said Christa Carignan, coordinator of digital horticulture education for the University of Maryland Extension.\"They basically look like a giant feather. There's this central stalk in the leaf, and then it has leaflets coming off of that central stalk. So it might have anywhere from 11 to 25 leaflets on a single leaf.\" Flowers or damaged foliage may smell like \"peanut butter that has gone bad,\" she said, and can be an effective way of identifying the trees.The biggest issue caused by the plant is how fast and aggressively it grows, threatening the habitat of native trees and wildlife, Carignan continued.The tree of heaven is allelopathic, which means it introduces deadly chemicals into the soil to effectively kill competing plants, but is also a high seed-producer that can withstand harsh growing conditions.The tree can cause severe damage to sidewalks and building foundations, according to the Purdue Landscape Report.\"This particular species is really good in urban environments,\" Boley said. \"They'll grow in a crack in the concrete.So they're very strategic about how they grow and unfortunately, they also happen to be the one of the preferred hosts for spotted lanternflies, which is another invasive species,\" Boley continued.Spanning 14 states since the insect was first found in the U.S. in 2014, including Maryland, the spotted lanternfly poses a threat to native plants and fruit crops like grapes. The Maryland Department of Agriculture says to squash and report the fly.Sudlersville farmer Jennie Schmidt has seen hundreds of spotted lanternflies in her buffer area between acres, where multiple trees of heaven grow, she said.\"What I'm looking at right now are actually two really small sapling trees of heaven that I sprayed with herbicides to kill,\" Schmidt explained, walking through her buffer area. \"And so I came up here just to see how they look and, even though they're dead, they're absolutely covered in lanternflies.\" The best way to kill adult trees of heaven is to use the \"hack and squirt\" method, Boley advised.\"You literally chop into the bark of the tree near the base, and then you squirt a herbicide that's rated for trees into those wounds and that should effectively kill without having to chop them down,\" she explained.Herbicides are needed to effectively kill the tree's root system and can be applied directly to smaller sprouts, Carignan said.Chopping down adult trees without this treatment could cause the root system to expand.The University of Maryland Extension recommends removing any trees of heaven to help control the spotted lanternfly population, but emphasizes the importance of correct identification. \n \n Caption: CECELIA SHILLING/CAPITA L NEWS SERVICE\n \nA tree of heaven sprouts from a sidewalk in downtown Annapolis.

    "content": "Pickering Creek Gets New Interpretive Panels - Life\n\n September 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 792\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Pickering Creek Audubon Center is a 450-acre nature center in Talbot County, which is open to the public daily with no admission for exploring on our trails.The center is a primary provider of outdoor science experiences for school systems on the Eastern Shore.Visitors to the Center on a daily basis use Pickering Creek's Farm to Bay Trail, which is 2.5 miles in length. The Farm to Bay Trail winds its way through cool season grass meadows, warm season grass meadows, brackish wetlands, freshwater wetlands, pine forest, emergent hardwood forest, mature hardwood forest and gives up close views of agriculture on Delmarva on a working farm.While exploring the habitats, about half of the trail borders agriculture fields while the other half borders brackish Pickering Creek.The trail affords a rare opportunity to experience most of the rural, coastal plain's habitats in one place coexisting with agriculture successfully. Interpretive panels along the Farm to Bay Trail tell the story of Delmarva's key ecosystems and species.In the fall of 2022, Pickering Creek received a grant from the Rural Maryland Council to support creation of new messaging and new artwork for nine interpretive panels. People visit places like Pickering Creek Audubon Center to learn, explore, find adventure, relax and exercise.Interpretive panels help give meaning to the visitors experience by telling the story of the land: past, present and future. Interpretive panels help draw connections between habitats, plants, wildlife and people.The panels highlight the key habitats along the Center's Farm to Bay Trail, which include forest, wetland, meadow, agriculture and brackish water creek. Through the panels we tell the story of key habitat features, flora and fauna through both concise written messages and compelling visuals. Panels help the visitor understand the interconnected nature of land and water on Delmarva.The panels replace aging panels that have been weathered by the sun and rain. None of the existing panels were replicated, so each of the nine panels shares a brand new story about the center, its wildlife and habitats. In addition to replacing existing panels, the new panels fill in spots along the trails that have not been previously highlighted.Over the course of the past year, center staff researched, designed, contracted fabrication and installed nine interpretive panels. At the Center's entrance parking area you will now be greeted by a timeline history of the center that explains its donation and evolution over time.New panels along the Farm to Bay Trail highlight songbirds in the woods, no till agriculture, the importance of forested buffers between land and water, fungi of the woods and birds seen on the creek.New panels along the Wetland and Meadow Trails highlight which amphibians you are likely to see and hear, the importance of milkweed in meadow communities, and bluebird boxes and their benefits.\"Pickering Creek is unique as a nature center in that we are also agricultural landowners. As the Olds Family who donated the center's core property wished we continued to highlight agriculture as part of the landscape on Delmarva while also sharing how conservation practices coexist with great habitat for wildlife,\" said Center Director Mark Scallion.Pickering Creek is open to the public daily during daylight hours. Check the center website for exact open times as evening daylight gets shorter this fall.There are several viewing platforms and blinds along the way for you to enjoy scenery and wildlife.Benches for resting are spread throughout the trails. The new panels join seven existing panels that have been installed in the last five years in both wetland and meadow habitats.Together they share the story of outdoor habitats and ecosystems and the creatures we share them with on Delmarva. \n \n Caption: Keep an eye out for mushrooms growing high on trees!\n \nSpecies like this Dryad Saddle (right) or Cracked Cap Polypore (above) can grow dozens of feet off the ground on standing snags.\n \n\"There is Fungus Among Us\" is one of the new interpretive panels.\n \nSome species of fungus grow directly in the ground. These species, like this Russula species (above), are seeking nutrients like nitrogen that are already in the soil and therefore don't need to grow on wood.\n \nLook around our forests and you'll find some kind of mushroom. Coming in all colors of the rainbow, most mushrooms are easy to see but they are only the fruiting body of the fungus or mycelium. Mycelium, which look like thin roots or strands of hair, help to break down organic material like leaves and wood for food which recycles the nutrients back into the soil for other plants!\n \nCheck fallen logs for mushrooms. Many mushrooms like the False Turkey Tails (right top) and Bonnet species (right below) can only grow out of dead wood so fallen logs and branches are crucial! \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A national treasure - Legislation moves forward to create Chesapeake National Recreation Area\n\n September 22, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 871\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - The Chesapeake Bay could see a boost in status under legislation introduced this summer to designate the region as a National Recreation Area.Sponsored by Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Maryland, the Chesapeake National Recreation Area Act would allow the National Park Service to oversee the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which covers over 60,000 square miles across six states and Washington, D.C.\"We know that the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and it's a global treasure,\" Van Hollen said in an interview with Capital News Service. \"We believe that by including this national treasure within the National Park Service system, we will ensure that it is protected in the future.\" Efforts to establish a Chesapeake National Recreation Area date back to the 2000s, when a study called for the bay to become a unit of the National Park Service. This year's legislation also comes amid attempts to mitigate the declining health of the Chesapeake Bay watershed and efforts to highlight lesser-known parts of bay history, including the contributions of Native Americans and Black watermen to the ecosystem and economy.The bill was created through a \"unique process,\" Van Hollen said. In 2021, in a practice uncommon among most lawmakers, he and Sarbanes created a working group to solicit feedback on what the legislation should look like.The bill is currently in committee but Van Hollen said a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers is \"determined to get it over the finish line\" by the end of this congressional session.Currently, the park service administers certain sites in the watershed, including those designated as national monument units. The Chesapeake Gateways program, established through federal legislation in 1998, allows the park service to partner with and provide assistance to local and regional organizations involved in the bay.But lawmakers are calling for the park service to play a larger and more administerial role, especially as they strive to tell previously-untold stories about the watershed's inhabitants.\"Right now, there's no entity whose mission is to help tell the stories of the Chesapeake Bay,\" Van Hollen said.\"If you look at the Chesapeake Bay, in many ways, its history is a microcosm of our American history so there are all sorts of stories.\" For Maryland residents like Vincent Leggett, whose families have been involved in those stories for generations as avid fishermen, shipbuilders and dockworkers, the bill offers the promise of highlighting history that's previously been passed over.Leggett is a member of Blacks of the Chesapeake - an organization that aims to highlight Black history in the watershed - which was part of the working group for the bill.\"African Americans, I feel, were the backbone to the maritime and seafood industries here in the Chesapeake Bay region, but our stories were not elevated, nor were they exposed through our own voices,\" Leggett said.Leggett hopes that expanding the reach of the park service in the region will also draw these populations into bay conservation. Only 7% of the state's bay shoreline is publicly accessible, he said, causing a \"sense of alienation\" for people of color in the region who can't get involved in cleanup efforts.According to the Chesapeake Bay Program, the main entity responsible for conservation and restoration of the bay, there are 1,296 public access points to the body of water across its six watershed states and Washington, D.C.The bill, if passed, would authorize the park service to administer additional landmarks in the Chesapeake Bay watershed - a step Van Hollen said would further improve public access to the bay.Blacks of the Chesapeake has worked with state and federal lawmakers in Maryland on several projects along the bay, Leggett said, including planning a heritage park at the historically-Black Elktonia Beach in Annapolis and ensuring that Black history is highlighted at Whitehall Manor, which was built by enslaved individuals.Some of these sites, if acquired by the park service, could become highlights of a Chesapeake National Recreation Area.The bill's sponsors also touted the legislation as an opportunity to create jobs and enhance Maryland's economy.\"By designating a unified National Recreation Area for the Chesapeake Bay, this legislation seeks to elevate the regional stories that shaped our nation's history, promote the spirit of stewardship, improve public access and spur economic growth across the bay region,\" Sarbanes said in an e-mail to CNS.The lawmakers have projected that turning the watershed into a park service unit will boost tourism in the region, augmenting its already-major role in the bay states' economies. In Maryland, recreational boating generates an average of $2.03 billion and 32,025 jobs each year, and wildlife-watching excursions generate over $600 million a year, according to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.Leggett said that the bill is an opportunity to foster these industries while increasing awareness of the bay's integral role in the region.\"I think that by bringing more attention to the Chesapeake Bay it just generates so many millions of dollars and employment opportunities and tourism,\" he said. \"I think that as we endeavor to improve the water quality of the bay, that is going to enhance the fisheries, it is going to enhance heritage tourism and all of the related businesses that surround it.\" \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY ANTHONY BURROWS/DNR\n \nRestoration of tidal marsh at Deal Island is one of numerous stories to be told about the Chesapeake Bay. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wink was the creator of last year's run and was happy to see this year's event get even more support from the community.\"Well, I used to be a runner, and heard about these kinds of events all over the country,\" Wink said. \"I thought that the Center's property, with the different trails that would really fit this kind of event.\"Her first job was to see if she could get the support of some brewers in the state. She sent each member of the Brewers Association of Maryland an invitation and was amazed to see there were over 100 members. The trail consisted of four different stops along the trail where runners were offered tastings of a variety of locally brewed beers.\"We wanted something low budget that wasn't too labor intensive,\" said Wink. \"I know there are a lot of beer drinkers in the area, so we moved forward with the idea.Participants weren't the average runners that participate in races across the state. \"This is definitely a whole different crowd,\" Wink said with a smile. \"Some run and some walk, not a lot of pressure.\"In advance of the run, the Center put out some \"all-in-fun training tips\" for participants with offerings like \"Jog over the toys, dog, cat on the living room floor, high-stepping it, with two beers in hand daily (lots of roots and obstacles on the run course)\" and \"hold five full beer glasses in your hands, sipping from each so you don't spill and high-step from living room to fridge for refill.\"The run made close to $15,000 last year. But money wasn't the whole reason for this kind of event. \"We wanted to get people of all ages awar of what we do and perhaps get more involved with our efforts,\" Wink said.Because of a health issue, Wink gave most of this year's event planning to volunteers Lynda Whitcomb and Pat Alquist. \"We started in March, because last year we only had two months to put everything together,\" said Whitcomb. Alquist, a former teacher, was the organizer, giving volunteers their marching orders and working with business supporters. \"We just can't thank them enough,\" Ahlquist said. \"There were so many this year.\"The Sweetak family from Millington were participants in last year run and were happy to be back. Jack Sweetak was there to ensure another first place finish from last year. \"I've got a strategy to win,\" said Sweetak. \"This year I've challenged my sister Grace to be the female winner. Lots of pressure.\"Parents Jackie and Drew Sweetak said the family has supported the Center since Jack and Grace, now young adults, were three years old. \"They have taken classes when they were young and then began volunteering, too,\" said Jackie Sweetak. \"We have lots of memories here.\"Jackie Paul brought family members to the event as well. \"We came last year, and had fun,\" Paul said. \"It's just an easy, nice day that gets our family to spend time together.\"The \"runners\" were called to the starting point with directions to put the serious runners up front, and the walkers and beer aficionados toward the back. As expected, the Sweetak siblings took the lead, but they did not stop for the beer until afterwards.\"This is a beer event,\" said Katie Lomax of Frederick who finished a few minutes after the Sweetaks. \"Why would I not stop and taste?\"After the run, participants and their families were treated to food, frozen delights, and of course, beer, enjoying the sounds of The Dan Heely Band.Dave Airel, President of the Center's Board of Trustees, said about the day, \"This is a fun day for a fun event that raises money-with an emphasis on fun.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nAnd they're off! runners begin to travel the tasting trail of this year's birds & brew run at the chesapeake bay environmental center. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Race is on to rescue historical shipwrecks\n\n September 26, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1069\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n MADISON, Wis. - The Great Lakes' frigid fresh water used to keep shipwrecks so well preserved that divers could see dishes in the cupboards. Downed planes that spent decades underwater were left so pristine they could practically fly again when archaeologists finally discovered them.Now, an invasive mussel is destroying shipwrecks deep in the depths of the lakes, forcing archeologists and amateur historians into a race against time to find as many sites as they can before the region touching eight U.S. states and the Canadian province of Ontario loses any physical trace of its centuries-long maritime history.\"What you need to understand is every shipwreck is covered with quagga mussels in the lower Great Lakes,\" Wisconsin state maritime archaeologist Tamara Thomsen said. \"Everything. If you drain the lakes, you'll get a bowl of quagga mussels.\" Quagga mussels, finger-sized mollusks with voracious appetites, have become the dominant invasive species in the lower Great Lakes over the past 30 years, according to biologists.The creatures have covered virtually every shipwreck and downed plane in all of the lakes except Lake Superior, archaeologists say. The mussels burrow into wooden vessels, building upon themselves in layers so thick they will eventually crush walls and decks. They also produce acid that can corrode steel and iron ships. No one has found a viable way to stop them.Wayne Lusardi, Michigan's state maritime archaeologist, is pushing to raise more pieces of a World War II plane flown by a Tuskegee airman that crashed in Lake Huron in 1944.\"Divers started discovering (planes) in the 1960s and 1970s,\" he said. \"Some were so preserved they could fly again. (Now) when they're removed the planes look like Swiss cheese. (Quaggas are) literally burning holes in them.\" Quagga mussels, native to Russia and Ukraine, were discovered in the Great Lakes in 1989, around the same time as their infamous cousin species, zebra mussels. Scientists believe the creatures arrived via ballast dumps from transoceanic freighters making their way to Great Lakes ports.Unlike zebra mussels, quaggas are hungrier, hardier and more tolerant of colder temperatures. They devour plankton and other suspended nutrients, eliminating the base level of food chains. They consume so many nutrients at such high rates they can render portions of the murky Great Lakes as clear as tropical seas. And while zebra mussels prefer hard surfaces, quaggas can attach to soft surfaces at greater depths, enabling them to colonize even the lakes' sandy bottoms.After 30 years of colonization, quaggas have displaced zebra mussels as the dominant mussel in the Great Lakes. Zebras made up more than 98% of mussels in Lake Michigan in 2000, according to the University of California, Riverside's Center for Invasive Species Research. Five years later, quaggas represented 97.7%.For wooden and metal ships, the quaggas' success has translated into overwhelming destruction.The mussels can burrow into sunken wooden ships, stacking upon themselves until details such as name plates and carvings are completely obscured. Divers who try to brush them off inevitably peel away some wood. Quaggas also can create clouds of carbon dioxide, as well as feces that corrode iron and steel, accelerating metal shipwrecks' decay.Quaggas have yet to establish a foothold in Lake Superior. Biologists believe the water there contains less calcium, which quaggas need to make their shells, said Dr. Harvey Bootsma, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's School of Freshwater Sciences.That means the remains of the Edmund Fitzgerald, a freighter that went down in that lake during a storm in 1975 and was immortalized in the Gordon Lightfoot song, \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" are safe, at least for now.Lusardi, Michigan's state maritime archaeologist, ticked off a long list of shipwreck sites in the lower Great Lakes consumed by quaggas.His list included the Daniel J. Morrel, a freighter that sank during a storm on Lake Huron in 1966, killing all but one of the 29 crew members, and the Cedarville, a freighter that sank in the Straits of Mackinac in 1965, killing eight crew members. He also listed the Carl D. Bradley, another freighter that went down during a storm in northern Lake Michigan in 1958, killing 33 sailors.The plane Lusardi is trying to recover is a Bell P-39 that went down in Lake Huron during a training exercise in 1944, killing Frank H. Moody, a Tuskegee airman.The Tuskegee Airmen were a group of Black military pilots who received training at Tuskegee Army Air Field in Alabama during World War II.Brendon Baillod, a Great Lakes historian based in Madison, has spent the last five years searching for the Trinidad, a grain schooner that went down in Lake Michigan in 1881. He and fellow historian Bob Jaeck finally found the wreck in July off Algoma, Wisconsin.The first photos of the site, taken by a robot vehicle, showed the ship was in unusually good shape, with intact rigging and dishes still in cabins. But the site was \"fully carpeted\" with quagga mussels, Baillod said.\"It has been completely colonized,\" he said. \"Twenty years ago, even 15 years ago, that site would have been clean. Now you can't even recognize the bell. You can't see the nameboard. If you brush those mussels off, it tears the wood off with it.\" Quagga management options could include treating them with toxic chemicals; covering them with tarps that restrict water flow and starve them of oxygen and food; introducing predator species; or suffocating them by adding carbon dioxide to the water.So far nothing looks promising on a large scale, UW-Milwaukee's Bootsma said.\"The only way they will disappear from a lake as large as Lake Michigan is through some disease, or possibly an introduced predator,\" he said.That leaves archaeologists and historians like Baillod scrambling to locate as many wrecks as possible to map and document before they disintegrate under the quaggas' assaults.At stake are the physical remnants of a maritime industry that helped settle the Great Lakes region and establish port cities such as Milwaukee, Detroit, Chicago and Toledo, Ohio.\"When we lose those tangible, preserved time capsules of our history, we lose our tangible connection to the past,\" Baillod said.\"Once they're gone, it's all just a memory. It's all just stuff in books.\" \n \n Caption: WAYNE LUSARDI\n \nThis Aug. 17, 2021, photo shows Quagga mussels cover the engine of a Bell P-39 Airacobra military plane in Lake Huron, Michigan, as maritime archaeologist Carrie Sowden, rear, documents the site.

The training covers topics including tree biology and proper tree planting techniques and concludes with an in-person tree planting.Thanks to these new tree stewards, 12 new natives are standing tall at Easton Point Park and more are on the way.\"Planting native trees improves water quality and reduces nutrient and stormwater runoff, shades impervious surface to better regulate water temperatures, and sequesters carbon in our atmosphere - and their benefits don't stop there,\" Chester Riverkeeper Annie Richards said. \"These trees, especially when planted in urban and developed areas, fill habitat gaps for birds and insects, keep our neighborhoods cooler, increase home values, filter our air quality and lower our energy bills.\" With funding from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and the Chesapeake Bay Trust, and an outstanding showing from this dedicated volunteer base, ShoreRivers has already worked alongside its Tree Stewards to plant a total of 300 native trees across our watershed. The 12 planted as part of the recently completed Tree Stewards training were the first of 1,000 that ShoreRivers has committed to planting in five urban centers in our watershed - Chestertown, Easton, Cambridge, Federalsburg and Denton - thanks to additional funding from the Chesapeake Bay Trust.If you know of a location that might be suitable for a native tree planting, please email mwhite@shorerivers.org. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nNewly trained tree stewards take part in a planting and training at Easton Point Park in September, where 12 new native trees were planted. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Could residents soon flock to a proposed bird sanctuary? - BIRDS\n\n October 5, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 8A | Section: News \n \n 922\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN - What to do with the agricultural property beside the wastewater treatment plant in Chestertown has been a topic of discussion lately among council members. Previous discussions explored expanding the solar panel field adjacent to the plant on John Hanson Road. There was even some talk about low-cost housing, but nothing determinate.Council member Tim O'Brien talked to the town's Tree Committee about turning the area into a bird conservatory back in May.Since then, he's been researching the idea, developing potential partners should the town commit to it.\"I think it could be a little jewel of a project. It's an exciting opportunity, and many people see it as very viable. The project requires very little for funding and administration,\" O'Brien said.O'Brien's referring to the two ponds at the facility located on the northeast side of John Hanson Road. They are settling ponds there, one called Montrose Farm pond, where waterfowl, shorebirds, gulls, and terns, congregate.The recent conversation being merely an introduction to the concept, Mayor David Foster made sure the public heard him say he's not agreeing to anything, not even in principle, of a bird sanctuary.\"I'm fully committed to exploring it, but don't interpret my interest in exploring, as a decision,\" Foster said.To introduce the concept to the council, O'Brien, at Monday's meeting, brought in Shore Rivers Community Engagement Director Darran White Tilghman, accompanied by Dan Small, field ecologist, and director of Natural Lands project for the Center for Environment and Society.Tilghman expressed eagerness to work with the town.\"This is the kind of project your nonprofit partners get excited about,\" she noted. She said it could be a passive recreation habitat, and could be a win for the native species there, while increasing the water quality in the area. Her proposal was for Shore Rivers and the Natural Lands project to use their existing resources to help the council advance the project so it's revenue-neutral or revenue-positive for the town.She said if approved, Small would be the expert in habitat, and Shore Rivers has on staff landscape architects and environmental engineers.Small said from his view there's 30 acres of bird habitat, and upon approval, he'd be in charge of native grass and wildflower meadows.Some other projects he's responsible for are North County park near Greensboro, and Sassafras park in Millington.He said as a member of the Maryland Birding Community, he knows people would be drawn to this area.Tilghman's request was simple.She asked for the town's consent to move forward, saying that right now there's no concept plan or contract.Shore Rivers would help fund the project, and she added it would not be exclusive to them, but would welcome the town to inform them who else to work with.But she needed a commitment from the council.\"We would like to be able to devote our staff time and resources and earmark some grant funding we are already holding for this project for FY25,\" she said.O'Brien requested the council support the project in principal,\" Hopefully we get Washington College in this as well, and they could use this opportunity for other research.\" He said they might even be able to track the impact of bird tourism in the area.But Foster said he's not agreeing to it, not even in principle, \"I'm not there yet,\" he said. Still Foster wants more information, exclaiming there are many projects to discuss in the upcoming months.\"I'm fully committed to exploring this. I'm personally not yet convinced this is the highest and best use of this public resource,\" Foster remarked. \"I was the river keeper on Chester River for three years. I spent 25 years with Environmental Protection. I'm not anti-birding, anti-environment, or open space.But we have a certain responsibility in terms of limited town resources.\" Council member, Tom Herz too said he would like more information before agreeing to anything. He said he would like to hear from the public and wondered how it would affect the businesses on that land as well.O'Brien reminded the council that it's in the comprehensive plan to dedicate having more publicly accessible green space.Council member Meghan Efland expressed excitement about the project. She said, in her history of the town, she hasn't seen anyone wanting to use the land for other purposes. \"I think this is a good idea.It could tie into the river trail and be connected with it, and bring it back into town on the other side. Hearing public input would be good though.\" O'Brien agreed saying, \"I'd like to have a public comment period and debate about it in a future meeting, because I don't believe we're prepared to state a position. We'd like the public to digest this and understand the concept.\" Tilghman said they would like to have an answer by the end of the year so they can prioritize for next year's budget. She said they have other projects in the pipeline they need to work on, and willing communities to partner with.The town's not ready to give Shore Rivers an answer, although most seemed interested in what was presented.Although the name's not too flattering, the Chestertown wastewater plant has one of the biggest species lists in Kent County, with 160 species, and is the number five ranked eBird hotspot for the county in terms of species seen, according to Birder's Guide to Maryland and DC. \n \n Caption: JAKUB FRYŠ/WIKMEDIA COMMONS\n \nThe Eastern Shore is home to a bevy of birds including eagles, hawks, seabirds (including pelicans), orioles, robins and others.\n \nDOMINIC SHERONY/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS\n \nA Scarlet Tangar \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Construction blamed for muddy runoff into Bay\n\n October 11, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Timothy B. Wheeler; Bay Journal News Service | Page: 5 | Section: News \n \n 2151\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Until recently, underwater grasses grew so densely near the mouth of Maryland's Gunpowder River that boaters say they had to skirt the sprawling vegetation to keep it from tangling their props.\"Down by Mariner Point, you would see a prairie there,\" said Ralph Comegna, who lives on a canal off the river in Joppatowne. \"You couldn't even kayak through it. You would see all kind of little fish and stuff in there, moving around. It was beautiful.\" No more. The grasses, which provide critical habitat for fish and crabs, have virtually disappeared, and once-clear water is now too murky to see below the surface.After heavy rains, it turns orange, as mud pours downriver.Submerged grasses gained ground or held steady last year almost everywhere in the Chesapeake Bay, except around the mouth of the Gunpowder River north of Baltimore. The once lush underwater meadows there shrank by 30%, leading scientists to speculate that some \"localized event\" caused the decline.Residents and activists say they know what did it. For more than a year, they have been complaining about muddy runoff fouling Foster Branch, a Gunpowder tributary in Harford County. The source appears to be a large housing development under construction called Ridgely's Reserve, where more than 100 acres were cleared of trees and all other vegetation in early 2022, exposing the soil to the elements.Despite repeated complaints and multiple citations ordering the developer to take corrective actions, the muddy runoff has persisted.Residents and activists fault the developer, but they also blame it on lax or ineffective enforcement by both the county and state.\"It seems like every time we call, there's an inspection, and they find the same things wrong,\" said Mike Horsmon, another Joppatowne waterfront resident.\"But the problem isn't going away. We would like something more to be done.This is going on 20-some months.\" CLOUDY WATERExcess sediment from muddy runoff is a major threat to the ecological health of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.Small particles of sand, silt and clay are washed off land by rainfall and snow melt.They cloud the water, blocking sunlight needed by submerged grasses, which then die. And as sediment settles out of the water, it can smother fish eggs and bottom-dwelling creatures.It also fills in waterways, requiring costly dredging to clear boating channels.On a per-acre basis, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, construction sites can generate the most sediment pollution of any land use - 10 to 20 times what might wash off farmland, for instance.The problem in Joppatowne is extreme but by no means uncommon, environmental advocates say.\"The pollution from this site is so bad you can see it from space,\" said Evan Isaacson, research director for the Chesapeake Legal Alliance, a nonprofit environmental law firm. \"But these massive blowouts happen all the time across the Bay watershed.It just so happened that this one is located immediately upstream of a large underwater grass bed that Bay researchers were studying and [where] we have a very active and vocal water keeper on top of things there.\" Inspectors in Maryland's largest counties and municipalities cited more than 3,400 erosion and sediment control violations in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, and nearly 3,200 building and grading violations, according to data reported to the Maryland Department of the Environment. Authorities temporarily shut down construction projects 649 times and levied a total of $1.8 million in penalties. They took violators to court just 43 times.Harford cited 252 sediment and erosion control violations during that period, the fifth most among the jurisdictions. It stopped work 19 times but levied no penalties.Maryland Department of Environment delegates inspection and enforcement of erosion and sediment control laws to the state's biggest counties and municipalities, including Harford.On 15 occasions in the past two years, though, a state inspector visited the Ridgely's Reserve development or the adjoining construction site for its sewer line.On all but two visits, MDE's inspector found the developer in noncompliance with state law requiring measures to prevent erosion and runoff during construction.SILT FENCESUnder state standards, developers are required to post fabric \"silt fences\" around a construction site's perimeter and install detention ponds strategically within it to contain muddy runoff. Once a site has been cleared, a contractor also is supposed to \"stabilize\" the bared soil within days by covering it with straw to cushion the erosive impact of raindrops. If left bare for any length of time, a site must be seeded with grass to help hold the soil in place.Failure to do so can easily overwhelm other control measures.While state law authorizes MDE to impose penalties of up to $100,000 for each violation - and in severe cases to take violators to court - state officials have let Harford County decide what to do about the violations at Ridgley's Reserve.\"We have been there side by side with them to make sure that the county is following [up] and taking the enforcement actions they need to,\" said Lee Currey, MDE's water and science administration director.Asked why problems keep happening, he said the development is a \"fairly unique site with some unique challenges.\" With nearly 400 single-family and town homes planned on 120 acres, It's a large development project with a lot of ground exposed at one time, Currey said.Plus, he noted, the soil is largely clay, which is prone to wash away and cloud water whenever it rains.MDE found issues in 2021 with Harford County's enforcement of erosion and sediment control laws. But last year, the state reviewed the county's performance again and noted \"improved implementation of inspection and enforcement procedures.\" Five or six times in the past year, and most recently in mid-September, the county has ordered construction temporarily halted at Ridgely's Reserve, each time for several days running, until specific violations were corrected. County officials also have twice levied $10,000 penalties this year against the developer, an unprecedented step for Harford. Half of the penalties had been paid as of mid-September.COUNTY EXEC FRUSTRATEDIn an interview, County Executive Bob Cassilly said he was \"very disappointed\" that the mud pollution has not been halted, despite repeated inspections, work stoppages and even penalties.\"It's frustrating,\" he added.\"I'm not at all happy with the developer here I suppose that maybe the amount of the fines isn't quite enough to make people behave as you'd want them to.\" On Sept. 22, according to Cassilly's spokesman, the county formally notified the developer that its grading permit could be suspended or revoked if issues continue.Local and regional managers with Forestar Group Inc., a Texas-based subsidiary of homebuilder D.R.Horton, which is developing Ridgely's Reserve, did not respond to requests for an interview or answer specific questions. Forestar spokesperson Jamie Brown instead provided a statement that the company is \"working diligently\" with the county and state \"to promptly and effectively address any and all issues.\" Some question why MDE has not used its more substantial enforcement powers to address the repeated violations. Cassilly said he's encouraged the state to do so.MDE's Currey said agency officials don't want to pile on more penalties for violations already cited by the county, but they are looking at whether other action could be taken.\"I think the ultimate responsibility falls to the state,\" said Joppatowne resident Bill Temmink, who has filed multiple complaints and repeatedly confronted county and state officials over muddy runoff from the Ridgely's Reserve site and the related sewer project. If MDE doesn't step up, he suggested perhaps the EPA should get involved.Gunpowder Riverkeeper Theaux LeGardeur said the state and county's handling of the persistent runoff problems is \"akin to wishing for compliance on one hand while letting a partially restored tributary of the Chesapeake Bay fill in on the other hand.\" The muddy plume at times has spread from the Gunpowder in Harford south to the adjoining mouth of the Bird River in Baltimore County, he noted.ENFORCEMENT SCRUTINIZEDMDE's water pollution enforcement has been a target of scrutiny and criticism for several years now, as legislators and environmentalists faulted the agency under Republican Gov. Larry Hogan for a lack of staff, lax inspection, slow enforcement and failure to update pollution permits.\"It's time that construction sites be treated the same as any other point source of pollution under the Clean Water Act and not some stepchild of this regulatory program,\" said Isaacson of the Chesapeake Legal Alliance, \"which is how it's been treated, with dramatically fewer agency resources dedicated to writing these permits or enforcing the law.\" The legislature has pressed MDE to hire more inspectors and permit writers, and funding for new positions was included in the current budget. Currey said his branch of MDE is now \"probably close to full strength,\" though at least some of the new hires may still be in training.Critics say they have yet to see results from the increased staffing.Activists also contend that the state's erosion and sediment control standards, last updated in 2011, are outdated and fail to account for the increasing intensity of rainstorms with climate change.What's more, they say, MDE relaxed the limit in 2017 on how much ground on a construction site could be cleared at one time, thus heightening the likelihood that big storms will overwhelm runoff control measures.\"The fact that Maryland law sanctions this is shocking,\" Isaacson said. \"We are literally permitting this outcome, shielding those responsible for it from liability for the damage they cause to others' property and to the public's cherished waterways and natural resources.\" Dion Guthrie, the Harford County Council member representing Joppatowne, said he's drafted legislation to reinstate the local restriction that limited clearing to 20 acres at a time, and the county executive said he supports it. In the 47 years he's lived on the water there, Guthrie said, \"I've never seen that water turn like that literally overnight\" after the housing project broke ground.DEVELOPMENT NEAR BAYResidents say Ridgely's Reserve exposes a longstanding flaw in Harford County's land use planning.The county established a \"development envelope\" in the 1970s that in large part encouraged growth along U.S Route 40, which borders the Gunpowder and Bush rivers and the Bay. Subsequent plans have doubled down on that concept.Cassilly acknowledged that focusing new construction and redevelopment on land so close to the rivers and Bay may have been misguided. But he said county leaders now are basically stuck with that growth envelope.MDE, meanwhile, has urged the developer to treat its detention ponds with flocculants to prevent or at least reduce the amount of sediment washing off the construction site. Flocculants are chemical agents that get tiny particles in water to clump together and settle to the bottom.The state has permitted the use of flocculants to control construction runoff since 2020, according to MDE spokesman, with 10-15 applicants seeking the agency's approval to apply them. Though flocculants can cause fish kills if they get into streams, Apperson said MDE has established standards for their safe and effective use and is unaware of any fish kills or other resulting issues.Residents say they're hopeful their complaints finally seem to be getting a response, at least at the county level.\"The water here, since this development, it's turbid all the time,\" said Joppatowne resident Comegna. \"Even when it doesn't rain, the water stays more cloudy than I've seen in years.\" While the water may clear up, the damage to the underwater prairie downstream may be long-lasting.Brooke Landry, a biologist with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources who chairs the Chesapeake Bay Program's submerged aquatic vegetation work group, said the aerial photos she's seen of the mud plume flowing down the Gunpowder from its confluence with Foster Branch are likely a factor in the dieback of grasses there.\"It'll take a long time for those grasses to grow back,\" she said.And even if the grasses do recover, they likely won't be as robust as before.\"We have lots of studies that show more developed watersheds lead to loss of SAV,\" Landry said.On Sept. 26, Temmink filed yet another complaint with the county and MDE after seeing Foster Branch turn orange again after light to moderate rainfall over the weekend.\"As I was walking around Mariner Point Park on Sunday, a family group was coming up from one of the piers,\" Temmink said in his email to officials. \"The young boy, 12 or so by my estimate, asked his parents a simple question, 'Why is the water that color?' \"I answered that it was because of a development upstream,\" Temmink said. \"We must do better.\" This story was originally published in the Bay Journal and was provided by the Bay Journal News Service. \n \n Caption: DAVE HARP/BAY JOURNAL\n \nRalph Comegna, a resident of Joppatowne, Maryland, points out where submerged grasses once grew in profusion in the lower Gunpowder River.\n \nCOURTESY OF GUNPOWDER RIVERKEEPER\n \nIn August 2022, a plume of orange, silt-laden water covers much of Maryland's lower Gunpowder River.

Although the Delaware Headwater river sites experienced their highest water temperature averages during the middle five-year period (2013-17), the Upper Nanticoke and Lower Nanticoke sites showed highest average temperatures in the most recent five-year block (2018-22).Higher water temperatures hold less oxygen, which can stress and kill fish and other life in our waters; they also fuel algal blooms, which can be dangerous for animals and humans and create a number of water quality issues.In addition, the report card includes results from the 2022 season. The Delaware headwaters scored highest of all regions, earning a B-.All other regions scored C+ or C.Although most regions were flat year-toyear, the alliance observed and measured disturbing changes at the Quantico Creek site during 2022. The site showed broad declines in every parameter except for dissolved oxygen.We saw continued issues related to excessive nutrients in the Rewastico Creek system.Both Quantico Creek and the Rewastico Creek are in the Lower Creeks region.The Nanticoke Creekwatchers Program began in 2007 with a short, pilot season.Since 2008, over 150 Nanticoke Creekwatchers, community scientists who collect water samples and take measurements directly in their adopted waterways, have participated in this program. The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control and the Chesapeake Monitoring Cooperative are also key program partners.Hard copies of the report card are available at the NWA's Vienna office and at outreach events. \n \n Caption: DCHS\n \nThe Brookview bridge joins the towns of Eldorado and Brookview, and spans the Marshyhope Creek in northern Dorchester County. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Note that Echo may move her cubs out of the den and around her habitat so they may be out of view at times.Animal care staff will leave Echo to bond with and care for her cubs without interference, but as opportunities arise, staff will perform quick health checks. During a recent weight check, staff confirmed there are three males and two females. The cubs appear to be strong, active, vocal and eating well.ABOUT ECHO AND HER CUBS· Five surviving cubs were born Sept. 12 (a sixth cub did not survive);· She is a second-time mom; Echo had a litter of four cubs in 2020;· Echo was born at White Oak Conservation in Florida in 2015;· There are two potential sires, either Asante or Flash; scientists will perform genetic testing to determine the sire when the cubs are old enough to have blood collected;· Echo is trained for ultrasounds, which allowed staff to determine she was pregnant July 28; and· The cubs' genetic data is important for population management as the cubs will eventually enter breeding programs.National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute is part of the Cheetah Breeding Center Coalition - a group of 10 cheetah breeding centers across the United States that aim to create and maintain a sustainable North American cheetah population under human care.These cubs are a significant addition to the Cheetah Species Survival Plan, as each individual contributes to this program. The survival plan scientists determine which animals to breed by considering their genetic makeup, health and temperament, among other factors. Since 2007, NZCBI has celebrated 81 cheetah births; the facility currently houses 30 cheetahs.Cheetahs live in small, isolated populations mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Many of their strongholds are in eastern and southern African parks. Due to human conflict, poaching, and habitat and prey-base loss, there are only an estimated 7,000 to 7,500 cheetahs left in the wild.The International Union for Conservation of Nature considers cheetahs vulnerable to extinction.To view the Cheetah Cub Cam, go to https://nationalzoo.si.edu/webcams/cheetah-cub-cam.ABOUT THE SMITHSONIAN's NATIONAL ZOOThe Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute leads the Smithsonian's global effort to save species, better understand ecosystems and train future generations of conservationists.Its two campuses are home to some of the world's most critically endangered species.Always free of charge, the Zoo's 163-acre park in the heart of Washington, D.C., features 2,100 animals representing 400 species and is a popular destination for children and families. At the Conservation Biology Institute's 3,200-acre campus in Virginia, breeding and veterinary research on 250 animals representing 20 species provide critical data for the management of animals in human care and valuable insights for conservation of wild populations.NZCBI's more than 300 staff and scientists work in Washington, D.C., Virginia and with partners at field sites across the United States and in more than 30 countries to save wildlife, collaborate with communities and conserve native habitats.

Wright Park in Preston, Oxford Cemetery, and the Presbyterian Church of Chestertown.At each community space, the established meadows will be highly visible and a welcome improvement to existing landscapes. They will serve to educate the community on the benefits of riverfriendly practices that function as native bird and pollinator habitat.The towns of Preston, Oxford and Chestertown can expect to witness the various stages of turf to meadow conversion. Early in the process, residents and visitors should notice less green as the current vegetation is removed to make way for seed planting in late winter.D uring the first two years of establishment, periodic mowing will occur to help reduce intrusion from invasive species. Around year three, the meadow will be humming with insects pollinating the colorful, seasonal flowers. Each of these projects will take time to complete, but will provide countless benefits both aesthetically and to native plant and pollinator habitat, and for climate change resiliency.In 2017, ShoreRivers developed its River-Friendly Yards program to inspire and empower residents to become environmental stewards of their own properties through direct action such as reducing turf grass, eliminating lawn fertilizer, planting natives, installing rain gardens, and increasing buffers along rivers, creeks, and ditches.A River-Friendly Yard mimics the natural environment to benefit water quality, native birds and pollinators, and our local ecosystem. The program now encompasses River-Friendly campuses, congregations, communities and roadsides.The Green Towns Grant program is funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region III, West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection and the Chesapeake Bay Trust, and supports the design and implementation of green streets, community greening and urban tree canopy projects that enhance livability in cities and communities.In addition to funding the conversion of these meadows, the program is providing funding for ShoreRivers to design multiple green infrastructure projects at St.Mary's Refuge of Sinners Church in Cambridge.To learn more about these, and other similar ShoreRivers projects, visit shorerivers.org/river-friendly-yards. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nShoreRivers is in the process of establishing perennial wildflower meadows at James T.

    "content": "Study documents shrinking ice shelves\n\n October 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 8 | Section: News \n \n 595\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Four dozen Antarctic ice shelves have shrunk by at least 30% since 1997 and 28 of those have lost more than half of their ice in that time, reports a new study that surveyed these crucial \"gatekeepers\" between the frozen continent's massive glaciers and open ocean.Of the continent's 162 ice shelves, 68 show significant shrinking between 1997 and 2021, while 29 grew, 62 didn't change and three lost mass but not in a way scientists can say shows a significant trend, according to a study in Thursday's Science Advances.That melted ice, which usually pens larger glaciers behind it, then goes into the sea. Scientists worry that climate change-triggered melt from Antarctica and Greenland will cause dangerous and significant sea rise over many decades and centuries.\"Knowing exactly how, and how much, ice is being lost from these protective floating shelves is a key step in understanding how Antarctica is evolving,\" said University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos, who wasn't part of the study.Scambos said the study gives insight into fresh water that's melting into the Amundsen Sea - \"the key region of Antarctica for sea level rise\" - that not only adds height to the ocean, but makes it less dense and salty.The biggest culprits were giant icebergs breaking off in 1999, 2000 and 2002 that were the size of Delaware, he said. The study looks at ice melting from warm water below.Ice shelves are floating extensions of glaciers that act \"like the gatekeepers\" and keep the larger glacier from flowing more quickly into the water, the study's lead author said.All told, Antarctic ice shelves lost about 8.3 trillion tons (7.5 trillion metric tons) of ice in the 25-year period, the study found. That amounts to around 330 billion tons (300 billion metric tons) a year and is similar to previous studies.But the overall total is not the real story, said study lead author Benjamin Davison, a glaciologist at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom.What's most important, he said, are the patterns of individual shelf loss. The new study shows the deep losses, with four glaciers losing more than a trillion tons on the continent's peninsula and western side.\"Some of them lost a lot of their mass over time,\" Davison said. \"Wordie is barely an ice shelf anymore.\" The Wordie ice shelve, which holds back four glaciers near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, had a big collapse in 1989, but has lost 87% of its remaining mass since 1997, Davison found. Neighboring Larsen A has lost 73% and Larsen B 57%. The largest of the Larsen ice shelves, Larsen C, has lost 1.8 billion tons of ice, about oneeighth of its mass.The biggest loss of all is in the Thwaites ice shelf, holding back the glacier nicknamed Doomsday because it is melting so fast and is so big. The shelf has lost 70% of its mass since 1997 - about 4.1 trillion tons - into the Amundsen Sea.The ice shelves that grew were predominantly on the continent's east side, where there's a weather pattern isolates the land from warmer waters, Davison said. The ice shelves on the east were growing slower than the shelves losing ice to the west.It's difficult to connect an individual ice shelf loss directly to human-caused climate change, but steady attrition is expected as the world warms, he said. \n \n Caption: CHRISTOPHER A.

The seawater that has crept up the Mississippi River in the summer and early fall of 2023 is a reminder that coastal communities teeter in a fragile land-sea balance.Fresh water is essential for drinking, irrigation and healthy ecosystems. When seawater moves inland, the salt it contains can wreak havoc on farmlands, ecosystems, lives and livelihoods.I am a coastal hydrogeologist and have studied water across the land-sea interface for 25 years. I think of seawater intrusion as being like a seesaw: The place where fresh water and salt water meet is the balance point between forces from land and forces from the sea.A push from the land side, such as heavy rainfall or high river flows, moves the balance point seaward. A push from the sea side - whether it's sea-level rise, storm surge or high tides - moves the balance point landward.Droughts or heavy use of fresh water can also cause seawater to move inland. As climate change and population growth stress freshwater supplies, one result will be more seawater intrusion.WHEN THE OCEAN MOVES UPRIVER The current seawater intrusion in the lower Mississippi River is due primarily to drought in the Midwest, which has reduced the river's volume.Both the magnitude of reduction in river flow and the length of time that the river is low influence how far upriver the salt water moves. As of Oct. 2, 2023, the saltwater \"wedge\" in the Mississippi had moved nearly 70 miles upstream from the river's mouth.This isn't the first time that low water on the river has allowed seawater to move inland. But as climate change raises sea levels and causes more severe weather anomalies, intrusion will become more common and will inch farther upstream.And the problem isn't unique to the Mississippi. In Delaware, seawater is traveling farther up small tidal streams during storms and the highest tides, flooding farmland and killing crops.In the Sundarbans of India and Bangladesh - one of the largest coastal mangrove forests in the world - seawater is intruding into the mouth of the Ganges River.The main causes there are upstream dams and water diversions from the river for irrigation and navigability, plus encroachment due to sea-level rise. Seawater intrusion could threaten many types of plants and animals in this UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is home to countless rare and endangered species.INVADING UNDERGROUNDAnother interface between fresh water and salt water at the coast is less obvious because it's underground.Many coastal communities draw their freshwater supply from groundwater - clean water that moves through pore spaces between grains of sand and soil.Groundwater doesn't just stop at the coastline: Under the ocean floor, the groundwater is salty, and somewhere between land and the ocean, there is an underground meeting point. It typically is landward of the coastline because salt water is denser than fresh water, so it has a greater force and naturally pushes in. But just as with a river, that interface moves when groundwater levels drop on land or water levels rise offshore.In groundwater basins of central and southern California, widespread pumping has caused groundwater levels to drop hundreds of feet in some areas. This is tipping the seesaw and causing groundwater from the sea to move far inland. Accessible groundwater has supported irrigated agriculture in these areas, but now the double hazard of reduced groundwater availability and seawater intrusion threatens crops like strawberries and lettuce.Seawater intrusion into groundwater is happening all over the world, but perhaps the most threatened places are communities on low-lying islands. Fresh groundwater is often the sole source of water for drinking and irrigation on small islands, and it exists in a thin lens that floats on top of saline groundwater.The lens can shrink in response to droughts, pumping and sea-level rise. It can also become salty from floodwater infiltration during storms or high tides.In the Marshall Islands, for example, a combination of sea-level rise and wave-driven flooding is predicted to make many islands uninhabitable by the end of the century.SHIFTING THE BALANCEAs salt water continues to encroach on freshwater systems, there will be consequences.Drinking water that contains even 2% seawater can increase blood pressure and stress kidneys. If salt water gets into supply lines, it can corrode pipes and produce toxic disinfection by-products in water treatment plants.Seawater intrusion reduces the life span of roads, bridges and other infrastructure. It has been implicated as a contributor to the Champlain Towers South condominium collapse in Surfside, Florida, in 2021. Seawater intrusion changes ecosystems, creating ghost forests as trees die and marshes move inland.Smart management can tip the seesaw back toward the sea. Limiting surface water extraction and groundwater pumping, or injecting treated wastewater into vulnerable aquifers, can increase the force pushing against intruding salt water.Constructing seawalls or maintaining healthy dune systems also can help hold seawater at bay, though these approaches protect only against saltwater flooding and infiltration at the surface, not underground. Pumping out saline groundwater or installing underground barriers can keep deeper salt water from moving inland.Being proactive is best, because once groundwater is contaminated, it's hard to remove the salt. If salt water does penetrate inland, communities can manage water quality by constructing desalination plants and switching to salt-tolerant crops.Another option is to let nature take its course. Allowing marshes to migrate inland can compensate for losses at the coastline as sea level rises. This preserves critical habitats, enhances flood protection and stores carbon at rates far exceeding most terrestrial ecosystems - dialing back the acceleration of climate change.Holly Michael is a professor of earth sciences at the University of Delaware.The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.

The INSR program aims to accelerate implementation of water quality improvements.The $9.6 million in grant awards will be leveraged by an additional $9.4 million in state and local matching resources for a combined impact of over $19 million.U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin said Team Maryland - himself and fellow U.S. Sen.Chris Van Hollen, both Democrats - are \"all-in\" to increase investments that restore the Chesapeake Bay.\"We have a national treasure, we have an international treasure in the Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in our hemisphere,\" he said. \"We recognize how important it is to our way of life here in Maryland, to our economy, to our environment.\" Programs funded by the grant awards highlight best practices, he said.\"Our farmers in Maryland are generally small business owners, and they understand that they have to be hungry to figure out better ways to do things,\" he said. \"And that's what this grant is about - best practices on how you're managing our environment and doing it in a cost-effective way so you can be successful business owners.\" Echoing Cardin, Van Hollen emphasized the importance of partnerships in restoring the Bay and its health for those who make their livelihood from it.\"Because of where we live, we all have a responsibility to be stewards of the Bay,\" he said. \"And it's not just to protect an ecological jewel - we also know that the health of the Chesapeake Bay is absolutely essential to the health of Maryland's economy.\" Acknowledging the number of ongoing restoration and protection efforts, he compared federal, state and local work in protecting the Bay to running up an escalator that's going down.\"The pressures on the Chesapeake Bay are constantly growing, so even as we invest in these programs, it can sometimes feel like we're running in place,\" he said. \"But the reality is that if we didn't do it, we'd be going back fast.\" Projects receiving funding in Maryland include the Delmarva Chicken Association's efforts to create cost-share programs to accelerate sustainable chicken farming practices, the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay's implementation and restoration of riparian forest buffers and The Nature Conservancy's utilization of the Delmarva Wetland Partnership to address barriers inhibiting wetland restoration in the Bay's watershed. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nMembers of Congress, federal agency representatives, local elected officials and community members pose with a $9.6 million check awarding funds to Chesapeake Bay restoration projects on Monday, Oct. 16. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Officials tout Bay education and funding bill\n\n October 19, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Shifra Dayak; Capital News Service | Page: A4 | Section: News \n \n 603\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - A House panel held a hearing Wednesday on a bill that would boost Chesapeake Bay restoration and environmental education programs.The Chesapeake Bay Science, Education, and Ecosystem Enhancement Act of2023, sponsored by Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Maryland, would reauthorize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Chesapeake Bay office for the first time since 2006.Congress has appropriated funds to the NOAA office each year, but an official reauthorization would allow the office to more efficiently carry out Chesapeake Bay restoration and monitoring initiatives, Sarbanes told the House Natural Resources Committee's water, wildlife and fisheries subcommittee.\"In recent decades, the health of the Chesapeake Bay has been negatively affected by nutrient runoff across the watershed, disappearing coastal and marine habitats and many other factors,\" Sarbanes said. \"That makes the passage of the Chesapeake Bay SEEE act all the more important.\"The bill would also enhance NOAA's interpretive buoy system, which collects data on water quality, weather patterns and more; enhance NOAA's aquaculture programs that aim to support marine habitats and workers in the seafood industry; and finance grants for hands-on environmental education in kindergarten through 12th grade classrooms in the region.This bill, introduced in the summer, \"could not come at a more critical time,\" according to Allison Colden, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation's executive director.\"There's still much work to be done,\" Colden said. \"To achieve meaningful and lasting restoration we need all of our federal partners at the table.\"Colden pointed to the NOAA Chesapeake Bay office's positive track record on oyster restoration projects, citing the bill as an avenue to continue such initiatives in the future by ensuring the office has financial stability.NOAA staff are working to restore oysters in 11 tributaries in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and have completed restoration across more than 1,900 acres, according to a tracker by the Chesapeake Bay Program.\"The scale of this work is really unprecedented,\" Carrie Selberg Robinson, the director of NOAA's habitat conservation office, said of the oyster conservation efforts. \"We want to continue to build upon our successes that we've had and continue this great work of oyster restoration into the future.\"Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Virginia, who co-sponsored the bill, also praised its potential impact on furthering oyster restoration projects.\"Large scale oyster restoration is really Mother Nature's filter in taking a lot of stuff out of the bay that would otherwise take years and years to do,\" Wittman said.The Chesapeake Bay SEEE Act comes amid other efforts this congressional session to restore the health of the nation's largest estuary.Sarbanes also sponsored a bill that would designate the bay as a national recreation area under the National Park Service. Wittman sponsored a bill that would fund conservation initiatives in the watershed, such as a pilot project to plant riparian buffers.The latest Sarbanes-Wittman bill includes provisions to instill stewardship values into students, allowing for bay restoration to continue in the longterm, witnesses told the subcommittee. If passed, the bill would continue to fund NOAA's Chesapeake Bay-Watershed Education and Training Program, which provides grants for environmental education in the watershed.Witnesses faced slight pushback on the bill from Rep. Cliff Bentz, R-Ore-gon - the ranking member of the subcommittee - who called for supporters to provide more specific metrics about the benefits of environmental education.Colden said that the Chesapeake Bay Foundation will provide the subcommittee with numbers ahead of further movement on the bill, but added that the positives of teaching children about caring for the bay are evident.\"We're building the workforce that can continue the work of Chesapeake Bay restoration,\" Colden said. \"It's so incredibly important to make that investment in our next generation of bay stewards.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

At each community space, the established meadows will be highly visible and a welcome improvement to existing landscapes. They will also serve to educate the community on the benefits of river-friendly practices that function as native bird and pollinator habitat.The towns of Preston, Oxford, and Chestertown can expect to witness the various stages of turf to meadow conversion. Early in the process, residents and visitors should notice less green as the current vegetation is removed to make way for seed planting in late winter. During the first two years of establishment, periodic mowing will occur to help reduce intrusion from invasive species. Around year three, the meadow will be humming with insects pollinating the colorful, seasonal flowers. Each of these projects will take time to complete, but will provide countless benefits both aesthetically and to native plant and pollinator habitat, and for climate change resiliency.In 2017, ShoreRivers developed its River-Friendly Yards program to inspire and empower residents to become environmental stewards of their own properties through direct action such as reducing turf grass, eliminating lawn fertilizer, planting natives, installing rain gardens, and increasing buffers along rivers, creeks, and ditches. A River-Friendly Yard mimics the natural environment to benefit water quality, native birds and pollinators, and our local ecosystem. The program now encompasses River-Friendly campuses, congregations, communities, and roadsides.The G3 Program is funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency Region III, West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, and the Chesapeake Bay Trust, and supports the design and implementation of green streets, community greening, and urban tree canopy projects that enhance livability in cities and communities.In addition to funding the conversion of these meadows, the program is also providing funding for ShoreRivers to design multiple green infrastructure projects at St. Mary's Refuge ofSinners Church in Cambridge. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF SHORERIVERS\n \nShoreRivers is in the process of establishing perennial wildflower meadows at James T.

Easton Utilities immediately reported these overflows to state and local health authorities and promptly treated the areas affected with lime to disinfect the surfaces around the points of discharge.Easton Utilities strongly urges the public and food service establishments to be mindful of what they release to the sewer lines.Only human waste and toilet paper should be flushed - disinfecting and \"flushable\" wipes and other items should be properly disposed of in the trash, not the toilet.These wipes and other items do not break down in sewer or septic systems and can damage the internal plumbing in homes as well.In addition, everyone should keep fats oil, and grease out of drains to prevent blockages or backups.\"Easton Utilities remains committed to the safe, sanitary removal of wastewater while minimizing the impact to our environment,\" said Doug Abbott, Easton Utilities' engineering, water and wastewater department manager.No customers were impacted by this event. While the Talbot County Health Department has confirmed there is minimal impact on public health, regulation requires a press release be distributed to notify the general public. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "What do manatees tell us about the Bay?\n\n October 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jeremy Cox; Bay Journal News Service | Page: 5 | Section: News \n \n 927\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When a Florida manatee swims into the Chesapeake Bay, it makes waves.Such was the case on Aug. 19, when one of the gentle giants was photographed munching on underwater grass in the St. Mary's River in Maryland near where the Potomac River meets the Bay. Another followed on Aug. 27, when a group of paddle boarders spotted a manatee trapped in a pound net at the mouth of the Rappahannock River in Virginia. (It was freed, unhurt, by a marine patrolman within hours.)Manatee sightings remain rare occurrences in Maryland and Virginia waters - rare enough that they generate a flurry of viral social media posts and news headlines. (Exhibit A: the manatee, nicknamed \"Chessie,\" that has captured the public's imagination with its multiple visits to the Bay, beginning in the mid-1990s.)Scientists don't have enough data to say whether the whiskered marine mammals are visiting the region more frequently. But many believe it's only a matter of time.\"You can mark my words and come back to me if I'm wrong. I think you'll see more before you see fewer,\" said Ruth Carmichael, a marine ecologist with the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama. She has been collecting reports of manatee observations across the southeastern U.S. for more than 15 years. \"We're seeing the same patterns in Mississippi and Texas and going up to North Carolina.\"Scientists don't conduct formal surveys of manatees' presence the Chesapeake region. But one measure suggests that an average of at least one per year ventures into the estuary.Since the National Aquarium in Baltimore began keeping records in 1991, it has documented 39 manatee sightings in Maryland waters - either in the Chesapeake or the Atlantic Ocean. To qualify as an observation, the report must be accompanied by a photograph, said Kate Shaffer, who oversees the facility's animal rescue program.But there might be more in the future. Carmichael and other scientists point to a potential collision of three trends: a decades-long upswing in the species' Atlantic population, a decline in water quality off Florida's East Coast and warming waters tied to human-caused climate change.The Florida manatee, also called a sea cow, was one of the first creatures to receive protection from the federal Endangered Species Act after it went into effect in 1973. Efforts to shield the manatees from boat collisions helped the population rebound from barely 1,000 individuals in the mid-1970s to more than 6,000 by 2017.That year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service downlisted the species from endangered to threatened.It's only natural for manatees, especially males, to expand the boundaries of their range as their numbers increase, Carmichael said.Some have been tracked as far north as Cape Cod, MA, in recent years.\"Those animals have to go somewhere, and we know there's the concept of carrying capacity,\" she explained.But that biological success story has hit a major snag. Since December 2020, about one-quarter of the species' population has died during what federal wildlife officials have dubbed an \"unusual mortality event\" along the East Coast of Florida.Worsening water quality appears to be at the center of the phenomenon, researchers say. Excessive nutrients spilling off lawns and farms are fueling the growth of a toxic form of algae, known as red tide, that is fatal to manatees. Such nutrients are also nourishing another type of algae bloom that has wiped out thousands of acres of seagrass, one of the manatee's primary food sources. Many have starved.Such pressures are likely to push manatees farther northward, research has suggested.The Chesapeake Bay's underwater grasses are proving to be an inviting refuge, said Jamie Testa, a dolphin researcher with the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science and former marine mammal stranding coordinator for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.\"We expect they find seagrass to eat in Chesapeake Bay and head back to the Southeast before water temperatures get too cold\" around mid-October, she said.Manatees begin showing signs of cold stress when water temperatures dip below around 68 degrees.So, with a typical thermometer reading of 48 degrees in February, the Chesapeake Bay is highly unlikely to become a year-round residence for sea cows, experts say.\"I don't really see that yet,\" said Dan Slone, a Florida-based manatee researcher for the U.S. Geological Survey. \"Maybe in centuries.\"But warming water could widen the Bay's visitation window, making sightings likelier both earlier and later in the season, Carmichael said.For now, encounters in the Bay region still tend to induce astonishment. \"I was surprised to see a manatee up here,\" said Neil Gunter, the state marine police officer who responded to the Rappahannock report. \"In fact, I didn't believe it when the call came in.\"Their presence, though, is nothing new in the Chesapeake, Slone said.The first recorded manatee sighting in the region was in Virginia in 1676, he said.\"I just want to stress how unremarkable it is,\" Slone said of this summer's reports. \"Can we say this is a new behavior that is changing what manatees are doing? I would say not in the absence of any new data.\"Officials and researchers urge the public to keep manatees at a distance and not to disturb them. They remain protected by the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act.In Virginia, sightings can be reported to the Virginia Aquarium at 757-385-7575. In Maryland, reports of live manatees should go to the National Aquarium at 410-576-3880, while carcasses should be called in to the state Natural Resources Police at 410-260-8888.Jeremy Cox is a Bay Journal staff writer based in Maryland.

The MDE has a process to review submissions and forward them on to the Maryland Department of the Environment for final approval.The landfill, titled the MidShore Level Three, is a result of an agreement between Queen Anne's, Caroline, and Talbot counties in the 1980's to alternate the operation of landfills for a period of 20 years, with Kent County joining the agreement in 1992.The Talbot Mid-Shore Level One and the Caroline MidShore Level Two have already been in operation. Queen Anne's County is set for Level Three beginning in 2031-2050. The county had identified the proposed landsite in 1993, behind the closed Centreville landfill.The Oct. 4 meeting was an information session only. Held by MDE and the landfill owner's engineering consultant GeoSyntec, attendees learned the county had confirmed the project had all necessary zoning and land use approval and that it conformed to the county's 10-year solid waste plan.The total site is 124 acres, with the landfill at 62 acres and the maximum elevation at 240 feet. The landfill will receive household refuse, solid waste from businesses, bulky waste, land clearing debris, and construction waste.The project is just in Phase I of five phases that would span seven years. There will more geological investigation of the site by an accepted engineer, and the findings will go to the MDE, State Department of Natural Resources, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Maryland Health Department All documentation will be available on the MDE website and at the Centerville Library.County Commissioner Jack Wilson, who attended the Oct. 4 meeting, said he was open to a public meeting. \"This is something the commissioners inherited from 1993, just like you,\" Wilson said. \"I'm for being transparent.\" He told the attendees that Queen Anne's County has also been talking to the Caroline County government about keeping the present landfill for another 12-15 years. \"We're going through the steps we have to at this time.\"County Administrator Todd Mohn said the landfill is included in the present county comprehensive plan and in the 10-year solid waste plan and as such \"has been open to public comment each time.\"Mohn also noted the county knew 30 years ago \"our landfills could not be another New York City.\"\"As a region,\" said Mohn, \"we knew that we would need to have something sustainable. We had to join forces. Talbot County went first, Caroline County then took their turn. They obviously have citizens who live near the present landfill that may not want to see it another 12 years.\"Shrewsbury Farm resident Anna Queller disputed the proposed landfill meets the county's solid waste plan requirement. Reading from the 2015 solid waste plan, she said when addressing the new landfill that \"the county's offices of planning and zoning and waste management should conduct a preliminary review of the site.\"Attendees questioned whether the county had followed its 2020 Comprehensive Plan which dictated that site must be 1500 feet from a residence and 2500 feet from a portable well.\"There's no way,\" said Queller. Resident William Kyle was most concerned with the scope of the proposal. \"When I went over the Bay Bridge, I measured the height elevation as being 212 feet. This proposal has the height of240 feet. You wouldn't be able to see anything else in the county.\"After hearing the concerns of residents' comments, MDE presenter Andrew Grenzer said, \"Maybe the county needs to look at this again. But I'm not going to say here that their letter of confirmation is wrong.\"At the commissioners meeting on Oct. 10, Keith Palmer, a geologist who lives close to the location, told commissioners, \"If you took a map of Queen Anne's County and chose a location for the landfill, the Centreville spot would be the last choice. It should be a 'do no harm' policy- not where you will impact people, not where you will impact drinking water, not where you will impact traffic. It's the head of the estuary Island Creek which feeds into the Chester River.\"Shrewsbury Farm resident Brad Dutton assured commissioners his home is well within the 2500 feet line. \"As a parent, I try to instill a set of values in my kids. If they make a mistake, they stop, correct it, and make it right. I believe that moving forward at this point is a mistake.\"\"We're not going away,\" Anna Queller told the commissioners. \"The land that the county purchased for the landfill 30 years ago has changed.\" \n \n Caption: Shrewsbury Farm resident Anna Queller asks questions about the county's confirmation letter to the Maryland Department of the Environment for a new landfill in Centreville. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "On the river - Heritage Trail on Chester River aims to improve access, promote history, fishing, boating\n\n October 26, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Will Bontrager; wbontrager@chespub.com | Page: 28 | Section: News \n \n 632\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN - The Chestertown Heritage Trail is a project aimed at improving public access to the picturesque wetlands along the Chester River. It's rooted in the Chestertown Comprehensive Plan which, among other things, emphasizes the need to have more publicly-acces-sible land.Throughout history the river played a pivotal role for Native American communities, European settlers, and for both free and enslaved Africans - while also a critical asset to the region's agricultural economy.In the proposal letter sent by the Chestertown Council to the Kent County Commissioners, that sentiment is echoed. \"Today the Chester River remains an integral part of the community, supporting recreational, educational, and economic activities like boating, fishing and crabbing,\" it stated.As of Oct. 11, the Council requested from the County, $350,000 to initiate Phase 1 of the Chestertown Heritage Trail plan. If approved, sections will be designed to cross wetland areas near the Washington College pavilion and the area south of the Armory site at 509 S Cross Street, Chestertown.The first phase involves detailed engineering, design and construction of the initial trail section. The 1,000 foot-long section consists of a bike and walking trail along with an observation platform for optimal river viewing.With the goal of creating an \"environ-mentally-conscious and aesthetically pleasing trail,\" the project team will ensure all safety and accessibility measures are met.The initial drawings and designs can then be carried into future designs. Phase 2 seeks to expand public access along the wetlands, with a focus on recreational and educational opportunities.For example, the trail will be co-located with the site ofWashington College's Semans-Griswold Environmental Hall, which is a regional hub for research.Washington College's Chief of Staff and Vice President for Planning and Policy, Victor Sensenig said the trail also fits into their plans as well.\"We see it as fulfilling the long-term goals for the college's waterfront, and the public accessibility component of the project supports one of the goals of our new strategic plan, which calls for strengthened relationships with the town, county, and region.\"He added over the last decade, the college has made significant investment in a beautiful waterfront campus, and expressed enthusiasm about the prospect of welcoming more of the community to enjoy that space.In that space, during Phase 2, more trails can be added, beyond the Armory, to Radcliffe Creek. Ultimately, plans are to connect the Heritage Trail with the Rail to Trail network, known also as the Gilchrest Rail Trail.The council's proposal also notes opportunities for public art installations, scenic viewpoints, and educational elements integrated throughout.H erz said earlier in the year, the commissioners supported the project. He's hoping they'll do so again.In the request to the County, Herz included a letter dated March 2, to U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, detailing the Kent County Commissioners' support of the trail project -$750,000 was requested at that time. In that letter, the County appreciated the importance of public waterfront access as well as any economic development it could bring.That original request was denied by Cardin, said Herz, but they were encouraged to re-apply.Now for a lesser amount, the Council is hopeful of the proposal being included in the 2024 state legislative agenda.Some potential funding sources include: Community Parks and Playground grants, Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, Program Open Space, and the Rural Legacy Program.The next milestone date, Herz said, is Oct. 24 on which day Council will offer an in-person presentation of these materials to the county commissioners.H erz sees the importance of the project, \"The Chestertown Heritage Trail represents a significant step toward enhancing local access to the Chester River, creating opportunities for connection to nature, appreciation of our heritage, and enjoyment of the scenic beauty the Chester offers.\" \n \n Caption: The Chestertown Heritage Trail Legislative Bond Initiative Proposal.\n \nA glimpse of the proposed scenic trails planned beside the Chester River. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Biologist uncovers 1640 shark attack - Incident in St. Mary's River documented centuries ago by Jesuit priest\n\n October 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Reid; mreid@somdnews.com | Page: 2 | Section: News \n \n 898\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Peter Benchley's 1974 novel \"Jaws\" brought shark attacks to the forefront of conversation, but such attacks on humans have been going on for a lot longer than that.Local biologist Kent Mountford has found evidence of one such attack in the St. Mary's River in 1640 and, together with Dr. Richard Fernicola, published a paper on May 1 titled \"Earliest Recorded Human Death from a Shark Encounter in North America.\" Mountford happened across the account of the attack while going through papers from Jesuit priest Thomas Copley, who sent annual correspondence to Rome from 1637 to 1640 with updates on missionary efforts.\"I stumbled across this thing in the 1640 letter,\" Mountford said.In the paper, Mountford explains there was a severe drought in the summer of 1640, which \"lowered river flows and raised salinity in both the Potomac and St.Mary's rivers, making saltiness there two-thirds that of coastal ocean water and encouraging visitation from many different fish species.\" Perhaps because of this, one man decided to cool off in the river on or about Aug. 15, 1640, about a mile or so south from where the Maryland Dove is currently moored in Historic St. Mary's City.Mountford said the man, whose name or age is unknown, was then attacked by a shark in about waist-deep water.Copley wrote,\" scarcely had he touched the water when a huge fish having suddenly seized the wicked man, before he could retreat to the bank, tore away at a bite, a large portion of his thigh, by the pain of which most merited laceration, the unhappy wretch was in a short time hurried away from the living.\" Curiously, Copley wasn't too upset at the death of the man, who had avoided conversion to Catholicism, according to the account. In addition, the man had also occasionally smoked his rosary beads, which at that time were made with nuts and seeds.Copley wrote he believed this was clearly \"divine justice bringing it about that he, who a little while before boasted that he had eaten up his 'Ave Maria beads' should see his flesh devoured, even while he was still living.\" The species was not identified, but Calvert Marine Museum Curator of Paleontology Stephen Godfrey said it's \"not unreasonable to say that it was probably a bull shark.\" Godfrey explained there are several reasons why it is the likely culprit.\"Their kidneys are pretty good at getting rid of excess water so they're very good at retaining salts so they are able to live in brackish water and navigate far up freshwater rivers,\" he said. \"And they're aggressive. I believe they also have the highest levels of testosterone of any shark, so they are given to aggressive behavior.\" Godfrey, who said an 8-foot bull shark was landed under the Gov. Thomas Johnson Memorial Bridge last year, said the species doesn't have good eyesight, \"so they don't have a great range of vision and that combination will make them bump into all kinds of things to assess its palatability.They're not very discriminate when it comes to ingesting all kinds of things.\" Mountford added that \"statistics indicate that 50% of the sharks that are known to be in the Chesapeake Bay are already bull sharks.\" Because of the size of the 1640 bite, Mountford and Godfrey dismissed a barracuda, a tropical toothy fish that has never been seen in the area.\"Most shark bites on humans are misidentification accidents, and some sharks first bump or nudge their prospective prey, then take a test bite,\" Fernicola wrote in the paper. \"This event appears unprovoked, a probable 'sneak attack' with predatory intent. Coming onshore with afternoon light overhead, the shark's solitary target is visible, accessible and possibly splashing.\" There have been other instances of shark attacks in the Chesapeake Bay as well.According to Wikipedia, William McFlood fell off a schooner in Tangier Sound in 1906 and \"his body was found a week later, nearly bitten in two.\" A bull shark was suspected in that case as well.Mountford is working on a paper with Fernicola of shark occurrences and interactions in the Chesapeake Bay, and has about 200 interactions.\"It's a little bit of 'gotcha' because people have been saying there's been no shark attacks in the Chesapeake Bay, and you can see there have been,\" Mountford said.But Godfrey said those wanting to take a dip in the Chesapeake Bay should still do so.\"Don't change your behavior about what you're going to do in the Chesapeake Bay,\" Godfrey said. \"You should be more concerned about the jellyfish and [bacteria].\" \n \n Caption: MICHAEL REID/SOUTHERN MARY LAND NEWS\n \nBiologist Kent Mountford of Lusby points in the general direction of where he believes a shark attacked occurred in the St. Mary's River in August 1640.

    "content": "Annual banquet on track to raise more funds for waterfowl\n\n October 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 3 | Section: News \n \n 485\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - Dorchester Ducks Unlimited will be holding its 52nd annual banquet and auction on Saturday, Nov. 4 at Minnette Dick Hall in Cambridge.\"Our committee has been working very hard in these economic hard times to acquire donations,\" Chapter Chairman Terry Robbins said. \"We've come a long way since a group of local friends, hunters and conservationists got together in a Cambridge backyard to start what is now a very successful chapter.\" The Dorchester chapter has repeatedly received the Maryland Award for Best Net to Gross Dinner.\"We do that by getting everything that we auction donated or underwritten\" Robbins, whose late father, Lee Brohawn was one of the founding members of the chapter, said.Donations are still needed to ensure a successful dinner.The auction and silent auction will have guns, handmade items, and fishing and hunting trips.Old Salty's from Fishing Creek will cater the dinner.The buffet dinner will include their famous crab cakes, baked chicken, ham and, of course, lots of sides and their pies and rolls.Ducks Unlimited is a 501©(3) non profit organization that depends largely upon donations from individuals and corporations.The money made at the banquet will provide valuable funding for wetland conservation.Last year's Dorchester Banquet netted over $30,000 for Ducks Unlimited. It received the \"President's Elite\" status for 2022, which is given to chapters who raise $100,000-$249,000 in total fundraising, including membership money.Most of the money raised at Maryland events comes back to Maryland for waterfowl projects on private and public land.In Maryland, 54,308 acres have been restored to provide winter feeding grounds for wild ducks and geese and all sorts of waterfowl and wild game.Over 5,500 of those acres are in Dorchester County.\"Ducks Unlimited is not just an organization so that hunters can have more ducks to shoot,\" Robbins said. \"They truly care about the land and habitat and trying to find a long term cure to the declining waterfowl and wildlife populations.\" Ducks Unlimited has over one million supporters.Currently, there is money available in Maryland to place ponds and impoundments on private property through various programs.Ducks Unlimited is the largest and most effective waterfowl conservation organization in the world. Since the inception of Ducks Unlimited in 1937, its projects have been responsible for more than 15 million acres of restored, protected and enhanced wetlands and other wildlife habitats.Wetlands are nature's most productive eco-systems, but the United States has lost more than half of its original wetlands and continues to lose more than 100,000 wetland acres every year. Maryland chapters raised $1,084,784 last year, which is a state record for Maryland.For more information about Ducks Unlimited or for tickets to attend the annual banquet, contact Terry Robbins at 410-463-1011. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF TERRY ROBBINS\n \nFrom left, Tammy Burns, Lesley Jackson, Terry Robbins, Mark Robbins and Kathy Abbott display some of the items that will be auctioned at the 52nd annual Ducks Unlimited Banquet. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The fee will continue the funding that benefits them.It's bittersweet that they're closing it down, but we understand,\" Taylor said.\"People aren't collecting the stamps like they used to.I've always enjoyed painting waterfowl, and (the contest) is a great tradition. I think 50 years is the right time for it to stop; it's a good anniversary milestone.\" Judges of this year's contest were \"all avid waterfowlers, conservationists, biologists and law enforcement people that have been involved in the migratory game bird waterfowl industry for many years - and possibly our best judging panel that we've ever had experience-wise,\" said contest emcee Chris Markin, program manager for Maryland DNR's Information and Hunting R3 program.Judging the entries in three rounds were Donnie Satchell of Trappe and four from Dorchester County: Wade Henry, Donald Webster, Bill Harvey and Frank Sutton.They cast secret ballots in three rounds of judging.Looking on were several spectators, including Chuck Black of Belgrade, Montana, winner of the Federal Duck Stamp Art Contest. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nMaryland Migratory Game Bird Stamp Design Contest winner Jim Taylor, right, is congratulated by Chuck Black, winner of the Federal Duck Stamp Art Contest.\n \nCONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nJim Taylor, left, winner of the 50th and final annual Maryland Migratory Game Bird Stamp Design Contest, poses for a selfie with Patrick Vincenti. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "All The Leaves Are Red, Yellow, and Orange - Top U.S. Destinations For Leaf Peeping And Other Fall Adventure\n\n November 16, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Pollick; Wealth Of Geeks | Page: 4A | Section: News \n \n 950\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The pumpkin spice lattes are flowing, and post-Halloween pumpkins are getting chunked.But there's still interest in family road trips, especially to destinations where the annual changing of the leaves is at its peak.A study by lawn care specialist LawnStarter reveals the top states for leaf peeping and other fall-related activities. Beyond Oktoberfest and Halloween, many cities offer harvest festivals as local crops come into season. Others organize arts and crafts shows or music festivals, while local wineries debut their latest releases.The allure of fall foliage may put cars on the road, but the states on LawnStarter's shortlist have found creative ways to reward visitors for their interest.TOP FIVE STATES FOR VIEWING FALL FOLIAGECaliforniaCalifornia ranks at or near the top in virtually every metric used in the LawnStarter study. It has the most national parks, the most scenic drives, and the most Fall-related attractions. Outside of Sacramento, Apple Hill features over 50 local farms and a fall festival with apple cider donuts and u-pick pumpkin and apple venues. The Napa Valley is famous for its fall foliage, along with wine tastings and grape stomping adventures.New YorkOne measurement used in the LawnStarter study was the number of peak days for the leaf-watching season. New York ranked highest, with a total of 31 days of ideal leaf peeping available. New York is also home to the Finger Lakes, renowned for their cideries. Other points of interest include the Adirondacks and the Catskills for hiking and historical towns such as Sleepy Hollow for ghost chasing.WashingtonWashington State's mountainous and forested terrain offers adventurous foliage seekers over 12 weeks of peak viewing time. Besides a generous number of hiking trails and national parks, visitors to Washington State can also visit the alpinethemed village of Leavenworth for its Autumn Leaf Festival and enjoy adult beverages at local wineries.MichiganMichigan's extended foliage viewing season of 12 weeks makes it very appealing for Midwesterners who seek a more local destination than coastal states. Michigan also has a high number of cideries, ranking second overall in the Lawn-Starter study. A scenic drive north of Harbor Springs is known as the Tunnel of Trees and offers travelers breathtaking views of hardwood trees and their colorful leaves. The Pumpkin Train is another popular Fall-related attraction located in western Michigan.PennsylvaniaPennsylvania's abundance of undeveloped forests helps land it in the fifth position on the Lawn-Starter survey. The view of tree-covered hills and rolling pastures has enticed visitors for literally hundreds of years. The Pocono Mountains host the annual Jim Thorpe Fall Foliage Festival, a ghost tour, and a scenic train ride.THE BEST TIME TO GO LEAF PEEPINGWhile the first leaves may start to change as early as mid-September, the peak Fall foliage season doesn't generally arrive until the middle to late part of October, when air temperatures also begin to drop in many regions. The most colorful part of the transition is often over by Thanksgiving, as leaves fade to brown and trees become bare.Min Park, Ph.D., Academic Program Coordinator School of Sport, Recreation, and Tourism Management at George Mason University, says, \"In general, fall foliage peaks in most parts of the nation in mid-October through mid-November.Some mountains in the northwest are often at their most colorful in mid-September to early October.\"As I live in Virginia, Virginia's Shenandoah National Park is one of the best for fall colors. The best time to experience gorgeous fall colors in Shenandoah National Park is in October. Visitors can make the scenic cruise along the 105-mile-long Skyline Drive, which offers 70 overlooks where travelers can hop out of the car for a better view of foliage with red, yellow, and orange leaves.\".FALL FESTIVALS AND OTHER ATTRACTIONSEven if fall foliage is not at its peak or travel options are limited, there are still many Autumnal activities individuals and families can enjoy. In many areas of the country, the temperatures and climate are still favorable for camping, hiking, and attending outdoor festivals.Rosa Abreu, Assistant Professor, Hospitality Management, New York City College of Technology, offers her suggestions for a satisfying fall-related excursion. \"Stay in a place that has a fire pit and roast marshmallows. Have a few drinks by the fire. Go glamping. Pumpkin and apple picking is always fun.\" Other fall-related festivals and destinations you might want to check out include: Morton Pumpkin Festival, Morton, Illinois The village of Morton, Illinois, produces almost all of the canned pumpkin products in the international market. The village considers itself to be the pumpkin capital of the world and celebrates annually with the Morton Pumpkin Festival in September.Salem, Massachusetts, Haunted ToursThe small coastal city of Salem, Massachusetts, has become a popular fall destination because of its association with the Salem witch trials. The city hosts several festivals throughout the fall season and guided tours of local landmarks.Vermont's Sugarhouses and Maple SyrupThe state of Vermont supplies over half of the country's maple syrup, and the fall months are the best time to watch the process unfold. Numerous sugarhouses in Vermont provide guided tours of their facilities, and guests also enjoy a taste of small-town New England life.World's Largest Corn Maze, Spring Grove, Illinois Corn mazes, hayrides, and harvest festivals are always popular destinations for families, and Richardson Farm in Spring Grove, Illinois, offers over 9 miles of hayride trails and mazes on its 28-acre cornfield.This article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n \n Caption: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/FLEMMING CHRISTIANSEN\n \nThere are plenty of places locally, across Maryland as well as travel spots nationally to check out autumn leaves and fall events.\n \nWIKIMEDIA COMMONS/LIZ WEST\n \nNew England is a popular destination to enjoy the sights of fall and the changing of the leaves \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pickering Creek Audubon Center opens new trail\n\n November 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Contributed | Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 510\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n At the Pickering Creek Audubon Center's annual donor Pig Roast this autumn, Pickering debuted the first trail loop in the new woods they acquired in fall of 2022.Thanks to the generosity of many community members, the Center was able to purchase 63 acres of woods adjacent to the Center's main campus in September of 2022. Over the course of the past year, staff and stakeholders have enjoyed free-form walks in the new woods as they considered potential trails and highlights along those trails.The first result of that effort is the New Woods Loop.The loop begins at the conclusion of one of the Center's wetlands boardwalks, following a path along the wooded shoreline overlooking the head of Pickering Creek.After a short walk, hikers enter the new woods, dominated by mature oaks, tulip poplar, beech and hickory.The first stop along the walk is Barred Owl Circle, a delightful set of benches built by the Center's volunteer crew that are set up in a natural clearing in the woods that provide a wonderful place to rest and contemplate the quiet around you.It is aptly named for the regularity that you hear Barred Owls calling.Summer EcoCamp groups enjoyed this location all summer as one of their starting points for exploration of the new woods. Camp groups began exploring the new woods with their group leaders during the second week of the Center's seven-week camp.It quickly became the most popular place that campers wanted to go.They have adopted their own name for it, Echo Woods Circle, because of the interesting echo of voices that occurs as sound bounce across the creek and back. The circle is slightly short of the halfway point of the walk.The trail continues and casually meanders amongst big trees and runs alongside a wooded wetland. A small bridge crosses a seasonal stream as the trail curls left beneath towering tulip poplars.From here hikers enter a grove of American Holly before exiting the woods into the Center's meadow.The trail links up with the center's next newest trail, the meadow loop.Hikers can turn right and continue on for further adventure through the meadow and onto the meadow viewing platform or head towards the farm pond and back to the parking lot.\"I've seen something new every time I taken this walk,\" said Pickering Board President Tom Sanders.This is the first of several planned trails that will enable community members to explore the woods over the next few years. The debut of the next section of trail is planned for mid 2024.The trail is three quarters of a mile long from the parking lot, through the woods and back along the meadow trail to the parking lot. Allow 40 minutes for the walk.During the winter months Pickering is open daily from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.If you would like to sign up for a guided walk in the new woods, visit pickeringcreek.org. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF AUDUBON CENTER\n \nBenches along Pickering Creek Audubon Center's new woods trail\n \nCOURTESY OF AUDUBON CENTER\n \nFerns viewed from Pickering Creek Audubon Center's new trail \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Investors consider climate change before buying homes\n\n December 1, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 13 | Section: News \n \n 908\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A recent Forbes survey reveals nearly a third of Americans cited climate change as a reason to move last year.For aspiring homeowners, climate has transitioned from a selling point to a critical risk factor.Prospective home buyers must educate themselves on the tangible impacts of climate change to safeguard their property investments from potential catastrophic events.When sizing up a property, environmental considerations used to be a matter of taste. Does the buyer prefer warm, sunny summers on the coast or the snug, cool, white winters of the northern interior? Now, aspiring homeowners must consider how climate change will affect their property over the long run and what costs they may incur as a result.\"As awareness of risk grows, the financial value of risky places drops,\" says climate futurist Alex Steffen. The rising costs of climate change will make some properties indefensible.\"[They] will be unofficially abandoned. That will then create more problems. Bonds for big projects, loans, mortgages, business investment, insurance, talented workers - all will grow more scarce then, the value will crash,\" Steffen predicts.Coining the term \" brittleness bubble,\" Steffen wants to raise awareness. These brittle properties, prone to sudden, irreparable climate-fueled failure could create unrecoverable losses for their owners. The climate crisis poses dire choices, especially for those buying a home for the first time.Yet being forewarned is being forearmed. The sooner investors and home buyers alike bone up on the ground facts of climate risk, the better they can mitigate their property portfolio against the perils of extreme weather.FEW GOOD OPTIONSAs a global phenomenon, climate change impacts human populations everywhere. No region in America is truly immune from the fallout. When disaster strikes one part of the country, everyone suffers since they depend on the supply of goods and services nationwide.However, some regions are being hit sooner and harder than others. This information can help those buying land as an investment navigate the ever-changing climate map.Data from First Street and Moody's Analytics shows that Texas, Florida, New Jersey, and California, four of the country's largest and most populous states, are all likely to face more climate change risk sooner.With its vast coastline and wetland ecosystem, Florida is most vulnerable to rising sea temperatures and exacerbated tropical storms. The state has been a favorite destination for \"snowbirds\" from the North, especially among Canadian homebuyers. Florida accounts for almost half of all Canadian property purchases in the United States.According to the 30-year forecast by Moody's, climate change events will continue to affect communities up and down the East Coast and, at some point, will impact the livability of states such as Florida and the Carolinas. In the Southwest, e.g., Arizona, record heat and fires increase weather dangers and threaten reliable water supplies.The nation's interior is also feeling the climate stress, with intense heat and unprecedented rainfalls recorded in recent years. As the weather becomes more extreme, smaller, less exposed cities such as Boise, Idaho, are poised for an influx of newcomers seeking shelter from climate catastrophe.FLOODS AND FIRESOf all the natural disasters impacting home valuations in the U.S., wildfires and flooding are among the most damaging.As more study on climate change risk is undertaken, the potential effect on the American real estate market becomes apparent. For instance, the journal Nature Climate Change recently published a study that claims property prices in flood zones are overvalued by $121 to $237 billion.\"Increasing flood risk under climate change is creating a bubble that threatens the stability of the U.S. housing market,\" said lead author Dr. Jesse Gourevitch, a postdoctoral fellow at the Environmental Defense Fund.\"These risks are largely unaccounted for in property transactions, encouraging development in flood-prone areas.Accurately pricing the costs of flooding in home values can support adaptation to flood risk, but may leave many worse off.\"Unfactored environmental risks bode poorly for low-income households. The study found this demographic may lose up to 10% of their property's market value to the risk of significant flooding.\"For many people, their most valuable asset is their home. We need policy approaches that improve the transparency of climate risk in markets while providing increased support and protection for frontline communities,\" said co-author Dr. Carolyn Kousky, Associate Vice President for Economics and Policy at the Environmental Defense Fund.INSURE YOURSELFThe rising risks will make home ownership, already out of reach for most Americans, even more unaffordable. The increasing costs of covering the damage from natural disasters are unsustainable for homeowners and insurance companies.Huge claims from natural disasters in states such as California and Florida leave companies rethinking their risk and opting out of insuring susceptible regions.State-backed insurers cover some gaps in this landscape, but the premiums only sometimes cover the bills that homeowners are forced to pay. This situation worsens as climate change continues to upend the weather patterns and wreak havoc through extreme weather events.Slowing the impact of climate change is a global effort requiring deeper coordination between governments, corporations, citizens, and the world. Unfortunately, the average American can do little to change the broader trends However, by being informed of the dangers posed by climate catastrophe, homeowners can prepare for the worst and safeguard their families' future. Real estate remains many Americans' primary investment vehicle, so contingency planning is urgent. Without it, a local extreme weather disaster could bring untold financial ruin. \n \n Caption: Threats associated with climate change, such as severe weather, are being considered by real estate investors when buying homes. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The dead zone is caused by algal blooms that are fueled by nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. These cloud the water and cause damage, mainly during the warmer months.The extent of each year's dead zone is dependent on several factors, including how much nitrogen and phosphorus pollution enters waterways. High precipitation can contribute to the dead zone because it leads to more polluted runoff washing into rivers and streams. Precipitation was below average for most of 2023.\"It has been a good year,\" Matt Pluta, Choptank Riverkeeper, said.\"A big influence has been a lack of rain run off. We have been in a three year drought.\"Chesapeake Bay Foundation Virginia Senior Scientist Joe Wood said, \"While the smaller dead zone this year is a promising sign, we must remember the major challenges that lie ahead. The mere existence of a dead zone in the Bay is cause for alarm, and a sign that we must still dramatically reduce pollution flowing into the Bay.\"Pluta said there are three ways to reduce runoff from the land. These are riparian buffer zones, rain gardens and healthy wetlands. He pondered why they cannot have this good news all the time even in wet years.Getting specific about locating the pollution is integral to helping the Bay. The watershed includes more states that just Maryland.The water comes from New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Delaware, Virginia and Washington, D.C.\"Most of the pollution-reduction progress so far has come from wastewater treatment plants,\" Wood said.States in the Bay watershed are still lagging far behind in reducing polluted runoff from agriculture as well as urban and suburban areas.In fact, urban and suburban pollution is increasing.Industry that uses pipes to flow unhealthy ingredients into the Chesapeake Bay, have gotten better kind of like cars have gotten better at reducing emissions, said Pluta.\"Wastewater treatment plants have gotten good with technology mandates out of their pipes,\" Pluta Said. \"The bigger issue is nonpoint source pollution. Urban and agriculture pollution are increasing. We need to control fertilizer and figure out the input and output.\"A dead zone for aquatic life in the Chesapeake makes life impossible. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland), a member of the Congressional PFAS Task Force, emphasized the urgency of addressing PFAS contamination in a recent statement to Capital News Service.\"I recently joined my colleague Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D) of Pennsylvania and many others in urging the Department of Defense to swiftly address its growing backlog of military sites contaminated with PFAS,\" Raskin said. \"We also urged the DoD to adequately fund cleanup efforts at contaminated sites across the country, including the White Oak Naval Surface Warfare Center in my district and several other sites in our state.\"Jones said there aren't many \"good\" ways to get rid of PFAS.\"Even if you're drinking water that has very low levels of PFAS in the water, most of what you drink today is going to be with you for years,\" he said. \" And there are very few natural processes that break down PFAS, so in essence, that's why they're called forever chemicals.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And we also deployed our speed sign to remind the vehicles of their speed in hopes of calming any potential speed issues.\"\nKellner said that in running radar and collecting data from the speed sign, the police department really sees an issue with speeding.\nHe said that large and loud vehicles driving down a small, narrow street can sometimes give off the perception that the driver is speeding.\n\"Our findings were that most of those larger vehicles were following the rules of the road,\" he said.\nIn the spring, the second part of the project is set to begin.\n\"We're estimating April,\" Lewis said. \"I mean a lot of this is dependent on weather temperatures, asphalt, plants, a lot of factors.\"\nLewis said the second part will include adding plants to the new structures, adding signage, elevating land on the far east end and making improvements to the parking lot.\n\"The whole concept is to build a higher area all along the Strand to protect it from the stormwaters off the river,\" Lewis said.\nThe parking lot will be built with storm management areas underneath it so that storm water can enter it and be filtered before going back out. The parking lot will be paved with asphalt, with a cobble layer underneath it.\n\"There's a lot of - not just tidal water coming from the river - but also stormwater settling along that road in the parking lot,\" Lewis said.\n\"So bringing all of that elevation up to prevent that and allowing the water to go under the road and then back out into the creek will basically build resilience for that whole area.\"\nLewis said that as the sea level rises and the intensity of storms increase, infrastructure along the Strand becomes more vulnerable.\n\"Keep in mind, this is the only road we really have that runs along the water,\" she said. \"This area here, it's worthy of this type of resilience protection because a breach in any place, especially up near the parking lot, would be so difficult to repair.\"\nLewis called it a project for the future.\n\"With the impacts of sea level rise and stormwater and tidal water management that we're seeing currently,\" she said, \"it's necessary to look at how to build in these areas with natural infrastructure that will help to protect it in the future.\"\nDavid Ghysels, who walks along the Strand every day, said he thinks the project will be nice when it is complete, particularly if it helps with flooding.\nLewis said she has received positive and negative comments from residents on the project.\n\"I think the closer you are to the project physically, the more involved you may have been over the last five years,\" she said. \"So I think that one of the impacts will be people who don't go there regularly or aren't involved in the government regularly all of a sudden want to know what happened. So it's really just a continued educational process.\"\nMac Sommerlatte, who lives next to the beach, said he thinks the project should, when finished, positively impact the town by minimizing shoreline erosion and mitigating the impact of sea level rise. He said the project is a complicated one.\n\"I think one of the problems is that there are several projects here,\" he said.\n\"It's not just one. And people don't seem to have the complete information on all of them. And they may disagree with parts of it.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n A sign at the Strand Beach in Oxford on Dec. 12 saying that the Shoreline Improvement project will be completed after a few months of an adjustment period, which will allow the new infrastructure to settle. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 672\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS - To mitigate increased flooding from sea level rise and stormwater runoff, the Commissioners of St. Michaels are considering investing in improvements to vulnerable shorelines and infrastructure.At the commissioners' Wednesday meeting, BayLand project manager and coastal engineer Anna Johnson presented the San Domingo Creek and West Side stormwater and harbor infrastructure assessment and flood mitigation study.\nThe study, performed by BayLand, an environmental engineering firm, focused on San Domingo Creek, which hugs the west side of town and opens into Broad Creek. It aimed to examine the town's current flooding sources and investigate what flooding will look like in the future.\nThe study came as another effort by the town government to address stormwater and coastal flooding. In 2021, the town created the Climate Change/Sea Level Rise Commission, which then worked with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to obtain a grant for a study.\nMuch of Maryland, including St. Michaels, is experiencing both global and relative, or local, sea level rise, Johnson said. And according to historic water level measurements taken from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide station in Cambridge, sea levels in the lower Chesapeake Bay have risen just over a foot in 80 years.\nAfter the BayLand team assessed existing conditions, current stormwater infrastructure and sea level rise data, further modeling was performed to identify the six most vulnerable areas along San Domingo Creek.\nGrace Street was determined to be the highest priority area, Johnson said. The culvert bridging over the creek is undersized, she said, and its low elevation means that by 2050, standing water could occur daily on the road.\nA county pump station is also in close proximity to the Grace Street culvert, and that area is also likely to experience daily flooding.\nBack Creek Park was ranked as the second highest priority, primarily due to the condition of the bulkhead on its southern shoreline.\nWest Chestnut Street at Tilden Street, Canton Street at Glory Avenue, the St.\nMichaels Nature Trail and Thompson Street were also identified as priority areas.\nAs for risk mitigation strategies, nature-based, passive solutions are preferred, Johnson said.\n\"Marshes rebound. A marsh may flood, but then six months later, it's back to being a marsh, whereas if a house floods, it all has to be replaced, or major construction has to be done to fix it,\" she said.\nNature-based solutions are also grant-friendly, Johnson said.\nAccording to Roy Myers, chair of the town's Climate Change/Sea Level Rise Commission, grant requests are underway for expansion of the living shoreline at Back Creek Park and completion of an assessment and preliminary design for a tide gate under the nature trail bridge.\nOnce the BayLand team compiled a list of projects based on the needs for mitigation, an implementation plan was developed to determine a timeframe for addressing the needs.\nBecause of the failing bulkhead, the Back Creek Park living shoreline improvement project was designated as an immediate implementation project.\nThe project is estimated to cost $204,000.\nInstalling a tide gate where the St. Michaels Nature Trail bridge crosses San Domingo Creek is another project proposed for immediate implementation.\nIf installed, the tide gate could prevent coastal flooding in the surrounding area.\nHowever, assessment, preliminary design and implementation for a tide gate come with a hefty price tag - just over $2.4 million.\nJohnson recommended the town look into applying for a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant to offset the cost.\nJohnson warned of the risk of waiting to implement improvements, pointing out that prices will increase over the next few years.\nImprovements to the Grace Street culvert, pipe outfall improvements at the West Chestnut and Tilden Street retention area, stormwater infrastructure replacement along the St. Michaels Nature Trail and raising boating infrastructure at Back Creek Park were listed as shortterm implementation projects.\nThe total cost for those four projects is estimated at $1.07 million.\nLong-term implementation projects, like monitoring flood risk for assessed areas and nourishing living shorelines along Back Creek Park, are designated as such to see if a stronger need develops over time. \n \n Caption: FILE PHOTO\n\n Heavy rains and higher than usual tides brought flooding to downtown St. Michaels on Sept. 23, 2021. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Members include those representing education, maritime archaeology, tourism, the local community, indigenous tribes and more.\nCouncil member and research specialist Megan Mccabe presented new efforts to make volunteering at Mallows Bay more accessible.\nA newsletter is in the works to showcase volunteer opportunities and upcoming events associated with the sanctuary.\nMccabe noted that a volunteer interest sheet would also be launching soon, which will make it easier to collect the contact information, availability and interests of potential volunteers in one place.\nFor those interested in getting involved sooner, Mccabe told Southern Maryland News, \"For right now, if you'd like to hear about our volunteering opportunities and upcoming events, follow us on social media or check our website.\nBut once we get that volunteer newsletter up and running, that will definitely be the best way to stay up to date.\" Currently, the team is aiming for the newsletter and interest form to be available in spring 2024.\nIn the meantime, people can follow Mallows Bay on Instagram at mallowsbay potomacrivernms, on YouTube@MallowsBay-Terrain360 and on Facebook at Mallows Bay-Potomac River National Marine Sanctuary.\nNext spring will be a busy time for the sanctuary.\nResearch, Resource Protection and Permit Coordinator Tane Casserley introduced updates to the sanctuary's new Terrain360 website and resources that will be rolling out in the coming months.\nAccording to its website, Terrain360 is a company that provides \"street level imagery for thousands of hiking/biking trails, waterways, and ecologically sensitive locations.\" The new website will not only house immersive 360 hiking and water trail experiences, but will also feature informational videos featuring cultural and ecological information, interactive maps, safety tips and information, directions, current weather and water conditions.\nIn an effort to create an even more rounded experience, Mallows Bay has also been working with East Carolina PhD candidate Allyson Ropp on a Sketchfab site.\nUsing this 3D modeling platform, Ropp has created 16 models of the World War I era ships in Mallows Bay before they sank. Visitors now fully can grasp the history and size of the shipwrecks they see at the Sanctuary using this technology.\nThose interested can access these models now on the Mallows Bay Sketchfab site.\nWhen asked what prompted this new site, Casserley explained, \"It was actually a congressional appropriation. We got funds from Congress focused on a virtual trail experience for Mallows Bay.\" With this funding, Terrain360 was contracted to build out the website for the Sanctuary.\nCasserly noted that it can be difficult to get to Mallows Bay if you do not have a car or the economic means to visit. The goal of using Terrain360 was to create a product that could be shared with the public that removes economic barriers somewhat.\nThose with mobility issues may also benefit, according to Casserly.\n\"We see this as almost an ADA type of experience where you could be anybody anywhere in the world and we still can show you the beauties of Mallows Bay and celebrate the history and culture,\" he said.\nCurrently the new website is being evaluated by the Sanctuary Advisory Council members, but the current plan is to give the public access by next spring. \n \n Caption: MICHAEL REID/SOUTHERN MARYLAND NEWS\n\n The remains of a wooden ship sit in the Potomac River and Mallows Bay Park.

    "content": "Delmarva ecologist seeks old growth designation for local forests\n\n January 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 921\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TUNIS MILLS — There is a centuries-old private land forest past Tunis Mills that has just been designated old growth. It is chock full of oak, beech and loblolly pines. Towering to the sky, these trees will outlive us all.The Old-Growth Forest Network is an Easton-based national nonprofit that focuses on preserving the oldest trees in each county. To them, the Tunis Mills forest is part of a border mission.\nThe founder of the network is a former professor of ecology, Joan Maloof. She peeled the bark off of a fallen tree Friday afternoon, while strolling the forest, and a lesson began.\nMaloof pointed out lichen, mushrooms and mycelium that all thrive in the warm, decomposing darkness. Life is still very much in session at the bottom of the forest, she said.\n\"The mission of the Old-Growth Network is to make sure there is at least one forest in each county that is protected from logging and open to the public nationally,\" Maloof said. \"In addition to that, we realized there were private owners that wanted to protect their forests but didn't necessarily want to make them open to the public. We wanted to recognize these people for their commitment to forgo the money from logging.\"\nWhile there is some disagreement over the qualifications of an old-growth forest, generally, they are over 150 years old, having survived the rapid deforestation of the 19th and 20th centuries.\nMaloof noted that the state with the most registered stands is Ohio. There are lots of farms there, and many of the owners preserved a forest plot.\nThere are four full-time and four part-time people working in the Old-Growth Network. They also have hundreds of volunteers called county coordinators, who walk through the oldest woods in each county.\nPart of the culture of the network is that it brings forest-loving people together, Maloof said.\nShe met Easton local and former University of Maryland geology professor Peter Stifel, the owner of the Tunis Mills forest land, while giving a talk at Pickering Creek Audubon Center.\nThis meeting helped Stifel get a no-log conservation easement, which is very rare. There is an Old-Growth Forest Network sign placed in Stifel's woods. Maloof said he is proud of it.\nIn Steifel's intact woods, there are bald eagles and woodpeckers. There are foxes and big Delmarva fox squirrels. There are snakes and rabbits. There are moths and praying mantises. There is chlorophyll and light. Green orchids poke up from the floor of decomposing leaves.\nMaloof said forging community connections is key to improving knowledge of the Old-Growth Forest Network's work.\n\"We would love to encourage other people to add their forests to the private Old-Growth Network. You could do it through us directly by signing a memorandum of agreement saying you always want to protect your forests,\" she said. \"If you wanted to do it only legally, you would do it through a land trust like Eastern Shore Land Conservancy and request a no logging easement. There are tax benefits.\"\nBut beyond private forest land, Maloof said the organization is searching for publicly accessible lands that can be preserved from logging, a daunting task in Talbot County.\nUnlike elsewhere in the United States, where there are larger tracts of government-owned land, Maryland forests are mostly on private property.\n\"There is no federal land in Talbot County, no national forests in Maryland, no (Bureau of Land Management) land, no national parks in Talbot County, very little state land,\" Maloof said. \"Talbot County has the least state-owned land (in Maryland) — only 236 acres. Queen Anne's County has Wye (Island Natural Resources Management Area), which is true open to the public old-growth forest. Fourteen acres of Schoolhouse Woods got protected (there).\"\n\"Somehow we need to get more forests in Talbot County set aside for the future,\" she said.\nMaloof wrote a coffee table book with color photographs by Robert Llwellyn called \"The Living Forest.\" From the birds in the canopy to the salamanders under bark, she has knowledge of the many facets that make a healthy old forest.\n\"I think I was born loving plants. I am an ecologist,\" she said. \"As I went on with my training, I got to love bigger and bigger plants and then realized how important (it is) to have forested ecosystem there for all these other organisms to survive.\n\"What is to prevent all the woods from being cut again? And you find out, nothing in the whole county is protected. So that got me sharing information and writing books. My first book was 'Teaching the Trees.' I wrote my second book about visiting old-growth forests in the East. I realized they are so rare and so precious. Who is going to make sure they are not getting cut?\"\nRight next to Stifel's forest to the north, there is another forest that has just tied orange markers on the tree limbs. This usually is the mark that precedes logging.\nMaloof said she is not opposed to all timber cutting. She just wants to preserve the oldest forests for future generations.\n\"So who suffers a cut? Future generations, the wildlife and the whole planet. We are not radicals. Can't we get at least one in each county that won't be cut? Where is the forest in Talbot County that can never be cut and is open to the public? We have not identified that yet,\" she said.\nAlthough she doesn't look like the Lorax, she said her mission is the same as the beloved Dr. Seuss character.\n\"I speak for the trees. I am proud to be the Lorax,\" she said.\nTo learn more about the Old-Growth Forest Network, visit oldgrowthforest.net/. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2024-01-07",

    "content": "Solar on Eastern Shore farmland raise concerns\n\n January 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEVE KLINE | Section: Columns \n \n 497\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For 33 years, Eastern Shore Land Conservancy has welcomed each new year with a strong spirit of mission, to work each day to conserve this special place we all hold dear. This year is no different, as we return to the office after a restful break among family and friends.We are proud of our accomplishments in 2023 and move ahead focused on the many opportunities to protect the Eastern Shore in 2024.\nThis particular new year dawns with an urgent issue on the horizon: the siting of commercial-scale solar on Eastern Shore farmland. As the General Assembly prepares for the 2024 legislative session, solar siting policy is a high priority for many, as the state seeks to meet aggressive renewable energy goals, while also continuing to make progress on land conservation.\nGround-mounted solar projects can run from a few dozen acres to several hundred, and across the Potomac in Virginia, some individual solar projects are slated to consume thousands of acres of farmland, forest and open space. Some look to Maryland's Eastern Shore and see similar possibilities, with acre after acre of generally flat agricultural land suited perfectly for solar energy generation.\nBut Eastern Shore Land Conservancy is encouraging state lawmakers to move ahead cautiously. The University of Maryland estimates that our state has lost about half of its agricultural land in the last 50 years, and the American Farmland Trust estimates that in the coming decades, Maryland will likely lose more than 100,000 additional acres.\nWhile estimates vary widely, the legislated renewable energy goals that already exist seem likely to require between 10,000 and 20,000 acres of ground-mounted solar on agricultural fields. This doesn't include the acreage that could be affected by expanded transmission lines, substations, and other energy grid infrastructure.\nGiven the state landscape, one can imagine the majority of those acres — and perhaps the vast majority — could fall on Eastern Shore farmland, unless steps to ensure regional equity are taken. This is why, as legislators prepare to gather and address the business of the state, ESLC is advocating for a few priority policies related to solar siting.\nFirst, commercial solar development should never be allowed on state-held or co-held conservation easements.\nSecond, solar siting should be prioritized for the built environment. We shouldn't be losing some of the most productive soil in the world while warehouses and parking lots go unutilized.\nThird, for every acre taken out of production for solar development, solar companies should be paying a mitigation fee to conserve lands via permanent easement elsewhere.\nLastly, policies should be enacted to ensure Maryland's Eastern Shore counties aren't expected to bear a disproportionate burden of solar development in the coming years.\nAs we navigate the changing climate, the need to decarbonize our economy and transition to a renewable energy future is abundantly clear. But what is also abundantly clear is that climate change will make Eastern Shore food production even more globally important.\nWe should think long and hard before we place too much Eastern Shore farmland under a solar panel. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I personally know this problem is not isolated to Caroline County. The Eastern Shore is becoming a dumping ground for these materials.\nThe neighboring farm has become an unregulated year-around storage facility. Under the guise of \"ag use\", DAF from seafood and chicken processing and municipal wastewater plant sludge from outside of Talbot County was dumped in heaping mounds, permitted to sit in the open, rotting from exposure, with unregulated runoff entering our waterway. The stench was gut wrenching.\nThis was not a 'farming' smell, which as farmers we clearly understand. This was an unbearable odor that you could not escape, even within the confines of your home. After nearly a year, some of the product was applied to the fields, resulting in the hatching of unbelievable swarms of midges (tiny flies), so thick we were inhaling them.\nWith a background in government and wastewater treatment, I am familiar with municipal operation regulations. What's happening here is wrong, and people are looking the other way. Heart wrenching testimony by my neighbors was given at a 2022 Talbot County Agricultural Resolution Board hearing, only to be told it was a \"normal and acceptable\" agricultural practice.\nHow can a practice that was not normal over the last 70 years, suddenly be considered acceptable. The air is thick with the smell of rotting waste as I type this letter and as my personal legal battle against this irresponsible practice continues.\nNo longer isolated incidents, the effects of improper industrial sludge storage are being experienced across the Shore. It should not be up to every individual county to regulate this storage or to individual citizens to fight corporate attorneys. What may be my problem today, could be your problem tomorrow.\nThe University of Maryland predicts more than half of Maryland's DAF supply is coming from out of state. When it's cheaper for producers to haul in their sludge from Delaware and Virginia (which require sludge spreading permits), it's clearly a state issue. The MDE and MDA need to regulate how this material is being stored and applied.\nPlease support the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and partners as they propose regulatory legislation to the Maryland General Assembly before the \"industrial sludge industry\" destroys our shore way of life.\nCHERYL LEWIS\nTrappe \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tree planting project fosters community in Cambridge\n\n January 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 650\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Over the past two years, Carlos Estin has noticed more children playing at the park off Academy Street in Cambridge.The reason for this increased activity at Meadows Park traces back to the trees.\nTwo years ago, Estin, a tree steward through ShoreRivers' Tree Stewards program, helped coordinate the planting of trees there. And although those trees today aren't but a handful of feet taller than Estin, they have acted as a catalyst to revitalizing the park.\n\"Fortunately, when we brought it to the attention of the city and the local councilman, which for this ward is Jameson (Harrington), he was very involved in helping,\" Estin said.\nHarrington, along with the City of Cambridge, was supportive of the project. Volunteers came to help clean up the park. On Earth Day that year, in 2022, students from Cambridge-South Dorchester High School came to help plant new trees.\nHarrington, who was there that day as well, said it was a \"fantastic\" day.\n\"I think they all really enjoyed getting out there and helping,\" he said about the students.\nOver the last two years, the park has been cleaned up, bushes have been planted and more trees have been planted. In the spring, Estin said they will place flower pots at the entrance.\n\"As you see things progress, and everybody's seeing positive results,\" he said. \"It encourages everybody to do more.\"\nEstin said before this project, the park was \"a little bit neglected\" with graffiti, trash and play areas in \"disarray.\"\n\"Not a lot of kids were using it,\" he said.\nNow, more kids are going to the park, using the playground and basketball court, Estin said. And that's not all he has noticed.\n\"Around the perimeter of the park, there was a lot of trash, a lot of overgrowth,\" he said. \"Slowly as (neighbors) saw the park improve, they started to clean up their properties.\"\nEstin has been a tree steward for the last two and a half years. The program is a partnership between Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay, the Maryland Forest Service and local groups, including ShoreRivers on the Eastern Shore.\nAccording to the Chesapeake Tree Canopy Network, the program was created to promote, enhance and increase tree canopy coverage.\nAs a tree steward, Estin coordinates different projects to get more trees planted in the area. Currently there are three projects in Cambridge: Meadows, Long Wharf and Great Marsh parks.\nEstin said tree loss often occurs because new trees aren't planted when trees die. Planting trees to replace the old ones has multiple benefits, including improving soil conditions, lowering flooding risks, improving curb appeal and keeping the temperature cooler, he said.\nHarrington said urban tree planting also helps with air pollution.\nMeadows Park, specifically, he said, is at the top of a hill that slopes down toward Cambridge Creek, \"So having more trees there helps absorb some of that runoff.\"\nEstin said the City of Cambridge has committed to maintaining 200 new trees that will be planted in the city through a grant from ShoreRivers.\nAlthough it hasn't been determined where each of these new trees will go, Estin said some will be planted at Long Wharf Park.\nAlong with the city, Estin and fellow Cambridge tree stewards have worked with other local groups, including the Dorchester Garden Club and the Sierra Club, to realize their goals.\n\"Now we're pooling our resources together and we're talking with each other,\" he said.\nSimilar to two years ago, Estin is planning to get students from Cambridge-South Dorchester High School to help plant trees again on Earth Day this year.\nHarrington said planting trees is a great way to get the community involved.\n\"I'm always for more trees,\" he said.\nLooking into the future, Estin hopes Cambridge will be a model for other cities and towns.\n\"I want Cambridge to be an example of how green spaces bring communities together and also improves the quality of our life,\" he said.\nThose interested in volunteering and getting involved with the tree projects in Cambridge can email Estin at carlosestin@gmail.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the Maryland Retailer's Alliance, more than 70% of Marylanders now live in jurisdictions with carry out bag policies in place.\nOn July 20, 2023, Centreville Town Council passed the ordinance to ban single-use plastic carry out bags within Centreville town limits.\nFor Town Council President Ashley Kaiser while the ban addresses single-use plastic bags the spirit of the ordinance is to encourage the use of reusable bags and eliminate the reliance on plastic bags, many of which end up polluting our highways and waterways.\n\"Consumers have an opportunity to play a significant role in the implementation of this bill. I don't think that anyone who is shopping at a local business wants to burden a local business, but instead wants to support them. If a paper bag fee is going to be a problem for you, decline the bag,\" says Kaiser. \"There are things people can do to change their behavior like making a point to remember to always carry reusable bags with them,\" she adds.\nFollowing that philosophy, the Town of Centreville launched a \"Bring Your Own Bag\" campaign in October in coordination with Plastic Free QAC. The campaign included specially designed reusable bags with a rack card featuring information on the bag ban as well as tips for how to remember to bring your bag to your next shopping trip.\nBags were handed out at Centreville Day in October and at the Centreville Farmers' Market Heck with the Malls market day in December and were made available at Town Hall. A limited supply of Town reusable bags and vintage farmers' market reusable bags are currently available for consumers to pick up at Centreville Town Hall from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.\nThe Centreville single-use plastic bag ordinance stipulates that retail establishments with the exception of food service facilities \"shall charge, collect and retain at least 10 cents for each paper carry out bag that it provides to a customer.\"\nExceptions to the ordinance includes, but are not limited to:\nNonprofit fraternal, civic, war veterans, religious, or charitable organizations and fire companies can still use plastic carry out bags.\nDue to cross contamination concerns restaurants may not allow customers to use their own reusable bags. Restaurants will provide paper bags, but will not charge a paper bag fee.\nThe Centreville Market's Market and cottage food businesses can continue to use plastic.\nPharmacies and opticians will not charge a paper bag fee for prescription items.\nConsumers and business owners who want to read the full text of the ordinance and frequently asked questions can visit townofcentreville.org and type \"plastic bag ban\" in the search window.

    "content": "Van Hollen discusses blue catfish, H-2B visas with Eastern Shore Delegation\n\n January 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 530\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — During an Eastern Shore Delegation meeting Friday, U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) updated legislators on policy issues relating to the Eastern Shore that are \"on the horizon.\"Van Hollen told Eastern Shore legislators that the issue of blue catfish, an invasive species in the Chesapeake Bay, has received a lot of attention in Congress.\n\"We know that we've got to deal with this invasive species,\" he said. \"And probably the best way to deal with it is to eat our way out of it.\"\nAlong with U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md. 1st), Van Hollen said that he has been working to make it so that blue catfish are inspected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — like other fish products in the country — rather than by the U.S Department of Agriculture.\nVan Hollen said they are also trying to get additional funding for the prevention of more blue catfish in the Bay. He said a $750,000 grant for this was included in an appropriations bill that has been passed by the U.S. Senate but not yet passed by the U.S. House of Representatives.\nDel. Jay Jacobs (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) voiced his concerns with the the U.S. Department of Commerce's recent rejection of the state's request for a \"fishery resource disaster\" declaration. The request was made to address the damages caused by blue catfish and northern snakeheads in the Bay.\n\"These fish are growing so fast, and they're so aggressive that by the time everybody sees the financial disaster, it may be too late,\" Jacobs said.\nJacobs told Van Hollen that he hopes Van Hollen can \"keep the pressure on\" in the Senate.\nVan Hollen thanked Jacobs, saying he agreed with him about the risks and dangers of the invasive species.\n\"We are in the aftermath of the administration's decision on the disaster assistance,\" Van Hollen said to Jacobs. \"We are going back to them. We may reach out to you and your colleagues to get some additional information as we circle back.\"\nAt the meeting, Van Hollen also spoke about H-2B visas, which are important for seafood processing companies in the state.\nVan Hollen said that for fiscal year 2024, the number of these visas, which are for temporary nonagricultural workers, has increased to more than 130,000.\n\"The challenge remains that it's a lottery system,\" he said. \"And that it's impossible to run a business with certainty if your labor depends on a lottery system.\"\nTo address this, Van Hollen and Cardin have introduced a bill that would exempt seafood processors from the H-2B annual worker cap. Van Hollen said that although the bill has bipartisan support, it also has bipartisan opposition.\n\"And so we are trying to work that through the system and address concerns that have been raised on both sides of the aisle,\" he said.\nVan Hollen also spoke about infrastructure and the 2018 Farm Bill at the meeting Friday. He said $18 million has been secured for different projects on the Eastern Shore, including various infrastructure projects.\nOn the Farm Bill, Van Hollen said the Senate has extended the bill through September of this year. He said the bill has important provisions for farmers such as crop protection. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Greensboro may get funds to move pump station, restore site of old wastewater treatment plant\n\n January 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly | Section: Local News \n \n 655\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Though she wasn't on the agenda, Caroline County Assistant Director of Planning Leslie Grunden reported a positive development in protecting a stream flowing into the Choptank River north of Greensboro.Leading off the Jan. 23 meeting of the Caroline County Commission, Grunden said state funding was available to shore up \"erosion at the town's pump station at the site of the old treatment plant located on a small tributary that feeds directly to the Choptank River,\" she said.\nGreensboro Director of Public Works Brandon Cunningham alerted Commission President Travis Breeding about the \"severe erosion\" after recent significant rainfall.\n\"When he called me, and I went to look at it, I was like, 'Oh, yeah, this is a big deal,'\" Breeding said.\nGrunden said Cunningham told her he noticed \"some erosion had been increasing\" over the past several months.\n\"I think that was part of the old outfall for the old treatment plant, but the sides and the bottom are lined all the way down to the river — under the overpass into the river,\" Grunden said. \"And over time, because it was probably put it in in the '60s, … it's broken up and starting to collapse and that's exacerbating the erosion.\"\nA short-term solution in the form of an emergency grant was already in the works to add rocks and rebar and help hold the bank in place \"while we went looking for funding for the long-term solution,\" to move the pump station farther uphill, Grunden said.\nThe aim is to remove the infrastructure and convert the stream location to a natural floodplain.\n\"Bringing the pump station up the hill (on town property) keeps it out of harm's way from erosion but also from eventual rising water from the Choptank,\" she said.\n\"This pump station takes flow from the town to the plant, so for that to be in jeopardy kind of keeps me up at night,\" Grunden said. The north county wastewater treatment plant is located on State Route 313, just north of Greensboro Volunteer Fire Company's community hall.\nGrunden said her usual funding sources could support either the infrastructure or stream and floodplain restoration but not both. \"So, I kind of put the word out saying we need money for both,\" she said.\nHowever, the Maryland Department of the Environment gave her a call a week or two ago, \"essentially (saying), 'We think we found the money to do both,' which is … almost a miracle,\" Grunden said.\nMDE had \"actually never done this grant. It's a grant they get from EPA that they've never had interest in,\" she said. \"They would actually be the recipient, and then the county would be the sub-recipient. (MDE) would actually have to do all the reporting up to EPA, and I would provide them status reports and invoices.\"\nShe is currently putting together a project budget. Preliminary estimates put the pump station relocation at $1.3 million, and Grunden's guess is removing the structures would be half a million, with stream and floodplain restoration another half a million.\n\"And then I always have a contingency plan because nothing ever goes the way you want,\" she said. \"So, we're at about $2.4 million. (The Department of Natural Resources) has reached out to say they'd be interested in helping with the stream and floodplain component, which would give us more money if we need more to deal with on the pump station side.\"\nGrunden said she was \"pretty confident\" that enough funding would be available for the two-phase project, \"where the first phase would be moving the pump station and demo-ing the old buildings, and the second phase would be going in and doing the stream and the floodplain restoration.\"\nAlthough the project is \"not a sure thing,\" she said MDE reaching out to her was \"a really good sign that they're serious about providing the funding.\"\n\"I can't think of a better move that we can make there environmentally other than to get that stuff out of the floodplain,\" Breeding said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tri-Gas & Oil Co. to pay $600K penalty for groundwater pollution\n\n January 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Environment \n \n 573\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BALTIMORE — A newly settled lawsuit against Tri-Gas & Oil includes a $600,000 penalty for pollution to groundwater and a nearby creek, the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Maryland Attorney General announced Wednesday.The settlement resolves a lawsuit brought against the Federalsburg-based company last year by the Attorney General's Office on behalf of the Maryland Department of the Environment.\nThough the company has long been known as Tri-Gas & Oil, its acquisition of Pep-Up Inc. in 2022 meant that as of 2023, it now operates all of its energy brands under the PepUp name, with acknowledgment of it being a Tri-Gas Family Company.\nThe terms of the settlement, outlined in a consent decree finalized in Caroline County Circuit Court on Tuesday, require the company to continue work to clean up the fuel that leaked from storage tanks at its Federalsburg location several years ago.\n\"The significant financial penalty and the required cleanup actions contained in this settlement reflect how serious it is to ignore environmental regulations and pollute our waterways,\" said Maryland Department of the Environment Secretary Serena McIlwain.\n\"Overburdened and underserved communities disproportionately bear the burden of environmental hazards,\" she added in a Wednesday news release. \"We will hold those entities accountable who are found to be non-compliant with the applicable environmental laws and regulations.\"\nThe lawsuit describes a series of events, beginning with the company's 2018 application to renew its oil operations permit for the facility, according to a news release from the Office of the Attorney General.\nAs part of that process, the state environmental department inspected the facility and found numerous problems, including a lack of documentation of supposed repairs to two aboveground storage tanks and vegetation and cracks in a containment dike.\nThe facility's permit was issued in March 2019, but it included more than 20 special conditions requiring the facility to address the concerns identified in the prior inspection.\nIn July 2019, the Tri-Gas & Oil facility observed an oil stain adjacent to a storage tank. Its contractors removed the oil from the tank in the following months.\nThe company alleged that it did not realize that the stain was associated with a larger release until March 2020, following a report of an oily sheen moving through the Faulkner Branch originating from the facility.\nThe Maryland Department of the Environment has overseen subsequent investigations and cleanup at the property.\nThe company discontinued its use of the property for fuel storage a few months later.\nAn investigation found oil in the subsurface between the facility's storage tanks and the nearby stream. And in July 2021, the company and its environmental consultant discovered evidence of previously unknown oil contamination.\nTri-Gas & Oil estimates that it lost roughly 26,000 gallons of fuel, according to the news release.\nUnder the settlement, the company must continue to comply with the provisions of an interim cleanup plan from 2022 to return contaminated groundwater at the site to acceptable conditions.\nThe fuel leak occurred in a community that is overburdened and underserved, according to the department's environmental justice screening tool.\nCommunities like Federalsburg \"bear a greater burden of environmental hazards compared to other communities,\" the release said.\n\"Marylanders have an expectation that the water they use will be safe no matter where they live,\" Attorney General Anthony Brown said in the news release.\n\"Businesses must follow regulations designed to protect our people and the environment, and I will hold every company doing business in Maryland accountable for its impact on our communities and the people who live here,\" he added. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — Months of work came to a happy conclusion Wednesday evening with the Commissioners of St. Michaels' unanimous approval of a final master plan for San Domingo Creek Park and a $1.7 million open space grant application.The final master plan for the park, previously referred to as the Boundary Lane Waterfront Park, includes nature trails, expanded wetlands, a living shoreline, a fishing pier, a comfort station and associated parking.\nA long-wanted dog park was initially included in draft park plans, but following extensive debate, it was ultimately removed to extend the area of the park's pollinator meadow, said Scott Scarfone, an associate principal at Mahan Rykiel Associates who worked on the park design.\nLeashed dogs will still be allowed to walk through the new park.\nPlans for a defined dog park are still in the works, according to Town Manager Rob Straebel. A 2.4-acre parcel next to Bradley Park was identified as a likely location, and the town is working on a purchase or lease agreement for the site.\nA viewing mound, a 10-foot hill with an accessible path to give visitors an elevated view of the creek, was also eliminated from the new park's final master plan.\nThe viewing mound will be replaced by a circular loblolly pine grove, with views of the creek still visible. The expansive pollinator meadow will extend into the center of that space.\nScarfone called the town's decision to buy the property and develop it into a park \"wise\" and \"visionary.\"\n\"I can tell you that generations of people who visit this park are going to enjoy it in the future, so congratulations to the town for acquiring an amazing piece of property,\" he said. \"I think it was a very smart decision.\"\nThe town purchased the 7.6-acre property on Boundary Lane, which is adjacent to San Domingo Creek, for $2.9 million last year. Formerly owned by nonprofit Environmental Concern, the property also includes an administrative building, which is slated for use as the town's new office.\nBecause most of the park is intended as open space, opportunities to receive state grant funding through Program Open Space are available to help offset the purchase price.\nNearly six acres of the property were designated by Talbot County as potential open space.\nAppraisals of the open space acreage came in at $1.6 million and $1.8 million, according to Town Planner Steve Ball, leading to town staff seeking approval to apply for a $1.7 million grant for reimbursement of acquisition costs.\nThe request was approved unanimously. The grant application, due in the next few weeks, was set to be submitted Thursday.\nThough master plan approval and the submittal of the grant application mark important steps forward in bringing San Domingo Creek Park to reality, more regulatory work remains to be done.\nWhile the town owns the property, and over half of it is located within town limits, nearly three acres remain under the county's zoning jurisdiction.\nThe town is seeking to annex the remainder of the property into its limits, including Boundary Lane itself, which includes the property in front of the park's entrance. St. Michaels Police Chief Jeff Oswald also requested to include the road in the annexation, Ball said.\nNeighboring resident Langley Shook and Commissioner Tad DuPont raised concerns about bringing Boundary Lane into the annexation.\n\"I'm leery about taking on the expense of maintaining a road when we are really pinched on every single front,\" DuPont said.\nIf the annexation is approved, the new portion will also need a town zoning designation.\nSt. Michaels doesn't have designated zoning for parks, and the part of the park property already within the town limits is zoned residential, Ball said.\nThe remaining area would need to be zoned as residential, and that's in part due to many state grants requiring the property to be in a priority funding area, an urban area where the state will invest money for infrastructure, Ball said.\nThe annexation request will be heard by the St. Michaels Planning Commission next month.\nThe town's board of zoning appeals will also consider a special exception to use the existing offices on the property as town administrative offices in February. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Harris: No offshore wind turbines\n\n January 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly | Section: Local News \n \n 1914\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OCEAN CITY — Outside the doors of the Roland E. Powell Convention Center in Ocean City, two masked protestors stood quietly with posters criticizing U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.).Just inside, two volunteers handed out postcards stating, \"Stop Offshore Wind\" and \"Join Facebook group 'Protect Ocean City.'\"\nIn the auditorium, Worcester County residents slowly filed in. At least 300 people came out in below freezing temperatures Saturday afternoon, Jan. 20, for a congressional hearing held on their sandy turf.\nWarning of dire consequences if offshore wind industrialization is allowed off Maryland's Atlantic coast, three legislators called on experts to bolster their call to halt construction of wind turbines off the mid-Atlantic coast. Harris was joined by New Jersey Congressmen Jeff Van Drew (R) and Chris Smith (R).\nEXPERTS WARN OF DANGERS\nSix experts testified and answered questions from the legislators. whose districts \"are directly impacted\" by \"offshore wind industrialization,\" according to news releases issued by the congressmen's offices.\nThe panel of experts focused on the negative impacts of offshore wind energy to the fishing industry, environment and energy policy, national security, tourism, the local economy — including the Mid-Shore counties — and even the medical value of horseshoe crabs.\nWhile the general economic impact of offshore wind development was explored, Harris told The Star Democrat following the hearing that allowing wind turbines off the coast of Ocean City to generate power would increase energy costs for all Eastern Shore residents.\nHarris doubted that \"the average person would be willing to pay the extra taxes and extra rates in order to develop a source of energy that … is roughly four times as expensive as what your current source of energy is,\" he said. \"That impacts everyone whether or not you live on the Shore.\"\nHarris lives in Dorchester County.\n\"Most people I know who open their electric bills this year say, 'Wow, I can't believe it's that much higher than it was last year,\" Harris said. \"It will get even higher if we insist on producing very high-cost sources of energy.\"\n\"We might be willing to bear the costs, but are we ready to industrialize the ocean floor?\" he said.\nOne of those costs is the increase in deaths of whales and dolphins, which the legislators attributed to the construction of wind turbines. Smith called them the \"canaries in the coalmine\" and blamed the Biden administration and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy for their \"(refusal) to even listen to the numerous warnings from local leaders, mayors and state senators\" and \"continuing with false promises.\"\nSmith said the construction of 3,400 offshore wind turbines across 2.4 million acres was being \"fast-tracked.\"\nLisa Linowes is executive director of WindAction Group, which studies and provides information on \"the potential harmful impacts of large-scale wind energy facilities on wildlife and the natural environment.\"\nAlthough Linowes has been concerned about the dangers posed to marine life, She expressed concerns about maritime safety, and the Biden Administration's relaxing of regulations designed to protect baleen, right and humpback whales, sentiments echoed by others on the panel.\nFor instance, radar interference, physical obstacles and turbulence caused by wind turbines pose dangers to aircraft, according to the Coast Guard and Air Force, she said, and no \"comprehensive assessment\" has been conducted.\nOther panelists agreed with Linowes' assessment of the dangers, and Harris said radar interference constituted a national security concern.\nMeghan Lapp of Seafreeze, a Rhode Island commercial fishing company, said offshore wind turbines would interfere with \"all classes of U.S. radar.\"\nIn December 2023, a new series of leases were proposed farther off the Maryland coast, Harris said, but were \"withdrawn from consideration by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management because of protests from the Department of Defense and from NASA, who said that those leasing areas would adversely affect our ability to maintain national security and, in the case of NASA, … interfere with the Wallops Flight Center.\"\nIn addition to maritime safety concerns, Linowes said the \"discrepancy between federal treatment of ocean industries is staggering,\" citing federal agencies' downplaying correlations between \"last year's surge of large baleen whale deaths on the East Coast coinciding with unprecedented offshore wind seismic surveys.\"\n\"Had the whale deaths coincided with oil and gas surveys instead of offshore wind surveys, the pause and investigation requested by the congressmen would have been standard procedure,\" she said.\nRobert Rand of Rand Acoustics LLC in Brunswick, Maine, said underwater testing and sonar surveys by offshore wind development was damaging the hearing of marine mammals, which is vital to their survival.\n\"I know how to measure sound,\" Rand said. \"More than that, I care about whales.\"\nHis independent surveys of whale populations off the coasts of Hawaii and Cape Cod revealed stark contrasts in their communication patterns, suggesting that, even with NOAA's noise mitigation requirements, whales were adversely affected by high decibel sounds associated with offshore wind development, he said.\nPanelist Travis Fisher is the director of energy and environmental policy studies at the Cato Institute. With wind turbine power, he said Marylanders would end up paying more for wind, in addition to a backup source of power, hitting lower income residents harder.\nObserving the results of California and Germany's green energy policies has been instructive, he said.\n\"Both places have chosen to embrace intermittent energy at the expense of reliable energy,\" he said. \"Germany's energy transition has caused its residents to pay three times more for electricity than we pay in the United States. California has higher electricity prices than any other state in the lower 48.\"\n\"It's not too late to recognize the folly of a forced energy transition,\" Fisher said. \"There is no justification for an off-shore wind mandate.\"\nAlso testifying was Bonnie Brady of the Long Island Commercial Fishing Association.\nLOCAL LEADERS UNIFY\nAlthough Danish company Ørsted canceled two off-shore wind projects in fall 2023, it was continuing to develop Skipjack Wind 20 miles off the Maryland coast.\nHowever, on Jan. 25, Ørsted announced it had \"withdrawn from the Maryland Public Service Commission orders approving the Skipjack 1 and 2 projects\" following \"consultation with the State of Maryland\" and \"an extensive review of the orders.\" It cited \"challenging market conditions, including inflation, high interest rates and supply chain constraints\" as reasons for the decision.\nThe company \"intends to continue advancing development and permitting for the combined project, including submission of its updated Construction and Operations Plan to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,\" according to a press release.\nHarris said another company besides Ørsted holds a Maryland offshore lease, a \"cleverly named U.S. Wind, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of an Italian company.\"\nThe project doesn't sit well with Worcester County and Ocean City's leaders, four of whom spoke during the hearing.\n\"The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's own environmental impact statement study further convinced me that the potential negative impacts of offshore wind industrialization off Maryland's Coast outweighs the many promised benefits by European-based offshore wind developers,\" said state Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Somerset, Wicomico, Worcester).\n\"With my prior work experience at the Pentagon and the U.S. Senate Homeland Security Committee, I especially am sensitive to the security and safety concerns raised by the Department of Defense, including the detrimental effect of wind turbines on existing radar systems by false alarms and missed detection of real targets,\" Carozza said.\nMainly concerned with tourism, they warned of potential hazards caused by strong storms, and even the health of the horseshoe crab population.\nDel. Wayne Hartman (R-Wicomico, Worcester) said the \"vast majority\" of constituents who had contacted him were \"adamantly opposed to the implementation of offshore wind projects.\"\n\"According to a study from North Carolina State University, 55% of vacation renters would not return to the vacation destination if turbines were visible,\" he said. \"This is very concerning for the future of economic development in Ocean City as tourism accounts for the largest percentage of the local economy.\"\n\"We have a horseshoe crab harvest here critical for the safety of injectable medications, yet there were plans to put turbines right in horseshoe sanctuary areas,\" Pat Shrawder of said. She is district representative for state Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Somerset, Wicomico, Worcester).\n\"My understanding is that the horseshoe crab industry is centered in the mid-Atlantic here,\" Harris said. \"As a physician I'll tell you, a lot of people don't know when you get an intravenous medication of any kind — something that comes out of a sterile intravenous vial — that batch has been tested against a derivative of horseshoe crabs to make sure it doesn't have bacterial endotoxin — something that would kill you.\"\nElectromagnetic fields and underwater cables would also interfere with horseshoe crabs' migration paths.\nThe effect of strong storms on wind turbines has not been adequately studied, Harris said.\n\"Our residents are fearful of the effect of hurricane force winds on wind turbulence,\" Schrawder said. \"Ocean City is subject to strong northeasters or hurricanes. Even the EIS (Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions of the U.S. General Services Administration) report states that a hurricane could result in the loss of a blade and or turbine collapse. We worry about a football field-sized blade hurtling (sic) through the air.\"\nOcean City Mayor Rick Meehan, a Republican who has served as mayor since 2006, galvanized the mostly local audience. He said he represented 26,000 property owners, residents and a million visitors who stand in \"total opposition to the proposed U.S. Wind project.\"\n\"The discussion on wind turbines off the coast of Ocean City goes back as far as 2010,\" Meehan said. \"Yet this is the first time a committee from the federal government has actually held a hearing here in Ocean City.\"\nMeehan said the wind turbines would mar the resort's vista. \"The sunrise over the Atlantic would look like a backdrop from Star Wars,\" he said.\n\"The first time I saw the renderings of what U.S. Wind was proposing — and at the time, those were four megawatt or possibly six megawatt turbines approximately 450 feet tall — I had stated our opposition to the size and locations of those turbines at that time seven years ago. Our concerns fell on deaf ears,\" Meehan said. \"Today, those same turbines are now 18 megawatt turbines at … maybe 1,065 feet in height, and they're proposing the same locations. Our concerns continue to fall on deaf ears.\"\n\"What has also been ignored is the revenue that Ocean City sends: Millions of dollars to both the state and the federal government each year,\" Meehan said. \"We only have one industry in Ocean City, and that's tourism. Why would the state or the federal government want to unnecessarily jeopardize our future?\"\n\"What I can assure you is that the Town of Ocean City will not back down from our opposition to these projects and to our future here in Ocean City,\" Meehan said as the audience applauded and cheered.\nFIGHT CONTINUES\nU.S. Wind, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were invited to attend the hearing. U.S. Wind did not respond and the federal agencies \"declined to attend,\" Harris said.\nSmith said \"calls for an honest review of offshore wind industrialization has left unaddressed and unanswered so many questions; so much so, that in March of last year, Andy Harris, Jeff Van Drew and I offered an amendment that passed 244 to 189 to have the watchdog of Congress, the Government Accountability Office, investigate the impacts of wind turbines, and their audit will be coming out very soon.\"\nThe bottom line for Harris: \"I believe it's time to reconsider whether offshore wind is the right approach for Maryland.\"\nVan Drew was more pointed. \"We have a war to win,\" he said. \"Do not succumb, do not be weak, and we will prevail.\"\nTo watch the entire hearing, go to www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ThWS1FT1Qo \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'A complicated matter with a lengthy history:' Lakeside resolutions remain pending\n\n February 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Environment \n \n 2194\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Although construction for the first set of homes in the Lakeside at Trappe development is well under way — and in some places, complete — project clarifications and efforts to implement county oversight remain to be done.The long-proposed and often contentious development has been the subject of numerous legislative measures since receiving approvals on its plans for wastewater treatment in the last few years.\nAnd now, even with homes already built within Lakeside's first phase, county and state officials are still attempting to clarify some aspects of the development while trying to supervise its impacts on Talbot County as a whole.\nThree pieces of county legislation, each with at least one amendment, remain pending approval from the Talbot County Council.\nTwo are waiting for a finding of consistency from the county's Planning Commission and a recommendation from the county's Public Works Advisory Board, and are set to be discussed at a joint meeting of both bodies on Wednesday, Feb. 7, at 11 a.m.\nUnder state law, the Planning Commission is required to review and certify any amendment to the county's comprehensive water and sewer plan before the Talbot County Council can adopt the measure.\nBut if the Planning Commission can't find the legislation consistent, the council will further delay an already lengthy process of replying to requests from the Maryland Department of the Environment for specific information relating to the development.\nIf adopted, the council will submit the amendments to MDE for final review and approval, fulfilling the request to address the needed information and correct mapping errors in the original legislation approving Lakeside's wastewater treatment plant.\nIn January, Talbot County Council President Chuck Callahan acknowledged the difficulty in following the pending legislation relating to Lakeside, calling it \"a complicated matter with a lengthy history.\"\nThe council is set to hold public hearings on all three pieces of legislation at its Tuesday, Feb. 13, meeting, giving county residents an opportunity to weigh in on the unresolved measures.\nWHAT IS LAKESIDE?First proposed over 20 years ago, the planned 2,501-unit Lakeside development spans more than 850 acres off of U.S. Route 50.\nThe property was annexed into the Town of Trappe in 2003 and approved as a planned unit development in 2006.\nOwned by Trappe East Business Holdings Trust, the development is slated to have a mix of housing types, including single-family homes, townhouses and apartments, and a commercial and retail space.\nThe project's developer, Rocks Engineering, based in northern Virginia, is no stranger to building on the Eastern Shore. The company developed the Easton Club, a 342-unit neighborhood of single-family homes and townhouses.\nEaston-based Rauch Inc. also is working on the development.\nPassing by the site's entrance on Route 50, it's clear that construction is underway, and some homes are already lived in.\nAccording to Erin Braband, Trappe's town clerk, 114 building permits have been issued and 109 connections have been made to the town's existing wastewater treatment plant.\nTrappe's existing plant has the capacity to take on wastewater from the development's first 120 homes.\nThat flow will eventually be diverted to a new wastewater treatment plant serving the development, a plan approved in county legislation and via an MDE wastewater discharge permit.\nRESOLUTION 281Introduced in December 2019, Resolution 281 amended the county's comprehensive plan to reclassify certain portions of the development's property for immediate priority for water and sewer service.\nIt included capital improvements — upgrading Trappe's existing wastewater treatment plant from biological nutrient removal treatment to enhanced nutrient removal treatment to minimize nutrient discharge to the Chesapeake Bay, along with building a new wastewater treatment plant to serve Lakeside.\nThe new plant, set to be built with enriched nutrient removal technology, would use a spray irrigation system to discharge treated wastewater onto nearby fields.\nResidents were uneasy about the then-proposed legislation, which was brought forward based on a draft permit from MDE. Concerns were voiced with water quality, health and environmental impacts and the spray irrigation system.\nBut in June 2020, the Talbot County Planning Commission found the measure to be consistent with the comprehensive plan in a 3-2 vote. And in August 2020, the Talbot County Council voted 4-1 to approve the legislation with an amendment, which split the property into two sections for differences in water and sewer classifications.\nCurrent Council Vice President Pete Lesher was the lone holdout in approving the resolution, citing concerns with connecting the first 120 homes in the development to the town's existing plant, which has been in operation since 2002, before it received an upgrade.\nMDE approved the resolution that November.\nBut in a letter sent that month, the agency told the county that Resolution 281 did not provide the number of equivalent dwelling units for the different phases of the development — information needed for further assessment.\nNo deadline was initially specified for providing the agency with that information, though a push came later.\nIn December 2020, MDE issued a final wastewater discharge permit for Lakeside's new wastewater treatment plant, approving a flow of 540,000 gallons per day — the number the developer requested in its application.\nPUBLIC OUTCRYOpposition to the fully approved wastewater discharge permit came swiftly and strongly.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation and ShoreRivers filed separate petitions for judicial review of the permit, citing concerns with spray irrigation of treated wastewater and specifics of a nutrient management plan not being made available during the permit's public comment period in 2020.\nA form of relief came in the ShoreRivers case in late April 2021 when a Talbot County judge ruled to remand the permit to MDE to hold another public comment period.\nBut the outcry didn't stop there. In May 2021, Easton resident Dan Watson began pushing a petition calling for the council to rescind Resolution 281 without prejudice, meaning that Lakeside's developer could come back and ask for water and sewer approval again.\nResolution 308, the formal legislation proposing the rescission of immediate priority water and sewer approval for Lakeside, was introduced by Lesher in August 2021.\nMDE's public hearing on the draft discharge permit in October 2021 drew more than 100 upset residents to Easton to speak on the development's environmental, pollution and water quality issues.\nThe issue was made more complex when the Talbot County Planning Commission rescinded its approval of the amendment to Resolution 281 in November 2021.\nWhile the legislation to rescind Resolution 281 remained on the table, attempts were made to come to a compromise by proposing ways to lighten the burden of connecting homes to Trappe's existing wastewater treatment plant, ensure that the treated wastewater would meet enhanced nutrient removal standards and give the developer more flexibility in ways to treat the effluent.\nBut ultimately, Lesher pulled his support from Resolution 308 to void the previous legislation, and efforts to compromise failed to garner enough support from the council.\nFrustrated by perceived inaction, county residents, led by Watson, the original petitioner behind legislation rescinding Resolution 281, filed a lawsuit against the Maryland Department of the Environment in May 2022.\nThe lawsuit asked the court to compel the agency to stand behind the Planning Commission's decision of inconsistency and revoke the permit and suspend any work with a sewerage system inconsistent with the county's comprehensive plan.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Talbot County Circuit Court, was dismissed last June.\nIn late October 2022, MDE made a final determination to issue a revised discharge permit for Lakeside, approving a significantly smaller wastewater treatment plant.\nThe revised permit allows for an average flow of 100,000 gallons per day — a sharp decrease from the 540,000 gallons per day initially requested by the developer.\nThe limited flow will allow for only 400 residential units to be built, only a small portion of Lakeside's planned development. Any future expansion of the facility will require a major permit modification.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation's 2021 challenge to the permit was revived after the newly revised permit was issued, but in August 2023, a Talbot County judge upheld the permit's issuance. An appeal of that decision is pending in a higher court.\nIn spite of the permit's final approval, members of the Talbot Integrity Project repeatedly requested the council introduce legislation \"resetting\" the development by recognizing the county planning commission's authority to determine consistency of amendments to the comprehensive plan.\nLesher, who had been asked to introduce the legislation, declined to do so in January 2023.\nThe legislation would not have had majority support from the council, he said, and because the Planning Commission's reversal of its consistency finding on Resolution 281 came after the measure was approved by the council, there would be no effect on what had already occurred.\nHowever, Lesher emphasized the limitations of the final permit dealing a significant setback to Lakeside — a significant win for those concerned about the project's scale and environmental impacts.\nOVERSIGHT EFFORTSWith efforts to \"reset\" Lakeside shut down, attention turned to working on ensuring county oversight to what was already approved.\nLast February, Talbot County Council member Lynn Mielke introduced legislation, known as Resolution 338, amending the county's comprehensive plan to be consistent with the provisions of Lakeside's wastewater discharge permit.\nUnder the amendment, any expansion of the new wastewater treatment plant would also require a new change to the county's comprehensive plan.\nAttorneys for Trappe and the developer opposed the requirement for the developer to come back before the county for future expansion.\nLesher and Mielke introduced an amendment to Resolution 338 in November, which adds language requiring a certification from the Talbot County Planning Commission of an expansion amendment's consistency with the comprehensive plan.\nAmended Resolution 338 was found consistent with the county's comprehensive plan in December, with commission Chairman Chip Councell saying it would be the county's only chance for review of potential expansion.\nBut even though construction is underway, thanks to Resolution 281 and the issuance of the revised discharge permit, the Maryland Department of the Environment is still seeking clarification on some specifics of the development.\nIn a series of letters sent last year, the agency reemphasized the need for the county to provide the number of equivalent dwelling units in each phase of Lakeside to assess the adequacy of the water and sewer system to accommodate and serve the development.\nTwo of the exhibits to Resolution 281 — maps displaying updates to Trappe's proposed water and sewer service areas — were in need of correction, MDE said. The maps showed additional properties not part of the Lakeside development to have incorrect water and sewer classifications.\nThe mapping issues were requested to be addressed in the form of a comprehensive plan amendment.\nThe county debated over the best way to address MDE's requests last summer, eventually settling on tackling them via comprehensive plan amendments, known as Resolution 347 and Resolution 348.\nThe original version of Resolution 347 provides the number of equivalent dwelling units — 2,874 in total across all six phases, with just over 1,200 designated for immediate water and sewer service.\nIt specified that the phases only represent land uses, not timing or sequence of development, and any changes in phasing or allocation will need to be included in amendments reclassifying any phase's water and sewer service.\nThe resolution's first amendment, introduced last November, struck the language on the phases only representing land use, clarifying that all phases not designated as immediate priority for water and sewer service will need to be reclassified before receiving service from Trappe.\nA second amendment, introduced Jan. 23, adds the provisions of Resolution 338 into the legislation.\nLesher described the inclusion of that language as an alternative to help the Planning Commission find Resolution 347 consistent with the comprehensive plan. Without that finding of consistency, the resolution can't be approved by the council, further delaying fulfillment of MDE's requests.\nResolution 348, introduced last September, was described by County Attorney Patrick Thomas as simple clarification and confirmation of the water and sewer classifications of certain parcels unrelated to Lakeside, which were incorrectly shown in two exhibits to Resolution 281.\nA resolution introduced Jan. 16 by all five council members shed light on more than just the unrelated parcels — it clarified the changes in water and sewer service status for some of Lakeside's parcels that weren't clearly specified in Resolution 281.\nMore specifically, the amendment clarified that prior to the council adopting Resolution 281, the comprehensive plan depicted a portion of Lakeside's property as immediate priority for water service, with the remainder designated as unprogrammed.\nHowever, Resolution 281 actually stated that some parcels within that portion were being redesignated from their \"current\" classification of W-2 to W-1, or immediate priority for water service.\nAnd prior to Resolution 281's approval, maps of sewer service areas in Trappe showed Lakeside's parcels as unprogrammed, the amendment said.\nBut Resolution 281 remapped a portion of Lakeside's parcels from their \"current\" classification of S-2 to immediate priority status for sewer service.\nIntended to resolve confusion and uncertainty from the state environmental agency surrounding the classifications, the amendment confirms Resolution 281 amended certain parcels on the town's water and sewer service maps from unprogrammed status to W-2 and S-2 status.\nWith review of Resolution 347 and Resolution 348 by the Planning Commission and the Public Works Advisory Board imminently approaching, the County Council could soon be facing a tough task.\nIf the resolutions, with or without amendments, are found consistent with the comprehensive plan, the council could soon grant approval, finally completing MDE's requests.\nBut if more questions remain, or if the legislation is found inconsistent, the county will return to the drawing board for further consideration and changes. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Plenty of shell'\n\n February 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1066\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — In July, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore signed an executive order to establish an Oyster and Shell Substrate Task Force, created to develop a \"proactive plan to keep and purchase oyster shells to ensure the state has enough hard surface to increase oyster abundance in the bay.\"This was tied in with another executive order of Moore's with the goal to create, \"healthy watersheds that benefit the environment, the economy and communities.\"\nRealizing a hearty oyster production creates cleaner water by filtering excess nutrients and sediments from the water, the task force now meets monthly. They discuss how to produce more oysters, transport oyster shells or talk about using alternative substrate in the water.\nDuring their meeting on Jan. 18, Kent County Commission President Ron Fithian responded to Chesapeake Bay Foundation Executive Director Allison Colden.\nIn a previous meeting Colden said the seed and shell program, which lasted for 46 years, was reported to be a waste of the state's resources.\nFithian refuted that, having observed the success of Maryland's past oyster program, the Maryland Seed and Shell Program, from 1960-2006.\n\"There's no copy of such a report or any facts to back up her statement,\" he told the task force.\nHe drew from his history on the Eastern Shore, urging the members to not accept her research as fact.\nFithian stated during the 46 years of the seed and shell program, the state spent $48 million, planting 190 million bushels of shell. That averaged out to 4.2 million bushels per year. Maryland harvested approximately 60 million bushels of oysters with a dockside value estimated between $400 million to $1.2 billion.\nDoing the math, Fithian said the program was \"hardly a waste.\"\nWhile he had their attention, he warned some groups deliberately deceive the public claiming there's not enough oyster shell in the Bay to place in the water — alternative sources are needed.\nFithian declared that false.\n\"The Bay is loaded with oyster shells from one end to the other.\"\nHe described the process. You find an area with shells with low oyster production and place them in productive areas.\nFithian pointed out there is a great supply of these shells at Man O'War Shoals in the upper bay. A 25-30 year supply even if Maryland decided to plant a million shell per year, he added.\n\"The transportation cost to the state, would be $2 or $4 a bushel.\"\nBut of late, he said, certain groups have taken away \"twenty-five percent of the most productive oyster bottom from commercial fishers.\"\nThey build sanctuaries — areas where the wild harvest of oysters is prohibited, Fithian said.\nAlthough, that may seem like a protective idea, it is not he told the task force.\nDeclaring an oyster bottom a \"sanctuary,\" means oyster bars sit undisturbed. This does not lead to oyster production. Oysters cease production and die of old age, Fithian emphasized.\nAn inactive oyster bed invites filth too, said the commissioner.\n\"Oyster larvae needs a clean shell to attach itself. That's why areas still harvested will generally have a higher spat count (oyster larvae that attach to the shell) more than closed areas.\"\nFithian brought up Harris Creek as a prime example of going from an open seeding area to a sanctuary.\n\"During the seed and shell program, the state would place dredge shell in Harris Creek. Then mother nature would provide it with oyster larvae. Some years the spat count would be between 800-2,000 a bushel. Shells at a specific size, were transplanted to other areas, with a survival rate of 97 percent.\"\nSince it was a highly successful spot, Fithian added, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation turned the area into a sanctuary thinking they'd also be a success.\nFithian called it a failed project.\n\"Spat count is less than 100 per bushel.\"\nThe site sits untouched, collecting sediment, making it unattractive for larvae.\nHe said the foundation was responsible.\n\"They supported spending $35 million and took the greatest natural oyster hatchery on the Bay and ruined it so it can never be a hatchery again.\"\nFithian posed a question to the task force, \"What's more wasteful? $48 million to produce 60 million bushels of oysters over a 47 year span and a dockside value too large to count? Or $38 million for the Harris Creek project alone?\".\nDespite these comments, Fithian remarked he's not completely opposed to sanctuaries. They need to be created using the right substrate, he added.\nThis is not happening and those who are creating sanctuaries continue to repeat the same mistakes.\nMistakes leading to more pollution.\nFithian claimed the foundation applied for a permit to create three oyster reefs in Lynnhaven River. After they did, waterfront residents reported plastic and paper waste. Also the Virginia Institute of Marine Science found, \"polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.\"\nHe said that the foundation was ordered to remove all the junk at the bottom.\n\"Someone needs to explain to these government agencies the Chesapeake Bay is not a landfill. It's the greatest resource the state has and should be treated as such.\"\nHe challenged the task force with a call-to-action.\nStop spreading falsehoods about the lack of natural shell.\nAllow the Department of Natural Resources to open up more areas.\nProvide ample amounts of substrate needed for aquaculture, the oyster industry and restoration.\n\"Stop experimenting with far-fetched ideas that continue to fail time and time again.\"\nAfter his remarks, Colden said she was taken aback, not expecting the commissioner to have so much time for a \"soliloquy.\"\nShe said he wasted everyone's fifteen minutes and encouraged Fithian to look through her research, evidence of her claims, in a Google Drive she shared with the task force.\nLater when Kent County News reached out to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, concerning Fithian's comments, they offered this statement.\n\"The Oyster Shell and Substrate Task Force was created to identify ways to increase the number of oysters in Chesapeake Bay across all sectors — restoration, aquaculture, and the public fishery by addressing the shortage of oyster shell. It will take expertise and cooperation across all groups and stakeholders to create innovative and durable solutions to this challenging problem. CBF looks forward to serving an important role in the task force moving these conversations forward.\"\nThere's no argument that oyster production is good for water health. But there is an ongoing debate about the manner of which that happens, and who gets to decide what's best for the bay.\nChair of the Delmarva Fisheries Association, Rob Newberry, backing Fithian's statements, said his facts and figures can be found in Maryland Department of Natural Resources Shellfish Monitoring and Assessment Program.\nThe task force will continue to meet monthly at: https://go.activecalendar.com/doit-md/event/oyster-shell-and-substrate-taskforce-meeting-3/. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Sara Love (D-Montgomery) is co-sponsored by four Republican legislators from Carroll and Frederick counties. It is cross-filed with Senate Bill 1074, introduced by Sen. Justin Ready, (R-Frederick, Carroll) and co-sponsored by two Democrats and a Republican.\nThe legislation aims to establish an \"industrial sludge utilization permit\" authorizing the Department of the Environment to issue the permits, develop a fee schedule and \"inspect any site where industrial sludge is utilized.\"\nAlthough the legislation's sponsors represent western shore counties, the bill aims to close a loophole of particular concern to Mid-Shore county residents, particularly in Caroline County, where concerns have been raised about the storage of dissolved air flotation residuals, or DAF, and other waste materials.\n\"Industrial sludge that's generated by DAF is the leftover material from poultry, fish and other protein products that rendering companies need to dispose of,\" said Alan Girard, Eastern Shore director at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\n\"The material is tested far less rigorously than other waste like sludge or biosolids from municipal wastewater plants, and its makeup when land-applied is not well understood,\" he said. \"In other words, we don't truly know what's being dumped on our state's farmland and what's ultimately running off into the Chesapeake Bay.\"\nIn mid-December, residents complained to the Caroline County Commissioners about the odor and flies emanating from a DAF storage pit near Greensboro and their fear of contamination of groundwater and waterways.\nSubsequent inquiries and investigation by county staff resulted in a proposed moratorium of DAF residual storage in the county, prompting hundreds of residents to attend a Jan. 23 public hearing in Denton.\nMuch of the DAF residual material is generated and trucked in from poultry and seafood processing plants outside the county.

    "content": "Oxford Residents learn more, ask questions about Strand Beach project\n\n February 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 565\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — Residents packed the Oxford Community Center Wednesday evening to hear about a local shoreline improvement project.The project, also known as the Strand Beach project, was approved in April 2021 and is intended to create a living shoreline.\nA berm has been created, hooks have been placed along the east and west areas to bring sand in, and small islands have been created in the water to reduce the waves that come onto the beach. Low marsh grasses will be planted on the islands.\nExpected to be completed by summer, the project also includes elevating the lowest-lying areas of Strand Road and improving the parking lot by paving it and building storm management areas underneath it.\nAt the Oxford Town Talk event Wednesday, representatives from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, the National Wildlife Federation and the engineering firm Underwood and Associates gave presentations and answered questions. All three of these organizations have partnered with Oxford on the project.\nNicole Carlozo of Maryland DNR, talked about the Resiliency through Restoration initiative. Carlozo said this program, which she manages, helps communities \"become more resilient to climate change\" by providing support for project design and implementation.\nShe said the program focuses on using nature-based solutions to address the impacts of climate change.\nOxford's shoreline improvement project was selected to receive funding for both the design and construction phases through this program. Additional funding for the project has been obtained through a grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.\nIn an interview, Town Manager Cheryl Lewis said the town is still working to get additional funding for the project from the state.\nAmanda Poskaitis, coastal resilience program manager with the National Wildlife Federation Mid-Atlantic Regional Center, said elevating the lowest lying areas of Strand Road and the parking lot will really help reduce flooding. She said the living shoreline is still in place and \"working pretty well\" following intense storms this winter.\n\"I think it's really going to end up benefitting the town in the long run,\" Poskaitis said.\nUnderwood and Associates Partner Chris Becraft delved further into the details of the project, discussing the reasons behind certain design choices. He gave examples of similar projects the engineering firm has worked on, including the living shoreline at Assateague State Park.\nDuring his presentation, Becraft said Underwood and Associates are not going anywhere.\n\"We are here,\" he said. \"And we look forward to hearing from you and working with you all for a successful project.\"\nAfter the presentations, many residents asked questions about the project. Questions ranged from specific design details, to how the project is being financed to how effective living shorelines are.\nMultiple residents asked about the wood placed on the points of the islands to accrete sand over time. One resident expressed concern that the logs could be a safety hazard for kids or for boats.\nBecraft said these logs are an added feature, not an engineering requirement. He said they can go if the community doesn't want them.\nBecraft also said the wood is beneficial when it comes to tidal events.\n\"They're that extra wave attenuater,\" he said.\nOne resident asked about the stability of sand accretion in this project.\nBecraft said that in 30 years, these types of shorelines have \"stood the test of time\" when it comes to sand. He said this is because the design imitates a naturally occurring process.\n\"So that formula — the distance between the island and the beach — that's a natural system,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland Department of Agriculture working to address ongoing DAF issues\n\n February 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Environment \n \n 735\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — The Maryland Department of Agriculture is doing \"everything within its powers\" to address recent concerns with the storage of dissolved air flotation residuals, according to Maryland Secretary of Agriculture Kevin Atticks.Speaking to the Eastern Shore Delegation Friday morning, Atticks touched on the agency's efforts to handle the growing worries with responsible handling and storage of the sludge — an issue that has garnered extensive attention in Caroline County over the last few months.\nDissolved air flotation, or DAF, is a method used to process wastewater from food processing plants. The method leaves behind a sludge-like byproduct, or DAF residuals.\nOn the Shore, much of the material generated from DAF comes from poultry processing plants, though some comes from industrial and wastewater treatment sludge.\nWhen used, managed, stored and transported correctly, there are no issues with DAF, Atticks said. But when it's used against MDA's regulations, issues arise with the smell, making neighboring residents concerned.\n\"What we're learning, what we're all collectively learning, is that for better or worse, one or two bad actors can ruin the entire setup,\" he said.\nAtticks said the agency is working on legislation to answer the concerns, but it's also doubling down on enforcement within its powers. The department is working with the Maryland Department of the Environment as well.\nOn Feb. 5, several state lawmakers introduced legislation aiming to establish an industrial sludge utilization permit. The legislation would authorize MDE to issue the permits, develop a fee schedule and inspect and enter any site where industrial sludge is utilized.\nAccording to the bill, industrial sludge includes material separated from liquid waste through a DAF process.\n\"We've been cooperating with Caroline County and in other parts of the state … to make sure that we're leaving avenues open for this product to be used responsibly and appropriately —where appropriate, when appropriate — but then putting the guardrails on it so that it's not going to cause the problems that it's causing in these minor incidents,\" Atticks said.\nDel. Steve Arentz (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil and Caroline) asked if the Department of Agriculture would look at processes that could turn DAF residuals into energy.\nAtticks said the department is actively exploring the idea.\n\"The poultry producers and other manufacturers who have food residual waste need a place to go, and it's not the landfill, and it's not the rivers,\" he said. \"If it's through this DAF process, that's an option, if it's through a bioenergy generator, even better.\"\nArentz said he'd prefer internal work to solve the problems as opposed to more regulations — a statement the secretary agreed with in part.\n\"The last thing we want is more regulation. We certainly don't mind better regulation,\" Atticks said, adding, \"We have limitations to what we can do and what we can't do, and this is an instance where we have industry come to us to say, 'We need more regulation to ensure that we can do what we're doing responsibly better,' and we can make sure that those who are bad actors are out of the business.\"\nDel. Jefferson Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil and Caroline) emphasized that the application of DAF isn't an issue due to the department's nutrient management plans. The unregulated storage is the problem, he said.\nA former Caroline County Commissioner, Ghrist introduced a bill Friday that would give local governments that own or operate a water or sewer system the authority to enact local legislation relating to DAF storage that is equal to or greater than the state permit requirements for sewage sludge utilization.\nTo Atticks, the goal is to get something \"on the ground\" as fast as possible, whether it's to the counties or state agencies.\n\"...More is not better here, but clearer would help — figuring out a process so that we've actually got the controls that the community feels we should have, and that our industry feels that we should have,\" he said. \"We're doing everything we can to work with the industry on this.\"\nA separate bill involving fines and fees with MDA's programs did have support from the industry, Atticks said, because those who aren't doing anything wrong don't face fines.\n\"This is one of those instances where what we need is clarity, what we need is to run the groove to make sure that we've got the authorities that we need, that MDE has the authority that they need and (that) the counties have the authority they need.\"\nStar Democrat reporter Connie Connolly contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Project to restore Delaware pond doubles in cost\n\n February 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 984\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n NEWARK, Del. — A controversial project to restore a manmade pond just over the Delaware border in White Clay Creek State Park has doubled in cost after engineers determined that more would need to be done to mitigate the risk of a dam break.Last week, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources hosted a virtual meeting to provide an update on the project. More than 70 people attended, including advocates who want the pond to become a fishing destination and opponents who question the logic of spending millions of dollars to rebuild a pond that is not naturally occurring.\nBig Pond, as it is known, is located between Paper Mill Road and Pleasant Hill Road. The pond and surrounding property were once part of a du Pont estate, and the state purchased it in 1993 to become part of White Clay Creek State Park.\nS. Hallock du Pont created the 5-acre pond in the 1950s by damming a stream called Middle Run with the intent to attract waterfowl for hunting. The dam eroded in 2015, and the pond drained.\nA group of citizens, including du Pont's son Richard and longtime park champion Don Sharpe, has fiercely lobbied park officials to rebuild the dam and restore the pond. They envision an area that would attract anglers and bird watchers and proposed making the site handicapped accessible so that disabled veterans can fish there.\nPark officials were less enthusiastic, and Big Pond was excluded from a master plan for the park that was finalized in 2019. At the time, officials said it wouldn't make sense to spend time and money restoring an artificial pond when there are other areas of the park with greater needs.\nHowever, responding to public pressure, the state legislature allocated more than $3 million for Big Pond, and DNREC began preliminary engineering to build the project.\nDuring that process, it was determined that the size of the pond would trigger dam safety thresholds, classifying the dam as either significant or high hazard, said Brooks Cahall, planning preservation and development section manager for DNREC.\n\"This really changes the scope of the project,\" Cahall said. \"It becomes a much different project, and the design changes significantly.\"\nThe old dam was just an earthen embankment, but regulations require that a new dam would need to have a wider footprint, flatter slopes, a clay core and riprap to prevent erosion. Once built, the dam would require regular inspections.\nThe changes push the total cost of the project to $6 million, double the original budget, officials said.\nJason Coleman, from the consulting firm RK&K, said a high-hazard designation doesn't mean that there is a high risk of the dam failing but rather that if the dam were to break, there is a risk of damage downstream.\nModeling shows that in a catastrophic storm, such as a hurricane, a dam break could trigger flooding on Paper Mill Road, Paper Mill Park and a small portion of the Middle Run Crossing neighborhood.\nRegulations would require the dam to have an emergency action plan and a plan for ongoing maintenance.\n\"Not only do we have to understand the risk, but we have to plan for emergencies and how we're going to deal with that,\" Cahall said.\nThe project would also require significant tree removal because trees and their roots can damage the structure of a dam.\nSeveral people who attended last week's meeting spoke passionately about their desire to see the pond restoration come to fruition.\n\"This pond would provide enough water that you could actually have good populations of sport fish,\" said Desmond Kahn, a retired fisheries biologist. \"The other ponds in the park, except for one, are tiny. They're too small. They don't support populations of fish.\"\nWhile the state park is popular for trout fishing in the spring, Big Pond would provide fishing opportunities in warmer weather. Kahn noted that several years ago, more than 2,000 people signed a petition in favor of upgrades to the park, including Big Pond.\n\"The goal was that once it was constructed, the programs for handicapped people to fish could use this pond,\" he said. \"Right now, they have very limited, tiny ponds. It's actually dangerous, because there's so many of them who are casting over each other's heads.\"\nOthers, however, questioned the need for the pond and whether it is the best use of resources in the sprawling state park.\n\"It's been mentioned that there's a lot of public support for this. I do not see that. I think there's strong opposition to this from everyone I've talked to, including a lot of the park staff, who probably are keeping their mouth shut,\" said Ken Cox, a longtime park volunteer. \"Given how much effort we've put into trying to keep the park naturalized, and I'm out there ripping invasive species out, the idea of losing that many trees, I don't even know why this is being considered.\"\nHe and others asked why Big Pond has received so much money from the state while there are a number of higher-priority White Clay Creek State Park projects still waiting for funding.\n\"I would love to know who is pushing for this funding so that I can bother them. Because it's obviously not you,\" Cox told the DNREC officials. \"Someone needs a talking to.\"\nDNREC officials repeatedly dodged those questions, saying only that they are doing as directed by the state legislature. They also sidestepped a question about whether they think recreating an artificial pond is as environmentally responsible as letting the area revert to its natural state.\n\"This is one of those situations where, from a parks perspective, we've been given a project and a task to do and we're just working toward that direction,\" Cahall said.\nHe said engineering and design will continue on the project, but construction cannot begin unless additional funding is secured.\n\"We wanted to be transparent and clear with you all, the local residents and park users, about where we are and some of the challenges we see with this project,\" Cahall said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Birders from all over the world went out to see what was flying and then sent the data via eBird, the world's largest database of birds, back to Cornell University.\nBirders identify different species using many criteria, like song, flight pattern and distinctive markings.\nThe birds rarely sit still to be counted, but bird counting efforts can help indicate species health and range, birders said.\nBirding discoveries can reflect climate change and loss of habitat. For example, for the first time ever, it is warm enough to find glossy ibis in Maryland. This bird is more commonly found in Florida.\n\"Good data goes to eBird. It is an international database that is free for the use of the scientific community. What we are doing as citizens goes to enrich the scientific information. eBird started roughly 20 years ago. This weekend is a citizen science weekend. There are maybe 50 people from Talbot County participating. Some on walks like this — we had 24 at Pickering Creek on Friday. And some just in their backyard,\" said Wayne Bell, PhD, as he ventured out with the group Sunday.\nBell, who teaches a class on Birds and Birding on the Eastern Shore at the Chesapeake Forum, likes birding because it gets him outside with a bunch of nice people.\nWhat looks like a brown lump in deep camouflage is an identifiable species to him. There is a skilled eye and ear to develop in birding.\nWhat birders discover varies greatly based on location and season, he said.\n\"We are right in the shoulder. The waterfowl are leaving and the spring migration hasn't quite started yet. We are looking at the dead of winter,\" Bell said.\nBy coming together globally, birding groups help gather useful local data that is aggregated by eBird into a global picture.\n\"There is a paper that came out in 2019 that got a lot of traction that documents the decline in North American bird populations by a third. We have lost 30% of our birds in the last 50 years. Loss of habitat. They didn't go anywhere, they are gone,\" Bell said. \"The global warming thing is kicking in in the last 50 years. Most of it is loss of habitat. One exception to that has been waterbirds.\"\nThe person leading the frigid morning count Feb. 18 was Bettye Maki, president of the Talbot Bird Club.\n\"The Great Backyard Bird Count lasts for four days. For all the four days, you could do it everyday. I have gotten feedback from the eBird people. They have people who monitor, and if they don't agree or they think you are wrong about something, they let you know. They are very helpful. They give me more information,\" Maki said.\nShe has traveled all over the world to see birds and has 700 species identified. She saw around 30 to 40 on this bird count.\nMaki said she likes to encourage new birders. She will give a talk at the Chesapeake Forum in the spring about her trip to Borneo.\n\"You have to like to be outdoors. There is the camaraderie and the ability to learn while seeing and doing this. There is the diversity of what you are seeing. It is like an Easter egg hunt. It is just fun,\" Maki said. \"It is like fishing — some days are good and some days it isn't. But you always have a wonderful day outdoors. I always feel better for doing it.\"\nTalbot County Bird Club has 80 members.\nAnother member of the Bird Club is Dave Burgevin. Not only was he geared up with a 500mm lens and binoculars, but he could convincingly call out to the birds in their songs, chirps and shrieks.\n\"I started learning the calls when I was 10 with Cornell birders. So it was like learning an instrument early. My dad got me into birding before I was six. I learned to tell the difference in the calls. I have continued to lead bird walks over the past 30 years in Maryland and Northern Virginia,\" said Burgevin.\nHe said the bird count is important.\n\"It is a worldwide effort to learn about migration and species decline or increase,\" he said\nHe has numbers backing up his passion.\n\"There are about 400 species available in Maryland including migration. There is about 888 available in the US. The country with the most is Columbia at about 1,800. There are just under 10,000 worldwide,\" said Burgevin. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Maryland lawmakers urge Congress to spend more on Chesapeake Bay restoration\n\n March 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: YESENIA MONTENEGRO and BRENNAN STEWART Capital News Service | Section: National \n \n 608\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Citing encouraging signs of improvement, five Maryland lawmakers expressed their support Wednesday for increased funding of the federally-backed Chesapeake Bay restoration program.\"We've made progress,\" Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) said at a luncheon hosted by the Choose Clean Water Coalition. \"We have the least amount of dead zones that we've seen since the 1980s on the bay. We have underwater grasses that are coming back in the Chesapeake Bay. We have oyster crops that we never thought we'd be able to see starting to bloom in the Chesapeake Bay. We're not at our historic levels, not even close. I understand that. But we've made progress.\"\nThe coalition, which was started in 2009, hosted its 13th annual Chesapeake Bay Day on Wednesday with nearly 100 of its members and nine members of Congress in attendance. Made up of over 290 nonprofit organizations from the Chesapeake Bay region, the non-profit advocates maintaining or increasing spending on clean water programs.\n\"I think the Chesapeake delegation in Congress is just so passionate about this work, and they understand the benefits to their districts and the people that live there,\" Kristin Reilly, director of the coalition, told Capital News Service.\n\"I think that's also why there's such wide bipartisan support for these programs because they can actually see the benefits in their communities,\" Reilly added.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Program, which receives funding from the Environmental Protection Agency, was started in 1983, with its main efforts directed towards reducing pollution and restoring the bay's ecosystem.\nThe program encompasses six states that surround the bay as well as the District of Columbia, and its funding needs were at the forefront of the coalition's lobbying day. Over 70% of the program's funds are spent on projects in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, including planting trees, reducing runoff from farmland and boosting the crab and oyster populations.\nThe coalition highlighted the recent introduction of the America's Conservation Enhancement Reauthorization Act of 2024, which authorizes funding for various programs, including $93 million in funding for the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program for the 2025 fiscal year and $100 million for 2026 and beyond.\n\"This bill (the ACE Act) is going to get the bay on track,\" Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.) said. \"Some of the things that these grants do, like sediment reduction, really make a difference in helping the Chesapeake Bay.\"\nThe coalition also is backing $15 million for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Watershed Investments for Landscape Defense program, which provides grants to local organizations in the Chesapeake region that focus on restoring or protecting wildlife habitats.\nThe coalition recognized Ruppersberger, Cardin and Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) as \"Chesapeake Champions\" for their contributions to the restoration efforts throughout their careers.\nRep. David Trone (D-Md.), who is running for the U.S. Senate, said he plans to continue working to protect the bay if he wins the seat.\nPollutants need to be kept out of the bay and the efforts towards no-till farming have not been as successful in Pennsylvania and Virginia as in Maryland, Trone said. No-till farming is a technique used to grow crops without disturbing the soil.\n\"The environment is top of the list,\" Trone told CNS. \"So the environment and the bay, that's the very very top of the list. If you don't get that right, nothing else matters.\"\nAfter the luncheon, coalition members had scheduled 44 meetings with members of Congress, presenting letters from 169 organizations that endorsed the coalition's appropriations requests.\n\"We have to both maintain the momentum, but we also need to accelerate our efforts even further,\" Sen. Van Hollen (D-Md.) told CNS. \"That means making sure that we protect and expand the resources that go to protect the bay from all the federal agencies.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "House Environment and Transportation Committee hears proposed DAF storage bill\n\n March 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 530\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Del. Jeff Ghrist has withdrawn a bill that would have given local jurisdictions the authority to regulate the storage of dissolved air flotation by-products, or DAF residuals.Dissolved air flotation is a method used to process wastewater from food processing plants. The method leaves behind a sludge-like byproduct, or DAF residuals.\nOn the Shore, much of the material generated from DAF comes from poultry processing plants, though some comes from industrial and wastewater treatment sludge.\nIn a letter to Del. Marc Korman (D-Montgomery), the chair of the Maryland House of Delegates Environment and Transportation Committee, Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) withdrew the bill he had introduced, House Bill 1404, and said he believed another bill, House Bill 991, would accomplish the same goals he is seeking if it is amended.\nHouse Bill 991, which is sponsored by by Del. Sara Love (D-Montgomery), would establish an industrial sludge utilization permit administered and enforced by the Department of the Environment.\nIn his letter, Ghrist said the current amended version of HB991 clearly \"aims to give the necessary control to local governing bodies.\"\nGhrist took issue with how DAF is defined in this version of the bill. He said in the letter that DAF is being defined as an agricultural food processing residual, and as an agricultural operation, when it should be defined as industrial waste.\n\"This definition is important because any agricultural operation falls under the protection of the state's Right to Farm statute, and restrictions imposed by the local governing body could be challenged in court based on the protections granted by the Right to Farm,\" Ghrist said in the letter.\nGhrist said he he would like HB991 amended to separate DAF from other agricultural waste products \"because it also includes other waste products that are not generated within the agricultural industry.\"\nA hearing on HB991 was held Feb. 28, according to the Maryland General Assembly website. A second reading of the bill has not yet occurred. A hearing was held Tuesday for a cross-filed version of the bill, Senate Bill 1074, according to the General Assembly website. A second reading of that bill has not yet occurred either.\nIn an interview Thursday, Ghrist said he suspects the HB991 will get passed in the House before the 2024 legislative session ends on April 8. There has been a commitment from the Environment and Transportation Committee regarding this bill, he said, and when bills get support from the committee, they usually pass in the House.\nIn a Feb. 21 interview with the Star Democrat, Ghrist said he had introduced HB1404 to make sure that local governing bodies could put restrictions on the storage of DAF residuals \"without any ambiguity.\" He said he wanted to ensure that if anybody decided to sue Caroline County, the case would not have any standing in court.\nCaroline County Commissioners have been dealing with concerns regarding DAF storage since December. According to previous Star Democrat reporting, in late February, the commissioners voted to adopt four resolutions designed to give them time to study the issue of storing DAF residuals and other materials in the county.\nThe moratoriums address issues the County Commissioners learned about in December, when residents complained of possible illegal storage of DAF residuals. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This time around, have Easter fun that leaves a mark on memories and not on the planet.What goes into creating memorable Easter fun? Plastic eggs and baskets, fake grass and candy wrappers probably aren't at the top of the list. If you're buying disposable plastic every year only to throw it away once Easter is over, then you might want to learn about alternative, fun and eco-friendly Easter festivities.\nSay no to single-use plastic\nFor many Americans, spring flowers or warmer weather may not be the first signs of Easter's approach. Instead, your initial reminder about the upcoming holiday likely comes from the shelves of your local Target. As retailers begin stocking Easter-themed holiday items, you might feel tempted to pick up a bunch of cheap plastic eggs and Easter decorations while running other errands. It's hard to resist the allure of making your Easter egg hunt a little bit easier to plan.\nUnfortunately, what begins as an impulse purchase often ends up in the landfill. Those plastic eggs, which look so tempting on display in stores, lose their appeal once the holiday is over. Many families may not have the space to store bulky Easter baskets or piles of crumpled plastic grass. Since most of that plastic can't be recycled, according to Nature World News, families simply throw it away.\nWith 81% of Americans celebrating Easter, according to Statista, those individual choices can add up quickly. UN experts are sounding the alarm about the toxic tidal wave of plastic, such as toys, bags and other products that end up contaminating the environment. In a recent statement, UN's David R. Boyd and Marcos Orellana warned that \"the contribution of plastic pollution to climate change is alarming, yet often overlooked.\"\nThe good news is that it's possible to have beloved Easter festivities without all that waste. For many Christians, the real meaning of Easter isn't buying and discarding a jumble of single-use plastics. Instead, the holiday is a time to reflect upon core Christian values of sacrifice and simplicity.\nEco-friendly Easter activities for kids\nWith a little creativity and planning, you can introduce fun Easter activities that don't involve spending money on wasteful plastic products. Instead, hop into an Easter celebration that's kind to your wallet and the Earth. Here are some ideas to get you started.\nOutdoor Easter scavenger hunt\nIn a twist on classic Easter egg hunts, don't send your kids out searching for plastic eggs. Instead, organize an outdoor Easter scavenger hunt with fun riddles as clues. Have meaningful prizes at the end of the hunt.\nEaster baking\nDitch the individually wrapped Easter candies and bake some Easter treats together as a family. Cookies, wrapped in paper or stored in jars, are a great gift to share with loved ones.\nDyeing hard-boiled eggs\nDid you know that dyeing real hard-boiled eggs is way more fun? It's easy to use natural food dyes, like onion skin or turmeric. And because these dyes are natural, you can eat the eggs as part of your Easter menu, so nothing goes to waste.\nGardening\nEaster is all about celebrating new beginnings. Planting seeds or seedlings with kids is an engaging activity that is also environmentally friendly.\nDIY-ing instead of buying\nDIY instead of buying your Easter baskets this year. Egg cartons, old newspapers and magazines can all be used to make Easter baskets and decorations.\n\"One of our family's favorite activities to do on Easter is crafting,\" says Siobhan Alvarez-Borland of Mimosas and Motherhood. \"From keepsake handprint or footprint crafts to utilizing found materials from an outdoor nature hunt to create a spring collage, this family crafting time has become one of our most treasured traditions.\"\nIf your kids are old enough, encourage them to get involved in planning and choosing eco-friendly options for Easter. This will not only help kids understand the importance of sustainability, but it's also a great way to get them excited about celebrating holidays in a way that doesn't damage the planet.\nTips for reducing waste during Easter celebrations\nNo matter how you celebrate Easter, there are lots of ways to reduce waste. Start by taking stock of what you already have. You may turn up a box of Easter decorations you didn't know you owned, avoiding the need to purchase something new. Or, consider connecting with other community members who are also celebrating Easter to swap supplies.\nWhen you're putting together Easter baskets, don't forget about your local thrift store. Thrift stores often have a plethora of wicker baskets available at low prices. These higher-quality reusable baskets can be saved and re-used from year to year, avoiding waste. If you own a shredder or a pair of scissors, you can easily create your own recyclable paper grass — an alternative to plastic Easter grass.\nVisit your local retailers to check out eco-friendly alternatives to Easter-themed plastic products. Recyclable paper eggs, which are great for decorating the house or an Easter egg hunt, are becoming increasingly available in stores. Also, use eco-friendly basket fillers, like tickets to zoos or museums, seed bombs and wooden puzzles.\nThe positive impact of eco-friendly Easter fun\nInitially, a low-waste Easter might seem like added pressure during an already busy time of celebration planning. But, as you implement the tips suggested in this article, you might be surprised at how sustainability becomes less of a chore and more of an integral part of your family values. You'll quickly appreciate the liberating feeling of having less plastic waste cluttering up your home post-celebration.\nDeveloping sustainable holiday traditions reduces waste and minimizes your family's environmental footprint. When you engage in eco-friendly activities it's an opportunity for family bonding while also setting a great example for children. Avoiding consumerism on Easter is the perfect way to be grateful for what you already have, placing the focus firmly on Easter's true meaning.\nBefore you know it, as your kids enjoy an outdoor Easter scavenger hunt, you'll be hunting for more ways to keep your family's life eco-friendly beyond Easter — and the planet will thank you for it.\nTamara Tsaturyan is the owner and writer of Thriving In Parenting, a website focused on providing simple tips for busy parents — easy and healthy recipes, home decor and organization ideas and all things parenting. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They also added more gravel to a ramp to level it and improve accessibility to a photo blind located off Wildlife Drive.\nBoy Scout Keegan Hulett, 14, is on his way to becoming an Eagle Scout, and this project is a step toward that achievement.\nHe said the entire experience was \"very fun.\"\nAlong with his fellow Scouts, Hulett was surprised about how long the owl boxes will last on the refuge.\n\"We thought it would last only two or three years,\" he said, \"but apparently, it'll be set for the next 15 years.\"\nBlackwater Wildlife biologist Holly Keepers said successful nesting rates have been decreasing for barn owls.\n\"By having these structures put up, we're giving the barn owls more options,\" she said. \"And they're able to hopefully — in the future — have more nestlings and more babies than before.\"\nNot only did the Scouts mount the boxes on the refuge, but they also built them.\nHulett's mother, Jeannie VanDyke, said the boys spent an entire Saturday at her dad's house building the barn owl boxes according to the specs that Blackwater sent them.\nKeepers said the refuge really appreciates community service projects like these.\n\"We love projects like these at the refuge,\" she said. \"But unfortunately it takes a lot of time and money, and wood is very expensive now. So having these projects, especially with people being able to come out and enjoy the day on the refuge, it was really, really nice.\"\nKeepers said the new boxes are bigger and better than before.\nThe work to the photo blind ramp was an addition to the owl box project.\n\"Most (Boy Scout) troops are pretty large,\" VanDyke said. \"So when Keegan went to the Scout board to tell them about the project that needed to be done, they weren't sure if it was enough for an Eagle project. So Keegan asked Blackwater if there was anything else the boys could do in addition to that.\"\nHulett encouraged others to consider becoming a Scout.\n\"Anyone who's looking to go into the Boy Scouts, you should definitely consider it,\" he said. \"It's really fun.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot council considers $100,000 to oyster credit program\n\n March 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 482\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — At a Tuesday evening working session, the Talbot County Council discussed the potential to fund Oyster Nutrient Trading credits and reviewed draft cannabis legislation.The Talbot County Council is considering allocating $100,000 to the Talbot County Oyster Nutrient Credit Pilot Program. If approved, the council will allocate $500,000 over five years for the program.\nNutrient credit trading allows municipalities and businesses to meet water quality permit requirements using oysters' pollutant-filtering capabilities to remove nutrients from the water.\nIn 2016, the Chesapeake Bay Program approved the use of oysters as a best management practice for nutrient reduction requirements for aquaculture. This practice removes nitrogen and phosphorus through aquaculture and generates tradable credits.\nCredits are generated when oysters are harvested from leased areas or public fisheries. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources verifies the harvest. Credits must be purchased in a 2:1 ratio to offset one pound of permitted pollution.\nThe program aims to plant oysters through the public fishery pilot to generate credits starting in year three. The county could use this program to offset agricultural pollution.\nThe $100,000 would initially fund two parts of the oyster nutrient credit program: the post-harvest credits from aquaculture leases and a new public fishery pilot program.\nPost-harvest credits involve purchasing credits already generated when oysters are harvested from leased areas. The pilot program would include investing in planting oysters in designated public oyster bars normally open to fishing.\nThe allocations between these two programs must be determined in consultation with the County Council. If funds are allocated, it will support local watermen and generate credits that could offset pollution from other sources like agriculture.\nCANNABIS\nThe council reviewed the state's limits on cultivation, processing and dispensary cannabis licenses. Patrick Thomas, county attorney, emphasized that cannabis dispensaries in Talbot County must not be unduly burdensome on cannabis businesses.\nThe council reviewed draft legislation about cannabis and the changes made by the county.\nThe council added language to regulate the zoning distance between dispensaries and preexisting schools, child care centers, places of worship, libraries, public parks and other similar buildings. Dispensaries would need to be at least 500 feet from these locations. This was not originally in state law but was added in the county ordinance.\nThere were distance restrictions for other dispensaries to be at least 1,000 feet — or just under a quarter mile — from each other.\nThomas noted a pending state bill that, if passed, may change the distance restrictions applied to dispensaries. House Bill 805 will alter the distance restrictions applicable to a licensed cannabis dispensary. If this bill passes, the required distance between dispensaries could change from 500 feet to 2,000 feet.\nThomas told the council that they are waiting until after April 8 to incorporate changes from the state legislative session into the county's proposed cannabis zoning bill. The state legislative session is scheduled to adjourn on April 8, so the county may better align with any relevant changes to the state law. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There will be no future for striped bass, or the charter captains and watermen who rely on them, if we stick with the status quo.Striped bass are key to Maryland's ecosystem and economy, especially in places like Kent County, as described in Will Bontrager's recent article. Which is why new regulations adopted by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) are so important.\nWhile fishermen may still be catching trophy stripers, there are very few juvenile striped bass to replace them. Juvenile striped bass numbers in Maryland have been far below average for the past five years. Bontrager's article notes this, stating, \"In October 2023, according to the DNR, the results of the annual juvenile striped bass survey found the worst recruitment in Maryland since 1957.\"\nThe species is in dire need of conservation and keeping populations at a sustainable level will require long-term, cooperative solutions.\nASMFC reports that striped bass removals, which include harvested fish and catch and release mortality, were up 33 percent in 2022. Unsustainable fishing levels, paired with reproductive failure, habitat loss and climate change, have left the striped bass population extremely vulnerable.\nIt is ASMFC's responsibility to act on these very concerning losses, and economic impacts are carefully considered as part of their fisheries management plan.\nAfter the 1985 moratorium, the species was able to rebound relatively quickly. Striped bass, and those who value them, won't have that luxury this time with the added stress of increased habitat loss and climate change. Those stressors, paired with invasive predators like blue catfish, will make it extremely difficult for the species to recover. If we want to preserve the fate of striped bass, charter boats, and watermen, we need action now and foresight for the future.\nALLISON COLDEN\nChesapeake Bay Foundation \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The organization intends to increase and improve stormwater treatment practices on the Severn River, which flows into the Chesapeake Bay in Annapolis.\n\"Agendas matter, elected officials matter, vision matters,\" Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Virginia) said. \"For the sake of the country, thank God we have the 117th Congress and Joe Biden to sign those bills into law.\"\nAttending the ceremony were not only federal officials and members of Congress but also legislators from state and local governments around the Chesapeake Bay.\nLibby Garvey, chair of the Arlington County Board, said funds are going to be used in her community on a small tributary called Grandma's Creek.\n\"(The Grandma's Creek project) is a great example of community involvement and advocacy for a beloved neighborhood stream,\" Garvey said. \"This project is going to propose the installation of rain gardens to better manage stormwater and increase the protection of the creek.\"\nIn addition to rain gardens, the Arlington community will also have the opportunity to participate in organized tree plantings and pop-up educational events centered around nature, Garvey said. The funds for these projects will be derived from the Small Watershed Grants Program, one of three grant programs administered by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, which is to receive $193 million of the $206 million.\nThe NFWF already has announced it will be giving $1 million to farmers in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, with the intention of implementing high-priority conservation practices that improve water quality.\n\"There are 40,000 farms in Pennsylvania, and many of them contribute nutrients and sediment to the bay,\" Rep. Don Beyer (D-Virginia) said. \"So anything we can do to get Pennsylvania on board with Maryland, Virginia and Delaware will be incredibly important.\"\nThe Chesapeake Bay Trust, another non-profit grant-making organization, will receive the remaining $13 million from the EPA. The trust will use the money to assist local organizations involved with improving the bay.\nThis could include providing operational infrastructure like computers and other hardware, or funding employee training and professional development sessions.\n\"We have to do better on agricultural runoff, and we have to do better on stormwater runoff. We do well on sewage treatment and on other point source pollution,\" Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) told Capital News Service. \"This $200 million is going to be heavily focused on grants that focus on non-point sources, and we should continue to see significant improvements.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Onlookers will even have the chance to meet and get a selfie with Oscar the Osprey, enjoy live music and move through nature activity stations.\nAlthough the event will take place at Drum Point Park, there is limited parking in the neighborhood and those planning to attend should park at Patuxent High School in Lusby and take the courtesy shuttle to the park.\nAdmission is $10 per single individual attendees or $20 for an entire family. Also, guests should keep in mind that there are absolutely no pets allowed on site, with the exception being for service animals.\n\"One thing that people should realize is that the osprey is not only an amazing bird, but also vital to the Chesapeake Bay and surrounding ecological system,\" said Sal Icaza, the driving force behind the outset of the Maryland Osprey Nature Festival in 2022. \"Each winter they basically migrate to South America, but they always return right around St. Patrick's Day and they are truly amazing to watch any time of day.\"\nIcaza noted that ospreys derive \"99%\" of their diet from fish and they can be seen diving toward the surface of the water for a catch from morning to sunset.\nFellow organizer Rick Smith commended Icaza for his work organizing the annual event and admitted that he also has a genuine bird's eye view of the ospreys from his home. He said the birds never cease to amaze him.\n\"Each year once the ospreys return from their migration south to the Chesapeake Bay they truly are exceptional birds to behold,\" said Smith, who noted the ospreys have rebounded from declining numbers in the 1970s after pesticides were reduced.\n\"They are able to dive into the water at perhaps 40 miles per hour and dive well below the surface to catch fish,\" he said. \"They rarely come up without something in their talons. Whereas bald eagles dive down and basically skim the surface of the top of the water for their catch, ospreys can dive well below the surface and come away with a fish.\"\nIf you go\nThe third annual Maryland Osprey Nature Festival will be held at Drum Point Park on Saturday, April 6, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Parking for the event is scheduled for Patuxent High School, located at 12485 Southern Connector Boulevard in Lusby, with a courtesy shuttle provided.

Unlike other animals that hibernate during winter months, reptiles and amphibians brumate, and when they wake up from their brumation period, they start to move in search of food, a place to warm up, search for new mates, new territory and new nesting sites.\nMaryland's Eastern Shore holds 14 of Maryland's 19 turtle species. Turtles are classified as aquatic, semi-aquatic or terrestrial. Only the Box Turtle is considered a full-time terrestrial, spending its entire life on land.\nHere on the Eastern Shore, as soon as temperatures break the 50 degree mark, turtle activity increases. As turtles emerge from winter brumation sites, they can be seen basking in the sun to warm themselves. Turtles are ectothermic (cold-blooded) and their activities and movements are determined by the surrounding temperature. By mid-April, it's not uncommon to see turtles moving about, sometimes crossing roadways.\nSadly, many turtle species are struck by vehicles as they try to cross roads. Beyond the threat of vehicle strikes, turtles are also threatened by climate change, shoreline armoring (like riprap), rising sea levels, and poaching.\nSo why do Turtles cross the road? Most turtles cross roadways in search of nesting sites, so ensuring their safe passage is crucial in supporting the turtle's future. While most turtles are aquatic or semi-aquatic, they all need higher and drier ground to lay their eggs.\nIf you see a turtle crossing a roadway, you can help, but it's important to know a few things, take a few precautions, and most importantly, be safe.\nFirst, if you can help a roadside turtle, it's important that you help turtles cross in the direction they're going. Smaller turtles like Box Turtles or Sliders, can usually be helped easily enough, just be cautious. Never relocate turtles to different regions and never keep them as pets. According to Maryland DNR Herptologist, Beth Schlimm, \"…all turtles, especially Box Turtles, have a limited range and spend their entire lives in a pretty small area. If a turtle is moved to a new location, it may attempt to navigate back to their original territory, increasing the chances of being harmed or killed.\" It's ok to help turtles cross the road, but never relocate them to unfamiliar surroundings and always be careful.\nHelping Snapping Turtles cross roadways requires a little extra care. Snappers have sharp claws, a nasty bite, and quick reflexes, so be cautious! They also will hold in place when they feel threatened. If you want to attempt to move a Snapping Turtle, it's best to use gloves and hold the turtle on the backsides of its shell. Never move or lift a Snapping Turtle by its tail. Doing so can cause major skeletal damage to the turtle. There are online videos on how best to move Snapping Turtles.\nTurtles will typically lay their eggs between June and September. If you find a turtle digging a hole and depositing eggs, it's best to observe from a distance, but do not disturb or touch a nesting turtle. All turtles, even aquatic turtles, lay their eggs on land. They search out higher ground away from water. Wet turtle eggs result in poor incubation and low survival rates. Homeowners will sometimes find turtles laying their eggs in garden mulch or sandy soils. The incubation period for most turtle eggs is about 60 days.\nFor shoreline residents and recreational crabbers who have crab pots hanging on their piers, make sure your crab pots have a Crab Pot Turtle Reduction device. Maryland DNR officers will be on the look-out making sure crab traps are in compliance. These devices are necessary to prevent air breathing turtles from drowning in crab traps.\nTurtles are an important part of Maryland's diverse ecosystem and we can all do a better job of helping our turtle species. The turtle's future is dependent on us.

    "content": "Listening at the Talbot County Free Library\n\n April 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Life \n \n 935\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n We live on a two and a half acre wooded lot. The northern end of the property is marked by a ridge that stands some fifty feet above sea level, an elevation seldom encountered in Talbot County. From there, the ground descends slowly but surely toward the southern boundary, the wetlands bordering the Choptank River.When asked if we have waterfront property, we always smile and say, \"No, but it is at least marsh-front.\"\nAbout halfway down the property, two streambeds enter our lot, one running along its eastern edge, and the other its western. The peaty floors of the valleys channeling these streams form two elongated wetlands. Our house sits on the spit of high ground separating the two valleys. I like to sit out on the southern end of this peninsula and look out over the spot where the two streams and their valleys converge into a single larger wetland.\nAs a result of its topography, our small piece of land is blessed with a number of different habitats: a mixed upland forest of loblolly, oak, beech and hickory, with a darker understory of holly; a middle elevation consisting of more holly, tall and short bush blueberry, mountain laurel, sassafras, black and sweet gum, and the occasional, cherished, crane fly orchid; and then, further down, at the lowest elevation, wetlands comprised of bay magnolia, shad bush, pinxter azalea, ironwood, green ash, maple, spice bush, fern, wild rice and swamp iris. In the summer the foliage becomes jungle-thick, blocking our view of the distant river, but we don't mind: the fragrances are heavenly.\nWhen I sit out on the point overlooking the confluence of our two streambeds, I like to close my eyes and try to identify the sounds happening around me. In addition to all the bird calls (147 species and counting), these may include the seesawing, rasping song of a gray squirrel, the drawn-out, rubbery chupting of leopard frogs, the high-pitched yodeling of a dog fox, the double-stomp and snort of a white-tailed deer or the rustling in the leaf litter that signals the presence of a snake or mouse.\nOnce I heard a raccoon give a most un-raccoon-like call, a call which — had I not watched the raccoon make it — I would have attributed to a coyote.\nOn another occasion, way off to the west of me, I began hearing a low whisper, like the noise air makes when it leaks slowly from a puncture. Focusing on the gentle hissing noise, I realized its decibel level was growing second-by-second, becoming now the sound of a distant breeze, now that of a crowd of people speaking just beyond the range of understanding.\nThe crescendo reached its peak when a great horned owl burst from the trees on my right pursued by a swirling comet's tail of angry complaining chickadees, titmice and nuthatches.\nI'm reading a wonderful book about sound just now, David George Haskell's \"Sounds Wild and Broken,\" which I checked out through the consortium of libraries that allows Talbot County Free Library card members to check out books, DVDs and audiobooks from any library on the Eastern Shore.\nAs with all good science books, Haskell's has enriched my enjoyment of the natural world. Now, when I sit out there at the end of the high ground and notice the surface of the water at the foot of our point roiling with small spawning fish, a part of me thinks that, instead of calling them banded killifish or golden shiners, I should refer to them as brother or sister fish. For Haskell has taught me that each of us carries within us the inheritance of their and our marine ancestors.\nWhen the first fishes crawled up out of the sea to become terrestrial animals, they carried with them, like the aqualungs we use to return to the sea, a portion of their watery environment. Thanks to the extraordinary organ known as skin, each of us still carries a semblance of that ocean environment within us; we remain, in essence, walking containers of our ancestors' liquid world.\nWe humans owe our ability to hear to three small bones in our inner ears, one of which began its evolutionary journey as part of a fish ancestor's gills. These bones transmit sound vibrations from the outside world to the ears' nerve center, the cochlea, a snail-like organ filled with, yet again, a sea-like liquid. Basically, when we sit by the fire and listen to a Bach toccata, we listen to it using ocean water and fish bones.\nTwenty-eight years ago, shortly after we moved into our house, I was sitting out on the point listening to all the birdsong incited by the first warm day of spring when I heard a call unlike any I had ever heard before.\nUp until that point, I had lived most of my life in urban settings, so I was eager to identify the more natural sounds belonging to the landscape around our new home. I turned my chair toward the noise, which seemed to be coming from beyond the woods on the other side of the valley east of me, and focused on it. It was a high-pitched call, like the laughter of a woodpecker but less harsh, and there seemed to be more than one animal producing it.\nAfter a moment's perplexity, I smiled. On a property upriver of us, two or three little girls were playing a game, perhaps jump-rope, their squeals of delight floating down to me on the moist, fragrant early-spring air. For the first time in my life I had heard human voices as animals must hear them: strange and wondrous, alien and alive. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some animals respond and some don't. Right now, it's a question that nobody seems to have a complete answer to.\"\nThe Texas A&M researcher said animals at a zoo in South Carolina showed varying reactions to an eclipse in 2017 — including some that began nighttime preparations, some that looked to the sky and others who displayed signs of anxiety or unusual activities.\n\"Researchers saw giraffes suddenly start running around their pen,\" Dykes said. \"Some of the male gorillas became more aggressive. These were some of the anxiety behaviors.\"\n\"For birds, they would suddenly go to nest and then a few minutes later, when the sun came back out, they would seem to start their day all over again,\" he said. \"There's no telling what's running through these critters' minds when, suddenly midday, the sky goes dark. Their environment is always having an influence, whether through rain, temperature, wind speed, the amount of sunlight or the length of day. Wildlife are deeply in tune with their surroundings.\"\nResearchers from other universities as well as students and teachers from high schools will also be studying animal and wildlife behaviors.\nThat includes a contingent from North Carolina State University who will be part of a research effort at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas during the April 8 eclipse.\nAdam Hartstone-Rose, a biology professor at North Carolina State, was also at the Riverbanks Zoo and Garden in Columbia, South Carolina in 2017.\nHe's excited for the 2024 total solar eclipse to see how animals react.\nThe researchers welcome input from others who see how farm animals, dogs and cats and other wildlife react during the cosmic happening.\n\"We're interested not only in figuring out which animals react to the eclipse and how, but (to) what extent of totality is necessary to cause a reaction,\" Hartsone-Rose said.\n\"We're really excited about getting data from people that might be at farms or cattle ranches,\" he said. \"We're hoping that people will go out into the woods and see what squirrels, deer and birds are doing. And I'm really excited about people just observing their pets in their backyard.\"\nThe eclipse will be visible to varying degrees across the U.S. with a path of totality where the moon will completely darken the sun for three to four minutes stretching from Texas and Oklahoma and into Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, upstate New York and New England.\nOvercast conditions and stormy weather could impact how visible the eclipse is in parts of the country — including Texas and Ohio.\nIt will be the biggest eclipse in the U.S. since 1806 and there will not be another similar event until 2044.\nZoos — especially those in or near the totality path of the eclipse — will also be hosting special events for visitors Monday. That includes ones in Indianapolis, Toledo, Ohio, St. Louis and throughout Texas.\nThe eclipse comes after a 4.8 magnitude earthquake hit Friday in New Jersey near New York City. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland legislation regulating DAF storage passes through General Assembly\n\n April 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: General Assembly \n \n 729\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On Saturday, Maryland lawmakers voted to pass a bipartisan bill to address the state's authority to regulate the storage of dissolved air flotation byproducts, or DAF residuals.If signed into law, this would be a victory for some residents of Caroline Country, who have been advocating for more regulations concerning DAF storage. The bill is currently awaiting final approval by Governor Wes Moore to sign into law.\nDissolved air flotation is a method for processing wastewater from food processing plants. The method leaves behind a sludge-like byproduct, or DAF residuals.\nOn the Shore, much of the material generated from DAF comes from poultry processing plants, though some comes from industrial and wastewater treatment sludge.\nThe bill refers to the material as \"food processing residuals,\" which it defines as \"an organic material that is generated by processing agricultural commodities for human or animal consumption.\"\nAccording to a 2023 study by the University of Maryland, more than half of the industrial sludge land applied in Maryland in recent years came from other states. In Maryland, it is an approved soil amendment or fertilizer.\nAlan Girard, Maryland advocacy director at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said that if not properly regulated, overapplication and mishandling of this material could risk local water quality and Bay health.\n\"Improper handling and application of industrial sludge cause it to spill and run off directory into our local waterways and ultimately into the Chesapeake Bay,\" Girard said. \"It's also a major concern for the Marylanders living near these sludge application and storage sites that drink well water and live off the land.\"\nThe state legislation will close a loophole in state oversight and keep Maryland on par with neighboring states, according to a press release by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\nThe bill, House Bill 991, and its paired Senate bill, 1074, aim to establish a food processing residuals utilization permit authorizing the Department of Agriculture to issue the permits, develop a fee schedule and inspect any site where food processing residuals are utilized.\nMaryland does not currently require a permit for DAF residuals.\nIf the new legislation is signed into law, counties will still be able to issue their own regulations when it comes to utilizing food processing residuals, though they must comply with state regulations.\nHB 991 and SB1074 will do the following:\nRequiring a utilization permit for the use, storage and hauling of food processing residuals in the state.Ensuring local governments issue all necessary approvals before someone can utilize food processing residuals.Authorizing the Maryland Department of Agriculture to enter and inspect any site where food processing residuals is used.Increase penalties for users who willfully violate Maryland's nutrient management regulations.\nThis bill is significant to the residents of Caroline County who have raised concerns about the storage of dissolved air flotation residuals and other waste materials.\nIn mid-December, residents complained to the Caroline County Commissioners about the odor and flies emanating from a DAF storage pit near Greensboro and about their fear of groundwater contamination and waterways.\n\"Caroline County has no authority to prohibit the application of DAF to farmland and the MDA and MDE do not regulate the storage of DAF residuals; therefore, Caroline County is not preempted by the State regarding the storage of DAF residuals,\" Daniel Fox, deputy county administrator, said.\nSubsequent inquiries and investigation by county staff resulted in a proposed moratorium of DAF residual storage in the county, prompting hundreds of residents to attend a Jan. 23 public hearing in Denton.\nThe Caroline County Commissioners introduced legislation on Feb. 6 to establish four moratoriums related to DAF residuals, vegetable processing wastewater and the storage of biosolids not permitted by the Department of the Environment.\nThe moratoriums aimed to buy the county more time to decide how it wanted to regulate the materials. In the meantime, state legislators worked to pass the House and Senate bills through the General Assembly.\nCommission Vice President Larry Porter said he met with Del. Sara Love (D-Montgomery), Alan Girard, Eastern Shore director at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, and a Caroline County Department of Planning and Codes representative to discuss the draft legislation at the state level.\n\"It's a bill that will hopefully give us some more control over where the material is stored, which is what we're looking for,\" Porter said at a meeting of the Caroline County Commissioners April 9. \"It does address transportation, and it does address application through the nutrient management plan, which we were interested in anyway.\"\nReporter Maggie Trovato contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Wild turkey numbers are falling in some parts of the U.S. – the main reason may be habitat loss\n\n April 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Marcus Lashley and William Gulsby The Conversation | Section: Environment \n \n 1264\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Birdsong is a welcome sign of spring, but robins and cardinals aren't the only birds showing off for breeding season. In many parts of North America, you're likely to encounter male wild turkeys, puffed up like beach balls and with their tails fanned out, aggressively strutting through woods and parks or stopping traffic on your street.Wild turkeys were abundant across North America when European settlers arrived. But people killed them indiscriminately year-round — sometimes for their meat and feathers, but settlers also took turkey eggs from nests and poisoned adult turkeys to keep them from damaging crops. Thanks to this unregulated killing and habitat loss, by 1900 wild turkeys had disappeared from much of their historical range.\nTurkey populations gradually recovered over the 20th century, aided by regulation, conservation funding and state restoration programs. By the early 2000s, they could be found in Mexico, Canada and every U.S. state except Alaska.\nNow, however, the trend appears to be reversing in some areas. In a 2021 study, eight out of 30 states surveyed reported that turkey populations declined from 2014 to 2019, with some of the sharpest decreases in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana and Oklahoma.\nTurkey numbers increased in 14 states, mainly in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. But even in many of those states, populations were down from historic peaks in the early 2000s. Another study in 2023 reported that turkey populations in the eastern half of the U.S. were declining by about 9% yearly, based on data from the past 50 years.\nWe are wildlife ecologists working to determine why turkey populations are shrinking in portions of their range. This is a classic challenge in ecology: Many factors could be at play, and it takes careful analysis to untangle them and figure out whether each trend is a cause or symptom — or just irrelevant.\nWe created the Wild Turkey Science podcast to make peer-reviewed science accessible to the public and provide a platform for turkey researchers and biologists to discuss their work. So far, we have reviewed numerous studies and interviewed scientists from more than a dozen states. Here are some hypotheses that have emerged:\nFewer open spaces\nWhile turkeys may appear at home in urban areas, their habitat is open forest — areas with sparse trees that allow near-full sunlight to reach herbaceous plants at ground level. Most uplands, or elevated areas, in the eastern U.S. historically were this type of dry-adapted woodland, savanna and grassland complex.\nIn 1792, naturalist William Bartram described the eastern U.S. as \"Grande Savane,\" or big savanna, a landscape with abundant wild turkeys. Traveling in Florida, Bartram wrote:\n\"I was awakened, in the morning early, by the cheering converse of the wild turkey cocks saluting each other from the sun-brightened tops of the lofty cypress and magnolia. They begin at early dawn, and continue till sunrise. The high forests ring with the noise of these social sentinels, the watchword being caught and repeated, from one to another, for hundreds of miles around, insomuch that the whole country is, for an hour or more, in an universal shout.\"\nToday, very little woodland or savanna remains in the U.S. Most of it has been cleared for development, farming or livestock grazing. The open spaces that are left often are not suitable for wild turkeys: They need a well-developed layer of vegetation at ground level that includes mainly wild flowers, native grasses and young shrubs and trees to provide cover for nesting and raising their young.\nVery few of the remaining lands suitable for wild turkeys are managed using frequent, low-intensity prescribed fire, which creates and maintains a mosaic of open forest and grassland by continually setting back growth of trees, shrubs and vines. Suppressing fire in these forests across the eastern U.S. allows them to change from open forest dominated by fire-adapted grasses and wildflowers to closed forests with dense canopies, creating shady, moist conditions with minimal vegetation near ground level.\nTurkeys can persist in these denser, shaded forests, but they don't reproduce as successfully, and fewer of their young survive. The lack of ground vegetation makes it hard for hens to hide their nests, and it limits food supplies for young turkey poults.\nThis isn't just a problem for wild turkeys. Over the past 50 years, populations of bird species that live in open forests and grasslands have fallen by more than 50%. Grasslands and savannas support hundreds of other wild species as well, many of which are declining.\nThe roles of food, predators and hunting\nScientists have proposed other explanations for turkey declines, but many of these hypotheses are at least partly habitat issues.\nFor example, blame is often placed on more abundant predators that eat turkey eggs, such as raccoons and opossums. But these predators probably are more abundant in part due to changes in turkey habitat.\nFor example, a 2024 study found that a range of mammals that eat turkey eggs were observed 70% of the time when prescribed burning was not used, but were observed less than 10% of the time in open forests where planned burns were conducted biannually. This suggests that prescribed fire across the wild turkey's range creates an environment that's more favorable for turkeys than for their predators.\nSome observers have suggested that turkeys may be so abundant that the landscape can't support their current population, so now they are declining to a more sustainable level. If turkey habitat remained stable, we would expect to see their numbers go up and down naturally, but their average abundance over time would remain the same. Instead, turkey numbers appear to be slowly but steadily falling in many areas — perhaps signaling that habitat availability is declining along with turkey populations.\nWhat about food supplies? Young turkeys feed on insects, so insect declines may explain some observed changes in turkey populations. According to one calculation, land-dwelling bird species that depend on insects as food have declined by 2.9 billion individuals over the past 50 years, while those species that don't have gained by 26.2 million individuals.\nInsect losses could explain why fewer turkeys are surviving to adulthood, but insects depend on plants, so this shift is likely also linked to habitat changes. And where land is managed to promote native flowers and grasses, there also are abundant pollinators, ants, grasshoppers and spiders that turkeys relish.\nLastly, some observers have proposed that the timing of hunting could be affecting turkey reproduction. However, a recent study in Tennessee found that this was not the case. Another recent study showed that hunters in the Southeast were harvesting about the same share of male turkeys as when turkey populations were growing rapidly. If current turkey harvest rates are unsustainable, the explanation is likely that wild turkey productivity has declined for other reasons, such as habitat.\nCreating space for turkeys\nLand owners can help by managing for native grasses and wildflowers on their property, which will provide breeding habitat for turkeys. We have produced podcast episodes that discuss which plants are valuable to turkeys and other wildlife, and how to promote and maintain plants that are turkey-friendly.\nPeople who don't own land can support state and local efforts to restore wildlife, contribute to local wildlife conservation groups and buy hunting licenses, which help to fund wildlife management programs. With the right conditions, this iconic North American species could thrive yet again.\nThe Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.

    "content": "Lives depend on effective shoreland protections\n\n April 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ELLE HOGAN | Section: Columns \n \n 719\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Have you ever taken a sip of water, a taste of food or a breath of air and wondered if it was safe for your health and the environment? As a local who grew up on the Chesapeake Bay, I have watched firsthand as the water quality has worsened, water levels have risen and temperatures have skyrocketed.From swimming in pools instead of the Miles River to rarely seeing tubes or water skis on the water anymore, I always wondered what was causing such detriment to our water. Beyond the vast beauty and productivity of farmlands lining the shores of the Chesapeake Bay, the root cause of water pollution in the bay is harmful nutrients sourced from agricultural farm runoff.\nAgricultural runoff is the leading cause of water pollution in the United States, threatening our water, food and air quality. The truth is, we are still not doing enough without effective policies to prevent our water quality from worsening, as bay water continues to threaten human health and environmental safety.\nWithout a shoreland protection policy to safeguard this issue, this problem is only progressing further, and water quality improvement goals are capable of being met. This environmental issue requires immediate attention because the current rate of detriment polluting the Chesapeake Bay water that we boat on, fish, crab, and oyster and hope to swim in and drink from safely is causing more harm than good for society.\nExcess nutrients from farm runoff in the Chesapeake Bay have long-lasting effects: killing marine life, polluting swimming areas and drinking water, flooding properties and homes, and causing many health problems. These dangers also harshly target low-income and minority communities, who often experience disproportionate harm from pollution and other\nenvironmental threats. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation's annual water quality report cards well document the extent of the bay's problems and current conditions, which are evidently not improving. Strict legislative change must be made because a safe environment, clean water and clean air are rights that need to be shared and fought for when threatened.\nIn order to create accurate and involuntary change, the Chesapeake Bay bordering states need to implement a shoreland zoning policy to enforce the protection of bay water quality from the threats of agricultural runoff. In environmentally unique yet critical areas like the Chesapeake Bay, the government must fund efforts to protect these crucial, indeed life and death, natural assets.\nFarmers cannot and should not be burdened by the costs of such programs. Citizens have a constitutional right to a dependable food supply, safe water and clean air, which requires the government to legislate and fund these efforts properly.\nA policy that has proven effective for New England states that Chesapeake Bay states could implement is Maine's Mandatory Shoreland Zoning Act. This act uses mechanisms to protect land near lakes, ponds and rivers from pollution and other environmental challenges. Creating a \"Maryland Mandatory Shoreland Zoning Act\" will enforce Chesapeake Bay farmlands in Maryland to administer shoreland zoning ordinances that regulate land use activity within 250 feet of horizontal distance from the water to eliminate any possible farm runoff.\nAlthough making a shoreland zoning policy in Maryland could temporarily set back the productivity of farms within these newly zoned shorelines, nonmonetary sustainability costs, water quality and health safety outweigh any monetary costs and consequences. Protecting the future of local Chesapeake Bay community health, marine life and environment safety must be our priority over financial gain. Despite commendable voluntary efforts by organizations like the Chesapeake Bay Program, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Environmental Engineers, the scale of the problem exceeds the current goals, highlighting the need for an enforceable policy.\nImplementing a shoreland zoning policy may initially pose challenges and incur costs, but the long-term benefits to community health, marine life and environmental safety far outweigh the financial considerations. Chesapeake Bay watershed states like Maryland must consider enacting a Shoreland Zoning Act through the state legislature, with support and guidance from state environmental agencies. By prioritizing the protection of the Chesapeake Bay through proactive policy, we will ensure a safer and healthier future for all.\nElle Hogan is from Chevy Chase, Maryland, and grew up spending weekends and summers in Easton at her family's home on the Miles River.

There was also bird song from the woods and the sound of bullfrogs from the pond.The crowd was large, with 300 tickets sold for the event. Multiple environmental groups and government agencies hosted information tables.\nEastern Redbud saplings were given out for attendees to plant at home by Francis Smith of the Maryland Forest Service. There were master gardeners and monarch butterfly experts. A birding trip led into the forest in the morning.\n\"Earth Day heightens our awareness and appreciation. It is joyful and good to get out. And it is fun to host this site to share with other local nonprofits,\" said Ginna Tiernan, executive director of Adkins.\n\"It reminds us to breathe, step out in nature. It is incredible for your soul, your brain,\" Tiernan said. \"It is amazing how clear you can think after a walk in the woods. I took a walk the other day, and a pileated woodpecker just swooped down in front of me. There were pine warblers in my ear. It is just affirming too that we are here on Earth with all of these animals, and we are a part of them.\"\nAdkins celebrated the global holiday a little early this year, with Earth Day actually falling on Monday.\nEarth Day is an annual event on April 22 to demonstrate support for environmental protection. First held on April 22, 1970, it now includes a wide range of events coordinated globally.\nJay Falstad, Adkins Arboretum board member and Executive Director of Queen Anne's Conservation Association, was using yellow and orange chalk to create a big sun at the arboretum's entrance.\n\"Earth Day is the one thing that we all share. We all share the same air, water and the same planet. We should all have an investment in protecting it,\" Falstad said.\nThere were many people who have worked hard to make this event happen. Not just organizing and planning but executing a fun educational experience.\nJenny Houghton, assistant director of Adkins Arboretum, said, \"We are partnering with other environmental organizations. We thought it would be nice to show people that we are all working together. We have Pickering Creek, Tuckahoe State Park, Maryland DNR, Bartlett Tree Experts, Shore Rivers, Talbot County Master Gardeners and Phillips Wharf Environmental Center.\"\n\"The highlight is getting people outside to celebrate nature together and listening to great music, eating local food and hopefully scooping up some tadpoles in the wetland. It is good to remind ourselves that the Earth is worth taking care of, because it is all that we have got,\" said Houghton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Shore Rivers issues report on Sassafras River water quality\n\n April 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 759\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BETTERTON — Each year, ShoreRivers, a nonprofit with the mission to protect and restore Eastern Shore waterways through science-based advocacy, tours locations along the four main watersheds on the Eastern Shore: the Sassafras, Chester River, Wye River and Choptank.They present their data to the residents in that region in a report card.\nAs scientists, they inform residents of their area's water quality index and bacteria count and on what species are thriving, while providing methods on how to maintain the shared watershed.\nTheir first stop this year was along the Sassafras, in Betterton, the \"jewel of the Chesapeake.\" On April 17, concerned residents gathered at the Betterton Volunteer Fire house, where local wine, drafts and oysters were served.\nShoreRivers had some good news and bad news for those gathered, delivered by Sassafras Riverkeeper Zach Kelleher and Chesapeake Conservation and Climate Corps member Autumn Conley.\nThe good news is the water has a high quality in and around Betterton beach, the lower Sassafras area, indicated on their report card with a green color, Kelleher explained. But the upper Sassafras, was not as clean, indicated on the graph by a yellow color.\nOverall the water quality level in the Sassafras received a B- grade.\n\"We're doing well, but definitely have room for improvement,\" Kelleher told the audience.\nThe scientists now have 65 water monitoring stations, and from April to October, they will be testing for water temperature, salinity, water clarity and nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus.\nComparing the data to the report card from 2022, they've decreased 2 to 3% at almost every level, Kelleher noted.\nBoth he and Conley chalked that up to a dry year combined with climate change and increased runoff from fields, roadways and open spaces.\nIn their estimation, that led to an increased salinity, (saltiness) in the water, which throws off a freshwater ecosystem.\nConley backed up her coworker's statements, declaring 2023, as the \"summer of salt.\" Speaking with scientists from the University of Maryland, she observed that the high level of salinity affected many organisms in local watersheds.\nProbably the largest noticeable one was the Eastern oyster. It thrives in saltier water, so it increased in population in 2023. Conley quoted the Department of Natural Resources fall report that the spat (baby oysters) count was four times more than the median of 39 years.\nHowever, saltier conditions can lead to more parasites and diseases like MXS, Multinucleated Sphere Unknown and Dermo, she noted.\nSpecies like dolphins are being seen more and more in the bay too. She said it could be because of the bay's saltier conditions, or it could be they're simply following their prey, or it could be because there are more dolphin-sighting websites and public interest than ever before, increasing the reporting.\nShe sees the emergence of white shrimp now as evidence too. Presently, watermen are catching them for commercial use whereas commonly grass shrimp used to only inhabit our waters.\nNot every organism likes the salt, she indicated. Sea nettles retreated from the mouth of the river, moving up the bay. The American Lotus bloom' numbers dwindled in number as well, although there were still sightings.\nBut, in a positive light, the invasive plant the nonprofit's been fighting, the water chestnut, does not like the increased salinity.\nIn fact, Conley pointed out, only 100 pounds was found in the Sassafras last year.\nThey showed various slides of volunteers and staff with smiling faces, pulling up invasive plants and clearing out the watersheds.\nThey like what they do but it's a daunting task. Year after year, it gets harder to clean the bay, the team acknowledged.\n\"Bottom line, Kelleher said, \"the waters are polluted.\"\nNo matter what grade was given.\nAnd the bacteria count is something they have to keep an eye on too.\nEach season, their volunteer \"swimtesters\" test for bacteria pollution at shoreline sites use a pass/fail system to determine the level of risk.\nIn 2023, Sassafras sites passed 87% of the time, and Bayside Creeks 95% of the time.\nThe team said cleaner water is what all Marylanders want, and stressed that getting out unbiased, scientific-based information to the public is essential.\n\"You can't protect what you love if you don't know to protect it,\" he said.\nAnd as always, ShoreRivers realized one of the great protectors of the water.\nThe volunteer of the year award went to Anne Stevens. Kelleher joked, \"the only thing more persistent than water chestnut, is Anne Stevens.\"\nShoreRivers Executive Director Isabel Hardesty thanked those in attendance, saying this will be a pivotal year for river restoration. In the upcoming years, she said to expect their goals to become more defined as they focus on what sets ShoreRivers apart from other conservation organizations. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland team on NASA project to study oceans, atmosphere\n\n April 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KATHARINE WILSON Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 752\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — To better understand the ocean surface, NASA scientists went to the stars.The Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite launched into orbit on Feb. 8 on a quest to better understand the microscopic content of Earth's atmosphere and oceans.\n\"This mission is really the search for the invisible,\" NASA project scientist Jeremy Werdell told Capital News Service.\nTwo Maryland teams — from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County- and a team from the Netherlands Institute for Space Research and Airbus Netherlands B.V., each worked on one of the three instruments on the satellite.\nScientists can use PACE's data, which was first released on April 11, for both short-term monitoring and long-term climate change analysis, according to Werdell. PACE is set to send data back to Earth 12 to 15 times every day.\nThe satellite, which is around the size of a minivan, is designed to orbit the Earth for at least three years, but Werdell said the mission might last longer.\nThe Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), a project of the Goddard team, will help researchers identify the species of phytoplankton in the oceans by looking at the color of the water across ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared light.\nPhytoplankton are a diverse range of plant-like microscopic algae living mostly on the surface of the ocean, according to the project website. While many species of phytoplankton are harmless and are key photosynthesizers, others create toxins harmful to humans and marine life.\nPACE data could help inform water quality managers, as well as the fishing and recreation industries, about the type of phytoplankton in their regions in a more sophisticated way than ever before, Werdell said. From previous satellites, he said, scientists were only able to tell where a community of phytoplankton was, not the type of phytoplankton.\nOCI's use extends beyond the ocean. The instrument's color analysis can be used to track vegetation on land and atmospheric particles, according to project science lead for the mission, Amir Ibrahim.\n\"If you'd like to breathe and eat, OCI can help us understand,\" Ibrahim said. \"OCI is not only going to tell us how the food chain works (and how) the phytoplankton distribution works, but also …climate change.\"\nThe project will give new insight into how climate change is impacting phytoplankton, and thus the rest of the planet, according to Ibrahim. Phytoplankton produce around half of the oxygen on Earth, according to the Scripps Institute of Oceanography.\nTo get to the ocean however, scientists must clear the light-reflecting haze between the ocean and the orbiting satellite.\nThe two other instruments — the HARP2 and SPEXone — are polarimeters, which focus on light bounced off of particles. Both polarimeters, the latter from the Netherlands team, identify particles in the atmosphere.\nA team from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County built the HARP2, which is focused on identifying the size and content of particles in aerosols and clouds.\nVanderlei Martins, the director of the Earth Space Institute and a physics professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, said he hopes the HARP2 will be used by other scientists to better understand how the atmosphere interacts with the ocean and land.\n\"My hope is that the UMBC contributions … will help scientists around the world … have a better understanding of our planet and how it works,\" Martins said. \"It's adding another piece of information to the puzzle.\"\nThrough the HARP2, scientists can see the size and content of atmospheric droplets.\nThe PACE project is years in the making, Werdell said. He joined the project in 2015, just after it was officially launched, but PACE had been discussed for over 20 years.\nWerdell, Martins, Ibrahim and most of the team who spent countless hours working on the satellite all anxiously awaited the launch from the Kennedy Space Center at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\nMartins was standing with his team on launch day, all intensely watching every update, from the launch until they saw in a live video that their instrument was still tightly secured to the satellite's side after the launch, and finally when the first transmission came in from space.\n\"It's very emotional, every single step,\" Martins said.\nAfter launch day, the team spent months processing and inspecting the quality of the data until it was ready to be released to the public earlier this month.\nIbrahim said that the day the team finally got its hands on the first round of PACE data felt like Christmas morning.\n\"I was like finally, I can see the data, and I really almost teared. That data is really very special,\" Ibrahim said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Frog’s loud call lets the world know he’s ready for love\n\n April 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Kathryn Reshetiloff | Section: Environment \n \n 805\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For some, robins are the first sign of spring. But the changing of the seasons may be more accurately forecast by songs from a wet forest floor.On a warm night, wander near any fresh water and you'll likely be serenaded by a chorus of tiny spring peeper frogs. Their song, which to some people sounds like sleigh bells, signals the winter's end and the arrival of spring.\nMost of the year, spring peepers live in the forest. Adhesive pads on their toes make them expert tree climbers. Peepers are brown, gray or olive and sport a dark cross in the shape of an X on their backs. These tiny frogs, only 0.75 to 1.5 inches long, can jump up to 28 inches, more than 20 times their body length.\nFrom February to March, spring peepers leave the trees to mate in open water. Forested wetlands are their main breeding sites. Because forested wetlands are subject to periodic flooding, they form temporary ponds, known as vernal pools. These ponds may last from a few days to a few weeks and are critical to the life cycle of many amphibians, including spring peepers. Forest wetlands also contain a rich food supply.\nSpring peepers breed a week or two behind wood frogs, and their timing sometimes overlaps, but they're easy to tell apart. The wood frog's mating call is lower pitched, not unlike the quack of a duck. But the peeper's call, as the name suggests, is high-pitched: a short, urgent, ascending whistle.\nBecause of the species' vast range, it is one of the most recognizable frog calls in North America — from the Maritime Provinces to Manitoba in Canada and the entire eastern half of the U.S., and as far south as central Florida and as far west as Texas.\nAs the vernal ponds appear in early spring, the males arrive first and start their incessant peeping, which can be heard as far as a half-mile away. The calls attract females, who make no calls of their own.\nAll frogs produce calls by moving air back and forth over their vocal cords, which causes them to vibrate and produce sounds. Spring peepers also have stretchy vocal sacs that amplify their calls. The male inflates its vocal sacs by pushing air through slits in the floor of its mouth. As it calls, the inflated sacs resonate the sound. Peeping is loudest on relatively warm nights and all but stops if the temperature drops below 30 degrees.\nAfter the female has chosen her partner, he latches onto her and fertilizes the eggs — as many as 1,300 — as she releases them, singly, to settle on underwater vegetation. This can take an entire day and, after the work is done, both males and females return to the trees.\nSpring peepers, like all frogs, toads and salamanders are amphibians. The Greek word amphibious means beings with a double life: aquatic and terrestrial.\nAfter two or three weeks, tiny tadpoles, less than 1/5 of an inch long, emerge from the eggs. Tadpoles are exclusively herbivores, feeding by inhaling water and filtering out blue-green algae. One ounce of tadpoles can remove algae from 12 gallons of water every day.\nIn about five months, tadpoles metamorphose into adults. Gills are replaced with lungs, legs grow and tails are reabsorbed into the body. Adult frogs are primarily insectivores, so a tadpole's intestines shrink, and its mouth becomes large enough to eat and digest insects. The new generation leaves the water for the forest, reaching sexual maturity in three to four years.\nAdult peepers eat whatever animals they can find, as long as it's small enough to fit in their tiny mouths. Insects are the staple of their diet. Peepers, in turn, are food for birds and small mammals.\nDuring autumn, peepers may sometimes call from the woods. This is known as the fall echo. Scientists speculate that light and temperature conditions, similar to those in the spring, stimulate the peepers to call — though it doesn't lead to mating. Spring peepers hibernate during winter under logs and tree bark. A high concentration of sugar in their blood helps peepers survive harsh winter temperatures.\nAlthough spring peepers have a large range and are not considered threatened or endangered, they are subject to the same threats that plague other amphibians.\nLoss or fragmentation of both woodlands and vernal pools can reduce populations. Many adult frogs return to the ponds where they were born to breed. If these natal areas are disturbed or lost, those amphibians will not seek another pond. They simply won't breed.\nProtecting forested wetlands and woodlands is the first step to preserving amphibian populations. Adults require wooded tracts as adults, but they also need access to vernal pools. Rivers and floodplains provide excellent corridors that connect isolated or fragmented woodlands, allowing amphibians to move between existing woodlands and wetlands and helping to ensure healthy and diverse populations. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The organization's advocacy work, which is led by your Riverkeepers, is fundamental to creating systemwide change to protect our local rivers against the major issues that impact water quality on the Eastern Shore. As a leading voice for the waterways of the Eastern Shore, we amplify our work through local and statewide coalitions, working groups and other positions of influence.\nOver the past 90 days, your Riverkeepers engaged with 60 environmental bills covering a wide array of topics including permitting for industrial sludge, abandoned vessels, enforcement activities in the critical area, invasive species control, underwater grass protections and more.\nTogether, ShoreRivers, environment advocates, and legislative committee members reviewed and discussed the findings of the Chesapeake Bay Program's CESR Report (a comprehensive evaluation of system response), which influenced many of the environmental bills passed this session and will continue to shape the way we prioritize restoration and Bay health goals for years to come.\nAfter months of hard work and productive conversations, the following slate of bills has now passed from the assembly to Gov. Wes Moore's desk to await ratification (or veto):\nShoreRivers priority and leadership bills:\nSB653/HB1101– Clean Water Justice Act, which gives communities impacted by water pollution the ability to enforce state water quality protection laws against polluters.SB1140/HB807 — Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) Surveys, which updates regulations that govern how the Maryland Department of Natural Resources currently maps and delineates SAV Protection Zones.SB1144/HB1266 — Clean Water Commerce Account Contracts for the Purchase of Environmental Outcomes, which clarifies language regarding payment schedules for an important funding source for pollution-reducing projects.SB1074/HB991 — Agriculture Food Processing Residuals Utilization Permit, which strengthens regulations for transporting, storing, and the land application of industrial sludge residuals.\nOther passing legislation supported by ShoreRivers:\nSB0268 — Critical Area Program EnforcementSB0281/HB0109 — Alteration or Removal Requirements for Submerged Aquatic VegetationSB0178/HB0022 — Requirements for State Highway Administration on Pollinator Habitat PlanSB0306/HB0233 — Climate, Equity, and Administrative Provisions to the Critical Area Protection ProgramSB0969/HB1165 — Whole Watershed Act\nHalf of ShoreRivers priority bills had bipartisan sponsorship, showcasing that protecting our rivers is a goal everyone can get behind. Many bills supported by ShoreRivers this session were brought forward by various state departments such as the Critical Area Commission, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Natural Resources, showcasing the Moore- Miller administration's commitment to improving Maryland's environmental protections.\nShoreRivers is grateful for all of our environmental partners this session — including Waterkeepers Chesapeake, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Citizens Campaign for the Environment, Arundel Rivers Federation, Maryland League of Conservation Voters, Potomac Riverkeeper Network and Clean Water Action — as our collective voices can make Maryland's waterways cleaner and more accessible for all.\nShoreRivers implements restoration projects throughout our communities, engages volunteers in tree plantings and oyster growing, and reaches thousands of students each year through environmental education programs in local schools. Our advocacy at the local, state and federal level ensures that all of those endeavors can continue in order to support water quality improvements.\nBethany Ziegler is communications director for ShoreRivers. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

For the Washington College Campus Garden Club that's not just a seasonal thing.They, and residents interested in sustainable living practices, gathered together for a monthly potluck dinner April 12 — a Permaculture Potluck, this time held at the community garden on campus.\nPresident of the club, Jo Perkins described permaculture as a, \"smash of two words, permanent and agriculture.\"\nShe explained, \"It's essentially a set of 12 design principles and three fundamental ethics: earth share, people care and fair share. It's a way to design your systems to be good for humans and for the environment simultaneously.\"\nFor member, Justinian Dispenza, permaculture is a way to get back to our growing roots.\n\"Let's get our feet in the dirt. Eat local and help heal. Everyone is capable of fixing where they're at.\"\nThe space itself is a good indicator of this lifestyle in practice.\nSince its early roots in 2012, when students put in some vegetable beds and trees, the club has grown significantly. The space now has a fenced area with a coop of happy chickens, a renovated pond, a bridge over a little waterfall, a mud pizza oven (primitive earth oven), a beehive, an insect hotel (for pollination purposes) some fruit trees, some buckthorn trees, and some compost piles.\nThis all lies beyond the painted wall on campus. A surreal area, especially surrounded by brick dorm buildings and cars chugging by.\nPerkins said, \"It's really impressive how far the space has come.\"\nShe pointed to her first project she started, over the fence where a scarecrow in Perkin's clothes is humorously referred to as 'The Scare-Jo,\" towards the chickens.\nThere are eight chickens in total, among them Black Jersey Giants, a Leghorn, some Easter Eggers, a Rhode Island Red and a Favorolle.\nAs nature teaches lessons, Perkins described permaculture at work inside the coop.\nShe said that chickens eat bugs which have nutrients, then chicken manure fertilizes the fruit trees, then the chickens eat some of the apples that grow, becoming a catalyst for compost and finally humans eat the nutritious eggs.\nEverything in nature harmonizes.\nShane Brill the permaculture educator at Washington College called it applied common sense.\nHe's been introducing these concepts to his classmates and the've been acting on them, which has produced incredible results.\nThe growing principles and rural way of life is something that Kent County and Eastern Shore residents know about already, so the club hopes to keep good camaraderie with the public.\nBased on the laughter and fellowship it's effective.\nDispenza, who takes the lead in the potlucks, said they always start with people introducing themselves and their field of interest.\nFor example, he said, one could say 'I'm a bee keeper,' and from there, the crowd would learn about another facet of sustainable living.\nAs it stands, the garden has plenty of green space for people to congregate, and they're building a new addition, a section for poetry, for classroom instruction and planning events.\n\"There's a lot of potential for things to come in and do a lot of cool things,\" Perkins commented.\nDispenza and company are always working on more activities for community engagement. They have master gardeners come in, and community events as well as volunteer with the Chestertown Garden Club on various projects.\nBut they are always looking for more people with knowledge on growing, planting, building, producing, harvesting, foraging, or anything else like that.\nDispenza said if anyone is interested in hosting a permaculture potluck, he encouraged them to reach out. He stressed the importance of going to different places in the county to learn, since no two areas are alike.\n\"There's a lot of great people in Kent County and Eastern Shore Community that know about sustainability. I'm here to learn,\" Dispenza said.\nThe next potluck is May 5, at 6 p.m. at Kentmore Park.\nPeople can check out www.facebook.com/espigrow or email espigrow@gmail.com for more details. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Officials stated that because of modernization and numerous partnerships associated with the Chesapeake Bay and environmental conservation, a revised plan was necessary.\n\"There have been a lot of recovery efforts and partnerships happening to help the bay so it is important that our strategy stays dynamic to meet the current needs of Chesapeake Bay recovery,\" said Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment Rachel Jacobson. \"This is one of the nation's most important watersheds.\"\nThe Chesapeake Bay watershed is home to over 17.5 million people. The Army operates 14 major installations in the area totaling over 211,000 acres — 26,000 of which are covered by the watershed.\nThe Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground — the state's second largest forest landowner — oversees more than 18,000 acres of woodland and a large portion of the Bush and Gunpowder River which ultimately lead to the bay.\n\"As caretakers of such a vast and critical area, we consistently work to find ways to do better,\" said Liz Miranda, Deputy to the Commanding General, Communications and Electronics Command. \"The Chesapeake Bay Strategy is part of that effort to continually improve by bringing Army conservation efforts in support of the bay into the Army's national defense activities.\"\nThe revised plan has four main goals that address bay health which, in turn, officials say will benefit the watershed's surrounding ecosystem.\nThe four goals are water quality, living resource restoration and sustainability, strengthening healthy stormwater management practices and generating community awareness.\nEach goal is outlined with specific actions such as the implementation of additional shoreline riparian areas to minimize erosion, the study of invasive species, implementation of green technology and even an expansion of wetlands to compensate for rising sea levels.\nOfficials stated that the strategy is a science-based action agenda that reflects adaptive management principles and contributes to the long-term recovery of the Chesapeake Bay.\nArmy officials talked about that plan at Earth Day celebrations at the Maryland base last month.\nAfter signing the Chesapeake Bay Strategy policy, Jacobson announced a new initiative in honor of this year's Earth Day theme — Planet Vs. Plastics — with the demand of a 60 percent reduction in the production of plastic by 2040.\nThe new initiative effectively phases out the Army's procurement of single-use plastic and styrofoam dishes in all Army dining installations by 2030 — excluding water bottles and packaging.\n\"The reason is very simple — plastics are the most common form of marine debris,\" Jacobson said. \"We have demonstrated time and time again that there is nothing incompatible about being good stewards of the environment and cultural resources and being the best Army in the world. We can, and will, do both.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Earlier this week Matt Neff, the museum's curator of estuarine biology, introduced the new tank inhabitants, including four cownose rays.It was about eight years ago that an environmental group called Showing Animals Respect and Kindness — or SHARK — raised awareness about a local event at which cownose rays were clubbed to death for sport.\nNeff, who said he has had a love for all of nature's creatures since he was a small child, dismissed reports that the cownose rays, which are prevalent in the Chesapeake Bay region during the warm weather months, are pesky and invasive.\nRecently, Neff and other museum personnel traveled to an aquarium in Kansas City, Mo., and returned with the cownose rays, along with some Atlantic rays and skates. The creatures were kept in an aquarium during the 22½ hour trip back to Maryland.\nNeff explained that the Kansas City aquarium was the only institute that responded to Calvert Marine Museum's request for cownose rays \"when we had a need for animals to exhibit.\"\nThe cownose rays, all male, seem to be getting along fine in the circular tank at the museum with the other local waterway denizens.\n\"They're pretty docile,\" Neff said, adding that the rays \"were born in captivity.\"\nNeff, who grew up in the Mid-Atlantic area and went to college in New York, majoring in biology, has previously worked at a nature center and at the National Zoo.\nOf his job at the local marine museum he said, \"I do like that we only have native species here.\"\nNeff also showed off one of the museum's newest exhibits, a pair of eastern hellbenders, the largest salamander in North America. However, the hellbender, first discovered in 1803, can no longer be found in the Chesapeake Bay region.\nThe eastern hellbender can grow as long as 29 inches and weigh up to 5.5 pounds.\n\"It's kind of a fascinating animal,\" Neff said, noting that some of the factors, including development and pollution, \"ended up being a perfect storm\" and put the hellbender's population in peril.\nBonnie Farmer, the museum's communications and marketing coordinator, confirmed that the annual Sharkfest is coming up at the Solomons facility on July 13. The extremely popular event will feature live sharks for viewing at Corbin Pavilion. It's recommended that anyone wanting to attend Sharkfest 2024 purchase tickets in advance since the museum has limited capacity.\nFor more information about the Calvert Marine Museum, go to calvertmarinemuseum.com \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dawn’s early light: A moment of magic and balm for the soul\n\n May 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM HORTON for the Chesapeake Bay Journal | Section: Columns \n \n 1014\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n People ask me what's my favorite place on the Chesapeake Bay, and it's often the last place I was … or the place I'm going to next week. But ask my favorite time around the Chesapeake's 11,000 or so miles of land-water edge and the answer's always the same: First light.It's elemental. Biblical even, right there in Genesis: \"In the beginning … the earth was a formless void … then God said, 'Let there be light.'\" A bloomin' miracle that recurs every single day.\nIt was for the love of first light back in my hunting days that I preferred crouching in duck blinds on the marsh edge when the best shooting had moved to pits in cornfields frequented by more abundant wild geese.\nIt takes the better part of an hour for the receptors in your retina to adjust to the \"formless void\" of the night. In that time, your other senses and your imagination are liberated from the visual.\nYou become attuned to the gentlest lap of water on shoreline, to every splash and slap of fish or otter or beaver, and to the miniature bugle of a sika deer (which is actually a miniature elk) and the scents of pine and marsh peat. More felt than seen, great blue herons and owls glide nearby.\nAnd whoa! What the hell was that? Ah, a mallard hen. To the day's approach, the water harkens well before the land. The duck, sassing the dawn, trails gouts of liquid fire where the very first light catches her ripples across the smooth, obsidian surface of the cove.\nAs the water thaws to tints of the eastern horizon, first light delicately filets the gray-black bulk of the landscape, liberating forms — forest, then trees, then branches, twigs and leaves — then stoking color as the sunlight rolls, spewing every permutation of golds and reds and greens wherever it encounters vegetation, turning a browsing deer to glowing cinnamon, shining bronze on the breasts of waterfowl in flight.\nThis happens every day, and no two days are alike. But what we have here is beyond beauty. First light invites reflection on the radical history of sunrise, a lesson we're still wrestling with.\nFor starters, it's not really the sun rising but the Earth turning. We've known that for around 500 years, since the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus proved that our Earth was part of a universe that revolved around the sun.\nFor good reason, Copernicus sat on his proofs for nearly a decade — similar to why Charles Darwin waited even longer to publish his Theory of Evolution. Both struck at fierce beliefs that humans were at the center of everything, special and apart, divinely ordained to dominate all lesser forms of life.\nBefore Copernicus — not illogically, given the visual evidence — we saw the sun as rising and setting upon us humans, revolving with the stars and other planets around an Earth that was the centerpiece of the universe. That was based on ancient Greek astronomy, \"perfected\" by the Egyptian mathematician Ptolemy.\nThe idea that Earth was not a big planet at the center of a small universe (the small size was needed to make Ptolemy's calculations work) shook the religious and social constructs of humanity.\nWe got over it. And life, including glorious Earth's daily turns, sunrises and sunsets, carried on — though a 2018 National Science Foundation survey found that more than a quarter of U.S. respondents still thought the sun revolved around the earth. Mainstream thought and science, though, accepts that Earth is a small part of a vast scheme and that humans, while quite remarkable, are quite akin to the \"lesser\" animals that inhabit the planet.\nBut those acceptances are about math and biology, and they have never been enough to resolve the many environmental crises, from global to Chesapeake scales, arising from human overreach. Resolution might have come from the more recent discipline of ecology, which speaks to the interrelationships of all life. It only became a word in 1866.\nBut ecology proved even more radical than descending from apes and a heliocentric universe, though environmentalists generally try to soft-pedal it, hoping to get to a more inclusive planet through the existing economic model that promotes the never-ending growth of a single species at all cost.\nHaving long accepted that Earth is not the center of the universe, we still act as if humans must always be at the center of life on Earth. (For more detail, do a web search for a fine essay called \"Ptolemaic Environmentalism\" by sociologist Eileen Crist, a professor emerita at Virginia Tech, and for the highly readable book, \"Seeing Nature,\" by naturalist Paul Krafel.)\nWe have developed some good \"dodges\" that allow us to think — if we don't think too hard — that we can follow a more ecological path, more caring for the whole diversity of life, while pursuing growth as usual. They are good dodges because they are rooted in good concepts and sometimes work well.\nTake technology: From moon landings to Tesla cars, from calculators to AI, we're really good at it. In the Chesapeake region, where the population has more than doubled, innovative wastewater treatment technology has more than halved sewage pollution. But that is reaching its limits, as growth continues.\nThen there's \"sustainability,\" which is already leading to some good thinking and planning about how to adapt to climate change. But, as with technology, it still treats symptoms more than the root cause: human-centeredness. It begs the real question: Is it sustainable for all life?\nI don't have the answer to all this, but I have good advice. Find yourself a spot to linger a few hours on the edge of land and water. Arrive in darkness. Bask in the smells and sounds and colors of the formless void turning splendid. Draw hope from the daily miracle.\nTom Horton, a Chesapeake Bay Journal columnist, has written many articles and books about the Chesapeake Bay.

Started in April as part of Earth Day observations, the beehive is helping IKEA achieve its goal of being people and planet positive by 2030.\n\"Through this collaboration, the IKEA bees (both honey and wild) are helping to pollinate their local environments, beautifying the local towns,\" said Lindsey Craig, IKEA Sustainability Business Partner. This is one of six IKEA beehive projects in the US.\nCraig said Alveole employees will monitor the hives every three weeks and provide updates to the Perryville warehouse. The visits will happen throughout the beekeeping season, typically ending in late fall.\nAs many as 100 jars of honey are expected to be harvested from the hive.\n\"The honey harvested from these bee hives will be given back to IKEA for educational events throughout the year for co-workers to learn more about pollinators in urban settings,\" Craig said via email. \"Together, we're increasing biodiversity, meaningfully promoting sustainability and making progress towards a better future.\"\nCraig said that, for now, there is only one hive on the Perryville site, but IKEA hopes that neighboring property owners will get interested.\n\"Right now, IKEA U.S. is focusing on improving biodiversity and native landscaping at our sites, with the hope that nearby properties share the interest in creating more meaningful healthy and resilient environments for all,\" Craig said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Striped bass limits will protect their future\n\n May 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ALLISON COLDEN | Section: Columns \n \n 702\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n This season anglers and commercial fishermen are following new striped bass limits in the Chesapeake Bay and along the Atlantic Coast.There's good reason.\nPersistent concerns about low striped bass numbers led Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission this May to take additional steps to address the number of striped bass that are dying after being caught and released, as well as unsustainable commercial fishing rates.\nThe commission's latest steps aim to get rebuilding efforts back on track. We must face the hard truth that striped bass are struggling. Concerns stem from below average numbers recorded over last five years by Maryland's juvenile striped bass survey — an annual count of the number of young striped bass in Chesapeake tributaries. The 2023 count was dismal — the second-lowest since the survey began in 1957.\nThe Bay's commercial striped bass catch has seen a decline of about 40 percent from 2012 to 2022. Maryland and Virginia's commercial harvest totaled 4.5 million pounds in 2012 and just 2.7 million pounds in 2022, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThese numbers make it clear: Without action now, there might not be a striped bass fishery in the future.\nNEW LIMITS\nTo address population concerns, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's Striped Bass Management Board voted at its spring meeting to establish a workgroup to reduce catch and release mortality. The workgroup will explore the effectiveness of season closures, impacts of different types of fishing tackle and the reduction in fishing effort needed to reduce striped bass losses.\nEarlier this year, Maryland implemented emergency regulations to prohibit fishing for striped bass during crucial spring spawning times (April 1 through May 15). The state also closed fishing for striped bass during two weeks in late July, when fish are most likely to get stressed and die after release.\nTo meet additional the commission's requirements, all Atlantic Coast states implemented a one-fish limit for recreational anglers. In the Chesapeake Bay, keepers must measure between 19 and 24 inches.\nStates also implemented a 7 percent reduction in the commercial harvest.\nLEAVE THE BIG FISH\nWhat has everyone so concerned is the lack of smaller striped bass present in the Bay. The last time we saw a strong group of young striped bass was back in 2015 — which are the big fish being caught today. We must leave these fish in the water to reproduce and rebuild the striped bass population. As a recent Maryland DNR study shows, older, larger female striped bass produce far more eggs. There's extra risk in hot months when the water is warm and holds less oxygen, making catch and release mortality rates are high. When air temperatures are above 95 degrees, about 17 percent of shallow hooked striped bass died after release, according to a Maryland DNR study.\nAnglers in Maryland who care about striped bass can take the following steps to help ensure the fishery's future:\nAvoid targeting striped bass during summer (June through August) when high water temperatures stress fish and make them less likely to survive being caught. Anglers can reference Maryland DNR's Striped Bass Advisory Forecast to determine if air and water temperatures are safe.Practice careful catch and release tactics, such as using barbless circle hooks, keeping fish in the water, and supporting fish with two hands if handling.Try fishing for other species, such as invasives like blue catfish or snakehead. The upper Bay and its tributaries are prime for targeting pickerel, white perch, and yellow perch. In higher salinity areas, anglers can target cobia, red drum, speckled trout, Spanish mackerel, and many other species.\n1980s MORATORIUM\nForty years ago, striped bass numbers reached a crisis point. Fishery regulators implemented a moratorium that shut down Maryland's striped bass fishery from 1985 to 1989. Striped bass numbers rebounded through the 1990s, and the moratorium is considered a major success story for fisheries management.\nBut there are new factors challenging the current recovery of striped bass, including climate change, pollution, habitat loss, invasive species and overfishing. New fishing limits are one of the most immediate, effective actions that can be taken to rebuild striped bass numbers.\nMaking these sacrifices today will help us avoid another moratorium and ensure that the striped bass fishery has a future.\nAllison Colden is the Maryland executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "author": "BRENNAN STEWART Capital News Service",
    "content": "Problems with Baltimore sewage entering Bay continue\n\n May 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BRENNAN STEWART Capital News Service | Section: Local News \n \n 1520\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In one of his most viral videos to date, with over three million views on Instagram and close to a million views on TikTok, Baltimore crabber and social media influencer Luke McFadden addresses the camera while standing on his boat in the Chesapeake Bay.\"Every time it rains in Maryland, at least where I'm at, we have garbage like this tire that washes down from places like the Conowingo Dam,\" McFadden says.\nUsing his reach pole, he hoists a massive rubber tire from the water and brings it aboard.\n\"In addition to the trash, we get this lovely brown, foamy slime on the top, which happens to be raw sewage that dumps out from the Baltimore City wastewater treatment plants,\" he says.\nMcFadden then gestures toward the water, where there is indeed a dark layer of sludge instead of a pale blue hue that most would expect.\n\"The issue we have here in the Chesapeake Bay is a water quality issue,\" he says. \"You can catch and throw back as many of whatever it is you want, but nothing is gonna live in a stagnant puddle — not one that gets sewage dumped in it every time it rains.\"\nPosted to Instagram and TikTok just two months after Baltimore City settled a $4.75 million lawsuit for violations at each of its two wastewater treatment plants, the Jan. 21 video combined for over 4,500 comments on both platforms.\n\"Your city tax dollars at work,\" one comment read.\n\"It does stink at the harbor when it rains,\" said another.\nBut the reality is, sewage is supposed to enter the Chesapeake Bay through the Back and Patapsco Rivers only after it's been properly treated by the plants which happen to be the largest in Maryland.\nAnd as for \"raw sewage,\" experts say that's not exactly the case.\n\"That's kind of a misconception — it's still sewage, but it's partially treated a lot of times because there is such an influx of rain,\" Desiree Greaver, project manager for the Back River Restoration Committee (BRRC), told Capital News Service. \"We have these rain events where there's tons of rain, and the plant can't handle it so they'll skip certain steps.\"\nFor Greaver, the effects that skipping steps has had on the bay were not made clear until March 2021 when the BRRC received a call from a concerned city resident.\n\"We got a call on a Friday evening from a gentleman that said, 'You're not going to believe the stuff I see. There is solid waste all over the river,'\" Greaver said. \"The only thing I knew was to call Alice (Volpitta) that evening.\"\nAlice Volpitta is the Baltimore Harbor Waterkeeper for Blue Water Baltimore, a non-profit dedicated to restoring the quality of the city's rivers, streams and harbor.\nAs one of 17 waterkeepers in the Chesapeake Bay region, Volpitta's role is to advocate for clean water in the city's two rivers and amplify the voices of citizens who live near them. It's a job she has held for 10 years since leaving the Maryland Department of Natural Resources in 2014.\n\"There's one facility in the Patapsco River and there's one in the Back River and both of them failed at the same time. So it was kind of like a perfect storm specifically for a waterkeeper to get involved here,\" Volpitta said.\nVolpitta said that in a perfect situation, the wastewater treatment plants would only be treating sewage and not rainwater, but the sewer pipes themselves are old and leaky. Because of this, rainwater infiltrates and creates an excess volume at the plants, and this same phenomenon has caused sewage to rise up from city manholes and through resident's basements and toilets.\nFlash forward to May 2021. Blue Water Baltimore twice detected high levels of bacteria at the Patapsco plant's discharge pipe, prompting Volpitta to immediately notify the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE).\nIn the following days, inspections by officials from MDE found a large fish kill in the bay, as well as trees growing in the plants' outdoor settling tanks that are designed to reduce overflow during large rain events.\nHow do they reduce overflow? By holding the excess water.\n\"Those trees don't just happen, which is a big concern,\" Greaver said. \"Those trees had root systems that took far longer than seven months to develop.\"\nFailing its inspection, the Patapsco plant was cited for having \"insufficient maintenance and operational staff\" and several \"equipment failures.\" A system that was installed to remove nitrogen was being bypassed altogether, and MDE found floating solids near the discharge pipe to be a result of several procedural violations.\nMDE also determined that the plant exceeded its permitted limit on nitrogen and phosphorus releases in 2020, and also failed to comply with a 2016 consent order that aimed at reducing outputs of fats and oils.\nThree months later, at the end of August 2021, the Back River treatment plant failed an MDE inspection that was prompted by the findings at the Patapsco plant. Finding similar operational and maintenance issues, MDE was authorized by state law to assess fines of up to $10,000 per day.\nFor Blue Water Baltimore, the next step was to file a $4.75 million lawsuit in December 2021 against the city with the Chesapeake Legal Alliance.\nThe Clean Water Act requires a 60-day notice period, allowing time for the plants to come into compliance and avoid litigation. The facilities failed to do so.\nThe city did not settle the lawsuit until last November, only after the Maryland Environmental Service (MES) temporarily assumed control of supervisory operations at the Back River treatment plant under orders by then-Maryland Environment Secretary Ben Grumbles.\nGrumbles in March 2022 had issued a previous order for the treatment plants to prevent all illegal discharge from entering the rivers, which is a direct violation of the Clean Water Act.\nIt took the Baltimore City Department of Public Works (DPW) just 72 hours to fail to comply, but the city agency said it had requested MES to get involved: \"The Department of Public Works has always had supervisory control of operations at the plant,\" a department spokesperson told CNS on Friday.\n\"DPW contracted Maryland Environmental Service to manage two construction improvement projects at the plant,\" the spokesperson said.\nForty percent of the city's lawsuit settlement, which totaled $1.9 million, was diverted to the Chesapeake Bay Trust, which is responsible for awarding those funds to grant projects aimed at restoring the Back River and Patapsco watersheds.\nBut awarding grant money isn't a simple process, according to Chesapeake Bay Trust President Jana Davis. Grant recipients are selected from a lengthy list of applicants by a review committee, and the selection process takes months.\n\"We use principles of participatory thinking, which is just a fancy term for working with communities to really understand what they need before we say 'Hey, here's this project in your community,'\" Davis told CNS. \"Communities that have been impacted by events like this don't always have a say in how money gets reinvested back to them.\"\nDavis said the Chesapeake Bay Trust aims to finalize its grant recipients by late fall of this year. As for the projects themselves, many are expected to start being implemented right away, but others may have to be postponed until next spring.\n\"We hope that all of the grantees will be well on their way to sort of completing a project within a two-year period from fall 2024 to, say, fall 2026,\" Davis said.\nGreaver's Back River Restoration Committee is one of many environmental organizations applying to use a portion of the $1.9 million.\nAs for when the effects from the wastewater treatment plants will be completely reversed, that's something Greaver thinks will take time.\n\"I hope that happens before I'm no longer on this Earth,\" she said. \"That's the most optimistic I can be given how there seems to be a lack of concern from the folks that own and operate the plants. Unless there's a real change in Baltimore City, it just seems like it's one of those things that gets brushed under the rug.\"\nBaltimore City is now under two separate consent decrees to prevent future sewage overflows.\nThe 2002 Sanitary Sewer Consent Decree was a result of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and MDE suing Baltimore City for discharging sewage into local waterways.\nBecause sewage overflows were still happening at the decree's original expiration in 2016, a renegotiation now gives the city until 2030 to prevent all sewage overflows from occurring.\nThis renegotiation birthed Baltimore City's \"Headworks Project,\" a $430 million investment that aims to increase holding capacity at the treatment plants while also relining sewer pipes to increase water velocity. This prevents solids from settling in the sewers.\nA second consent decree approved last fall is focusing on the wastewater facilities themselves, ensuring that both are in compliance with MDE regulations and are functioning normally.\nThe Baltimore DPW is responsible for making the required changes. That agency only regained control of the Dundalk plant on May 1 of last year after MES relinquished responsibility for supervisory operations under direction from the Baltimore City Board of Estimates.\n\"Until that plant is holding every single person and every single manager and every single department and every single contractor in the fire, I feel like we're just going to keep coming right back here,\" Greaver said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hang dry rebels revive the classic laundry method of lather, rinse and repeat\n\n May 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Sarita Harbour Food Drink Life | Section: Life \n \n 814\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Despite technological advancements and stricter energy-efficient standards for clothes washers and dryers, a quiet revolution is currently changing how Americans handle one of the most mundane household chores: laundry.Learn why more Americans are turning away from the convenience of modern washing machines and dryers. They're opting instead for classic laundry methods such as hanging laundry outdoors on lines to dry, a practice that some states have banned.\nNew energy-efficient laundry appliance standards target 2028\nAre you concerned about the cost and energy consumption of your clothes washer and dryer? If so, you aren't alone. Several groups, including the Consumer Federation of America and various energy-efficient advocates, have long complained about the impact of laundry appliances on household budgets and our national carbon footprint.\nIn February 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy announced updated residential clothes washer and dryer standards. Manufacturers must meet these new energy efficiency standards by March 1, 2028. These standards are forecasted to save average American households $100 a year in lower utility bills.\nThere's a small but growing movement to forego these appliances altogether and return to more traditional laundry methods. Yet some laundry activists are impatient with this low movement towards more energy-efficient appliances. Instead, they're rolling up their sleeves to revisit older methods of cleaning and drying clothes.\nThese methods include using homemade laundry detergent recipes, hand washing with a bucket and washboard and hanging clothes outside to dry. But not everyone is thrilled with the reversion to these classic methods.\nLine-drying breaks HOA clothesline bans\nLine-drying laundry is the simple practice of hanging clothes on a line to dry. It is cheap, energy-efficient and requires minimal investment. All you need is a clothesline and clothespins or a foldable drying rack.\nThe classic method of line-drying clothing is still common across Europe. However, not everyone loves the idea of seeing their neighbors' clothes clotheslines flapping on the line over their backyard gardens.\nIn some places in the United States, landlords and homeowners' associations (HOAs) have banned outdoor clotheslines and prohibited outdoor laundry drying, citing aesthetic concerns.\nClashes between the right-to-dry groups and those opposed to the practice have resulted in 19 states outlawing clothesline bans and upholding people's right to air their laundry outdoors, which is good news for line-drying laundry advocates. Most recently, in 2023, Pennsylvania introduced a bill to allow condo owners to hang dry clothes outside.\nBenefits of eco-friendly laundry practices\nThe appeal of traditional laundry methods may lie in their perceived benefits. Hanging laundry to dry saves money and bypasses the need for an energy-hogging clothes dryer.\nLine drying offers other benefits, as well. For example, it minimizes wrinkles and reduces the need for ironing, further cutting your energy consumption. Clothes dried outdoors smell fresh and clean, and they aren't subjected to the wear-and-tear of tumbling in a clothes dryer.\nThese classic laundry methods are part of the growing simple living movement, a return to simpler, traditional methods of homemaking popularized on various social media platforms. Accounts such as LaundryTok, with more than 13,000 followers, celebrate mundane household chores and simple lifestyles. Other simple living accounts showcase activities such as sourdough baking, canning, preserving foods and raising backyard chickens, gaining thousands of followers on YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.\n\"There is nothing, and I mean nothing, that smells as lovely as line-dried laundry,\" says Laura Sampson of Alaska-based Little Frugal Homestead. \"Even though we live where it's snowy for a large portion of the year, we make an effort to put our sheets on the line every Sunday. Even if they don't dry and we finish them in the dryer it's worth it.\"\nEnergy-efficient laundry drying tips\nWhether you hand-wash your laundry, use a washboard and wringer washer system or even use an electric washing machine, follow these tips to successfully and efficiently dry your clothes.\nFirst, wring out as much water as possible to reduce the time it takes to dry your laundry. If you use a traditional electric washing machine, run an extra spin cycle to remove any excess water.\nAvoid folding clothing over the clothesline when hanging garments on a line. Doing so results in a double layer of cloth, extending the required drying time. Instead, use clothespins to hang the garment from the line. This allows the air to circulate causing your clothes to dry more quickly.\nWhen hanging skirts, shorts or pants, hang them by their cuffs instead of their waistband. This practice results in a faster drying time and fewer wrinkles. Also, turn hoods on hoodies and pockets on all garments inside out to help them dry faster.\nTry hang-drying to save energy and money\nHanging laundry to dry instead of using an electric or gas dryer saves money and energy. While some neighborhoods across America have chosen to ban line drying, more states are outlawing those bans, making it easier to practice this simple, necessary and effective household chore.\nSarita Harbour is a long-time business and finance writer.

The region is on the north end of a heat dome that stretches from Mexico to South America, National Weather Service meteorologist Zack Taylor said.\nSunday looks like the hottest day with record-setting highs for late May forecast for Austin, Brownsville, Dallas and San Antonio, Taylor said.\nThe temperature was approaching 90 degrees F (32 degrees) and the heat index was 104 F (40 C) in Brownsville on the U.S./Mexico border by midmorning Saturday, according to the National Weather Service.\nRed Flag fire warnings are also in place in west Texas, all of New Mexico and parts of Oklahoma, Arizona and Colorado, where very low humidity of below 10%, wind gusts of up to 60 mph (97 kph) combine with the hot temperatures.\n\"We've got very dry air, warm temperatures and strong winds creating a high fire danger over a wide area ... that can lead to rapidly spreading or uncontrollable fires,\" Taylor said.\nMeanwhile, several inches of snow fell Friday into early Saturday in Rolla, North Dakota, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Canadian border.\nApril and May have been a busy month for tornadoes, especially in the Midwest. Climate change is heightening the severity of storms around the world.\nApril had the country's second-highest number of tornadoes on record. And in 2024, the U.S. is already 25% ahead of the average number of twisters, according to the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.\nIowa has been the hardest hit so far this week. A deadly twister devastated Greenfield. And other storms brought flooding and wind damage elsewhere in the state.\nThe storm system causing the severe weather is expected to move east as the Memorial Day weekend continues, bringing rain that could delay the Indianapolis 500 auto race Sunday in Indiana and more severe storms in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and Kentucky.\nThe risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "The importance of planting native\n\n May 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JAY FALSTAD Nature Notes | Section: Life \n \n 663\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Over the last decade or so, there's been a heavy emphasis (with strong scientific evidence to support it) about the importance of planting native trees and shrubbery on residential properties and communities. The emphasis on planting native cannot be overstated, especially here on the Eastern Shore.Across the spectrum of organisms, numerous species of insects, birds, mammals and amphibians are in some way threatened or in decline. There are variety of reasons for these declines, including habitat loss, pesticides, climate change and loss of native plants.\nPlanting native trees and shrubs instead of ornamental non-native species can help turn the tide in support of a stronger, healthier local ecosystem.\nHere's an example of why planting native is so important. According to best-selling author and naturalist, Doug Tallamy (\"The Nature of Oaks\" 2021), \"…a single oak tree is the host to some 534 species of moths and butterflies.\"\nWhen you add in the number of other insects, birds and mammals that are reliant on those insects for food, the number of organisms dependent on the linkages to the Oak tree goes even higher.\nOver thousands of years, flora and fauna that are native to a particular region, have developed and adapted together, often creating specialized, symbiotic partnerships where both organisms benefit from the other. At the same time, insects, birds and mammals that are indigenous to a region are likewise dependent on native trees and shrubs throughout the year for food and nesting sites, all of which contributes to a healthier environment.\nBy contrast, an introduced, non-native, ornamental Bradford Pear hosts only a minuscule fraction of insects compared to the Oak.\nUnfortunately, the story doesn't stop there. As invasive trees like Bradford Pears invade the landscape, they can disrupt and eventually decimate a surrounding ecosystem.\nEach time a native tree is displaced by a non-native tree, the result is fewer insects, fewer birds, fewer animals and an ecosystem that can begin to collapse on itself.\nHere on the Eastern Shore — in the heart of the Atlantic Flyway — migrating birds need the insect nutrition that native trees and shrubs help support.\nThis is especially important during the spring and fall migration period. In fact, one brood of Chickadees requires some 3,000 inchworms (small caterpillars from moths and butterflies) in just one season. Take away that important food source, and you're negatively impacting a valuable member of bird species that is native to the Eastern Shore.\nUnfortunately, many of the ornamental, non-native plants sold at garden centers host no native insects at all, ultimately leading to a decrease in biodiversity.\nSome of those non-native plants can be downright dangerous.\nOne example is the Asian Nandina plant, which is sold at big box garden centers. This cheap, popular landscaping shrub, with its bright orange berries, might be aesthetically appealing to the human eye, but the Nandina does little to support native insect species. Worse, their berries contain a toxic hydrogen cyanide compound that is fatal to a wide variety of animals and birds, especially the Cedar Waxwing and American Robin.\nInsect decline is real, and it can have a devastating effect on a region's biodiversity. According to numerous studies across the globe, insect populations are suffering. Oliver Milman, author of \"The Insect Crisis,\" indicates that \"…flying insects have declined by 75% in the last 25 years.\"\nHere's the good news. Everyone can help support their local ecosystem by planting trees and shrubs that are native to the region, resulting in more birds and mammals that are crucial in supporting a healthy environment.\nThe top ten best trees for the Eastern Shore that help support healthy biodiversity are:\nOak.Cherry.Willow.Birch.Tulip Poplar.Crabapple.Blueberry.Maple/Box Elder.Elm.Loblolly or White Pine.\nThe Maryland Department of Natural Resources (www.dnr.maryland.gov), The Maryland Native Plant Society (www.mdflora.org) and the University of Maryland Extension office (www.extension.umd.edu) all provide excellent information and resources on how best way to support nature by planting native trees and shrubs.\nJay Falstad is a Maryland Master Naturalist and Executive Director of the Queen Anne's Conservation Association.

    "content": "Local news vital to dealing with climate change\n\n June 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Rivera Sun | Section: Columns \n \n 977\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Local news has its finger on the pulse of our communities. When the city council acts (or acts up), when disaster strikes, when corruption or scandal needs to be scrutinized, local news steps up.From our kids' sporting events to small town heroes, road construction detours to storm preparedness, they cover stories of interest and importance to our daily lives — stories that large media overlooks.\nAmid the climate crisis, these stories could save our lives.\nHeat waves. Super-storms. Forest fires. Floods. Reporting on climate events, disasters, and preparedness is essential, obviously. But local news has a bigger role to play in helping us apply climate solutions that make sense to the unique places that we live.\nIn the beautiful valley where I live, nestled on the border of Canada in northern Maine, agriculture, forestry and snowmobiling are the three big industries. Last week, I stood in the cool shade of a potato barn talking to the farmer who also works as a trucking broker, getting local pallets of vegetables and other goods onto shared trucks headed to market.\nWe spoke about how the hot, wet summer led to poor harvests for potato farmers. He mentioned that they stopped shipping spuds to market a month early. The rain and heat this summer led to too much rot in the barns.\nAcross the street from his office, there's a lumber mill that stood idle through our unseasonably warm winter. Without snow, the loggers couldn't get their heavy equipment into the woods. Forestry hit a standstill — as did the lumber mills. Even if you live far away, you'll likely see this reflected in the price of paper goods and two-by-fours and construction costs in the coming months.\nJust down the road from the potato barn is a bed-and-breakfast on the lake. Usually, it's booked from November through April as downstate and out-of-state snowmobilers come on vacation. Not this year. With scanty snow, mass cancellations put the hospitality industry — hotels, B&Bs, restaurants, etc. — into such a dire downturn that they applied for state relief funds.\nMy community needs to see how climate change is already impacting us. It's here. It's hurting us. It's changing everything in this valley's way of life. We can either suffer and collapse from it, or we can understand what's happening and learn how to adapt. Local news can help us do it.\nA local newspaper has an intimate understanding of what our neighbors and local businesses need to know about the problems and the possibilities. For example, our local newspaper could do us a great service by translating the bewildering maze of subsidies, grant programs, relief funds, and rebates that already exist into plain speak. They could announce when the grant cycles open and close. They could help homeowners, woodlot owners, and local businesses know what funding and options are available to us. We need that help.\nA local newspaper can draw on its knowledge of how we live to help us with the steep learning curve that we face. Fox, MSN, and NPR can't be that specific — but what Florida needs to know is different from what Northern Maine needs to learn. With rising temperatures in the summer, our traditionally temperate valley faces increased cases of heat strokes. No one has air conditioning. We've never needed it before. But with heat hovering at 90-100° F for weeks now, our elders and families need to learn the signs of heat stroke … and the ways that we can prepare for this.\nA local newspaper can report on climate solutions that make sense for the unique ecologies and social fabrics that exist in our areas. Our valley has three solutions to rising summer temperatures, each of which is hyper-specific to our community's sense of itself. A local newspaper could help homeowners find the rebates that make heat pumps affordable, reminding them that the fuel savings we love on these machines come with a built-in emergency air conditioning potential.\nThe paper could also report on the concept of centralized emergency cooling centers that could be organized in our community buildings, library, schools or church basements — locations that either have natural cooling capacities or are putting in air conditioning.\nHere's a heat solution that is utterly unique to our area, one that would make readers of our local newspaper sit up and smile. One of the world's best, most energy-efficient cooling systems has been used in this farming community for centuries: the potato barn.\nAs I stood in that chilly barn talking with a farmer, I wore a sweater, coat and ski cap. It was over 70° F outside, a brilliantly sunny spring day. But a potato barn is dug into the earth. It taps into the ground's year-round 50° F temperature to warm it in the winter and keep it cool in the spring and summer. It's one of the key features of the renowned, highly sustainable Earthship Biotecture in the high desert of New Mexico. This historically French-Acadian farming community has known about this for hundreds of years.\nHow can we adapt this technology to help us survive hotter summers? Our local newspaper could research and report on that.\nWhat a local newspaper covers on climate is a matter of survival for us all. We need the intimate knowledge that they have of the places that we live. Your local community is special and distinct from my local community. Your local news is perfectly poised to deliver the stories, strategies, and solutions you need. Local news is an endangered species, threatened by corporate buyouts and mega-mergers. If we lose our local news, we lose the nuances, specificity, and responsiveness that only a local news outlet can deliver.\nAnd amid the climate crisis, this kind of information is of vital importance to our daily lives … and to our future.\nRivera Sun, syndicated by PeaceVoice, has written numerous books, including \"The Dandelion Insurrection\" and the award-winning Ari Ara Series. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Save a blue crab, eat a blue catfish",
    "date": "2024-06-06",
    "author": "Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado",
    "content": "Save a blue crab, eat a blue catfish\n\n June 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 734\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The blue crab population has been struggling. For the last four years, experts say, it has experienced significant declines, negatively affecting the economy and ecology of the Chesapeake Bay.Yet, for some studying blue crab populations, the answer to preserving the species is simple.\nAllison Colden, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation Maryland, said one of the best ways to help preserve and uplift the rise of blue crabs in the Chesapeake Bay is by eating more blue catfish.\nColden explained that blue catfish are an invasive species that has been a primarily threat to the blue crab population on the Eastern Shore.\nHarvesting and eating more blue catfish can help reduce their numbers and alleviate some of the predation pressure blue catfish are placing on important species like blue crabs, allowing blue crabs and other native species a better chance at survival and growing their low population numbers, she said.\nThere is agreement among environmental organizations, political leaders and watermen that creating a more streamlined path from harvesting blue catfish to getting them to market and table is key to getting control of their numbers.\nMany watermen suggest establishing a whole new fishery of blue catfish alongside striped bass, blue crabs, oysters and other Bay produce. But for commercial fishermen, who have the capacity to harvest thousands of pounds of blue catfish, jumping through the regulatory hoops currently in place can be daunting and discouraging.\nTilghman Island Seafood in Talbot County is the only USDA-certified blue catfish processor on Maryland's Eastern Shore.\nAccording to the state's website, Maryland is a prominent producer and processor of seafood and is the national leader in supplying blue crabs. The Chesapeake Bay provides about 50% of the total blue crab harvest in the United States, and each year, the Maryland seafood industry contributes nearly $600 million to the state's economy.\nColden said that 2022 had the lowest number of crabs on record according to a dredge survey by the Virginia Marine Resources Commission and Maryland Department of Natural Resources documenting population growth from 1990 to the present. These numbers have left experts concerned about the species.\n\"What has been concerning over the past couple of years is that we're seeing lower numbers of crabs that are staying low,\" Colden said. \"In particular, the number of juvenile crabs is now at four years in a row below that long-term average, which is a concern because those juvenile crabs, which are sampled in the wintertime, are the ones that grow up to support the blue crab fishery in the fall.\"\nColden said this would mainly affect people who are fishing for crabs. Low numbers would impact the fishery and impact profits.\nAccording to the 2024 dredge, there was a total crab abundance of 317 million blue crabs, a slight decrease from last year's estimated population of 323 million. However, it is still above the 2022 record low of 227 million crabs.\nIn 2024, the adult female crab population decreased to 133 million compared with 152 million last year. According to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, this number falls far below the target of 215 million adult female crabs needed for a healthy population and sustainable harvest in the Chesapeake Bay.\nJuvenile crab numbers improved slightly compared to 2022 numbers, but the juvenile population remained below average for the fourth year. Male crab numbers decreased from 55 million in 2023 to 46 million in 2024 despite male harvest limits instituted last year.\nChris Moore, executive director of Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said in a statement, \"While juvenile population estimates can vary greatly from year to year, it is encouraging to see a slight increase in this segment of the population. However, given the population estimates from this year's survey, there remains a significant need to continue to protect adult females and critical nursery habitats, like underwater grasses, in order to help ensure better numbers in the future. \"\nColden said she understands that they will not be able to eradicate blue catfish, but eating more of this invasive species would help alleviate factors that are negatively impacting blue crabs, which would give the blue crabs the best chance to bounce back from these low numbers.\n\"The Department of Natural Resources in Maryland is encouraging people to get out and eat catfish; they're delicious to eat, they're fun to fight if you're a recreational or commercial angler, and it will help reduce the impact that they're having on our native species — blue crabs,\" Colden said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Darling Ingredients fined $15K for pollution violations\n\n June 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 552\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n LINKWOOD — The Maryland Department of the Environment fined Darling Ingredients $15,000 for repeated pollution violations at its Linkwood facility.According to a news release from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, MDE inspections revealed 51 violations made between August 2023 and March 2024 by the owner of Valley Proteins, an animal waste rendering facility in Dorchester County that processes poultry byproducts.\nThe company violated a requirement that it must leave at least two feet of empty capacity, or freeboard, in wastewater lagoons, the news release said. The freeboard is required in order to prevent overflows or spills into waterways during events like heavy rains.\nIn a statement, Chesapeake Bay Foundation Eastern Shore Director Alan Girard said Darling Ingredients has committed violations \"time and again\" that could harm the waterways of the Eastern Shore.\n\"We're grateful that the Maryland Department of the Environment is stepping up to levy fines and enforce the terms of the consent decree,\" he said. \"The Bay's health depends on consistent and timely enforcement of laws and regulations designed to protect our environment.\"\nIn response to a request for comment, Darling Ingredients' Director of Global Communications Jillian Fleming said to the Star Democrat in an email, \"We are working with the regulator and will respond through the appropriate process.\"\nMatt Pluta, Choptank riverkeeper with ShoreRivers, called the imposed fines a win for enforcement. But he said it's always unfortunate when pollution concerns are discovered.\n\"I think there was a lot of hope that with the new ownership of this facility that we would see a change in the operations,\" he said. \"But this fine tells us that nothing's really changed there, unfortunately.\"\nIn December 2021, it was announced that Texas-based company Darling Ingredients would be acquiring Valley Proteins, according to previous Star Democrat reporting.\nPluta said its important the fines imposed are high enough to deter bad behavior.\n\"I hope the company moves beyond this in a better way where they're complying with their permits and being a good steward of the communities that they live in,\" he said.\nIn 2022, the facility was put under a consent decree with MDE, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, ShoreRivers and Dorchester Citizens for Planned Growth. The consent degree ordered the facility's owners to pay $540,000 in civil penalties to the state for its more than 40 violations of a discharge permit issued by the state, according to the news release.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation said the consent decree authorizes MDE to order financial penalties against Darling Ingredients when it fails to comply with the terms of the agreement.\nIn February 2023, local environment groups, including the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and ShoreRivers, challenged MDE's wastewater discharge permit for Valley Proteins in court. According to previous Star Democrat reporting, the petition for judicial review stemmed from concerns about the potential for the plant's pollution discharges under the new permit to contribute to unhealthy water quality in the Transquaking River, Higgins Millpond and Chesapeake Bay.\nIn a May 24 letter from MDE Compliance Program Manager Andrew Gosden, which details the violations made between August 2023 and March 2024, Gosden writes that Darling Ingredients has 14 days to respond.\nThe letter states that if the company would like to contest any violations, it must provide a written explanation and any supporting documents.\nIn its news release, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation said MDE has found \"dozens\" of additional pollution violations in recent inspections. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Along with the living shoreline, a stormwater management system will be put in place to reduce flood risk, according to the news release.\nThe project will have two phases: design and permitting, and construction. The first phase, which scientists from the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science at Horn Point will assist with, will include gathering and analyzing data, completing a detailed design and obtaining the permitting needed for construction.\nThe week of June 3, field surveyors began conducting a hydrographic survey by boat to measure tidal information and other physical features along the shore of the Choptank.\nAlong with the $1.7 million awarded for the first phase of the project, FEMA is reserving $16 million for the second phase of the project, the news release states. The total $17.7 million in grant money is being awarded through FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Assistance grant.\nThe city is committing 10.5% of funds for both phases of the project through a grant from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, the Resilient Maryland Revolving Loan Fund and city budget funds.\n\"The City of Cambridge is committed to the 'Make Cambridge Resilient Initiative' and views this project as a major step forward,\" the press release states.\nIn terms of timeline, phase one of the project will extend through 2025. Public outreach will be scheduled throughout the first phase of the project, according to the news release. It says the city will directly coordinate with affected property owners for concerns and property assessment. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Changing our perception of the ‘messy’ yard\n\n June 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JAKE SOLYST For the Chesapeake Bay Journal | Section: Columns \n \n 920\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Around this time last year, I saw a local television news story out of Portsmouth, Virginia, that was more important to me than Chinese spy balloons, Barbenheimer box office sales or any other world event happening at the time.The story involved a homeowner along the Elizabeth River whose next-door neighbor hadn't cut or trimmed the vegetation in his yard for more than four years. In the segment, a homeowner named Dennis Melms stands in the middle of his well-groomed backyard as he airs his grievances against the densely vegetated property over the fence.\nIncluded in Melms' list of concerns are the intrusion of snakes and raccoons, the lowering of his property value, the dangers posed to his granddaughter and the fact that he can't comfortably play horseshoes in his backyard anymore.\nMelms ends the segment by announcing, \"You need to cut your grass, Bill!\" A literal shout into the void.\nFor me, this colorful local dispute gets to the heart of a perception issue that is critical to the future of the Chesapeake Bay and its wildlife.\nOn one side, you have the majority of people whose ideal yard is bright green, low cut and tidy, with perhaps some shrubs or a row of daylilies around the edges. The standard can be traced back to sprawling lawns in English estates and has been reinforced by decades of lawn-care marketing — so much so that turfgrass is now the most irrigated crop in the country.\nOn the other side, you have the brave few who aim to break tradition and use their yard in ways that benefit the environment.\nI can't say whether Melms' neighbor's overgrown property is out of a love for nature, or simply neglect, but there's a lot of benefit to it. The reason the neighbor can let his yard grow so lavishly is because it's in a Resource Protection Area due to its close proximity to the water. This means, under the law, he doesn't have to cut it if he doesn't want to.\nTall grass, shrubs and trees do a great job of absorbing stormwater runoff, which keeps nutrient pollution, chemical contaminants and sediment from washing into the river. Conversely, frequently mowed turf grass has shallow roots that don't absorb much stormwater.\nBut the benefits go beyond cleaner water. Bugs, bees and birds are dying off by the billions across the country because of dwindling natural habitat. Melms' yard, though likely a better place for a granddaughter to run around in, provides far less habitat for wildlife. The overgrown property, on the other hand, is likely bursting with insect and pollinator life, which is food for birds.\nWhile I can't defend leaving your yard uncut for four years, I do encourage people to make room for more intentional vegetation in their yards in place of turfgrass.\nBreaking the perception is going to require some trailblazers. To help you be part of the change, I have a few tips on how to maintain a more Bay-friendly yard.\nChoose plants based on the benefits they provide to wildlife. For example, a shrub like winterberry produces fruit for birds late into winter, while milkweed is the host plant for larvae of the beloved monarch butterfly. Also try to pick plants that bloom at different times of the year, thus providing different wildlife with habitat and food year-round.\nWhere you must mow, set the mower height to 3.5 inches or higher, which will make your lawn healthier and more drought resistant. After mowing, spread some of those clippings back onto the yard as natural fertilizer — or better still, use a mulching mower, which does much of that work for you by leaving the clippings where they lie.\nUse as little chemical fertilizer as possible, especially during rainy seasons or when you're close to a body of water. Better yet, use only native plants, which often require no fertilizer at all.\nConsider giving your property a \"mullet,\" by leaving the front yard with turf grass and dedicating the backyard to native trees, shrubs and other plants. Similarly, you could establish a \"wild space\" or two in the yard, where you let the vegetation grow and collect all of your fall leaves.\nLook into resources and programs near you to install rain gardens, pollinator gardens and other \"conservation landscapes.\"\nTo be clear, there will be barriers to rewilding your yard. Replacing turf grass with new plants can be time consuming and expensive, and there's no guarantee wildlife will show up once you do.\nThe Orwellian elephant in the room — homeowner associations — can also be an obstacle, often requiring that grass be kept under a certain length and even dictating which shrubs and trees are permitted. These rules can often be at odds with environmental best practices.\nAt the end of the day, we need more middle ground. It's OK to leave space in your yard for kids to run around and to play horseshoes, but it's also OK to stand out from your neighbors and provide habitat for wildlife.\nIt's my hope that in my lifetime, homeowners will be proud of their yard not because it's close-cropped and bright green, but because it's attracting birds and soaking up runoff. We are in a time where smart land management is very critical, and we should all be on the same page about what we want to get out of our natural spaces.\nJake Solyst works for the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay and is the web content manager in the Chesapeake Bay program's communications office.

    "content": "Lakeside wastewater treatment plant is complete\n\n June 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 1257\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TRAPPE — The Lakeside wastewater treatment plant is built, running and ready for the next step in the Lakeside development plan, which is transferring ownership to the town of Trappe.Two Lakeside transfer agreements were presented during a recent Trappe Council meeting. These agreements are the first steps in eventually passing over ownership of the wastewater treatment plant to the Town of Trappe.\nThis controversial project has faced lawsuits, petitions and an array of public outcry over environmental concerns, but it is an essential step in moving forward with the Lakeside development.\nFirst proposed over 20 years ago, the planned 2,501-unit Lakeside at Trappe development spans more than 850 acres off of U.S. Route 50. The development is slated to include a mix of single-family homes, townhouses and apartments, and commercial and retail spaces.\nTrappe's existing plant has the capacity to take on wastewater from the development's first 120 homes. That flow will eventually be diverted to the new wastewater treatment plant serving the development, a plan approved by county legislation and via an MDE wastewater discharge permit.\nSpray irrigation systemThe new plant, set with enriched nutrient removal technology, uses a spray irrigation system to discharge treated wastewater onto nearby fields.\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Water Science Center, the sprayed wastewater either evaporates into the air, soaks into the soil or percolates through the soil and recharges the groundwater.\nRobert Rauch, president of Rauch Inc., a project management and civil engineering firm for Lakeside, said spray irrigation has been recognized for years by states and the federal government as a preferred method of treated wastewater disposal.\n\"It is an exceptional re-use method of disposal that recharges groundwater and can provide needed nutrients to agricultural ground covers,\" he said. \"Generally, spray irrigation does not require the highest levels of treatment, so valuable nutrients are available for plants to reduce farmers' costs for additional commercial fertilizer.\"\nRaunch said this is based on Lakeside's developer's voluntary election to provide enhanced nutrient removal level treatment to avoid groundwater nutrient increases. The MDE discharge permit establishes strict limitations on the discharge of treated wastewater, which results in the application of a fraction of the nutrient uptake requirements of the grass planted in the irrigation field.\nRaunch said that due to the high quality of the Lakeside wastewater effluent and the nutrient needs of the ground cover, there is no practical scenario in which the spray irrigation of treated effluent will negatively impact surface or groundwater.\n\"Ironically, the nutrient levels of the treated effluent will be so low that the farmer will have to apply fertilizer to the spray irrigation field to maintain a vigorous and healthy crop cover,\" he said.\nAlan Girard, advocacy director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, argued that nutrients absorbed into groundwater could eventually discharge into nearby impaired rivers and streams like the Choptank River.\n\"I don't think people understand that the state is claiming that there will be zero discharge of nutrients to groundwater,\" Girard said. \"The state has already demonstrated that there's a link between groundwater and surface water and surface letters that are tarred right near the discharge. So the state needs to be accountable for that issue.\"\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation and ShoreRivers filed separate petitions for judicial review of the permit in, citing concerns about the spray irrigation of treated wastewater and specifics of a nutrient management plan not being made available during the permit's public comment period in 2020.\nMatt Pluta, Choptank riverkeeper and director of riverkeeper programs for ShoreRivers, said that the wastewater issue has been a concern for ShoreRivers due to the existing Trappe plant and how poorly it has been functioning and treating the wastewater before discharging it into Trappe Creek.\nAccording to Pluta, the Lakeside Plant is making noticeable improvements that were not seen in the old Trappe Wastewater Plant.\n\"I'll go on and say that one thing that's very clear and obvious is that there will be more treatment from this new plant,\" Pluta said. \"The wastewater will be treated to a cleaner standard. That's what we want to see. We support that. The thing that concerns us with the new plan is just the method of discharge. That's where they'll be spraying the treated wastewater onto nearby farm fields.\"\nPluta said the way the state permits spraying the treated wastewater onto nearby farm fields is under what he calls \"legal fiction or false assumptions.\" When someone is spraying wastewater on a farm field, that wastewater gets taken up by the plants.\nThrough studying agricultural practices, Pluta has learned of the impacts of runoff and pollution on groundwater. He said there are different incentives for someone operating a wastewater treatment plant compared to farmers caring for local crops.\nPluta stated that no farmer is applying nutrients to their crops every day throughout the whole growing season. There is an incentive for wastewater treatment operators to focus on controlling their volume and not so much on a healthy crop, which Pluta said is concerning for the sake of adding too much pollution to these fields.\nEach farm that receives spraying from the plant needs a nutrient management plan on how many nutrients can be put on the fields. Those plans were not public information, but because it was part of the treatment process, ShoreRiver argued to make that information public.\nIt was through the 2020 filed lawsuit that the permit was remanded to the Maryland Department of the Environment, which issued a new permit with fewer homes and less wastewater.\nA separate lawsuit was filed against MDE by concerned residents in May 2022 asking to revoke the permit and suspend any work with a sewage system as inconsistent with the county's comprehensive plan. Though the suits was ultimately dismissed last June, MDE issued a revised discharge permit for Lakeside, approving a significantly smaller wastewater treatment plant.\nThe revised permit allows for an average flow of 100,000 gallons per day. A vast decrease from the 540,000 gallons per day initially requested by the developer.\nOversightIn part due to the outcry and lawsuits made by residents and environmental organizations, a wave of resolutions were brought forward to better address concerns involving the Wastewater Treatment Plant.\nOne that stood out to many was Resolution 338, which amended Talbot County's Comprehensive Water and Sewer Plan. It requires an amendment to the comprehensive plan for any future expansion of the new Lakeside wastewater treatment plant.\nThough this was deemed favorable to the environmental organizations, there were many, including members of Trappe's council, that opposed the Lakeside resolutions.\nDuring a public hearing before the vote of Resolution 338, Brian Schmidt, Trappe Town Council president, commented opposing the resolution and stated that the county was treating Trappe differently than other towns, hurting the municipality's growth.\n\"We did not ask this council to intervene,\" Schmidt said. \"MDE is the controlling authority in matters of wastewater discharge, not the county. Disguising growth legislation as wastewater discharge is not proper procedure is only impeding the town's authority to control its own growth.\"\nNext stepsDuring the June 5 Trappe Town Council meeting, two Lakeside transfer agreements were presented. These agreements are the first steps in eventually passing over ownership of the wastewater treatment plant to the Town of Trappe.\nAccording to Showalter, Once the initial phase of the wastewater treatment plant is complete and turned over to the town, the developer remains responsible for any deficiencies between the costs of operation and maintenance and the sewer revenues collected by the Town from Lakeside residents. Additionally, the developer remains responsible for the incremental expansion of the wastewater treatment plant as the capacity is utilized.\nFurther discussion on the transfer agreements will be discussed and reviewed during the Town Council's next executive session. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It also said all 10 are on track to complete the restoration goals by 2025, which was the original target year.\nThe effort to restore the oyster populations stems from a 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement, which aimed to restore the bay and its surrounding waters.\nAll 10 of the tributaries were given a target number of healthy reef acres to reach. A 2023 restoration update showed that eight tributaries had hit the target of healthy acreage, which includes pre-existing reefs and recently restored ones.\nThe Manokin River in Maryland is less than halfway complete, with 222 acres of reef restoration remaining of the target 441. Virginia's Lynnhaven River is 38 more acres away from reaching its target of 152 healthy acres.\nAllison Colden, the Maryland executive director of the nonprofit Chesapeake Bay Foundation, applauded the progress and vouched for continued oyster restoration in the bay.\n\"It's critically important to build on the success of these oyster restoration projects and maintain momentum by expanding these initiatives to more tributaries in Maryland and Virginia,\" Colden said in a press release. \"Restored oyster reefs support a healthy Chesapeake Bay, numerous economic opportunities, and strengthen our resilience to climate change for communities across the Bay watershed.\"\nOyster protection has been a long-running debate at the state and local levels.\nIn March, State Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) introduced SB922, a bill repealing previous requirements that prevented the Maryland Department of Natural Resources \"from taking any action to reduce or alter the boundaries of certain oyster sanctuaries.\"\nAccording to previous Star Democrat reporting, watermen supported the bill at the time, which would allow harvesting in those oyster sanctuaries. Many conservation leaders and DNR officials, though, did not.\nAs the bill made its way through the House and Senate and was amended, there was little pushback. In May, it was signed by Gov. Wes Moore. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Energy justice needs to uplift our communities",
    "date": "2024-06-16",
    "author": "GARY BAXTER",
    "content": "Energy justice needs to uplift our communities\n\n June 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: GARY BAXTER | Section: Columns \n \n 746\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Earlier this year in Annapolis, just down the road from Baltimore, where I played for the Ravens, I helped kick off the Energy and Poverty Awareness Center, known as EnPAC. This organization is a beacon of hope committed to addressing the persistent issue of energy poverty — a challenge that disproportionately affects minority communities across the United States.My journey toward founding EnPAC, as a former NFL player turned entrepreneur, was sparked by a deeply personal experience. It was a moment that starkly revealed the urgent need for equitable energy solutions.\nEnPAC, in response to the acute energy poverty experienced by minority communities across the U.S., is dedicated to advocating for equitable energy solutions. Our mission, inspired by the disparities witnessed during winter storm Uri's devastating impact on Texas in 2021, is to champion policies that alleviate poverty and enhance economic growth, particularly in marginalized communities, through sustainable solutions.\nThe numbers paint a grim picture: Black households are almost 2½ times more likely to be disconnected from utility services than other American households. Furthermore, more than a third of Black Americans report difficulties in affording their energy bills. These aren't just figures; they represent families and communities grappling with choices no one should have to make — between heating their homes, feeding their families or paying for medications.\nA particularly pressing issue exacerbating energy poverty is the impact of electric vehicle mandates. While intended to reduce carbon emissions, these policies disproportionately burden lower-income and minority communities. The situation worsens as states move toward banning internal combustion engines by 2035 and federal standards aim for 70% of new vehicle sales to be electric by 2032. EVs remain predominantly luxury vehicles, inaccessible to many, and when consumers turn to the used vehicle market, prices surge for everyone, further disadvantaging vulnerable populations.\nAdditionally, access to EV charging infrastructure and the financial means to transition from gasoline to electric vehicles are disproportionately skewed against these communities. A recent Gallup poll shows that only 2% of households earning less than $40,000 own an EV, with 61% expressing no intention to buy one.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state and federal leaders must reconsider these poorly crafted energy policies. While aiming for environmental benefits, they risk exacerbating energy poverty and socioeconomic disparities. Additionally, the looming threat of higher electricity rates and potential brownouts and blackouts could worsen challenges for vulnerable communities.\nMuch like in football, where we prepare multiple plays to adapt to any scenario, we at EnPAC embrace the necessity for diverse strategies to tackle systemic issues in energy policy. By recognizing that one-size-fits-all solutions are inadequate, we support tailored policies that promote energy efficiency and renewable sources, ensuring an inclusive energy sector. Our commitment extends beyond advocacy; we actively engage with communities to understand their challenges and develop effective programs that deliver real benefits.\nOur recent community reception in Annapolis was just the start of ongoing dialogues with local residents, leaders, and stakeholders who are as invested in the community's future as we are. The evening was filled with meaningful discussions, yielding insights shaping our strategies to enhance the community's economic and social well-being.\nThe community's enthusiasm fuels our commitment to light up homes and transform them into hubs of hope and prosperity. Their feedback highlights a readiness for sustainable change and an eagerness to tackle unique challenges together. As we progress, these dialogues will continue to guide our strategies to ensure they align closely with the actual needs of the communities we serve. By maintaining these partnerships and conversations, we aim to create lasting impacts that extend beyond mere energy access, promoting thriving and equitable communities.\nAt EnPAC, our mission is driven by a commitment to community-based solutions and the belief that energy justice is a fundamental human right. We aim for a future where all Americans, irrespective of their economic or racial backgrounds, can access clean, efficient, and affordable energy. This commitment extends beyond simple utilities to empowering entire communities through equitable policies. EV mandates often place a disproportionate burden on minority and lower-income groups who may lack the infrastructure or financial means to adapt, illustrating the need for policies that are both inclusive and equitable.\nI remain optimistic about the future of energy justice. The challenges are significant, but the opportunities to make a meaningful difference are even greater. By thoughtfully tailoring energy policies, we can illuminate a path forward, not just with electricity but with opportunity and justice for all.\nGary Baxter is founder of the Energy and Poverty Awareness Center and aformer Baltimore Raven's cornerback. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The majority of turtles are quite harmless, but snapping turtles have powerful claws and a set of jaws, Falstad said. To prevent skeletal damage, turtles should never be picked up by the tail, he noted.\nQueen Anne's County is the first county in Maryland to make a proclamation for the wellbeing of turtles, according to Falstad, \"and hopefully we're not the only one,\" he said.\nMore information about turtles can be discovered at The Terrapin Institute in Neavitt, Falstad said.\nMore information about Queen Anne's County Conservation Association can be found at https://qaca.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Adding eight to 12 months for Talbot County to determine whether it is an \"appropriate\" time for the town to continue implementing its Comprehensive Plan would require the town to initiate the Comprehensive Water and Sewer Plan amendment four to five years before expanded treatment capacity.\nToward the end of the letter, the writers stated that if MDE is inclined to approve any portion of Resolution 338, \"at a minimum, the 100,000 gallons per day daily capacity limit and the footnote requiring a (comprehensive water and sewer plan) amendment for each expansion of the Lakeside (wastewater treatment plant) should be deleted.\"\nHowever, they also stated that if MDE were to \"approve Resolution 338, this would establish a precedent that could result in unintended consequences, including erosion of MDE's authority to regulate the timing, scope and conditions of discharge permits.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It doesn't reflect climate data and science,\" she said.\nOther concerns include while the technology proposed for the wastewater treatment plant meets Maryland's minimum standards for best available technology, compared to other states including Washington, California and Arizona, \"we are lagging behind what best available technology is,\" she said.\nAnother notable reason for necessary updates in technology is that nutrients are no longer the only concern in the water, she said.\nPFAS or forever chemicals being found to bioaccumulate as well as the rise of microplastics emerging contaminants is another reason for necessary updates in technology, she said.\n\"We need to do things to keep them out of our water,\" she said.\nPilot programs have received national recognition as a means to conserve and reuse water as well as treat water, and other parts of Maryland, including Anne Arundel County are pursuing pilot programs for newer technologies, she said.\nAs part of its services, ShoreRivers monitors waterways seven months out of the year, testing for nutrients including nitrogen phosphorus and algae as well as measuring water clarity, salinity and temperatures.\nAs Chester Riverkeeper, Richards monitors the Chester and all major tributaries and annual testing is used to generate a report card for the overall Chester River.\nAccording to ShoreRiver data, this year the Chester River brought home a C-plus report card, Richards said.\nWater quality typically degrades farther up river into smaller bodies of water.\n\"So when you have a high ratio of land to a small ratio of water, the water is going to have a harder time recovering from the amount of pollutants going into,\" she said.\nAccording to the data, Corsica ranked as one of the poorest performing tributaries due to the shallow depths and shapes of the bodies of water.\nOn a three-year average, the Corsicia's annual health grade, or water quality index, only met minimum passing water quality standards 34 percent of the time, Richards said.\n\"It's very easy for things to accumulate in the Corsica and not be flushed out,\" she said.\nShoreRivers' concerns are focused on the increased input that will be year-round during warm weather months, she said.\nSeveral aspects including nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll are scoring particularly poorly in the Corsica River already without the additional load of wastewater treatment plant discharge year round, according to Richards.\nBecause of the rural area, non-point source pollution is the largest source of pollution heading into the waterways and urban stormwater runoff from increased construction is the fastest growing type of pollution in the Chesapeake Bay, according to Richards.\nShoreRivers and affiliates look to the pilot program as a way to pursue and implement best practices and the town initiating interest was a critical first step to help advocates secure the development of an improved restoration pilot program.\n\"It would protect and build upon the progress over the last 20 years through restoration efforts by this town and community organizations and maximize environmentally oriented grants and funding sources to offset the cost,\" she said.\nThe pilot program would not change the town's wastewater permit from MDE nor alter the size of the proposed wastewater treatment plant building, she said.\nRestoration funding is something the council has been seeking for three years, said council President Ashley Kaiser, noting the council was aware of funding sources and had received the bulk of its current funding from the Bay Restoration Fund legislatively.\nAlthough offered the opportunity by the legislature, the council aims not to have to dip into the state's revolving loan fund as to not saddle future generations of this town with additional millions of dollars in debt, she said.\nThe council reached a consensus to collect more information regarding program costs as well as comments from the public works department and town staff.\n\"We'd be interested in learning anything that we can,\" Kaiser said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Striped bass need summer vacation to thrive\n\n June 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ALISON COLDEN Bay Journal News Service | Section: Columns \n \n 815\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n There's a shift happening in Chesapeake Bay angling.\"People are pivoting, and they should be,\" said David Sikorski, executive director of the Coastal Conservation Association in Maryland. \"It used to be all stripers all the time. I find now more people view angling as an experience on the water, versus needing to target an exact species.\"\nSikorski is worried about the dire state of the striped bass population. Recent years have seen troubling trends — below average numbers for five years straight in Maryland's juvenile striped bass survey, fewer citation-sized stripers being registered in Virginia, and a steep decline in the Bay's commercial striped bass catch.\nThere are many reasons for these trends, ranging from overfishing and climate change to pollution and loss of habitat. But changing fishing habits is the only immediate way to make a difference.\nChesapeake Bay states and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission have taken action with new regulations. The tough new reality also is being met by a new generation of anglers.\nWhile stripers remain a staple, other species — especially invasives like blue catfish and snakeheads — are increasing in popularity.\n\"Blue catfish are available in every tributary of the Bay and provide endless recreational angling options, with no limits,\" Sikorski said. \"They're attracting new anglers across the watershed all year round.\"\nThe regional publication FishTalk hosts monthly invasive species fishing reports. On social media, hundreds of thousands of people are following catfish anglers like TikTok personality Haz Life Fishing and Ernest Robinson, whose half a million Instagram followers know him as Ernie the Hog Snatcher.\nWhile fishing for schoolie stripers is tempting these warm summer days, it's also when striped bass are most vulnerable. With the right steps now, we can rebuild a healthy striped bass fishery for the future. Anglers can start by giving stripers a well-deserved summer vacation.\nAbout 90% of striped bass caught recreationally are released, according to ASMFC stock assessment data. But a significant number of these fish die, especially on hot summer days.\nAtlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission data assumes that about 9% of stripers that are caught and released will die from the stress. But that's the year-round number; the percentage is likely much higher in the summer, when heat causes low-oxygen levels in the water, increasing striped bass heart rates and hindering their ability to swim, find food and fight disease.\nTo address this, this year the commission established a catch-and-release mortality workgroup to explore options to reduce the loss of released fish.\nMaryland also has implemented regulations prohibiting striped bass fishing from July 16 to July 31, when striped bass are particularly stressed by high temperatures. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources posts heat warnings when air temperatures are above 90 degrees.\nThe season will reopen Aug. 1 and run through Dec. 10. Anglers may keep one striped bass from 19 to 24 inches per person, per day.\nSummer is prime time for catching many other species, including northern snakehead (also known as Chesapeake channa), white perch and yellow perch in the upper Bay and its rivers. In the southern Bay, where salinity is higher, expect to find cobia, red drum, speckled trout and Spanish mackerel.\nBlue catfish can be caught in every Bay tributary, year-round. Introduced into the Bay watershed in the 1970s, these catfish have since become voracious predators of beloved native species like striped bass, oysters and blue crabs.\nThe Maryland Office of Tourism's Fish & Hunt Maryland recently added a Catfish Trail resource to help anglers target these aggressive and fun-to-catch predators. Many prime catfishing spots are easily accessible from the shore, where you can use basic tackle and cheap bait (try dipping raw chicken in Kool-Aid).\nBlue cats also make for a great meal. Unlike other catfish species that are mainly bottom feeders, blue catfish have a more varied diet and are known for their tasty white, flaky fillets. Summer is an ideal time to catch the smaller, younger blue catfish that taste best.\nIf you do target stripers this summer, there are steps you can take to responsibly fish them. The maximum catch size for striped bass in the Bay is 24 inches, because bigger fish most effectively reproduce and rebuild the population. Older, larger females produce far more eggs and are key to repopulation efforts.\nThe last time we saw a strong number of juvenile striped bass in the Bay was in 2015. These have grown into the big fish being caught today.\nAnglers can help ensure fish survival by practicing safe catch and release tactics, such as using barbless circle hooks, keeping fish in the water and supporting them with two hands if handling.\nSustainable fisheries require long-term forethought and, sometimes, short-term sacrifice. If we want a striped bass fishery in the future, we need to pivot. Let's give striped bass a summer break.\nAllison Colden is the Chesapeake Bay Foundation's Maryland Executive Director.

The driver who hit the bear was not injured.\nThe bear was first spotted in western Newark more than a week ago, showing up in back yards along Julie Lane in Barksdale Estates.\nLater sightings were reported in Scottfield and Bear.\nWildlife biologists from the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control will conduct an examination of the deceased bear to try to determine where it originated, its age, sex and other information that might be helpful in tracking other transient black bears that venture into Delaware from surrounding states that have resident black bear populations.\nThe expansion of black bear populations in neighboring states such as Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania has led to occasional sightings in Delaware, officials said.\n\"We understand the community's interest in the bear,'\" said Joe Rogerson, a DNREC wildlife biologist. \"It's always unfortunate when wildlife is lost in such a manner. Our team will be examining the bear to gather information.\"\nPolice began receiving reports of bear sightings on Saturday, June 22.\nPolice warned people to be alert but not to attempt tracking or capturing the bear, said Lt. Andrew Rubin, a spokesman for the Newark Police Department.\n\"It's a wild animal,\" Rubin said. \"They're allowed to run where they want. We're just letting people know that it's out there.\"\nRachael DeFilippis, who lives on Julie Lane, said her security camera captured video of the bear visiting her back yard shortly after 8 p.m. Saturday.\n\"We took our dogs out to the back yard about 20 minutes later, and they wouldn't leave the deck,\" DeFilippis said. \"They were sniffing the area the bear had been in.

If all goes to the company's plan, Morgnec Solar LLC, owned by Urban Grid, will connect to the power grid via an existing Delmarva Power Substation adjacent to the project site.\nThe state recently approved of the project against the county and Chestertown's wishes.\nUrban Grid's website lists the benefits of a solar field.\n\"The project will yield significant Real Property Tax revenue for Kent County for a lifetime,\" it says, along with listing the environmental benefits of solar power.\nThe project poses \"no material impact to the wetlands, cultural resources or threatens any endangered species,\" according to Urban Grid.\nArchitect Tom Kocubinski and chair of the Kent County Conservation and Preservation Alliance Janet Christensen-Lewis would beg to differ.\n\"It's 140,000 solar collectors. That's a mile long,\" Kocubinski said.\nNot only do they disapprove now, he added, but the Kent County Commissioners did when the issue came up roughly two years ago.\nOn Feb. 1, 2022, at their regular meeting, the commissioners joined Kent Conservation and Preservation Alliance in an appeal of the Public Service Commission's approval of a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the Morgnec Road Solar project.\nAnd Chestertown was not on board either. Mayor David Foster didn't see it as a suitable location at the time since eastward is their only direction to expand.\nFoster said, \"While we normally welcome solar power, the town also opposed that solar project because it was right in the middle of our only real opportunity for expansion of Chestertown.\"\nKocubinski and others thought the issue was settled. However, a year ago a judge approved of the project, leading to heated discussions over the solar farm.\nThose for the project say that these solar panels will save money and allow the community to \"think globally while living locally.\" They say that it will boost the economy, bringing revenue to a county desperate for it.\nOpponents claim solar panel energy is not as environmentally friendly as once thought.\nThe solar panels utilize numerous materials — cobalt, nickel, cadmium, lithium, vanadium, graphite — the mining of which has been shown to damage the environment.\nOpponents also point out once in operation, the solar field will be controlled from a distance, not by people in the county.\nInstead of a solar farm of one mile frontage on Morgnec Road with a screening wall, KCPA proposes an alternative of berm, trees, shrubs and pedestrian amenities like a footpath.\nAll of this is likely to be discussed on July 11 at 1:30 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Young author presents local bird guide to Horizons students\n\n July 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Life \n \n 743\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Encouraging fellow youths to learn about their local feathered friends, Xaviana Leis, 13, of Edgewater presented her authored and illustrated \"Maryland Bird Guide\" to Horizons of Kent and Queen Anne's students at the Gunston School June 25.Preventing summer learning from going to the birds, this season's Horizons summer program focus is all about birds with high-flying fun. Last week's presenter, Leis shared her knowledge about birds and her experiences as a raptor volunteer and what others can do to support their environment.\nHorizons of Kent and Queen Anne's programs seek to prevent \"summer slide\" and provide engaging educational opportunities and events for under-resourced students, according to Emily Murphy, executive director.\nThis season's theme focuses all on birds and in addition to regular Horizons activities, this summer students are diving into what it means to be a good steward of the environment and strengthen an appreciation for wildlife, Murphy said.\nThroughout the summer the students will engage in high-flying activities including bird watching and building an osprey nest, Murphy said.\nIn keeping with this season's theme, Horizons was excited to welcome Leis, who at the age of 11, authored and illustrated her book \"Maryland Bird Guide\".\nA homeschool student in Edgewater and member of Girl Scout 11023, her passion for birds grew when a rehabilitator with Owl Moon Raptor Center came to present to her troop, she said.\nSoon, Leis was volunteering herself at Owl Moon along with her mother, and was captivated by the world of local birds, she said.\nWriting and illustrating the self-published \"Maryland Bird Guide\" as part of a Girl Scout Bronze Star Award when she was 11, Leis seeks to continually educate her community on the wonders of local birds and spread messages about how to help these amazing creatures.\n\"I wanted to do something that would inspire others to learn more about birds and how they can help them,\" she said.\nSome species of birds like crows are extremely intelligent and can remember the actions of humans that are nice to them and those who aren't so nice, Leis said. Crows also use human tools to their advantage, such as leaving nuts in the road to be cracked by passing cars and then hopping into the road when the traffic light turns red.\nContrary to popular belief, bread is not a suitable food to feed ducks at the park, Leis said.\nBread has little nutritional value for ducks and uneaten bread can also form algae to gunk up the water. Better foods available in your kitchen to toss for ducks include fruit, uncooked oatmeal and rice. Frozen peas thawed by the time you get to the park also make a nice treat, she said.\nLeis also noted the impressive wingspan on several species of raptors that truly has to be seen to be believed.\nShe reiterated the importance of cleaning up litter for the benefit of keeping a natural habitat beautiful for all of us.\nAlso part of her Scout project, Leis built special tubes to properly dispose of discarded fishing line so it does not get tangled in unsuspecting wildlife.\nEveryone can do their part in helping wildlife this summer by picking up trash, including fishing line and disposing of it in proper receptacles.\nGoing into eighth grade this fall, her goal is to continually educate her community about wildlife.\nBirds are more than just pretty things to look at out your window, they are living creatures and helping birds thrive is a necessary part of the functioning ecosystem, Leis said. \"They are part of the environment and we need to help them.\"\n\"Maryland Guide to Birds\" includes over fifty different birds common to Maryland and nearby states alongside vibrant watercolor illustrations by Leis herself. The book contains a wingspan's worth of information including habitats, diet, size, and fun facts.\n\"You have the ability to make a difference even if you're younger. I want to show others they can have a cause they believe in,\" she said.\nReceiving signed copies of the bird guide, Horizons students were encouraged to \"go wild\" and use the book through the summer program to help identify local birds in the area.\nLeis self-published book is available on Amazon and all proceeds go toward Owl Moon. To date, Leis has raised over $10,000.\n\"It just feels incredible,\" she said.\nFree copies of \"Maryland Guide to Birds\" for groups are available by messaging the Girls Making The World A Better Place Facebook page, Dombi-Leis said.\nHorizons seeks to provide additional support and summer enrichment opportunities to underprivileged students.\nMore information about Horizons can be found at https://horizonskentqueenannes.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Save the Bay, reduce plastics\n\n July 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 367\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Earlier today I was riding around the Miles River and saw little pieces of plastic floating all around the boat. They almost looked like a pretty mosaic glistening in the water until I remembered that plastic pollution is a huge problem in the Bay. The Chesapeake is contaminated with plastic bags washing up onto our docks and \"microplastics\" (tiny fragments that can be as small as .05 millimeters in diameter) in water samples.The Chesapeake Bay has often been called a \"sink\" for plastics. Every day, small pieces of plastic swirl throughout our waters, ending up in the ocean or, far more likely, in the streams that flow through our backyards. Scientific surveys conducted on Bay water have found that 100% of samples contain microplastics. Although they are minuscule, their effects can be massive.\nI love to go out on the boat, watch the sunset, and, most importantly, pull in our crab traps at the end of the day. But in the past couple of years, I have noticed that my crabs are not as prevalent and the cost at restaurants has constantly increased. The crabs and our larger ecosystem are threatened by many factors including the plastic pollution problem in our waters.\nOur bay is an intricate system with thousands of species that interrelate and depend on one another. By adding this plastic pollution into the mix, the whole system is impacted. Sea life and the seafood many of us love are a cornerstone of life in the Bay, but they rely on a healthy ecosystem. NOAA estimates that the Bay could lose hundreds of millions in tourist and seafood sales if plastics continue to go unchecked.\nI think we can all agree it is time to make a change to save our Bay. This Fourth of July, I used less disposable plastic to move us toward a future with a Bay free of plastic waste and tables covered with crabs. Instead of single-use cups and cutlery and disposable decorations, I had cute table settings that can be used for other celebrations and picnics on the Bay.\nJoin me in reducing plastic use to do your part in helping the Bay which has given so much to us.\nJENNA KRINSKY\nRoyal Oak \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "‘A dumping ground’: Despite new state regulations, Caroline County still wrestling with impacts of DAF residuals\n\n July 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1766\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n RIDGELY — When walking around his Ridgely residence and the Tuckahoe State Park, Al Martinez holds grave worries about the health of his neighbors and the environment.As president of the Tuckahoe Equestrian Center, he's mindful of the cleanliness of riding trails throughout the park, along with the park's bodies of water. Martinez's concerns for the environment led him to join other Caroline County residents who publicly spoke out regarding tanks storing \"food processing residuals.\"\nHe has taken notice of the large companies outside of the state that often bring the materials to Maryland. It's a trend he doesn't want to see harm the park or Adkins Arboretum, a 400-acre native garden across from his house.\n\"Big name companies with big pocketbooks are quietly paying other agents to get this stuff into our state,\" Martinez said. \"We kind of know that, even though it's not said so. We know that Big Brother with big money is behind all this.\"\nDissolved air flotation, a method for processing wastewater from food processing plants, leaves behind a sludge-like byproduct, or DAF residuals. State legislation, which referred to the material as \"food processing residuals,\" went into effect July 1. It requires a permit to use, store or haul the material.\nWhile the state's actions will bring some relief, county leaders still are grappling with mitigating the health and environmental drawbacks of the materials. Those drawbacks include increased flies and pungent odors for neighbors, along with the potential for polluted waterways.\nOn the Eastern Shore, much of the material generated from DAF comes from poultry processing plants, though some comes from industrial and wastewater treatment sludge. In Maryland, it is an approved soil amendment or fertilizer.\nAccording to a 2023 study by the University of Maryland, more than half of the industrial sludge land-applied in Maryland in recent years came from other states.\nSince December, Caroline County leaders have held packed public hearings and extended moratoriums on DAF storage tanks. For county commissioners, the main hurdle has been cracking down on a few \"bad actors\" that store the residuals irresponsibly.\nMartinez and his wife, Stacy Frank, each commented at a January hearing on DAF residuals in Caroline County.\n\"The sludge created by this process emits the foulest, nauseating, noxious stench you have ever smelled,\" Frank wrote to county commissioners.\nThe turnout for that January meeting was more than significant — it was historically high, with nearly 70 pieces of spoken and written testimony. It caught the attention of state legislators, who raised the issue during this year's General Assembly.\nTHE STATE BILL\nHouse Bill 991 and its paired Senate Bill 1074 were signed into law by Gov. Wes Moore on May 9. The legislation doesn't prohibit the usage of food processing residuals by farmers, but it requires a permit to store, use or haul the food processing residuals.\nThe bills introduce increased penalties for those who willfully violate Maryland's nutrient management regulations and allow the state to inspect any site where residuals are used.\nWhile HB991 was introduced and sponsored by delegates on the western shore, Del. Jeff Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) also introduced DAF-related legislation in February.\nHis legislation aimed to give local jurisdictions the authority to regulate storage of DAF residuals. Ghrist eventually withdrew his legislation, stating in a letter to Del. Marc Korman (D-Montgomery) that HB991 would \"give the necessary control to local governing bodies.\"\nThe now-signed bill gives responsibility for the permitting program to the Maryland Department of Agriculture.\nThe MDA program is expected to be self-sufficient by collecting fees to support the program's funds.\nHolly Porter, executive director of the Delmarva Chicken Association, said DCA supported the final version of the bill and was \"pleased to see\" the permitting process fall under MDA's purview.\n\"We wanted to make sure that all of our farmers had the ability to utilize food processing residuals because it is a great source of nutrients,\" Porter said. \"… It's an organic material, and it's really one of the best forms of recycling you can do. And it lowers input costs for our grain farmers, which is very important in today's economy.\"\nThe exact extent of the benefits of land-applying DAF residuals isn't always agreed upon between industry and environmental experts.\nMatt Pluta, the Choptank riverkeeper at ShoreRivers, said that DAF could have \"such little available nutrients for the crops,\" causing it to often be applied in large quantities at once.\n\"Because this material is often applied in large quantities, we have concerns over the potential of runoff,\" Pluta said, adding that the waters on the Shore are already polluted due to other agricultural forms of runoff.\nAlan Girard, Maryland advocacy director at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, emphasized the importance that the state caught up to neighboring Virginia and Delaware in regulating the residuals. Companies from those areas had been trucking the product to a less-restricted state like Maryland.\n\"It's really sort of created a dumping ground for the material in Maryland (that is) generated elsewhere,\" Girard said.\nPERMIT PROCESS\nHans Schmidt, assistant secretary of resource conservation at the Department of Agriculture, said the department worked with sponsors of the bill, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Shore Rivers and more groups during the legislative process. The department drafted regulations and presented them to MDA's Nutrient Management Advisory Committee.\nGirard said \"the department deserves a lot of credit\" for its work on drafting regulations to satisfy the bill, which officially took effect July 1.\n\"The department will know ahead of time when and where these products are going to be applied,\" Schmidt said. \"… We have authority now to go on the farms where these products (are) without prior approval from the landowner.\"\nSince the time between the bill passing and the July 1 effective date was limited, Schmidt clarified that the final permit regulations are not active. Instead, the department finalized a set of emergency regulations that was sent to a state legislative committee.\nThe emergency regulations, posted on MDA's website, will be effective once approved by that administrative, executive and legislative review joint committee. Those regulations will last for six months, during which MDA will submit proposed final regulations, Schmidt said.\n\"Hopefully by Jan. 1, the proposed regulations will be approved,\" he added.\nPorter said the Delaware Chicken Association offered suggestions to the first draft of regulations, adding that the group is \"very much engaged\" in conversation with MDA.\nIn a recent Caroline County Commissioners meeting on July 9, Porter said she believes the state regulations aim to ensure \"tracking, reporting and accountability.\" However, she added that the emergency regulations — which are currently being reviewed by the joint committee — \"still (have) some things we're a little concerned on.\"\n\"It's more restrictive than I'm sure the industry likes,\" Schmidt said. \"But I think it still meets the intent as far as limiting the number of applications that these products can be applied to the land.\"\n'BAD ACTORS'\nWhile not opposed to the usage of food processing residuals, the Caroline County commissioners have taken significant steps in the past year to aleve concerns from residents like Martinez and Frank. Many of the complaints relate to odors and flies.\nCounty resident Russ Yates owns Holiday Park Campground near Greensboro and has expressed concerns during public hearings about the prospect of using the structures at a neighboring former dairy farm to store DAF. He doesn't want non-permitted materials stored next to his campground and corn fields.\nCommission President Travis Breeding said the problem became apparent last winter as the yearly deadline for permitted land application of DAF residuals neared. From Dec. 15 to March 1, the residuals cannot be land-applied under state law, which is the reason for much of the DAF storage.\n\"There was a mad dash to get as much of this material out on the fields as they could get on the fields up until that Dec. 15 cutoff,\" Breeding said. \"And then they started to store this material in these structures.\"\nBreeding said that trend led the county to call meetings over the winter to discuss placing moratoriums on the storage of DAF residuals. Moratoriums are still in place until later this fall.\n\"We knew that we had to be well educated in this decision … because of how important the industry is to our local economy,\" Breeding said. \"But just because an industry is a vital part of your economy doesn't give them the right to become a nuisance. We had to try to balance that.\"\nAt a July 9 county commission meeting, a county bill to create a food processing residuals storage permit was introduced. Notably, if passed, it would require closed-top storage, going a step further than the state's recently introduced regulations.\nDuring the meeting, Breeding said he visited a Goldsboro resident who \"had never experienced flies like that before\" due to nearby food processing residuals.\nSpeaking on behalf of the Delmarva Chicken Association and as a Denton resident, Porter expressed disappointment with the legislation and raised concerns that it'll hurt the agriculture and poultry industries.\n\"You potentially open up the door that five years or 10 years from now, people are going to come in and complain about other odors (and flies),\" Porter said.\nIn an interview with The Star Democrat, Porter said part of the reason for her opposition to the county legislation is that it \"does not grandfather in\" farmers who use open-top storage.\n\"I don't anticipate that our elected officials are experts in all things,\" Porter said to the commission, \"… but I do expect our commissioners to be leaders. As leaders, you don't manage to the exception and develop a policy for one person.\"\nPorter has emphasized that the vast majority of farmers store and apply the residuals properly. \"We had a bad actor in this county,\" she later said.\n\"It's more than one,\" Commissioner Frank Bartz responded.\nBreeding, who has previously acknowledged that he expects \"players from the poultry industry\" to \"have heartburn\" with county legislation, admitted to Porter during the meeting that he believes they are \"a ways apart\" on the debate.\nAt a Caroline County Planning Commission meeting on July 10, the legislation passed with two yes votes from Breeding and Chair Jeff Jackson. Hannah Cawley, the commission's vice chair, voted no, while commission member Keith Bilbrough abstained.\nThe bill will return to the desk of the Caroline County Commissioners on Aug. 6 for a public hearing.\n\"It is still an issue for a lot of residents in the county,\" Breeding said at the July 9 meeting. \"… That is why we have taken a very hard-line stance that you're not going to be allowed to affect your neighbors.\"\nVeronica Fernandez-Alvarado contributed to this story.\nA previous version of this story incorrectly stated the date of the Caroline County Commissioners public hearing. The hearing will be held on Aug. 6 at 9:15 a.m. in the Health & Public Services Building in Denton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So it becomes more economical to keep your home cool,\" said Jennifer Vaccarro, community restoration coordinator for ShoreRivers.\nVolunteers, called tree stewards, get involved by spreading the word about the program, conducting site assessments to make sure the trees are being put in the spots where they can thrive, and keeping an eye on the trees after they are planted.\nOne such volunteer is Sophie Leight of Easton.\n\"It was a super easy and quick way to get involved in environmentalism and restoration. I have really enjoyed engaging with the community in a different way,\" she said.\n\"It seems like such a small action to plant a tree, but I know that small actions definitely add up. All those little actions matter so much,\" Leight said.\nRestoration dollars for private properties are rare, Vaccarro said, making this opportunity for residents to get free trees unusual.\n\"The scale of it — we are trying to make a long-term, big difference in the livability of our towns,\" she said. \"(The trees) not only benefit the birds, but they have so many benefits for people.\n\"When there is a healthy tree canopy present, asthma rates go down. Trees naturally clean the air around them,\" Vaccoro said. \"Being in a shaded, green environment is calming to your central nervous system so it will reduce stress.\"\nThere are also environmental and ecological benefits to planting the trees.\n\"As we built out our towns, that were usually forests, we have removed habitat that is important to birds and insects and small mammals,\" Vaccoro said. \"Typically when we put that habitat back, it has not come in the form of native plants that are from here.\n\"The trees we are planting are all native — tees that coevolved here on the Eastern Shore with those birds, insects and small mammals. They are providing really crucial habitat,\" she said.\nCarlos Estin has planted many trees as a volunteer with the program.\n\"I have been with the Tree the Shore program for three years. We have done projects over at Great Marsh, Meadow Park and long wharf. Now we are working on the neighborhoods. There are studies that show an incredible psychological benefit. People start taking better care of themselves and their lawns,\" he said.\nIt really brings the community together,\" Estin said.\nThere will be another volunteer training in the fall for people who want to get involved.

The county's recent initiative to recycle single-use boat shrink wrap has resulted in a significant increase in the amount of plastic diverted from landfills.In the second year of the program, the Queen Anne's County government, in partnership with Plastic Free QAC and the Marine Trades Association of Maryland, has seen a 370% increase in the amount of recycled shrink wrap compared to last year.\nThis year, a total of six tons pounds of plastic shrink wrap was collected and recycled, a substantial increase from the 1.62 tons collected in 2023.\nQueen Anne's County Commissioner Phil Dumenil expressed his enthusiasm, stating, \"This significant increase in our recycling efforts underscores the dedication and commitment of our residents and businesses to protect our county. By expanding the availability of MTAM recycle bags and increasing the public awareness, we have made it easier for everyone to participate in this important initiative.\"\nKey highlights of this year's success include:\nIncreased participation from individual boat owner with a notable rise in the number of individual boat owners participating in the recycling program, showcasing the community's growing environmental consciousness.Expansion of recycling bag pickup locations; the program expanded from one to four convenient pickup locations for MTAM recycle bags, including:West Marine in Chester, Rommel's Ace Hardware in Stevensville, Centreville Town Hall and Refill Goodness in Stevensville.Commitment from local marinas and boat companies. Several local businesses committed to responsible disposal of shrink wrap, among them: Bay Bridge Marina, Bosun's Marine, Atlantic Yacht Services and Pocket Yacht Company\nThe MTAM recycle bags, sponsored by the County Commissioners, were provided free of charge and made available at multiple locations. The dedicated MTAM shrink wrap dumpster at the Grasonville Transfer Station facilitated easy and eco-friendly disposal for boat owners from early April to June.\nThis initiative is part of Queen Anne's County's broader commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainability. By continuing to work together, the county aims to set an example for other communities across Maryland and beyond.\nPlastic Free QAC started in 2018 with the mission to reduce single-use plastic usage in general and places focus on education and building public awareness, according to Sara Shelley, president of Plastic Free QAC.\n\"We are really thrilled with the community response,\" she said.\nUnderstanding that old habits with single-use plastics can be hard to shake, Plastic Free QAC looks to continually build involvement by connecting with individual boat owners and hosting community-wide clean ups, Shelley said.\nFor more information about the recycling program, including where to pick up MTAM recycle bags and drop off cleaned shrink wrap, visit https://lnk.bio/RecycleBoatShrinkwrap. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Town passes ordinance cracking down on illicit discharges\n\n July 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 512\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — An ordinance that will crack down on the dumping and spillage of certain discharges in Easton is set to take effect in early August.The Easton Town Council unanimously passed an illicit discharge ordinance on Monday following discussions of the item at three public meetings. Town Engineer Rick Van Emburgh worked to put the ordinance together, emphasizing that the only discharge that should end up in the street is rainwater.\n\"At the end of the day, the only thing allowed in the stormwater system is rainwater, so we need to do our best to keep everything else out,\" Van Emburgh said.\nDue to EPA requirements that were passed down to the Maryland Department of the Environment, the town is required to restrict certain discharges. The restrictions come since Easton is in its sixth year of the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System program — a program that the state requires the town to follow.\nThe ordinance authorizes the town to perform inspections at sites where it has \"reasonable cause\" that an illicit discharge violation is occurring. The town may also fine violators.\nHowever, Van Emburgh stated that the main goal is to make residents aware of the law and how to achieve \"best practices\" when disposing of substances.\n\"We're not going to come out and fine anybody,\" Van Emburgh said at the meeting. \"We're just going to come out, and we'll have flyers.\"\nMatt Pluta, the Choptank riverkeeper for ShoreRivers, expressed support for the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System program. Pluta said foreign material entering the stormwater system negatively impacts the Chesapeake Bay and local waterways. Grease from restaurants and concrete were two materials Pluta pointed out as harmful.\n\"Those storm drains along the street, those aren't treated,\" Pluta said. \"The water that goes in there isn't treated, it's just a direct conveyance to our local waterways. Here in Easton, that waterway is the Tred Avon River right here at Easton Point.\"\nPROHIBITED DISCHARGESThe town engineer noted some specific examples during Monday's Town Council meeting. Van Emburgh said the town is asking for leaves to be placed \"behind the curb\" for the public works crew to pick up. He also addressed the example of changing oil.\n\"We're not going to be out looking for people changing the oil in their cars,\" Van Emburgh said. \"We're looking to make sure it's done in a responsible way, and if there is an accident, we use what's available to us to clean it up.\"\nSome other prohibited discharges outlined in the ordinance include swimming pool water with chlorine levels beyond state regulations, new or used petroleum products, industrial waste and septic tank waste.\nChemicals put down drains in houses are fine, since those go to the sanitary sewer line and a wastewater treatment facility, Van Emburgh clarified at a previous Town Council meeting.\nExempt discharges include discharges from firefighting, irrigation water, dechlorinated swimming pool water in line with state regulations and residential car washing, among others.\nWhile commercial car washers are not exempt, Van Emburgh said that car washing companies in town have proper recycling methods that will fall in line with the requirements of the ordinance. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He came to the Eastern Shore as part of a riverkeeper movement, and he and his wife Ann settled at the Wye Farm about 20 years ago.\nThrough assistance with ShoreRivers, Shaw began the acreage of wildflowers plantings three years ago.\nWildflowers can coexist on commercial farm land to provide an important wildlife habitat, and Shaw emphasized anyone with a bit of land can grow wildflowers and benefit the environment.\n\"Everyone can do a little bit to help,\" he said.\nWhether plein air artists, equestrian groups or farmers and individuals interested in growing their own native wildflowers, Shaw is alway happy to welcome tours of the land and further education about environmental benefits.\nWith a \"friends first perspective,\" ShoreRivers believes in building relationships with anybody, especially farmers, for outreach and collaboration, Leigh said.\nShoreRivers is a grassroots nonprofit that works to protect and restore Eastern Shore waterways and provide leadership in land restoration. ShoreRivers field trips seek to bring hands-on experiences to provide a clear look at the interconnected land and water.\nAvailability is essential to stewardship, and ShoreRivers continually seeks to provide a wide variety of both land and water expeditions, including kayak trips, visits to oyster hatcheries, and the Chesapeake Culinary center showcases about turning invasive species into great eatings, Leigh said.\nMore information about ShoreRivers, including upcoming events and how to get involved, can be found at shorerivers.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "After 60 years, gravestones return to a reborn island\n\n July 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JEREMY COX Bay News Journal | Section: Local News \n \n 2018\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Sometimes, a final resting place is far from final.When the Howarth family interred their loved ones in Poplar Island's soil in the late 1800s, they probably had no idea that the ground, along with everything on it and in it, would disappear in a matter of decades.\nA mixture of forces — sinking land, rising seas and erosion — chewed away at the Chesapeake Bay island just off Maryland's Eastern Shore. By the 1920s, the last of the original 100 residents had been forced to flee. By the early 1990s, nothing of Poplar remained above water but a few small scrapes of marshland.\nWater has claimed countless cemeteries and individual graves around the Chesapeake. As climate change accelerates the pace of sea level rise, much more hallowed ground is at risk of vanishing.\nBut the descendants of those buried at Poplar fought for a different outcome. More than 60 years ago, an aging family member led a mission that rescued the remaining five headstones from a watery grave. Then, fate intervened. A history-making project to rebuild Poplar Island gave them the opportunity to bring those stones back to where they had once stood.\nAt the center of this story are an aging father, Louis Howeth, and his son, Lee. (The family surname morphed its spelling after they left Poplar.) Lee, an IT specialist at the Shore's Salisbury University, has raced against time over the past few years to fulfill his father's dream while he was still alive to see it.\nThe Bay Journal reported this story over 15 months. What follows is the account of an unlikely reunion told by those who made it happen.\nBroken tiesLouis Howeth: People would say well, \"If you could be anywhere in the world, where would you be?\" This person would say, \"Well, in New York.\" My father said, \"Poplar Island.\"\nLee Howeth: There's definitely some story to be told about the island fading away and the restoration that they're doing. This is kind of the human side of that story.\nLouis: [My family] had a farming operation. I understand that the Howarth family owned over 1,000 acres [on Poplar]. They were timber people. They were farmers.\nKristina Motley (senior environmental specialist, Maryland Environmental Service): People used to live out here. The first date we like to focus on is the year 1847. And the reason is that's when they first measured the area of the land. At that time, they found it to be 1,140 acres in size, a fairly large island. It housed a town called Valiant, where there were about 100 individuals.\nLouis: My mother told stories on how there were 16 old, brick-solid — not brick veneer — but solid homes over there.\nMotley: There was a schoolhouse [that also served as a church] with a cemetery attached to that, a general store, a post office and a sawmill.\nLouis: My mother told a story about how she and dad were lying in bed one night. All of a sudden, they heard this terrible squeal. The men get up the next morning to go out to the farm, went down to the water, and there was a cow down there without its tail. Mother said that it was Chessie, the monster that lived on the Bay [that had attacked the cow].\nMotley: By the 1920s, all the full-time residents had to move off the island due to erosion. The water was pretty much coming up to their doorstep.\nLouis: My father said, \"We watched a field go, and we didn't really think too much about it because when it gets to that woods, the trees will stop it.\" Well, they weren't thinking about the fact that the tide and waves would undermine the roots. Suddenly, you just have a tree on roots, and nothing in the ground. That was my first understanding of erosion firsthand.\nLee: People that lived out there spent their whole lives, raised families and died on the island.\nLouis: [My father] had a lot of — I wouldn't call them regrets — but he had a lot of thoughts about how he could have maintained the island itself. They had to sell [their portion of] the island, must have been early 1900s. It was a money thing.\nMotley: The island went through a variety of different owners after that.\nSaving the stonesLouis: There was a cemetery plot [remaining on Poplar]. My uncle, Harvey Howarth, used to go over there with his lawn mower to keep it looking nice. He said to me one day [in the 1960s], \"We got to get over to that island. That graveyard is eroding, and I think we've lost some of the stones already.\"\nLee: [Harvey] was in his probably late 70s. He didn't have the means or capability to do it by himself. So, he asked a friend of his, Willie Rowe, to help. He, Willie and another friend went out [to Poplar] and looked for the stones.\nWillie Rowe: (speaking to the Baltimore Sun in 2006): He'd been asking me two months before that to take him. That one day was a Saturday. I said, \"I'll take you right now.\"\nLouis: They had a row skiff and went to the island.\nLee: They didn't take any tools. They didn't realize they were going to be taking them [when they set off]. They had to get down on their hands and knees and literally dig with their hands to get the gravestones out.\nLouis: They couldn't find any evidence of the bodies themselves. All they had was stones.\nLee: From oldest to youngest, there's Levi Howarth. He was my great-great grandfather. Then, there's his son, George. He was my great-grandfather. And George's first wife, Mary, is there. There's a stone for their son, Grover. And there's a stone for George's son, Melvin, whom he had with his second wife, Lizzie.\nLouis: The water was intruding into the cemetery. It was turning into a marsh. It was muddy.\nLee: They ended up taking [all five remaining stones] and bringing them back to Tilghman Island and placing them on Willie Rowe's property. They were there for 50-plus years. My great-uncle would go there and mow the grass and keep them up and plant flowers.\nPoplar Island is rebornMotley: When the U.S. Army Corps came out in 1993, they did another land survey on the island. They found that the island had shrunk from that 1,140 acres to less than 5 acres. And those 5 acres weren't even one continuous island. They were split between four tiny \"remnant islands.\"\nWe are restoring the island by using fresh material from the Baltimore [shipping] channels that we bring here to Poplar Island to restore habitat for our native species. We started construction in 1998 and received our first bit of inflow of dredged material in 2000. We've been slowly filling it up ever since.\nPoplar Island gravestones arriveThe Howarth family gravestones arrive at Poplar Island on May 8, 2024, to be reinstalled on the restored island.\nIt's been estimated that in our known history about 400 islands have been lost in the Bay. Every year, we lose about 260 acres of this wetland habitat. It's very important habitat that is very much on the decline.\n[Poplar] is sort of a sanctuary. We get a lot of migratory birds. We've been able to identify over 400 different species of animals that have come back to the island. Over 250 of them are bird species.\nHatching a planLee (speaking in March 2023): We want to get [the headstones] in a permanent place. Over the years, I've kind of felt that sense of burden. My father's 85. I'd kind of like to see him see it through and see them put back where they belong.\nAbout three or four months back, Willie Rowe passed away. And my father, realizing that the house was going to be sold, felt the need to move [the headstones] quickly. So, right now they're at my cousin's house [also on Tilghman].\nLouis (speaking in November 2023 at Lee's home, where he had recently moved because he could no longer live on his own): I said to my son, Lee, \"Before something happens to me, those tombstones down on Willie Rowe's farm, in my opinion, should go back to the island.\"\nLee (responding to his father): You talked to me about it probably for the last 20 years.\nLouis: There was talk about putting them other places, but I thought, \"That's where they came from.\"\nPreparing for gravestone installation, Poplar IslandLee emailed the Maryland Environmental Service, which is involved with the restoration work. Ryland Taylor, then an environmental specialist at the agency, quickly responded.\nRyland Taylor: It was too good of an opportunity to pass up to bring them back here.\nLee (in November 2023): Everything's hung up, waiting on a legal document to be drafted that dad will sign with one of my cousins. It essentially says we don't have any claim to the tombstones anymore. I don't feel like we ever really did have a claim to them. I feel like in every way they belong to the island more than they ever belonged to us.\nAnother hangup: The stones needed refurbishment. Some were missing the entire underground portion. The family took the stones to Tony LeCompte (pronounced \"lay count\") of LeCompte Monument in Laurel, DE, to have them fixed.\nTony LeCompte (speaking in May 2023): We are fabricating new parts to replace the missing parts. They're from other old stones that were destroyed. They were hit by a car. So, it's kind of from the same vintage time with the replacement parts.\nThe final step will be epoxy and then cleaning the stones to make them look as if they've been cleaned, but not new. I don't want them to look like they came right out of the factory or the quarry. ... My family does go back a long, long way here. I'm sure I have relatives whose stones have been broken and washed out into the Bay. I want to be part of the process of fixing them and putting them back where they belong.\nThe headstones returnBy May 2024, the headstones' restoration was complete, and the legal hurdles cleared. The job of ferrying the headstones to Poplar fell to Robert Wilson, a 72-year-old waterman based on Tilghman Island who has a contract with the Maryland Environmental Service to haul freight to the island. For the final resting place, officials selected a shady spot adjacent to a courtyard of stone pavers.\nKatie Perkins (Poplar project manager for the Army Corps): As soon as visitors arrive here and step off the boat, they will see it.\nMotley: This is where we gather every tour. We'll talk about the history of the island. We'll definitely have [the headstones] here, front and center, for people to come and visit. And we'll definitely talk about their story to give a full picture of what Poplar Island really is.\nA family celebrationOn June 4, a little more than a dozen Howeth family members climbed aboard a boat on Tilghman for the 20-minute ride to Poplar. The stones, gleaming white, were standing upright once again in two neat rows. Workers had spread a layer of pea gravel around them, shaped like a heart.\nLee: I'm amazed. I'm impressed that we've got everybody here to see it together. These [names on the headstones] are all Howarths here. But they represent a bigger community that is here and many other surnames and other people that were here.\nBobbie Sue Knight (Louis' great-niece): I don't think I ever came out here. Not to say I didn't hear all the stories.\nHoweth family, Poplar Island\nHoweth family members gathered on Poplar Island on the day their ancestors' gravestones were rededicated. (Courtesy of the Howath family)\nLorie Fluharty (also a great-niece): They look like they were made to be here. It makes a connection with the past even though I didn't know these people. It makes it more real.\nLee: Today's just the end of a 60-year journey for these stones. It's an emotional day, and I'm happy to see it completed. They're back where they belong. (Turning to his father standing beside him, gripping a silver cane) What do you think?\nLouis: Absolutely.\nJeremy Cox is a Bay Journal staff writer based in Maryland.

    "content": "Edible Flower & Farm Tour entices the senses\n\n July 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LISA J. GOTTO Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 812\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Every year, ShoreRivers compiles an impressive roster of experiential events intended to highlight and connect area residents in obvious, and sometimes not so obvious, ways to the Bay, rivers and creeks.Wednesday's event, which was listed on their calendar as a, \"farm tour featuring edible flowers,\" explored one of the less obvious interactions.\nThese partner-driven events, ShoreRivers Membership Manager Courtney Leigh said, take root in their symbiotic nature. The site for this day's gathering was Wildly Native Flower Farm in Chestertown.\n\"Shore Rivers believes that creating engaging opportunities for community members in the work that we do is going to help and restore our waterways,\" Leigh said, as she introduced the event host Liza Goetz, the owner of Wildly Native, to the attendees.\n\"Wildly Native Flower Farm encourages people to understand how the natural world, and particularly plants, are not only useful in pollination, they are excellent inhabitants. They are beautiful ornaments to bring joy into your worlds in your homes and your events,\" Leigh said. \"But, they also believe in the power of plants as it pertains to human health and its enjoyment as it pertains to food and beverage.\"\nThe groups are kept small intentionally, making the day's gathering of nine seem just right. While small, the group did not lack Eastern Shore representation, as attendees came from as far as Kent Island, Oxford and Easton to participate.\nGathered under a white festival canopy surrounded by several of the farm's fragrant pastures, attendees began their experience by sharing their rationales for attending.\n\"I'm here because I just love to see the wildflowers and the native plants,\" said Carol Trippe, a Chestertown resident and Chair of the Chester Watershed Advisory Board. \"And we just turned our back yard into a river-friendly yard, so it's great to see some native flowers, as well.\nTrippe was joined by others with property-related project pursuits, or passions of the entomological sort.\n\"I just started raising monarchs, so I'd like to learn what might attract them,\" Connie Jones of Galena added.\nGoetz's family history on this land located off of Broad Neck Road goes back generations, so she is keenly aware of the impact that running a farm can have on the environment, and, in particular, its surrounding waterways.\nThis, said Leigh, dovetails especially well with the ShoreRivers' Next Generation Land Stewards program, which she said aims to create cohorts with the newest generation of family-based land owners so that as land stewards they can be educated and empowered to manage their land in a way that's not just profitable for the farm and their business, but also conscious of how it impacts water quality.\nGoetz has been working closely with Alicia Boyd, proprietor of local Humble Hearts Catering & Events, to create a native flower sampling experience, in which the group was then able to partake.\nVarieties of marigolds and chrysanthemum were the most easily identified as components of the summer toast and goat cheese spread; the Dianthus barbatus, or Sweet William, as it is more commonly known, was among the most difficult to identify. A chilled tea made from a base of steeped orange geranium leaves, served as the beverage accompaniment to the samplings.\nOf the edible flower aspect of her catering, Boyd said, \"Everyone is excited about this venture, but it is a long process. There's a lot of compliance that comes along with it.\"\nBoyd said that they work extensively with Cornell University, several local health departments, and the University of Maryland Extension to ensure the quality and safety of every native plant used to create their menus.\nThe tour continued with a short walk past the garden plots, outbuildings, and the family ancestral home to the farm's flower production barn where Goetz introduced the group to the people, processes and products associated with the hundreds of species and subspecies of native plants grown on the property. The small staff works within two levels of the barn under ceiling beams from which hundreds of variations of native plants are affixed for drying.\nGoetz points to a large, plastic tray divided into many small pods filled with soil. It will soon be sitting on a workstation, where a staff member will use garden tweezers to convey the precious seeds to the pods for germination. Goetz said every native plant in the gardens started out this way.\nThe experience ended with a communal flower arranging session. Before any stem was placed in a vase, fresh, clean water was added to it from the farm's outdoor pump, reminding everyone how none of this works without life's most basic element.\nLeigh concluded with a reminder that many ShoreRivers events are free to the public and there are still a good selection of events, including an expedition to the Chesapeake Culinary Center in Denton and a fly fishing lesson near Mill Creek, that will take place in the remaining calendar year for the community to come out and experience.\nFor more information, visit shorerivers.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Wave of defense tactics aim to save eastern hemlocks\n\n August 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AD CRABLE Chesapeake Bay Journal | Section: News \n \n 1235\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The fight is far from over, but scientists are increasingly optimistic that once-ubiquitous eastern hemlock trees might, with help, bounce back from a 50-year assault by invasive woolly adelgids.The aphid-like insects, native to the Pacific Northwest and Asia, found their way to the eastern U.S. in the early to mid-1900s and have been spreading and killing hemlocks by the millions ever since.\nBut a combination of bio-controls, insecticides, habitat doctoring and a disease-resistant hemlock hybrid — plus the discovery of native trees that are somehow immune — may keep the beloved and valuable tree from disappearing in Eastern forests. That's an outcome that arborists would not have predicted with confidence 20 years ago.\n\"It's a long game, but it's a long game we are going to win,\" said Tammara Van Ryn, director of the Nature Conservancy's Adirondack Park Invasive Plant Program. The conservancy, along with the U.S. Forest Service, has embarked on a Trees in Peril program to find, monitor, research and breed pest-resistant hemlocks, along with efforts for similarly imperiled native beech and ash trees — even the nearly extinct American elm.\n\"I am sure the hemlock is going to stay on the landscape,\" she continued. \"We've learned a lot of lessons from mistakes with the American chestnut that we're not repeating. We're using every tool to keep [enough] hemlocks alive to get to the point where we can breed more-resistant trees and get them out into the forest.\"\nThe primary tools that will buy that necessary time are chemical treatments, which keep the insects at bay for several years per treatment, and promising biological controls: nonnative insects that feed on the adelgids. Forest managers and scientists have been experimenting with predatory beetles for decades. Recently, they've added adelgid-eating silver flies to the experimental arsenal.\nWoolly adelgids do their often-fatal damage by sucking nutrient-rich fluids from hemlock needles, weakening the tree and reducing foliage. The bugs, with two egg-producing life cycles per year, have rapid population growth.\nIn Pennsylvania, where the eastern hemlock is the state tree and represents about 15% of all forest trees, woolly adelgids are found in all 67 counties.\nIn Virginia, where the eastern U.S. infestation is thought to have begun, foresters estimate a loss of roughly 2% of its hemlocks annually. Shenandoah National Park has been particularly hard hit, though. According to the park trust, 95% of the property's mature hemlocks have died during the last 25 years.\nIn Maryland, the hotspots appear to be the state's four westernmost counties. Catoctin Mountain Park in Frederick County has lost a significant portion of its hemlocks, important for shading and cooling the park's trout streams, in recent decades.\nClimate change could complicate matters. Substantial cold kills the woolly adelgid, so warmer winters generally work to its advantage — and may extend its range northward.\n\"For a long time, we had a series of really cold winters that kept adelgids at bay,\" said Justin LaMountain, a U.S. Forest Service silviculturist at Allegheny National Forest, which has hemlocks up to 300 years old. \"Since 2017, we have had much milder winters and the pest has really expanded significantly to the point where we have an infestation [here].\"\n\"It all comes down to the level of stress on a tree. As the climate warms or changes, it makes the trees susceptible to other stressors,\" said Rosa Yoo, forest health manager in the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources' Bureau of Forestry.\nDespite this new headwind, the once widely accepted possibility of hemlock extinction in the region is giving way to optimism, as promising advances emerge on several fronts in the fight against woolly adelgids.\n\"It is important to tackle these challenges on a landscape scale,\" LaMountain said. \"Anything less than a collaborative effort is going to have a high probability of failure.\"\nUnleashing predators and chemicalsThe newest biological controls to be thrown into the battle are two species of silver flies. The insects, each about the size of a grain of rice, feed on adelgid larvae that infest western hemlocks in the Pacific Northwest. The two species feed exclusively on woolly adelgids, and scientists conducted tests to make sure the nonnative insects wouldn't bring unintended consequences to East Coast forests.\nThe silver flies will not replace the predatory beetles that have been deployed until now. Instead, they will supplement them, giving the biological attack a seasonal one-two punch. Scientists have found that the beetles only prey on the first of the adelgid's two yearly generations, in the fall and winter. Silver flies eat the eggs of the second generation in the spring.\nThe Forest Service released 2,800 silver flies, provided by Cornell University, into the Allegheny National Forest in November 2023. The flies joined forces with an estimated 3,500 predatory beetles grown at Virginia Tech that have been unleashed there since 2020.\nOther releases of silver flies are occurring in Bay drainage states. A location in Giles County, VA, is the first to host both species of predatory beetles and both kinds of silver flies.\nIn a huge development, new generations of silver flies are being found at release sites throughout the region, showing they are making themselves at home and surviving by eating adelgids. King William and Wythe counties in Virginia were the first to provide proof that both fly species were reproducing after a release.\nAs of January 2023, 46,000 silver flies of both species were released at 65 sites in the Eastern U.S.\n\"I'm optimistic that bio-controls will definitely provide some control of the woolly adelgid, but bio-control takes a long time for these populations to build up. We need to keep hemlocks alive in the short term,\" said Nicholas Dietschler, research support specialist with the New York State Hemlock Initiative.\nOne short-term fix that forest managers have recently turned to is \"habitat adjustment\" — clearing away other tree species to give hemlock stands more sunlight. Hemlocks are famously shade-tolerant, but, like nearly all trees, they grow better in direct sunlight. And adelgid growth appears to be less robust in direct sun.\nInsecticide treatment is an even more immediate and widely practiced short-term approach. Like habitat tweaks, though, it is not practical for remote stands of hemlocks. Still, where it can be done, each injection of the right chemical into the soil under hemlocks, or directly into the trunk, has been shown to prevent infestation for five years or more.\nUntil recently, the treatments have mostly been used to save well-known groves of hemlocks and trees in public areas, such as around campsites and in parks. But efforts are increasing to treat mature hemlocks deep in the woods — particularly where the trees perform a crucial ecological service — like preserving wild trout habitat by shading and cooling streams.\nThere is no widely agreed-on order of battle for the multifaceted defense against the woolly adelgids, but a united front appears to be taking shape among federal and state agencies, universities and private partners in the Mid-Atlantic states. A tide of hope is rising that the eastern hemlock may not be doomed.\nThat's encouraging to people on the front lines of the battle, like the Nature Conservancy's Van Ryn. \"The hemlock, if you will, is a tree of my heart,\" she said. \"There is something majestic about the tree, and there is something almost magical about wandering among a hemlock grove.\"\nAd Crable is a Chesapeake Bay Journal staff writer based in Pennsylvania.

    "content": "Scientists identify toxin found in Chesapeake Bay phytoplankton\n\n August 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE | Section: News \n \n 432\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — From a 60-year-old Karlodinium Veneficum (K. veneficum) culture kept at the U.K.'s Plymouth Laboratory, a research team led by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science discovered the cause of the Chesapeake Bay's fish kill, which was originally blamed on another phytoplankton, Pfiesteria piscicida.Center for Environmental Science researchers determined that Pfiesteria was not, in fact, the cause of the Bay's fish-kill; rather, the karlotoxins found in K. veneficum were to blame.\nIn a paper recently published in Nature Scientific Reports, using surface plasma resonance and a suite of bioassays, the authors report the specific functions of membrane pores formed by these karlotoxins. Moreover, the formation is a highly targeted mechanism involving the cell membrane and sterol-specificity; cholesterol, in this case.\n\"What is so unique about this toxin is its mode of action, how it works,\" said Allen Place, a UMCES professor and expert in biochemistry who served as the primary investigator on the project.\n\"To consume other phytoplankton, it generates holes in their cell walls, creating a porous membrane through which other ions can flow,\" Place said. \"This incapacitates and eventually kills its prey, which it then eats.\"\nThe team's analysis proves karlotoxins generate pores in membranes with desmethyl sterols — like cholesterol, phytosterols and ergosterol — that weaken membranes, disrupt motor function, cause cells to swell and eventually burst, all for the sake of capturing and devouring susceptible organisms.\nThey use the toxin as a defense mechanism, too.\n\"Think of a venomous snake that stores venom inside special glands — the venom can't harm the snake. In other words, it can't self-intoxicate due to the make-up of its anatomy, but it can certainly harm creatures it comes into contact with,\" Place said. \"The same holds true for K. veneficum, and it's not unique to Chesapeake Bay; this has a worldwide distribution. And it's sensitive to environmental inputs such as global warming, so the higher the temperature, the more abundant this organism becomes.\"\nAlthough the toxin has proven deadly to fish, shellfish, small sharks and even laboratory mice, it's important to note that the presence of cholesterol deactivates the threat, similar to how vinegar neutralizes lye.\nThere is little physical impact to people. The impact to the environment, however, could potentially be significant.\nThe University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, based in Cambridge, leads the way toward better management of Maryland's natural resources and the protection and restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. From a network of laboratories located across the state, UMCES scientists provide sound evidence and advice to help state and national leaders manage the environment, and prepare future scientists to meet current global challenges. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Since then, Lakeside's effluent has been stored in Hurlock.\nAccording to Lyndsey Ryan, Trappe's attorney, the plant, which finished construction in June, \"has not gotten through the startup phase.\" As a result, Lakeside engineers are requesting the effluent be sent to Trappe's sludge lagoon, instead of to the town's treatment plant.\n\"The request in front of (council) is to either request to MDE to allow the effluent to be sent directly from Lakeside plant to Trappe for discharge, or to have the effluent transported to Trappe's holding storage until (MDE) decides that it's appropriate and not going to impact our operations,\" Ryan said.\nThe original method of transporting effluent to the Trappe plant was through diverting valves at a Trappe pump station. However, the town requested the use of tank trucks to transport treated effluent into the Trappe sludge lagoon, rather than directly into the Trappe collection system.\nRyan said this is so Steve Callahan, Trappe's water/wastewater superintendent, could maintain the amount of effluent that was coming into Trappe's plant on a \"monitored basis.\"\nRobert Rauch, Lakeside's engineer, is requesting the town temporarily store the partially treated effluent as Lakeside waits for final testing and approval to store it in its own treatment plant.\nRauch said the Lakeside Wastewater Treatment Plant is in the process of treating 120 equivalent dewelling units' effluent flow. Rauch said they are doing effluent testing up to three times a week to confirm it is consistent with all parameters of the permit and expects to have compliant effluent within a two-week period.\nCommissioner Brian Schmidt stated that the Lakeside operator in charge of the effluent is working diligently to get it going and have it working per MDE specs.\nRauch described the situation as a \"non-issue\" since Lakeside has already paid for the 120 equivalent dwelling units of effluent flow to reside in the Trappe Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\"We expect to have the first certified report by the middle or end of next week,\" Rauch said. \"... We need to make sure that the town's in a position to cooperate with us in the event we have another week that we have to deal with. The treatment plant is working like a dream.\"\nFurther into the discussion, Ryan read an email from Trappe's engineer, also offering support of effluent being moved to the lagoon for storage rather than directly to the town's treatment plant since the treated effluent may not be good for the treatment plant.\nAfter a discussion and more explanation on the request, the motion was approved by commissioners under the condition that MDE approves Lakeside discharging via truck directly to Trappe's lagoon. A letter has been sent to MDE seeking approval for this request. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Kramer, who is an experienced avian rescuer, responded to the post and offered his services.\nQuickly, he and two other center staffers hopped in a truck and made their way over to where the bird had been sighted.\nAfter the bird tried to fly across the river and crashed into the water, they drove across the bridge and requested access to a resident's backyard to capture the raptor who had made his way onto the opposite shore.\nKramer was able to approach the bird swiftly, pin him gently and secure the animal's feet before lifting him up. The bird rode shotgun in center staffer Emma Cease's lap on the way back to the Center for Environment and Society's headquarters, where he was inspected and placed in a crate until he could be picked up by TriState Bird Rescue.\nKramer, who has years of experience rescuing, researching and working with bald eagles and other birds and is a listed rescuer with Tristate Bird Rescue and Moon Owl Raptor Center, urged people in the Chesapeake Bay region to call in the professionals if they spot an eagle or other large bird who is need of help.\n\"You can look up a few local rehabbers, and you can always call the Department of Natural Resources for help. If you don't have handling experience don't approach the bird,\" Kramer cautioned. \"Bald eagles have three sharp ends, if they can get you with one, they will. The thing is to get the bird safely restrained. We want to limit injury to people as well as the bird.\"\nWashington College's Center for Environment and Society is no stranger to bird encounters.\nIn the last year, staff at its Foreman's Branch Bird Observatory have caught, identified, banded and released over 13,000 birds representing more than 125 species. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "GOP energy policy is bad news for Talbot County",
    "date": "2024-08-17",

    "content": "GOP energy policy is bad news for Talbot County\n\n August 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JIM BRUCE | Section: Columns \n \n 593\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The recently released 2024 Republican policy platform pumps its fists on energy as a central focus. Unfortunately, the policy recommendations obsess on problems we don't have, and ignore problems we do have. Talbot County will suffer from such policy.The GOP energy plank states: \"We will DRILL BABY DRILL and we will become Energy Independent and even Dominant again.\"\nThe truth is that the U.S. is already \"dominant\" in world energy production. The latest annual statistics show that the U.S. is the No. 1 producer in the world for oil and liquid fuels, for natural gas, and for nuclear and renewable energy. China is No. 1 only in coal production, but we don't need or want more coal production. Natural gas and renewables are cheaper and far cleaner. There has not been a new coal-fired plant built in a decade in the U.S., and demand for coal dropped 8% just last year.\nTalbot County would not benefit from more coal production and consumption, as the GOP wants.\nBy 2016, Maryland utilities had spent billions of dollars to clean up their polluting emissions, but Maryland had no control over the utilities in five states upwind from us who were only intermittently using their emission controls on coal-fired plants.\nAs much as 70% of Maryland's ozone air pollution during the May-October season was attributable to those out-of-state plants. (Ozone and nitrous oxide emissions from coal-fired plants exacerbate asthma in children and adversely affect the Chesapeake Bay.)\nMaryland petitioned the federal EPA to require these out-of-state coal-fired plants to use their emissions controls continuously. EPA issued the order, protecting Maryland citizens from coal-fired utilities over which the state had no jurisdiction. EPA is vital to protecting Maryland air quality from out-of-state sources of air pollution.\nUnfortunately, in addition to expanding coal production, Trump's allies call for weakening EPA and its regulations. This is all bad news for Talbot County if it means returning to the situation of earlier years in which prevailing winds brought air pollution from coal-fired utilities in other states.\nWhile the GOP policy platform seeks to solve energy problems that don't exist, it inexplicably ignores real problems, in particular, climate change. The entire 16-page GOP policy platform covering all subjects never mentions climate change or global warming at all. In fact, the policy recommends \"cancel the electric vehicle mandate ...\" For the GOP, climate change is not a problem worth mentioning.\nWe in Talbot County will especially suffer the consequences of ignoring climate change. We sweltered this summer in triple digit heat indexes. In 2022, researchers at Penn State University projected the effect of climate change for sea level rise, changing temperature patterns, and changing rainfall patterns in counties in Maryland and four adjacent states.\nThey report that in 1980 to 2019 sea levels around Talbot County rose over 7 inches and will rise an additional half foot to 2.4 feet by 2070, inundating low areas in the 600-mile Talbot County coastline.\nOn average Talbot County experiences high temperatures reaching or exceeding 95 degrees on six days per year. Within the next 50 years we can expect 28–50 days in which temperatures reach 95 degrees. Annual rainfall in Talbot County will likely increase by an average of 2-3 inches. Across the Mid-Atlantic region stream temperatures increased roughly 2.5 degrees from 1960 to 2010. This trend reduces dissolved oxygen in stream water and threatens the survival of rockfish, oysters and soft-shelled crabs.\nWe in Talbot County should ask Republican candidates, is climate change truly not worth talking about?\nJim Bruce is a resident of St. Michaels and is a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Anglers report multiple sightings of tarpon in Maryland waters\n\n August 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JOE ZIMMERMANN Maryland Department of Natural Resources | Section: News \n \n 749\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Scouting for red drum near the Hoopers Island Lighthouse on Aug. 1, Capt. Tom Weaver saw something roll in the flat, calm waters a couple hundred yards away.He looked for the wake and followed a disturbance in the distance. When he got close and shut the motor off, he saw huge shapes under the water. The fish looked familiar—and Weaver soon realized he recognized them from his years fishing in the Florida Keys.\n\"When you run out of Annapolis, you don't expect an hour and a half later to be running across a tarpon,\" Weaver, who runs a charter business Fish With Weaver, said. \"My brain took a few minutes to process.\"\nTarpon are large, athletic fish renowned for how they fight the line, with both incredible stamina and an ability to leap out of the water, their bodies thrashing in the air.\nIn a video Weaver recorded, hulking 6-foot-long fish lurk motionless under the surface. They were tanks, he said, each maybe 80 to 100 pounds. He went after the group of seven or eight tarpon for a while and got a bite, though he didn't have the right gear to pull one in. \"Really, we were not ready to see tarpon,\" he said.\nErik Zlokovitz, Maryland Department of Natural Resources' recreational fisheries outreach coordinator, said the department is getting more reports of tarpon, usually associated with warmer southern waters, in Maryland this summer.\n\"We have seen tarpon in Maryland's section of the bay historically, but the number of fish spotted recently is unusual,\" Zlokovitz said. \"This year is the first time we've gotten multiple reports of schools of tarpon, and not just a stray fish.\"\nTarpon are known to come into the southern Chesapeake Bay in the summer, and anglers target tarpon in the coastal waters off the Eastern Shore of Virginia. But it's usually rare for anyone to encounter a tarpon in Maryland waters.\nIn 2019, DNR staff sampling for striped bass netted and released a small tarpon near Kent Island. Angler Brittany Growe hooked a 6-foot-long tarpon near Smith Island and the Virginia border in July 2020. Her fishing partner touched the leader before the hook pulled out with the fish next to the boat, making it an official catch and release.\nOlder references also note occasional sightings. In the 1927 publication for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries \"Fishes of the Chesapeake Bay,\" authors Samuel F. Hildebrand and William C. Schroeder wrote that tarpon \"was reliably reported by fisherman in the southern parts of Chesapeake Bay\" and referred to an earlier list of fish species in Maryland from 1878 that reported a tarpon caught off Crisfield.\nWeaver said when he told people about his find, two other guides said they had also seen tarpon in Maryland in the last week. He saw a school of tarpon moving fast in the Bay last year too, and people he's spoken with have only seen tarpon in Maryland waters in the past two years.\nZlokovitz said it's too early to tell if the apparent uptick in tarpon is an \"anomaly or the start of a trend.\"\nWater temperatures have risen in the Chesapeake Bay in recent decades, and climate change is affecting Maryland's biodiversity. A number of warm-water fish species—from Florida pompano to cobia, cutlassfish, and pompano dolphinfish—are becoming more common in the Bay and the Atlantic coast.\nWarming waters could be drawing tarpon farther north, or they could be traveling farther in pursuit of food sources like menhaden and shrimp, DNR scientists said. It could also be a larger northern migration this year. A surfcaster in Rhode Island caught a tarpon this summer.\nWater temperatures have increased in the Chesapeake Bay over the last three decades, with most DNR monitoring stations showing an increase between 1 and 2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1999. This summer has been hot as well, with monitoring stations recording above average temperatures near Hoopers Island, according to DNR data.\nWhen Weaver saw the tarpon, he thought they were \"slurping on blue crabs\" that were swimming nearby. Regretting that he didn't have fly rods on board, he pulled out the smallest paddle tails he could find and did his best to hook one. Next time, he's bringing crab flies and plans to be ready. He wants to catch a tarpon in Maryland, or even just get one to jump.\n\"I'm gonna have a dedicated tarpon setup on the boat—rig and fly,\" Weaver said. \"I'm not going to make that mistake again.\"\nTarpon are generally considered undesirable for eating, and DNR officials recommend anglers only pursue tarpon for catch-and-release fishing. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We need help and the help is the land use planner.\nTopolski said the department's resource managers do work with local planners.\n\"We talk 'fish,'\" he said. \"We see things from the fish's perspective.\"\n\"What do we do about it?\" Haynie asked. \"We're at 20%. You've seen it; t's all downhill. There is hope there are things that can be done.\"\nMonday's meeting also included an update from Mary Hoover, the American Chestnut Land Trust's Southern Maryland Conservation Alliance coordinator, on the results of the 2024 \"water quality blitz.\"\nThis year, 128 sites were tested for nitrogen by 14 volunteer organizations in five counties. According to results posted online, water quality at 100 test sites was deemed good while six sites were found to have poor water quality.\n\"We have seen an improvement, but we need to do more testing,\" Hoover said.\nTo review the summary, go to www.acltweb.org/index.php/2024-blitz/. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In June, it announced that the FEMA had awarded the city $1.7 million for the first phase of the project.\nThe city said FEMA is also reserving $16 million for the second phase of the project. The total $17.7 million in grant money is being awarded through FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Assistance grant.\nDuring the meeting, representatives from the city, the state, the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science at Horn Point, and BayLand Consultants and Designers spoke about climate change, flooding and the project itself.\nMaryland Secretary of Emergency Management Russell Strickland talked about the importance of mitigating disasters prior to them occurring. He said mitigation cuts down on the need for response and on the costs associated with recovery.\n\"So this would be what I would call a transformative mitigation project for the city,\" he said. \"And it's important that it be projects like that because that will have a greater result and a greater benefit for more people.\"\nHorn Point Lab professor Ming Li talked about sea level rise across the Chesapeake Bay and increases in flooding. He said working with nature can be better than fighting with it.\n\"So that's why there's a lot of interest in a lot of places all around the world to look at nature-based solutions,\" he said.\nMegan Barniea, a BayLand senior project engineer, said no design decisions have been made yet, but the plan is to build upon those three main project elements of a living shoreline, embankments and stormwater management.\nHorn Point Lab, which is supporting the project, will help to optimize the living shoreline design, assess flood risk reduction, monitor living shoreline performance and evaluate ecological co-benefits of the project.\nBarniea said the project partners will be coming back to the public to get feedback on a 30% design plan. The plan, which she expects will be ready to show in early 2025, will include the footprint of proposed features, elevations and dimensions, and a construction cost estimate.\nAfter the presentation, residents asked questions about the project, including how the project will affect private docks and public access to the waterfront.\nWhite said the city and its partners will work with each property owner, and residents will keep access to their docks. He said there will be some public access to the living shoreline.\n\"I mean it can't be everywhere, but there will be access,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Allen Family Foundation today announced a $1.12 million grant to the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science and the American Bird Conservancy.A partnership between UMCES Appalachian Laboratory researchers and the Appalachian Mountain Joint Venture will apply big data to conservation planning for the benefit of birds and people in the Appalachian Mountains.\nThe researchers will use remote sensing and interpretable machine learning to characterize aspects of forests and landscape structure that provide habitat for birds during migration through the Appalachian Mountains. They will apply this information to forest management planning through a collaborative process that balances the habitat needs of birds with the objectives of local human communities. The research and process will ultimately transform our ability to sustain healthy bird populations throughout the Appalachian region.\n\"Conservation planning to restore and sustain migratory bird populations has been occurring for many years,\" said Emily Cohen, an associate professor at UMCES. \"But these efforts have been singularly focused on increasing habitats for birds during the breeding season, while habitat needs during migration have been largely overlooked. The focus of this project is to provide the information necessary to include migratory habitat needs, along with breeding, into planning efforts and then to develop those plans together with the communities living in those areas.\"\nThis research is one of 10 projects receiving funding under the Partnership to Advance Conservation Science and Practice program, a first-of-its-kind collaboration between NSF and the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. Now in its second year, the program is designed to catalyze deep collaboration between researchers advancing basic science and conservation partners engaging in on-the-ground conservation.\nThe projects focus on a range of species—from migrating songbirds and grizzly bears to Venus flytraps and the Hawaiian honeycreeper—and the outcomes will have far-reaching implications for biodiversity and conservation, policy and the economy.\n\"The fundamental knowledge these projects create, even though related to specific species, will unlock innovative conservation efforts across a broader range of threatened species and ecosystems,\" said Lara Littlefield, executive director for programs and partnerships at the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. \"For instance, studying whether some microorganisms in mosquitoes can help limit the spread of malaria among birds in Hawaii could ultimately limit disease spread among other animals more broadly.\"\nEach project extends basic science into on-the-ground conservation to address critical knowledge and data gaps, enabling greater real-world impact to benefit species and ecosystems.\n\"The unique partnerships this program creates forge a roadmap to broader conservation action by uniting the skills, expertise and tools needed to address the most urgent threats to our natural world,\" said Susan Marqusee, NSF assistant director for biological sciences. \"These projects also will engage the public, policymakers, law enforcement and others in conservation through education, outreach and other broader impacts.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "White House OKs Maryland wind energy project\n\n September 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KATHARINE WILSON Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 959\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Offshore wind energy is coming to Maryland, and with it, union jobs.The Biden administration on Thursday approved Baltimore-based US Wind's project to build offshore wind turbines about 10 miles off the coast of Ocean City, Maryland.\nThe offshore wind farm could generate over two gigawatts of wind energy and power over 718,000 homes, according to the Department of the Interior.\nPresident Joe Biden said in a statement that the wind energy industry had been \"struggling to gain a foothold\" in the years before he came into office.\n\"From manufacturing and shipbuilding to port operations and construction, this industry will support tens of thousands of good-paying and union jobs, provide reliable clean power to homes and businesses, strengthen our power grid against outages, and help reduce pollution — all while protecting biodiversity and marine ecosystems,\" the president said.\nMaryland Energy Administration Director Paul Pinsky called the Biden administration's action \"an important step forward in the effort to bring clean, renewable energy production to Maryland's coast.\"\n\"Today's announcement underscores the careful, comprehensive and collaborative environmental analysis that has gone into these projects,\" Pinsky said in a statement.\nThe Maryland project is the tenth commercial-scale offshore wind energy project approved by the Biden administration. Combined, the projects are projected to generate 15 gigawatts of clean energy, half of Biden's goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind-produced energy by 2030.\nThe Maryland project includes up to 114 wind turbines, four offshore substation platforms and a meteorological tower. There will be three phases to the US Wind project, two of which — called MarWin and Momentum Wind — have already received offshore renewable energy certificates from the state.\nEnergy is set to start flowing in December 2028 from the first phase of the project. The final project is expected to be completed in late 2027 or early 2028, according to the plan submitted by US Wind.\nThe approval is a win for Maryland environmental groups and the state government, which have been working for offshore wind power in the state for around 10 years.\nStarting in 2013, the Maryland legislature passed a series of bills to set offshore wind energy projects in motion.\nThe state set a goal in 2023, through the Promoting Offshore Wind Energy Resources Act, to generate 8.5 gigawatts of power from offshore wind by 2031.\nThis goal has hit some road bumps along the way, including the withdrawal of Denmark-based Ørsted's planned offshore wind projects in January.\nUS Wind won the competitive lease sale of the 46,970 acres of federal ocean waters in 2014.\n\"By moving away from reliance on dirty fossil fuel energy and building renewable energy, Marylanders will be able to breathe cleaner air and benefit from new clean energy jobs,\" Maryland Sierra Club Chapter Director Josh Tulkin said in a statement Thursday.\nJamie DeMarco, the federal campaigns coordinator for the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said in an interview with Capital News Service that the Maryland wind farm is a milestone in moving offshore energy generation forward in Maryland.\n\"This is a huge undertaking to build an entire machine to deploy offshore wind, but once that machine is built, it'll be able to hum and crank out new domestic energy, and clean energy that's going to help us clean the air and meet our climate goals,\" DeMarco said.\nOffshore wind turbines have been coming online across the East Coast, DeMarco said, but this will be the first operational offshore wind facility in Maryland.\nEnvironmental advocates aren't the only celebrating parties. Union officials are touting the jobs set to be created by the wind farm.\nAlmost 2,680 jobs annually over seven years could be created during the development and construction phase of the wind farm, according to the Interior Department.\nUS Wind's planned permanent offshore wind components production facility, called Sparrows Point Steel in Sparrows Point, Baltimore — the former home of Bethlehem Steel — is forecast to generate jobs for steelworkers.\nThe Baltimore Bethlehem Steel mill, which closed in 2012, was once the largest steel producer in the world. Sparrows Point Steel will bring steelworker jobs back to Maryland, DeMarco said, in a way that hasn't been seen since the closure of Bethlehem.\nJim Strong, the offshore wind sector assistant for the United Steelworkers International Union, told CNS Thursday that the facility is expected to bring in over 500 jobs. The project will help not only steelworkers, Strong said, but other union trades as well.\n\"It's about addressing our climate crisis, about creating new green energy jobs — these will be high paid union jobs,\" Strong said.\nStrong has served as a liaison between the union and US Wind. He said that the Sparrows Point facility has the opportunity to become a \"central hub\" for monopile production on the Atlantic Ocean. Monopiles, steel cylinders, are used for wind turbines, bridges and other projects, he said.\nUS Wind is a subsidiary of Italian company Renexia SpA.\nThe project has some detractors, like Rep. Andy Harris (R-Maryland), who represents the Eastern Shore.\n\"Offshore wind industrialization comes at a heavy cost to our marine life and environment, and is an incredibly expensive way to generate electricity,\" Harris said on X in July. \"We should never allow foreign owned companies to control our energy supply — much less harm our environment while doing it.\"\nThe federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's director, Elizabeth Klein, said in a statement that the Maryland project \"reflects the best available science and invaluable insights from Tribes, government agencies, local communities, industry leaders, ocean users, and environmental groups gathered during our extensive environmental review process.\"\n\"As we continue to support the undeniable momentum we see along our coasts, our focus remains on fostering responsible energy development, while protecting marine life and ecosystems,\" she said.\nDemocrats in the state, including Gov. Wes Moore, have been supportive of the project. Moore signed a memorandum of understanding with the federal government in June supporting offshore wind production. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the report, excessive nitrogen in waterways can fuel algal blooms and cause low dissolved oxygen and fish kills. The report says that four regions — Marshyhope Creek, Delaware Headwaters, Lower Nanticoke and Lower Creeks — saw improved total nitrogen grades in 2023.\nWasden said although it may not sound good that two regions are getting Fs in this category, it's good to see improvement elsewhere.\n\"When you've had years and years of most of the regions scoring Fs in total nitrogen, it's a really bright spot to see some of those regions performing better,\" she said.\nWasden also talked about some of the negative results in the report card. She said that there continues to be impairment issues on some creeks. According to the report card, Barren, Quantico and Rewastico creeks continue to be \"heavily impaired.\"\nThe report card also showed that the Upper Nanticoke and Broad Creek regions, which received Cs overall, scored the worst. According to the report card, this continues a long-term trend.\nWasden said everyone should care about the Nanticoke River because it is a big part of the Nanticoke River watershed.\n\"A lot of us enjoy participating or using the river, whether we're fishing or kayaking,\" she said. \"Maybe we have a property along one of (its) waterways. Maybe we like going to a park that's along the river or one of the creeks. So it's a big part of our lives, and we should want to support clean water to have healthy wildlife and also healthy people to enjoy the water.\"\nWasden said that when the water is polluted, people might not be able to use it or go in it, which can \"take some enjoyment out of our lives.\"\n\"Especially when you think about, for example, how hot this past summer was, just being able to get into a healthy body of water can really help you cool down,\" she said.\nLaura McCann is in her second year as a creekwatcher with the Nanticoke Watershed Alliance. As a creekwatcher, McCann helps calibrate water testing equipment and collects water samples at two sites. She helps with testing, including measuring depth and clarity of the water and testing pH levels.\nMcCann said that along fertilizers can be detrimental to the river's health. She said that keeping the river healthy helps keep the environment healthy.\n\"If you don't watch that health, it can affect everything,\" she said.\nMcCann said she hopes the steady improvements in the river's health continue. She said putting out report cards and other outreach will help.\n\"Water reports, things like that, will help build education and help other people understand the importance of what we're trying to do,\" she said.\nThose interested in learning more about the Nanticoke Watershed Alliance can visit nanticokeriver.org or visit them on Facebook or Instagram. Those interested in volunteering with the organization can register to become a creekwatcher next season. Wasden said registration will open in January and training will be in March. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

As a young boy, my dad and I would go fishing as often as possible. Then, when I had a son, he joined us and the three of us fished together. When my son is in town, fishing together remains our top priority to this day. My wife also enjoys being on the water and we spend a lot of time on the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries fishing and boating together.The challenge and the anticipation of catching a fish on any given cast is one of my favorite things about fishing. What's not to love about spending the day out on the Chesapeake Bay, dedicating countless hours trying to entice a fish below the surface that you're not even sure is there or even hungry. Another important thing about fishing is understanding the proper and careful release after the thrill of the catch.\nAs a Maryland native, I've had the pleasure to explore some of the region's most unique fishing locations. The Chesapeake Bay itself is the country's largest estuary and an angler's paradise. But in such a big body of water, it's easy to feel overwhelmed trying to find the fish.\nThe key to finding fish is structure and their prey. Oyster reefs provide both and, therefore, attract fish and their food.\nMaryland waters have more than 100 oyster reefs, both artificial and protected sanctuary reefs. The state also has five tributaries being targeted for large-scale oyster restoration by 2025. Although these protected sanctuaries are closed for oyster harvest, they make exceptional angling spots.\nFish and the critters they eat love using the complex structure of oyster reefs for habitat. Where oyster reefs have been lost, specially-designed artificial reef structures called reef balls are used to establish high quality, three-dimensional reef habitat as soon as they hit the water — a feat that would take a natural oyster reefs hundreds of years to achieve.\nBetter yet, the fish absolutely love them.\nStriped bass, white perch, both red and black drum, speckled trout, spot, croaker, flounder, toadfish and even invasive species like blue catfish can be caught around oyster reefs. These invasives are getting much more popular to target for their abundance and fun fight. And eating them is one of the best ways to mitigate their threat to the Bay ecosystem.\nFor those looking for a new challenge, there's nothing like the upcoming Maryland Rod & Reef Slam to test your creativity and angling skills. This annual fishing tournament encourages anglers to target the greatest variety of fish species, rather than just fish size by fishing over Maryland's restored oyster reefs. From oyster toadfish to red drum, everything counts.\nIn previous tournaments, over 16 different species have been recorded, demonstrating the diversity of life that oyster reefs support. When I won the 2021 Rod & Reef Slam, I landed 11 different species including catching the only speckled trout.\nI have fished several of the reef locations including Tilghman, Harris Creek, Tred Avon River, Clint Waters/Cooks Point on the Choptank River, Manokin River and Bill Burton pier. I use a variety of bait, but it's hard to beat a piece of bloodworm.\nThe week of Sept. 7, I'll once again be fishing for oyster restoration in the 2024 Maryland Rod and Reef Sam. I challenge you to join me. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Hummingbird enthusiasts soak up last weeks before birds fly south\n\n September 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: News \n \n 465\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Sandy Brown has 16 hummingbird feeders set up in her back yard, most of them bright red.This has been an endeavor of many years, and she delights with every chirp, swoop and the buzzing noise the birds' wings make.\n\"You could call it an obsession,\" Brown said.\n\"I have had them drinking from my hand this year for the first time ever. I keep a hummingbird diary. I could give you dates and times of when I have seen the most hummingbirds,\" Brown said.\nShe says she has never seen anything but ruby throated hummingbirds, and she takes keen note of their distinct plumage and behaviors.\n\"They are crazy and they have sword fights. You can tell when they are displaying aggressive behavior because their tails flare out,\" she said.\nAccording to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, in the summer, ruby-throated hummingbirds can be found throughout the eastern half of the United States and within parts of southern Canada. They are commonly spotted in Maryland during warmer months.\nBut their time in the area is coming to an end. In the winter, ruby-throated hummingbirds travel to Mexico and Central America, following warmer temperatures.\n\"If you had called a week ago, you would have been hit in the head by a hummingbird. They are starting to go away,\" Brown said. \"The males go first and the females follow. It is mostly juveniles now.\"\nFor little birds, they drink a lot.\n\"I was refilling my feeders twice a day up until Monday or Tuesday. I saw a bit of a slowdown. I can count little fat guys like little Hindenburgs. They are loading up for the season,\" she said.\nWayne Bell, a birder and ecologist, leads groups to find birds. He gets out with muddy boots and a pair of binoculars often.\n\"We were on a bird walk on Sunday or Monday, and several people were saying they were having lots of activity at their hummingbird feeders,\" Bell said. \"I have noticed the same thing. It is particularly interesting because there wasn't a lot of activity earlier in the year after the birds arrived from the south. They migrate across the Gulf of Mexico, so they have a long way to go.\"\n\"All of a sudden we seem to have a lot. That is due to juveniles hatching out. They are getting ready to migrate south and doing what some people call staging. They are tanking up on sugars and protein to get ready for their flight south,\" Bell said, later adding that the large number of sightings may indicate that it was a good year for hummingbird reproduction.\nThough sightings are becoming less common, Brown has not put a lid on this year's hummingbird season yet. She leaves her feeders out until December, hoping to glimpse the last of the visitors on their way south. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Riverkeeper works to keep Chesapeake Bay, local waterways clean and healthy\n\n September 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lilly Howard lhoward@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 525\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n GALENA — This is Zach Kelleher's sixth season as the Sassafras Riverkeeper for ShoreRivers, but he fell in love with local waterways when he was a young boy growing up along the Eastern Shore.The most important part of his position, according to Kelleher, is collecting the water quality data and sharing it with communities so they can make informed decisions and be educated about issues like algal blooms and toxicity.\nEaston-based non profit ShoreRivers, the organization under which the Riverkeepers work, is focused on a mission to \"protect Maryland's Eastern Shore waterways through science-based advocacy, restoration, education, and engagement,\" according to their website. They cover the Sassafras, Chester, Choptank and Miles-Wye rivers to combat pollution and protect the waterways.\n\"Everything that I do as a riverkeeper and that we do at ShoreRivers is grounded in science and data, which allows us to be an unbiased source for the waterways,\" said Kelleher.\nThrough their bacteria monitoring program, riverkeepers take samples every week and post them via a variety of means to try to reach as many people as possible, because community members deserve to know that data and what to do about it, according to Kelleher.\n\"The more we can communicate that data effectively to a variety of audiences…the better off we are, the better off the rivers are,\" said Kelleher.\nIn regards to the Chesapeake Bay's recent C+ grade, which was the highest in over 20 years, Kelleher points out that the Bay is dealing with 300 to 400 years of colonization and habitat destruction, while the community only started being proactive about the Bay's health roughly 40 to 50 years ago.\n\"So I think it's very easy to be pessimistic about it, but I think it's also really important to be stubbornly optimistic about it,\" said Kelleher.\nHe noted that, for example, it takes 40 to 80 years for nitrogen to reach waterways after being applied to a field or backyard, because it goes through the groundwater, which means we're still seeing the impacts of nitrogen from many years ago.\n\"So it's going to take time,\" said Kelleher. \"There's a little bit of a delay between the work that we're doing today and the impact on water quality, but all of the data and indicators do point that we are moving in that positive direction overall.\"\nKelleher also pointed out the importance of incorporating the various impacts of climate change into his work. For example, it's been dry the past two years, causing huge spikes in water salinity. Due to this, certain species are thriving and water clarity and quality are improving in some areas. Meanwhile, more freshwater-oriented systems like the Sassafras are struggling with the increased salinity.\nBeing a Riverkeeper is ever changing with the tides and seasons, Kelleher noted. In the colder months, Kelleher does a lot of policy and advocacy work involving the legislature at the state and federal levels. But when the spring and summer roll around, the water quality monitoring programs, invasive species removal programs and volunteer programs ramp up.\n\"The primary job of the Riverkeeper is to be the voice for the rivers but also the voice for the communities. And they're very closely tied together,\" said Kelleher. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

An Application for Appeal was also filed with the County Board of Appeals objecting to the County's action.\nBy a 3-2 vote July 9, the Commissioners agreed to reconsider a request from Chesterhaven Beach Partnership, to \"re-include\" 101 acres of property on Piney Creek Road owned by Chesterhaven Beach Partnership, LLP back into the Chester Growth Area.\nThe Commissioners also placed a condition on the property development that the reconfiguration of the 180 vacant lots be limited to 90 vacant lots without the need for Critical Area Growth Allocation.\nCiting concern for legal density, the Commissioners previously rejected the project proposal in May 2022. At that time the applicant was asked to seek a declaratory judgment or equivalent court ruling to establish the grandfathering of the property lots for review at a later date.\nAccording to a press release from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, \"The County's decision undermines Maryland's Critical Area law by circumventing requirements to obtain local and state land use change approvals known as growth allocation. It also sidesteps requirements in state law related to designating growth areas in local comprehensive plans.\"\nOpponents of the proposed development voiced concerns that the project is located in the critical area and is an ecosystem that supports wildlife and includes natural water quality filters as well as contains major conservation investments in the area. That includes 1.6 miles of shoreline onon the Chester River and Piney Creek,\nAccording to the release, passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 1984, the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area law protects land within 1,000 feet of high tide or tidal wetlands to minimize the negative impacts of new development on Bay water quality, habitat, and wildlife.\n\"This is a uniquely valuable property from an environmental standpoint,\" said QACA Executive Director, Jay Falstad. \"To turn it into a residential subdivision, as a majority of the Commissioners are now willing to do, would be to violate both Maryland's Critical Area law and the County's own Comprehensive Plan. It is deeply disappointing that our Commissioners, who have done so much for land preservation in the County, have been persuaded to go along with something so contrary to the conservation ethic to which this county is committed.\"\nAccording to Falstad, the coalition's lawsuit argues that the lots were never grandfathered under the Critical Area law and therefore, don't exist; as well as that the Commissioners violated the Comprehensive Plan by 're-including' the property back into the Chester-Stevensville Growth Area after the adoption of the 2022 Comprehensive Plan that excludes the property from the Growth Area.\n\"Queen Anne's County is trying to redesignate property for growth that the courts have ruled as ineligible for such a change,\" said Alan Girard, CBF advocacy director, \"The decision circumvents state law that protects the public's right to inform County land use decisions. The consequences of the County's action could harm the Chesapeake Bay and the people and wildlife that rely on it.\"\nA public hearing is scheduled for Oct. 16 at 5 p.m.\nStevens Palmer LLC, on behalf of Chester Haven Beach Partnership, could not be reached for comment. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Preparing the landscape for that transition.\"\nAccording to a news release from Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy is one of eight organizations receiving federal funding through the Chesapeake WILD Program, which is a program administered by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to support conservation, stewardship and enhancement of fish and wildlife habitats in the Bay. The program was created through bipartisan legislation.\nFunding for the eight organizations — which include the Maryland Department of Agriculture, the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources — total $2.7 million and will be used for habitat and wetland restoration projects throughout Maryland's Chesapeake Bay watershed, according to the news release.\nThe announcement of the grant awards was made Friday by Van Hollen, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md., 5th), Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md., 2nd), Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md., 3rd), Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md., 7th), Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md., 8th) and Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-Md. 4th).\n\"Protecting and preserving the Chesapeake Bay is vital to both our environment and to the many Marylanders whose livelihoods depend on it,\" the lawmakers said in the news release. \"The Chesapeake WILD program is central to our efforts to restore wildlife habitat and improve the overall health of the Bay — and these federal funds will go to critical projects across the state to help achieve these important goals.\"\nAccording to the news release, the Chesapeake WILD Program is awarding 30 new conservation and restoration grants for projects this year. The news release says the grants total $8.9 million in federal support and leverage $13.7 million in matching funds, which result in a total conservation impact of $22.6 million.\nSatterfield said the more money government invests into conservation easement programs to protect private lands, the more work land conservation groups can get done.\n\"The more investment we get, the more work we get done, the more we secure this landscape against the threats that are coming for it, the better,\" he said. \"So we're excited to get the WILD money out there and get our community protected.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lakeside permit challenged in appellate court\n\n September 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 917\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — In its opposition to a permit to spray treated wastewater on land in Talbot County, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation argues it wants to protect the quality of county streams and rivers.On Sept. 11, the foundation faced off with the Department of Environment in the Appellate Court of Maryland, where oral arguments were heard in the case.\nThe arguments concerned wastewater discharge at the Lakeside at Trappe development and whether or not a permit should have been issued.\nThe Maryland Department of the Environment issued a permit in December 2020, that was revised in October 2022, authorizing the discharge of treated wastewater through spray irrigation on land from the Trappe East Wastewater facility owned by the Town of Trappe and Lakeside developers.\nThe foundation argues the approach the department has taken is inappropriate and violates federal and state law. But MDE maintains the permit meets or exceeds groundwater quality standards.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation was represented by attorney Paul Smail. Smail made three arguments to Judges Stuart Berger, Michael Wilson Reed and Andrea Leahy questioning whether or not the permit will be protective of the state's waters, whether the department complied with the applicable law in approving it and whether that decision was supported by substantial evidence.\n\"This is a discrete groundwater discharge permit,\" Smail said. \"This is a discrete issue, and there is only one question before the court: Whether or not this permit ensures compliance with water quality standards.\"\nSmail argued under state law, Lakeside would need to assure 100% uptake of nutrients, meaning that all nitrogen and phosphorus from the wastewater discharge must be taken up by vegetation so as to not pollute nearby land and water.\nAccording to Smail, the department has not provided substantial evidence that net-zero discharge can be assured in this case.\n\"It's simply an error in the law,\" Smail said. \"We assert that monitoring after the fact does not (determine) whether or not the department can make the decision to improve this permit in the first instinct.\"\nLeahy interjected and said she believed the department was basing its approval of the permit on studies showing the nutrient uptake was going to be greater than the amount of nutrient that would be present in the wastewater after it was treated.\nLeahy and Berger questioned why, with that evidence, it isn't considered an appropriate basis for the department to approve the permit. Leahy also questioned why the proposed irrigation, with its advanced system, was not seen as better than alternatives.\nAccording to Smail, the nutrient management plan is subject to change. Without knowing the concentration of nitrogen already in the groundwater, any addition of effluent is extra nitrogen in the system that would find its way to Miles Creek.\nSmail said in a perfect world the spray irrigation, considered advanced technology, would be welcomed, but there is still so much unknown it would be irresponsible to proceed without more data.\nMDE ARGUMENT\nAttorney Matthew Patrick Clagett represented the Maryland Department of the Environment. Clagett said the central question is whether or not the department should have issued the permit as a state discharge permit or a federal discharge permit. He raised a related issue — whether or not the permit and the nutrient management plant prevents nutrients from reaching the groundwater.\n\"We think the court should reject those arguments because the permit authorizes discharge only to groundwater protected exclusively by state law and the permit protects the groundwater quality by incorporating the nutrient management plan that achieves to complete the uptake in nutrients as required by Maryland law,\" Clagett said.\nClagett later argued the department determined it is already going to meet or exceed the groundwater quality standards at the point of discharge via spray irrigation. He described it as a high quality discharge and added that some of the limitations in the permit are stricter than the state's groundwater quality standards.\nClagett said the permit requires the effluent to be further treated by the strictly monitored nutrient management plan, which will ensure the complete uptake in nutrients so no nutrients should reach groundwater, let alone surface water.\nJudges Reed and Leahy raised potential problems with spray irrigation.\n\"If there was a weather event because of climate change, how would that be dealt with in the future? If there was a, let's say, a hundred-year storm or 50-year storm,\" Reed asked, \"is that being considered?\"\nClagett said the permit has specific requirements on when spray irrigation can be applied. The nutrient management plan is a flexible document, Clagett said. If the department expects to see an increase in rainfall in the next decade, the nutrient management plan will need to be updated every three years. Clagett called it a form of \"adaptive management.\"\n\"There's no doubt here that the spray irrigation field is a separate but related component of the wastewater system,\" Clagett said. \"It has to be actively managed … The permittee will have to be paying attention to ponding and when they can spray and what the monitoring data is showing as far as the nutrient uptake.\"\nSmail said \"adaptive management\" would run \"afoul\" in the requirements with state law. He said it is understandable that if something is not working to make adjustments down the road but without knowing what's out there and without having a baseline of information, it could lead to issues.\n\"What we have here is monitoring after the fact, after the approval, and that is especially problematic,\" Smail said.\nA final decision was not made during the hearing. The court will issue a written decision based on the briefs and the record from the circuit court. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Global warming: 'Russian roulette with our planet'\n\n September 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 599\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres recently exclaimed in a speech about global warming: \"We are playing Russian roulette with our planet.\"We also have recently heard that this is the warmest year on record. In Arizona's Maricopa County around Phoenix there so far have been 100 straight days with triple digit temperatures. In 2023, 645 deaths caused by the heat were recorded in Maricopa County, a more than 50% increase from the previous year.\nFloods are happening around the world as the warming of oceans cause an increase in rain becoming stationary over land for long periods. Drought in Canada and the U.S. West increases the risk of fires. California has again this summer had some very large fires to fight, and residents are forced to flee.\nTo reduce global warming, the Biden administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the most consequential climate legislation in the world accompanied by $369 billion in climate investments. The private sector stepped in with $190 billion investment in electric vehicles and batteries. In addition, Biden persuaded Republicans to join him in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which contains billions more to build out a network of electric vehicle chargers as well as many other pollution reduction features.\nOn its first day, the Biden administration also rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement of 2016 from which former president Trump had withdrawn the U.S. If Trump wins in 2024 he will again withdraw from this international agreement. Trump also has suggested to a group of oil and gas executives that if they give $1 billion in donations to his campaign, he will remove regulations by closing down the Environmental Protection Agency. Is this legal?\nThere is some good news for Maryland.\nThe White House recently approved Baltimore-based US Wind's project to build off-shore wind turbines 10 miles off the coast of Ocean City. This project has been in the works for more than 10 years. It will be able to power 718,000 homes. Consequently, it will meet part of the goal in the Maryland Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022 of a 60% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2031 (from 2006 levels). It also will create tens of thousands of new jobs. Gov. Wes Moore has been supportive of this project.\nI have seen similar projects in Europe and think that they look very elegant. About 50% of Denmark's electricity consumption came from wind power in 2022, up from 19% in 2009.\nTo reach the Maryland climate goal of net zero emissions by 2045, we also need to install solar panels on roofs and geothermal heating and cooling in the ground, if we do not have suitable roofs. South-facing roofs are ideal for solar panels. I had solar panels installed on my south-facing roof in 2020, and my energy bill for heating, cooling and electric lights as well as charging my electric car amounts to $13 per month for my two-floor house. I also sell my surplus electricity for about $100 per month. Since 2022, homeowners who pay for a solar panel installation are allowed a federal tax credit of 30% of the cost of the installation.\nIt is up to each one of us to do what we can to be greener. One way is to not allow Trump to win the election in 2024. Last time he rolled back 110 climate and environmental policies. He gutted pollution standards for cars and trucks and revoked a rule preventing coal companies from dumping strip mining debris in local streams polluting drinking water in Appalachia. By the end of his term, Trump had won the prize as the most anti-environment president in our history. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The longer story is that we're still behind,\" Adam Ortiz, administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency's Mid-Atlantic region, said at a Capitol Hill press conference.\nThe bay failed to meet the agreement's main target, known as the total maximum daily load, which measures the total pollution in the Chesapeake Bay, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said.\n\"The point of the 10-year plan is to create a pollution diet to reduce the amount of phosphorous, nitrogen and other pollutants in the bay,\" Van Hollen said. \"That's a measurable target. That's how we know we're not going to hit it this year, so we need to redouble our efforts.\"\nDespite missing the targets set in 2014 through 2025, Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said he remained hopeful that the delegation can work together with experts at the EPA and other agencies to ensure the bay's health continues to improve.\nMaryland Democratic Reps. Steny Hoyer, Dutch Ruppersberger, Kweisi Mfume and Jamie Raskin joined Cardin, Van Hollen, representatives from the EPA and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.\nThe University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science gave the Chesapeake Bay an overall grade of a C+ in July, the highest grade the bay has received since 2002.\n\"I know that nobody would be thrilled with bringing home a grade of a C+, but the fact of the matter is, it is the highest grade we've seen in a long time,\" Van Hollen said. \"We all want to do better, but I do want to stress that without the collective effort we see today, the bay would have died a long time ago.\"\nThe Chesapeake Executive Council signed the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement in 2014 and established five strategies for the restoration and protection of the bay, its tributaries and surrounding lands.\nLocal, state and federal governments are required to enact the plan's management strategies and work with academic institutions, nongovernmental organizations, watershed groups and businesses and individuals, according to the 2014 agreement.\n\"You need cooperation between the federal government and the states, among the states, among state governments and private industry,\" said Van Hollen. \"There are all sorts of sources of pollution today, and so we need to make sure everybody cooperates in producing pollution reduction.\"\nOrtiz said that groups committed to improving the bay were in disarray when President Joe Biden's administration began almost four years ago.\n\"The states were suing the federal government, and states were pointing the fingers at each other for not making…progress,\" he said.\nBut since then, he said, the EPA has been able to bring the states together and hold them accountable.\n\"The Chesapeake Bay isn't just a bay,\" Cardin said. \"The Chesapeake Bay has been one of the highest priorities for our Maryland congressional delegation. We've been focused on not only preserving but expanding our role and partnership with states, local governments and stakeholders.\"\nVan Hollen emphasized the importance of identifying \"measurable targets\" of pollution reduction for long-term success, especially as climate change concerns surrounding the bay grow.\n\"I think we'll have to have a discussion about what the length of time for the next agreement should be. It may make sense to look at shorter time horizons,\" the senator said. \"But you have to have a measurable target to hold people down.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It came amid significant resident complaints of the noxious odors and bugs that stemmed from farming operations keeping the product in storage tanks.\nTalbot County is looking to the neighboring county and hoping to be proactive.\n\"We think we need to get ahead of it,\" Planning Commission Vice Chairman Chip Councell said. He noted that Caroline and Wicomico counties were \"behind the eight ball\" in enacting legislation.\nCouncell said he met with the Talbot County Farm Bureau regarding potential restrictions.\n\"I think they would like to see some restrictions put on it, one being that any type of food residuals storage would have to be enclosed, so it couldn't be open-air,\" Councell said. \"The storage of it would have to be used in that agricultural operation. A farmer couldn't store it for everybody in the neighborhood. He could store it for his operation only, so there wouldn't be commercial storage.\"\nCouncell clarified the county would focus on the storage of the residuals, not the land application. State legislation that went into effect July 1 created a formal permitting process for the usage of food processing residuals.\n\"There's a few bad actors out there that, frankly, I think see profit potential with handling the material,\" said Alan Girard, advocacy director at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, during Tuesday's meeting.\nWhile Wicomico County banned the storage of residuals, temporary storage for 45 days is allowed. In Caroline County, storage is allowed once a permit is acquired, as long as the storage tank has a closed top.\nCouncell said the 45-day allowance may be adjusted once the legislation begins to be drafted.\n\"I think 45 days might be a little bit tight,\" Councell said.\nAt the end of the work session, Planning and Zoning Director Brennan Tarleton said discussion of potential DAF legislation will be added to the Planning Commission's agenda in November. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The department is urging anglers to catch as many as possible and to destroy them, if not eaten, rather than returning them to Maryland waters.\nJoseph Love, a Maryland DNR biologist, wrote a report indicating that female snakeheads have been found with egg clutches in two different sizes, indicating two spawning seasons.\nThe average female Chesapeake Channa carries more than 63,000 eggs.\nThese fish have been in Maryland waters since 2002, when adult fish were released into a pond in Crofton. Rather than dying in unfamiliar waters, the fish thrived and have now spread to the Chesapeake Bay and the Susquehanna River. Love found the fish easily acclimate to different water temperatures and are voracious hunters.\n\"It is important to document life history traits of a species in different habitats because we know there is plasticity in the traits of fishes based on the environment,\" Love said. \"This study fills a gap in what we know about Chesapeake Channa reproduction in the upper Chesapeake Bay.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Small said the project is funded for three years.\nThe event Thursday was organized by the Oxford Community Center and the Friends of Oxford Conservation Park. At the event, Small spoke about the details of the project and why it's important.\nWashington College's Natural Lands Project aims to create a balance of productive farmland and wildlife habitat on public and private lands with a focus on implementing grassland, meadows and shrubland that support northern bobwhite, which are grassland birds also known as bobwhite quail.\nSmall said quail are an \"umbrella species.\" He said creating and managing habitat that suits quail will, in turn, benefit a lot of other species. Small said grassland birds are suffering \"serious population decline,\" so it is important to focus on quail.\nThe Oxford Conservation Park South 30 project plan will include a meadow, along with areas of cover for wildlife, which is intended to help grassland birds and other wildlife thrive.\nSpecifically, the plan is to convert about 24 acres of the 30-acre land into meadows and plant trees on the remaining 6 acres. Small said there will be hedgerows — or fences of trees and shrubs — on the land.\nThere are also plans to build a grass trail throughout the new meadow where visitors can walk and observe nature.\nSmall said they plan to plant 3,000 trees on the South 30. When it comes to the meadow, he said they will plant species complementary to what was planted on the existing 40 acres of the park, but the grasses will be shorter and planted at a lower rate to allow for more wildflowers.\n\"That has many benefits,\" he said about the wildflowers. \"Obviously they're pollinators, but it's an increased food source and then just generally requires less management.\"\nThe project will also include follow-up work on the park's existing 40 acres to \"bring it back to its original vibrant self,\" Small said. This follow-up work will include moving trees from areas they don't belong in, removing non-native species and thinning out grasses for wildflowers.\nSmall said the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy and the Natural Lands Project will oversee implementation with contractors and will continue to work with the county to offer management advice.\nAt the end of his presentation, Small cautioned that meadows don't look \"the most scenic\" the first year. He said it often takes a couple of years for the plant diversity to really come in.\nResident Pam Baker said the event was interesting and informative. Jim Brighton, who works in Oxford and visits the park often, said he thinks the project is \"awesome.\"\n\"Dan and the work that he does is always top-notch,\" said Brighton, who is friends with Small. \"And I'm very excited to see the changes that will be made.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Of those, 12 failed, indicating that bacteria levels at those sites made them unsafe. Commissioner John Price said he wished he could see a map to compare the failing sites with the four that weren't.\nBut Commission President Ron Fithian said in Rock Hall they're catching more crabs than he's seen in other years.\nFithian said when areas of rivers he called \"bad water,\" crabbers would pull up pots with dead crabs in them. The crabs that aren't in pots would flee those toxic areas, making it a dead zone.\nBut there aren't many dead zones this time of year, he observed while crabbing during the week.\nFithian pointed out that in Ferry Point Park, the beach in Rock Hall, there was a swim at your own risk sign (now removed). He questioned why it was issued.\nHouston commented he has not spotted many dead fish awash on shore either this year, another sign of healthier water.\nWith a drought and no signs of wastewater spillage, they wondered what could be the cause of the unsafe conditions found by ShoreRivers.\nPrice said they've always had a little trouble with bacteria, but these high numbers are concerning.\n\"I don't think anyone has an exact answer,\" Price said.\nIn an interview, ShoreRivers Chester RiverKeeper Annie Richards said she is not quite certain of the cause either, but she added some information about the ShoreRivers water quality monitoring program.\nThe organization runs two types of test it runs on the river. The first is the Tidal Water Health Program, which tests for nitrogen, phosphorus, clarity, temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen. The other test is the one the commissioners were concerned with — The Swimmable Rivers program, which only tests for enterococci, an indicator species for E-coli.\nRichards confirmed Houston's earlier assessment that all but four of 16 sites on the Chester failed this assessment.\nShe said the tests are administered weekly and involve volunteers drawing water samples every Thursday from Memorial Day to Labor Day. On Fridays, after going though the lab, the results are posted. The scoring, she said, is based on the Environmental Protection Agency's Healthy Beach Pass/Fail Rubric.\nSeeing the results of Aug. 30, Richards said rainfall and runoff usually are the greatest cause for a high reading of bacteria.\nRichards listed other possible sources for the high numbers could be illegal marine discharge (dumping from boats), failed septic systems, pet waste or wildlife waste.\nShe added bacteria is tricky because once it's in the water, it thrives in temperatures 80 degrees or above.\nShe produced ShoreRivers' map, comparing the failing sites with the four passing ones.\nThe four sites that passed were Quaker Neck Landing, Conquest Beach, Corsica River Yacht Club and Jackson Creek Landing, which all have similarities, Richards said.\n\"These sites are in deeper, wider sections of the river with better tidal flushing. In comparison, a place like Morgan Creek is our poorest performing site because it has a high land-to-water ratio,\" she said. \"In these types of environments the impact of bacterial pollution are felt more acutely.\"\nRichards said more testing is needed.\nFithian invited ShoreRivers to come to one of the commissioners' regularly scheduled meetings.\nHouston thanked the commissioners for hearing his concerns.\n\"I know you all are being as proactive as you can be. It seems like this is the canary in a coal mine when you get this degree of unswimmable time,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Herons on the Shore\n\n October 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JAY FALSTAD Nature Notes | Section: Herons On The Shore \n \n 624\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Here on the Eastern Shore, it's not uncommon for people to see that wonderful Chesapeake icon known as the great blue heron.The heron's large size, its blue/gray color, its long legs, neck and straight beak make this amazing bird a standout against other birds. From a distance, a blue heron in flight can look like a prehistoric Pterodactyl.\nJust as distinctive as the bird itself, is its obnoxious call. James Michener described the heron in his book, \"Chesapeake\" as \"fishing long-legs\" and its obnoxious sound as \"Kraaaaak.\" Both are perfect descriptions.\nWhile the great blue heron is well recognized and well known on the Delmarva Penninsula, there are 10 other species in the heron class that inhabit — or at least visit — the Eastern Shore.\nSome are more common than others. These include the bittern, black crowned night heron, green heron, great white heron, cattle egret, snowy egret, least bittern, yellow crowned night heron, little blue heron, and tri-colored heron.\nBlue herons on the Delmarva Peninnsula mostly live here year-round — other herons use the Eastern Shore as a breeding ground and migrate back to southern locations like Florida or the islands during the winter months.\nMost heron species have been present on the Eastern Shore for thousands of years. Herons are a prehistoric species, and the earliest evidence of the blue heron has been dated to 1.8 million years ago.\nInterestingly, there's a new-comer in the group that has arrived just within the last 100 years — the cattle egret, which somehow arrived here from Africa, can often be seen in farm fields near livestock, munching on ticks and other insects. Like other herons, the cattle egret also likes small fish and frogs too.\nThe Eastern Shore's liquid landscape of marshes, streams and tidal waters provides ideal habitat for herons, which accounts for the frequent sightings.\nAll heron species are carnivores, eating fish, frogs, small snakes, ducklings, tadpoles, crayfish and mice. With their long legs and beaks, they stealthily walk along shallow waterways, often stabbing their food with their sharp beaks before gulping it down.\nCulturally, herons have played an important role in both Native American and non-Native cultures.\nSome Native Americans symbolized the heron with patience and good luck.\nBetween 1870 and 1920, the Eastern Shore was a major hunting ground for heron species to support the feather trade. In fact, the great white heron was almost hunted to extinction. During this era, it was considered high fashion for women's hats to adorn elaborate feathers.\nEach women's hat often included three ounces of feathers, and it generally took about four birds to generate one ounce. As a consequence, tens of millions of herons were slaughtered over that 50-year period.\nIn 1918, the United States passed the Migratory Bird Treaty, which put in place some sweeping protections for many migratory birds. Those protections exist today, and in 2024, many heron populations are stable.\nThe great blue heron is so common now that the International Union for the Conservation of Nature declares the blue heron as a \"least concern species\".\nAll heron species are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.\nHerons mate in the spring, and and many of their nesting sites are in trees near the water. Each colony of heron is referred to as a rookery. There are documented rookeries on public lands can viewed at Sassafras Wildlife Management Area near Kennedyville, Eastern Neck Island near Rock Hall, and Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge in Cambridge, among others.\nIf you're out and about, near a marsh or stormwater pond, in a marina or out on the rivers or Bay, look for a heron. They are truly majestic birds.\nJay Falstad is a Maryland Master Naturalist and Executive Director of the Queen Anne's Conservation Association.

    "content": "Chesapeake Bay cleanup at a crossroads: new path or stay the course?\n\n October 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JEREMY COX Bay Journal | Section: State News \n \n 1014\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As the Chesapeake Bay cleanup's leaders close in on a revised working agreement, many of the effort's most influential supporters are endorsing a major thematic shift: putting less emphasis on improving the estuary's seldom-seen deep waters and more on helping people and living resources in the Bay watershed.\"This is an opportunity for our movement to understand our successes and failures, and adjust accordingly,\" said Kate Fritz, CEO of the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay, in a letter to the Chesapeake Bay Program, the multi-state and federal partnership in charge of reviving the Bay. \"This means … intentionally including people and living resources at the center of the partnership's work.\"\nThat closely aligns with the recommendations of the Bay Program team that was tasked with drafting an update of the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Agreement. A draft was released for public feedback on July 1.\nThe team urged the program to \"better incentivize practices that maximize benefits to living resources and people.\" This, they argued, could be accomplished largely through actions that target water quality improvements — long the effort's central focus — but only if local community concerns take precedent.\nMore than 80 people and organizations submitted comments on the draft agreement by the Aug. 30 deadline. The Chesapeake Executive Council — the governors of the six watershed states, mayor of the District of Columbia, chair of the Chesapeake Bay Commission and administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency — is set to vote on a final draft during its annual meeting in December.\nThe revised agreement is intended to serve as a top-line strategy for cleaning up the Bay and its 64,000-square-mile drainage basin beyond 2025, when the deadline for goals in the current agreement expires.\nFor decades, the partnership has centered its work on reducing nutrient and sediment pollution flowing into the Bay. The main goal has been to shrink the annual \"dead zones,\" pockets of oxygen-starved water in the estuary's deepest waters where aquatic creatures struggle to survive.\nDespite billions of dollars invested in the effort, pollution reductions have been modest and slow in coming, according to the Bay Program's own calculations. Some advocates and scientists fear that the cleanup risks falling out of favor with the public if it doesn't shift toward more visible quests, such as restoring shallow waters along the edge of the Bay and its tributaries.\n\"Without renewed attention to those things that matter the most to people, we run the risk of leaving potential living resource benefits unaddressed and potentially losing public support for our efforts,\" wrote Larry Sanford, chair of the Bay Program's Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee (STAC), on behalf of the panel.\nBut in remarks to STAC on Sept. 12, Sanford, a professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, described the new draft agreement as a \"compromise\" between two factions: those seeking a pronounced change in direction and those who want to stay the course.\nFor his part, Sanford said the program needs to maintain much of its existing work but also \"go back to the original reason for the Bay Program, and that was what was happening to the living resources.\"\nIf that recalibration is to move forward, it will have to survive a big test later this fall when the agreement goes before the Principals' Staff Committee — senior officials from the Bay states and DC, who sounded a note of caution about that approach when they met in March.\nMeeting water quality goals is a legal requirement, enforced by the EPA. The committee appeared concerned that de-stressing that goal could lead to potential lawsuits. Several members at the time also said they believed that those authoring the revised agreement had gone beyond what they had been authorized to do.\nA group of agricultural industry groups in Virginia, including the Virginia Farm Bureau, signed on to a letter that said they \"appreciate\" the draft's call to better address climate change and public engagement. But they are concerned that such measures would \"change the original intent and shared goals\" of the 2014 agreement. The state in its current two-year budget has set aside a record $207 million to reduce farm-based pollution.\nMeanwhile, several environmental groups touted how reorienting the program toward people and living creatures would support other important goals. Much could be achieved, for example, through tougher enforcement of state and federal water pollution control laws, according to a letter signed by Waterkeepers Chesapeake and several local waterkeepers.\n\"While the status quo elevates considerations of nutrient pollutants and the dissolved oxygen levels in the mainstem of the Bay, the path forward must elevate the role that enforcement of illegal pollution from point sources has on protecting humans and wildlife from toxic and carcinogenic substances,\" the waterkeepers said.\nThe needs of people and wildlife will be difficult to meet without more land conservation, said the Chesapeake Conservation Partnership, an alliance of land trusts and related organizations. Bay leaders, they added, should elevate land conservation to stand as a \"key guiding pillar\" along those already on that top tier: science, restoration and partnership.\nThe document being readied for the Executive Council's approval this December isn't the final revised agreement but rather a framework for a more detailed compact to be worked out in the future. The current draft doesn't call for a full revision of the agreement until the council meets in 2026.\nSeveral commenters urged leadership to put the finalized agreement on a faster schedule. To wait until late 2026 could lead to a pause or slowdown in oyster restoration activities in key Bay tributaries, said Oyster Recovery Partnership Executive Director H. Ward Slacum. It should be ready by the end of 2025 instead, he said.\nA group of about 40 retired Bay scientists and former public officials also weighed in. The coalition, calling itself \"Chesapeake Bay Program Veterans,\" echoed the push to have the revisions in place in 2025.\nAnd the program should look at the problems and benefits that arise from local, state and federal greenhouse gas reduction goals, they said. They suggested that the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, for example, is likely to reduce nitrogen pollution that enters Bay waters from the atmosphere. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hurricane Milton tests Tampa Bay’s Indian blessing, ‘Bay of the Holy Spirit’ legends; Storm projected to hit near Sarasota\n\n October 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Belgrade News | Section: News \n \n 632\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Anyone who grew up in or has lived in the Tampa-St. Petersburg area for a number of years likely knows about the Indian blessing that protects Tampa Bay from hurricanes.The blessing stems from the ancient Tocobaga Native American tribe which protects Tampa Bay against hurricanes. The indigenous tribe lived in the bay area with sacred sites in Safety Harbor in Pinellas County overlooking Old Tampa Bay.\nOn top of the indigenous tribe's blessing, Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto (during his search for the Fountain of Youth) encountered the Tocobaga in Safety Harbor in 1539 on Pentecost Sunday and named what is now Tampa Bay — Bahia Espiritu Santo (tBay of the Holy Spirit).\nThe Indian blessing and de Soto's Christian name for the bay have protected the Tampa area from hurricanes, according to local legends.\nTampa has not been hit directly by hurricane since 1921. There have been numerous contemporary examples of hurricane projected to hit Tampa Bay and then turning and deviating north or south — including Hurricane Ian.\nHurricane Milton is putting the spiritual legends to test. The hurricane is slated to hit Florida early Thursday with Tampa Bay potentially facing historic and catastrophic storm surges, 100 miles per hour winds and heavy rain.\nThe Category 4 storm has winds of 155 miles per hour and is expected to make landfall in Florida early Thursday morning.\nBut some of the latest updates from the National Hurricane Center and storm path models have Milton making landfall south of Tampa Bay potentially in Sarasota or south of Sarasota.\nIf those expectations hold true, that would bring the worst of the storm to the south of the Tampa area.\nTampa Bay could avoid biblical storm surge flooding is the storm lands to the south.\nStill, Tampa and Pinellas County are in the wider path cone of the storm and are almost certain to see high winds, power outages, possible tornadoes, thunderstorms and downpours from Milton.\nBut it might dodge a more catastrophic storm surge bullet.\nTampa. St. Petersburg and Pinellas barrier islands did see major damage from Hurricane Helene as is barreled north.\nThe Indian blessing legend is not lost on Tampa Bay locals.\n\"I kind of believe it,\" said Kristen Hendry, who lives in Brandon near Tampa.\n\"I've seen weird things happen with other hurricanes. Storms will turn.\"\nHendry is not alone.\nThere are plenty of local references to the blessings against hurricanes on social media, breakfast diners and dog parks as local residents brace for Milton's impacts.\nStill, having faith in the spiritual, if not keeping local residents from bracing from Hurricane Milton's impacts.\n\"We're definitely getting ready,\" she said.\nOthers are also bringing their faith and spiritual beliefs as Milton approaches from the western Gulf of Mexico with a potential historic hit on Florida.\nFathers Athanasios Haros and Pappa Fanis of the St. Nichols Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Tarpon Springs went to the shores of the Gulf of Mexico on Monday to bless the body of water in advance of Hurricane Milton and ask for spiritual intercessions and protections.\nIn a Facebook video, Haros said they were on the Gulf of Mexico shores to bless the waters and ask for blessing and protections.\nTocobaga indigenous tribe inhabited had burial mounds in the Tampa area specifically Safety Harbor, which sits on the northern end of Old Tampa Bay in Pinellas County.\nTocobaga encountered the Spanish in the 1500 and 1600s, had their populations decreased by diseases brought by Europeans, conflicts with other tribes and eventually emigrated to Cuba with the Spanish when Florida came under British rule from 1763 to 1783 before returning to Spanish control.\nTampa is home to one of the largest ports in the U.S. and U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base. Central Command runs U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Holy land including those involving the current war between Israel and Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Activists elated, Tradepoint frustrated as Hart-Miller Island won't receive dredged material\n\n October 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JOEL LEV-TOV jlev-tov@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 1010\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Tradepoint Atlantic will not be placing the material it dredges from deepening its harbor on Hart-Miller Island.Community activists cautiously celebrated the announcement on last week. Two council members and the county executive expressed disappointment. Tradepoint's Aaron Tomarchio told the Eagle he was frustrated.\n\"While there were many who understood the value of a win-win opportunity and the positive impact such a significant investment of $40 million could have in their communities,\" Tomarchio wrote in a letter to Baltimore County sent Thursday morning, \"there remains a long-held sentiment that Hart-Miller Island should remain as-is.\"\nThe long-held sentiment continues, the executive vice president of corporate affairs wrote, despite the $40 million proposed community benefit agreement and \"assurances\" that the company is dedicated to placing the dredged material on the island safely.\nFrank Neighoff, the president of the Chesapeake Bay Association and a member of the committee that would have advised the Baltimore County Council on how to spend the $40 million, said he was \"very pleased.\"\nKeith Taylor, the president of the Sparrows Point-North Point Historical Society, called the news \"wonderful\" but cautioned that the fight wasn't over.\nTomarchio told the Eagle that his company was \"community-minded\" and understood the community \"did not\" want to see the dredged material placed on Hart-Miller Island, created through the dredging of the Baltimore harbor in the 1980s.\n\"Is it frustrating that certain people lack vision? Yes,\" he said. \"Is it frustrating that certain people are unable to let go of the past and look toward the future? Yes.\"\n\"But are we respecting the decision of the community?\" he continued. \"Absolutely.\"\nAnd so the proposal to put the dredged material from the site of the former Bethlehem Steel Mill, where Tradepoint and Mediterranean Shipping Company want to expand the harbor into one capable of hosting the large container ships in a billion-dollar project, onto the island is dead in the water.\nThe Hart-Miller Island plan was just one of three proposals for what to do with the dredge.\nTHE PLAN\nTradepoint plans to move ahead with a \"blended\" option, where it would deposit the 4.2 million cubic yards of dredge, dug from the bottom of its harbor while deepening it to 50 feet by 2028, in four different sites.\nRoughly a third of the cleanest dredge would be dumped into the ocean off the coast of Norfolk, a third of the dredge would be contained on its own property and the last third would be stored at an existing containment site run by the state across the Patapsco River in Cox Creek by Hawkins Point.\nAn environmental report the company commissioned, released to the public on Oct. 2, cleared the first hurdle for the third to be dumped into the ocean. The report found it clean enough to meet the Environmental Protection Agency's standards.\nAnother proposal called for building a new facility on the western part of Coke Point, taking away 100 acres of water — about 76 football field's worth — for a closed-off site with the dredged material, called a dredged material containment facility.\nScott Pappas, the president of the Fort Howard Community Association who sat on the committee advising what to do with the funds as well, said either of the two options that did not involve placing the material on public, recreational land was fine with him as long as the corporation followed the law.\n\"You've got to remember that Hart-Miller Island is a commonwealth, it's a state property that we as taxpayers of the state of Maryland, we own that,\" he said. \"What they wished to do was to take their materials and put it onto one of our gems, one of our recreational places.\"\nLAST-MINUTE CHANGE\nSo why the sudden change of heart at Tradepoint, after at least two months of pushing for the dredge to be placed on Hart-Miller Island?\n\"I think there was a combination of things that played a role in it,\" Tomarchio said.\nCommunity feedback was one big pillar, he said. On Tuesday, Oct. 8, more than 90 people jammed into a small meeting room at the North Point Library to hear about Tradepoint's proposal to deposit the dredge on the island.\nMany community members hadn't heard of the project. The number of attendees was more than twice that of any meeting with the committee, called the Hart-Miller Island Community Benefit Agreement Steering Committee.\nAbout two hours after the meeting began, some members of that committee asked the community members to vote on whether the committee members should advise the County Council to accept or reject the $40 million Community Benefit Agreement.\nIt wasn't even close. 86 residents voted to reject the agreement, according to a Facebook post. Two voted to accept it. One voted undecided.\nLess than 48 hours later, Tradepoint jettisoned the plan. That canceled a committee meeting later that day, set to be held at the Sollers Point Multipurpose Center.\nTomarchio derided the meeting as a \"kangaroo court,\" claiming that Tradepoint was not invited.\n\"There was no opportunity to present the facts of what was actually going on and being proposed,\" he said. \"So, of course, when you have a one-sided conversation happening, people are going to end up on that one side.\"\nTaylor chuckled when asked to respond.\n\"Sometimes the community has to speak for itself,\" he said, \"and I think that happened Tuesday.\"\nThe second pillar, Tomarchio said, was a realization that placing the dredge on the island wasn't nearly as simple as they had expected.\nIt would take about the same amount of time, he said the company realized, to build the new containment facility in Hart-Miller Island's North Cell as it would to place the dredge via the \"blended\" plan.\nNow, with the plan to place the dredge on the island jettisoned, the $40 million that went along with that as compensation is gone as well. Tradepoint will not be paying the communities any money, whatever plan it goes ahead with.\nPappas isn't sorry to see the money go.\n\"What they were doing is compensating the community for their political support in order for them to have a fast track and a secure place to put their dread spoils from their construction and real estate development at Tradepoint Atlantic,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Striped bass continue to struggle in the Chesapeake Bay\n\n October 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 626\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Young Striped Bass are struggling in the Chesapeake Bay, and experts across the field are working to find solutions for the economic and cultural impacts.This week, the Atlantic Striped Bass Management Board met and discussed the future of the species during the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's annual webinar meeting.\nMeeting attendees discussed the findings of an annual report released by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources showing concerning results for the future of striped bass in the Chesapeake.\nAllison Colden, Chesapeake Bay Foundation's Maryland executive director, said the Chesapeake Bay is an important nursery area for striped bass.\n\"It's safe to say the majority of striped bass all along the coast are spawned here in the Chesapeake Bay,\" Colden said. \"So we are the epicenter for where all of these fish are born before they make their way, grow up and make their way out of the Chesapeake Bay and migrate all along the Atlantic coast.\"\nAccording to Colden, data about the status of the population shows juvenile striped bass face various barriers before making it to adulthood.\nThis survey goes back to the 1950s and is one of the longest-running for the species on the Atlantic coast. The results of this year's survey show the sixth consecutive year of below-average numbers.\nThe data collected is done through an observation of fish that spawned in the spring, then grew over the summer. The sample used a net, which is called in from the shoreline at various sample sites throughout the Maryland and Virginia portions of the Bay.\nThe information gathered is used on an annual basis to create an index and from year to year, show many fish are caught at these set sample sites over a long time frame.\nDuring the Atlantic Striped Bass Management Board meeting, several attendees shared concerns over the decline in striped bass and the effect new regulations to protect the species will have on the Chesapeake Bay economically.\nIn the past, the commission implemented several additional regulations in order to help raise the striped bass population. Most recently, new limits for size and the number of fish that can be harvested were issued in January. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources also prohibited fishing for striped bass from July 16 through July 31, when temperatures are highest and fish are most vulnerable.\nMike Smolek, president of the Upper Bay Charter Captains Association, shared during the meeting the hit his industry took as a result of the regulations. Smolek shared that six pack boats \"have been hit the hardest,\" and business for these boats is down by 80%.\n\"We cannot endure any more closure days. If we do, all of us might as well just go out of business.\"\nDuring the meeting, the board stated that based on the results of the survey, rebuilding the striped bass population by the intended 2029 goal is unlikely without additional management action.\nThe commission determined that at least an additional 15% reduction in fishing mortality would be necessary for the stock to have a 50% probability of rebuilding to sustainable levels by 2029. Options to achieve that reduction were not available at the time of the meeting.\nThe board voted to meet again in December to consider further action, saying additional time will allow technical staff to develop options for new limits that can be implemented in the 2025 fishing season.\nColden said protecting the species through new regulations is important, but it is just a piece of the solution to keep the species and industry going.\n\"Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, they only have control over one piece of the puzzle,\" Colden said. \"... When it comes to improving conditions within those nursery and spawning areas at Chesapeake Bay, it's something that's a lot more complex and long-term.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I watched an osprey come by, not eight feet away from me, and catch a fish and fly off,\" Schroeder said. \"I saw a mother American mink with two of its little babies running around, and I walked around the corner of the trail and saw two hen turkeys and all their little babies, and there were just turkeys flying everywhere.\"\n\"Those are experiences I would not have, had this become developed,\" he added.\nSchroeder's story encapsulates what he and other park advocates envisioned for the land when DuPont donated it to the states of Delaware and Pennsylvania 40 years ago.\n\"I think it is a refuge to some extent,\" David Koppeser, president of the Friends of White Clay Creek State Park said. \"[Visitors] feel that it is a place they can step into nature, either on their own or with other people, and they can just get away from it all and they can enjoy nature as it existed for so long in this area.\"\nBoth the state park in Newark and the preserve in Landenberg, Pa., held events Saturday to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the donation that led to the creation of the two-state park. Groups from both sides hiked to the state line for a ceremony reminiscent of the one held to celebrate the founding four decades ago.\nThe events that led up to the creation of the park began in the 1950s when the DuPont company began buying up land in Delaware and Pennsylvania with the intention of damming the White Clay Creek to create a 12 billion gallon reservoir to serve its factories and the surrounding community. The reservoir would have flooded more than 1,000 acres of forest, meadow and farmland.\nEnvironmental activists, led by Dorothy Miller, Don Sharpe and others, launched a massive community effort to stop the reservoir. By the 1980s, DuPont had given up on the idea, and in 1984, the company donated the land to the states — approximately 1,200 acres in Pennsylvania and 500 in Delaware.\nIn Delaware, the land was added to existing parkland and eventually became known as White Clay Creek State Park, which after further acquisitions is nearly 4,000 acres today. The adjoining land in Pennsylvania formed White Clay Creek Preserve.\nA bi-state council, made up of six people from each state, was set up to advise the states on how to manage the land. From early on, the members were adamant that the land remain a passive park that is as natural as possible, said Schroeder, who served on the council and later founded Friends of White Clay Creek Preserve.\nHe recalled that the council fought against Pennsylvania's initial plan to build campgrounds, picnic areas, big parking lots and other facilities.\n\"The goal was to have a place that was a natural area, because we're in the middle of the mid-Atlantic area, we're surrounded by tens of millions of people and we have this gem here,\" he said.\nState officials eventually got on board, and the preserve's strongest supporters still take pride that the land lives up its name as a preserve.\n\"We don't have basketball courts. We don't have tennis courts. In fact, I think there's only two picnic tables,\" said Scotty Crowder, president of the Friends group on the Pennsylvania side. \"It's really about the streams, the hiking trails and enjoying nature as it was here.\"\nThe Delaware side does have some recreational amenities like a bandstand, picnic area and nature center, but most of it remains natural as well.\nA new nature center is slated to be built near the existing one that is housed in the historic Chambers House on Creek Road near Hopkins Road. The current building is small and can't accommodate large groups.\nThe new 6,800-square-foot building will include classrooms, exhibition space, public restrooms and an outdoor classroom space. It will be used for school groups, summer camps and other nature-focused programming.\nKoppeser credited the state park's enduring popularity to the community members who so passionately fought for the park four decades ago.\n\"They had a vision that was decades into the future,\" he said. \"Save whatever you can because if you don't save it, it'll be gone, and the future generations won't have this resource available to them.\"\nSchroeder added that the bi-state cooperation was key, as well.\n\"We made a very conscious effort to treat it as a single ecosystem and not get too distracted by where the state line was,\" he said. \"I think that was critical for the success here.\"\nSarah Sato, an environmental education specialist who runs programs on the Pennsylvania side, said decades of community involvement have made the park and preserve what they are today.\n\"It's been really cool to see all of the different people who use the park and hear how much they care about the park, because the whole reason this place was preserved was because people cared,\" Sato said. \"It makes it a special place, because they actually want to be here and they care about it.\"\nEd O'Donnell, of Newark, is a member of White Clay Fly Fishers and enjoys fishing in the park nearly year-round.\n\"It's our piece of wilderness, surrounded by suburbia and cities,\" O'Donnell said. \"You can get lost in White Clay and not think about.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Environmentalists push for ban on Maryland’s industrial chicken farms\n\n October 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MADISON KORMAN Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 819\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n An environmental group is urging Gov. Wes Moore's administration to impose a moratorium on Maryland's industrial chicken farms when the current permit comes up for review next summer.But Maryland chicken farmers say they're taking all the precautions they can to protect the environment, while also running one of the state's biggest industries.\nA debate between the two sides is starting to heat up this fall, as the state Department of the Environment holds a series of listening sessions to get the public's point of view on the matter.\nThe state's job is to make sure business is operating in a way that complies with state and federal requirements protecting the environment, according to the agency. They make revisions to the statewide animal feeding and operations permit every five years.\nAnimal waste is an ongoing concern for the state, mainly on cattle production in northern Maryland and poultry in the Eastern Shore counties, according to a report last fall from the University of Maryland. Most nitrogen and phosphorus in manure comes from poultry litter, according to the report, and that nutrient output is expected to rise with increases in the weight of chickens over the next ten years.\nThis fall, state officials are listening to testimony on the subject at meetings online and in person, as people on all sides of the question weigh in.\n\"Our primary goal is to make sure that we maximize public participation in the process, so we are seeking input before a draft permit is written,\" said Jay Apperson, deputy director of communications for the state Department of the Environment. \"We want to hear from all stakeholders, including farmers and nearby communities.\"\nApperson said the department will analyze the comments and begin drafting a statewide permit that will be released early next year. A second public comment period will follow after that and the permit will be subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approval before becoming final.\nEnvironmentalists worry about pollutionThe Food & Water Watch, an environmental group, would like to see a total moratorium on new large chicken farms. They also want to limit the expansion of existing ones under corporate contracts on the eastern shore, home to one of the state's biggest farming industries.\nThe group believes those farms threaten local communities, as well as the Chesapeake Bay.\nAdvocates with the FWW say the population of chickens in Maryland is too dense. There are about 488 poultry-concentrated animal feeding operations in Maryland, raising around 330 million chickens a year, according to the state agency.\nThe regular review presents an opportunity to look into the density, said Rebecca Wolf, senior food policy analyst at the Food & Water Watch. She also questions whether poultry farms are fully complying with regulations on water pollution.\n\"It's a really good chance to take a look at a lot of these issues, to take a look at pollution, to take a look at the concentration,\" Wolf said. She also said officials should \"review how state agencies are falling short on monitoring the chicken waste problem and actually pursue some real effort to hold the industry accountable and make Maryland air and water safer for communities.\"\nThe agency says they've increased the number of inspections from 163 in the fiscal year that started in 2021 to 263 in 2023, and that they're on track to do 288 this year.\n\"The Maryland Department of the Environment maintains a strong program to enforce environmental regulations pertaining to poultry operations,\" Apperson told Capital News Service in an email. \"A high percentage of violations that are found are associated with record-keeping requirements as opposed to water quality issues.\"\nFarmers defend the safety and cleanlinessChicken producers defend their business, one of the most vibrant and prosperous in Maryland. Hundreds of people depend on the industry for their livelihood in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, according to the business group that represents them.\n\"There are more than 1,200 Delmarva family farmers who raise chickens on independently owned farms,\" said James Fisher, a spokesperson for the Delmarva Chicken Association, citing the group's own annual surveys of the five chicken companies operating on Delmarva. \"There are more than 18,000 chicken company employees.\"\n\"There are hundreds of allied businesses on Delmarva that sell products and services to the chicken economy,\" Fisher said. \"It is an essential part of our culture, our workforce, our economy here in Delmar.\"\nFisher said farms have worked to reduce the pollution despite the increase in the number of chickens.\n\"Farmers raise their own families on their farms,\" Holly Porter, the group's executive director, said in a statement. \"So air and water quality is very important to them.\"\n\"Simply canceling the Maryland chicken industry, as some activists say they want, would bankrupt hundreds of farms and destroy thousands of jobs with chicken companies and allied businesses,\" Porter said.\nIt would also make chicken more expensive and harder to find, she said.\nThe revisions to the state permit are due by July of next year. State officials will continue their review in the coming months. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "A 'smart buoy' is coming to St. Michaels harbor\n\n November 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Environment \n \n 325\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS — On Wednesday evening, Andrew David Thaler carried a large wooden device with yellow cords piled in its interior and a yellow and black top into the St. Michaels commissioners meeting.Thaler, a member of the St. Michaels Climate Change/Sea Level Rise Commission, smiled as he eagerly presented the \"smart buoy.\"\nWith the permission of the commissioners, the Climate Change/Sea Level Rise Commission will put the buoy in the harbor to monitor water levels and flooding.\n\"What this buoy will do is it measures sea state, so we get sea surface temperature, we get wave action on the surface,\" Thaler said. \"And then we'll also have a pressure gage at the bottom of the mooring, which we'll be able to use to assess tidal head. So that'll give us both the actual tidal cycle coming into the harbor, as well as any storm surges coming up from the bay.\"\nAccording to Thaler, one of the long-term goals of the commission is to look into the viability of having the town's own tide gage.\nThe reasoning behind this goal is to gather specific data of St. Michaels tide pH. Currently, the data gathered for nuisance flooding, tidal surges and storm surges come from three sites. The sites are gages from Cambridge, Annapolis and Clayburn. Which are too far from St. Michaels to accurately gather information for the town.\nThaler said last year the commission applied for an equipment grant from So Far Ocean, a company that makes smart buoys. The presented device will gather data in real time and is solar powered.\nThaler said the location of the smart buoy will not interfere with boat traffic and will be located in the lagoon between Honeymoon Bridge and Mill Street. It comes at no cost to the town.\nAfter the presentation, the St. Michaels commissioners thanked Thaler and the Climate Change/Sea Level Rise Commission for all their efforts.

    "content": "Will a cleaner Chesapeake Bay mean more fish and crabs? It’s complicated\n\n November 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KARL BLANKENSHIP Bay Journal | Section: News \n \n 1994\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For decades, Chesapeake Bay cleanup efforts have been driven by a simple equation: Cleaner water equals more fish and shellfish.The 1983 Chesapeake Bay Agreement, which launched the state-federal restoration effort, made that clear as it sought to reverse the Bay's \"historical decline in the living resources.\" It would do so, the agreement said, by addressing pollution flowing into the Bay.\nThe living resources goal was reiterated in the next two cleanup agreements in 2000 and 2014, and the pollution goal has been refined to measurable targets for reducing nutrient pollution in the water.\nBut would achieving those goals actually result in more fish, crabs and oysters?\nIt's complicated.\nBay scientists caution that the link between nutrient reductions and increased fish abundance is highly uncertain. In a report last year, they warned of a need for \"grounding\" the public's expectations about the recovery of aquatic life, even if cleanup goals are met.\nIn the May 2023 Comprehensive Evaluation of System Response report, the Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee of the state-federal Chesapeake Bay Program cautioned that other factors — such as temperature, salinity, river flows and structural habitats — play important roles in determining fish abundance. Compared with those, the water quality role can be small.\n\"Considerable uncertainty,\" they wrote, \"will accompany any effort to predict how fish and shellfish populations respond to changes in water quality alone.\"\nStriped bass and some other fish species might benefit from reducing nutrient pollution in the Chesapeake Bay, but reducing it might not help others, such as menhaden.\nScientists who worked on the report are quick to say that doesn't mean the Bay Program should walk away from its nutrient reduction commitments. Rather, they say, it points to the need to better understand the relative importance of water quality improvements and other factors, such as habitat restoration, in boosting aquatic populations.\nThat could inform efforts to balance spending on nutrient controls with other things to produce the greatest benefit for the widest variety of species.\n\"We're really saying this is an evolution, not a revolution,\" said Kenny Rose, a fisheries scientist with the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science who was the lead author of the living resources section of the CESR report.\nThe best place to figure that out, according to the report, is in shallow water areas that fringe the Bay and the tidal portions of tributaries that are disproportionately important for a wide range of creatures.\nThat recommendation has spurred recent interest within the Bay Program to focus increased pollution reduction and habitat restoration work on a handful of targeted nearshore areas.\nThe challenge of changeIt would be a significant change in direction — and it would also pose significant scientific challenges.\nHistorically, nutrient reduction actions have generally been aimed at improving the deepest parts of the upper Bay, where water quality is the worst.\nBut the CESR report warns that cleanup progress has been slow, the Bay has not responded as rapidly as expected, and that the deepwater goals may not be fully attainable.\nIt also pointed out that, when it comes to helping aquatic life, focusing most nutrient reduction efforts on deepwater areas could detract from other actions that would more directly help aquatic life.\nThat has triggered interest in creating a \"tiered approach\" to reducing nutrient pollution. In that approach, some shallow-water areas with a high potential to show results would get greater priority, even if their impact on deeper water would be relatively small.\nThose nearshore areas would, in effect, become incubators for understanding how — and whether — alternate approaches to Bay restoration might produce better results for fish and shellfish.\nThat doesn't mean that all emphasis would be removed from deepwater areas, said Lee McDonnell, chief of the science, analysis and implementation branch of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Chesapeake Bay Program Office.\nSome focus on those areas is important because when oxygen disappears there, it triggers conditions that release nutrients stored in the sediment, making overall Bay water quality even worse.\n\"We can't ignore the deep water [or] deep channel and say everybody's going to focus on shallow water,\" McDonnell said.\nAt the same time, he said, there is a public expectation that cleanup actions will result in tangible benefits.\n\"We're asking for behavior change in people, and their expectation is that they should be able to see some kind of change and experience it,\" McDonnell said. \"There's a much better chance of doing that in the shallow waters than in the deep trench.\"\nShifting more resources to shallow water could slow the rate of progress in deepwater areas, but many scientists say the change is worth the trade-off if it results in quicker, more tangible benefits for aquatic life.\n\"This tiered implementation is not saying you're taking your foot off the gas of the pursuit of a long-term goal,\" said Penn State ecologist Denice Wardrop, one of the lead authors of the CESR report. \"But at the pace we're going, you need an interim goal because you're going to be losing living resources on the way to the long-term goal. And you don't need to.\"\nFinding the balanceChief of the science, analysis and implementation branch of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Chesapeake Bay Program Office Lee McDonnell, Wardrop, Rose and a handful of others have been meeting for months to figure out how to identify shallow areas to be prioritized — and how to assess whether their actions are making a difference. It's a complex task.\nReducing nutrient loads in the Bay system have long been seen as a way to help living resources. The nutrients spur algae blooms that cloud the water and block sunlight from reaching underwater grass beds, which provide important habitat for juvenile fish and crabs, waterfowl and other species.\nWhen the excess algae die, they decompose in a process that removes oxygen from the water, sometimes causing oxygen-starved \"dead zones\" that plague the deepest parts of the upper Bay each summer.\nThe nutrient reduction goals assigned to each Bay state and major tributary aim to improve those conditions, allowing more sunlight to reach underwater plants and largely eliminate dead zones.\nThat would certainly allow underwater grass meadows to expand and would benefit bottom-dwelling organisms, such as clams and worms, that can suffocate if oxygen levels get too low.\nThe increased oxygen is intended to help fish and crabs as well, but whether that would lead to greater abundance is unclear.\nFor one thing, those species can simply move if water conditions get bad. And many, such as striped bass, blue crabs, shad and others, spend most of their lives — or at least important life stages — outside the Chesapeake. Conditions in those areas often are more important in determining their abundance.\nFurther, reduced algae production isn't always a good thing. While excess amounts can trigger poor oxygen levels, algae is also an important food, especially for fish in their early life stages, as well as for some adult fish, like menhaden, which are themselves an important food for larger fish and birds.\nIndeed, a 2017 EPA study found that while species like striped bass and oysters might benefit from the improved water quality, the reduced algae production might hamper populations of others, such as Atlantic menhaden.\nThe CESR report also stated that \"living resource abundance may eventually decrease as nutrient loads continue to decrease and [water quality goals] approach full attainment.\"\n\"[There are] always going to be winners and losers,\" said Tom Ihde, a researcher at Morgan State University's Patuxent Environmental & Aquatic Research Laboratory, who also worked on the CESR report. \"If you're managing menhaden populations versus the blue crab, you're concerned about very different things.\"\nIhde has worked on complex computer models that try to tease out how various species respond to different variables. In a 2017 paper, he examined the responses of nearly 50 aquatic species to a variety of ecological changes.\nHe found that achieving the clean water goals only had a small impact on most species — though some, like blue crabs and white perch, showed benefits.\nThat influence was dwarfed by the impact of temperature increases. Achieving water quality goals does little to offset that problem for most species, he found.\nThat shouldn't be totally surprising, Ihde said, because temperature affects everything in the system, such as growth rates, the timing of reproduction and food production.\n\"It's not that the nutrient reductions are not having an effect,\" Ihde said. \"It is, and we're seeing change. But it's that temperature is much more of a change.\"\nIt's never just one thingOther factors — salinity, the amount of freshwater flowing into the Bay during spring spawning periods, fishing pressure, disease and loss of structural habitats — are also important in influencing species abundance.\nA recent Bay Program report looked at the habitats of forage fish, which are small species eaten by larger fish and birds. The researchers found that shoreline hardening played an important role in predicting their abundance. The most sensitive forage species go away when just 10% of an area's shoreline is covered by bulkheads or rip-rap. And many comparatively tolerant species disappear when that amount reaches 30%.\nThe CESR report noted that benefits of water quality improvements \"will be modest\" if such factors are limiting populations.\nBut, it said, pairing water quality work with other actions — restoring wetlands, replacing hardened shorelines with living shorelines or building oyster reefs — might yield better overall results.\nIn recent years, state and federal agencies have worked to restore large oyster reefs in 11 Bay tributaries.\nMonitoring has shown that underwater grasses are rebounding in areas near the reefs, very likely a result of oysters filtering the water. Other studies have found that oyster reefs help remove nutrients from the water.\n\"We feel pretty confident that doing large-scale oyster restoration leads to ecological benefits,\" said Bruce Vogt of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Chesapeake Bay Office. \"We have very clear evidence that the oyster reefs are cleaning the water and produce better clarity.\"\nFish abundance is also higher near the reefs, though Vogt said it is less clear whether the reefs are boosting fish reproduction or merely attracting fish from other areas.\nThat is the type of question that scientists say could be cleared up by targeting some shallow water areas for more intense work and monitoring the results.\nStill, understanding impacts in a given area — and predicting whether positive signs in one area would be repeated in others — is no easy task in a system as large and complex as the Chesapeake.\n\"Not all oyster habitats are equal, and not all seagrass habitats are equal,\" said Mark Monaco, a senior scientist with NOAA's\nNational Centers for Coastal Ocean Science and an author of the CESR report. \"How do those relationships hold up across the Bay in specific areas? And would an enhancement in habitat restoration actually move the dial in a particular area?\"Getting to a tipping point\nThe good news, Monaco said, is that a lot of data is available. Fish surveys and studies have taken place in the Bay for decades. They've never really been integrated with information on habitats, water quality and other variables that can impact fish, but that work has begun.\nIt will take at least two years to glean needed information from that data and identify shallow water areas for emphasis, according to those working on the process.\nAnd there are a lot of basic details to work out along the way: What does \"shallow water\" actually mean? Is that two feet deep or six feet deep? What species and what life stages should be included in an analysis? How big of an area would be targeted?\nThe hope, said McDonnell of the EPA Bay Program Office, is to find shallow areas near an ecological \"tipping point\" where a realistic amount of action can turn an area of poor habitat into fair habitat, or a fair area into a good area, and produce faster improvements for the species that live there.\n\"If we're going to have this tiered implementation, it has to be grounded in science,\" he said. \"If we're going to do something different than we're doing now, there ought to be a reason for it. I'm hoping this is our good reason.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Chris Van Hollen, would create the Chesapeake National Recreation Area in Maryland and Virginia and make it part of a network of sites overseen by the National Park Service.\n\"In Maryland, we know the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure,\" Van Hollen said in a statement. \"And creating the Chesapeake National Recreation Area will celebrate that fact while also bringing major benefits to the Bay.\"\n\"Not only will this open up more equitable public access to the Bay, the (Chesapeake National Recreation Act) will also mobilize additional federal support for restoration, shine a light on the untold stories of its history, and support greater economic opportunity in the region,\" the senator said.\nOne of the key goals of making the Chesapeake National Recreation Area part of the national parks system is to boost national pride in the bay and its history, amplifying the stories of historically underrepresented groups such as Indigenous and Black people.\n\"Today's bipartisan, unanimous vote was a big step forward in our efforts to pass this historic legislation,\" Van Hollen said.\nIn 2021, Van Hollen and Maryland Rep. John Sarbanes, a Democrat, created a working group to help draft the language for the legislation. The working group included Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, a Democrat, Virginia Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, and Reps. Bobby Scott, D-Virginia, Rob Wittman, R-Virginia, and various conservation groups. Van Hollen and Sarbanes introduced the measure in the Senate and House, respectively, last year. However, the idea of the Chesapeake National Recreation Area dates as far back as the 1980s.\n\"The Chesapeake Bay is an extraordinary national treasure and a vital resource for our region,\" Sarbanes said in a statement. \"I am thrilled that the Chesapeake National Recreation Area Act has advanced out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee — a crucial milestone in our efforts to safeguard the Bay for the well-being and enjoyment of future generations.\"\nSince the measure's introduction, several interested parties have submitted letters to Van Hollen in support of the legislation, including Rep.-elect Johnny Olszewski, Jr., Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley and Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott.\n\"Thanks to Sen. Van Hollen's leadership, this is a great day for the Chesapeake Bay, with another step forward in the four-decade effort to establish National Park Service recognition for the nation's largest estuary,\" Chesapeake Conservancy President and CEO Joel Dunn said in a statement. \"The Chesapeake Bay is as spectacular as Yellowstone or Yosemite, as great as the Great Smokies and as grand as the Grand Tetons.\"\nThe Chesapeake Recreation Area Act would make the park service take on a larger and more administrative role.\nCurrently, the National Park Service can partner with and provide assistance to local and regional organizations involved in the bay through the Chesapeake Gateways program and administers some sites along the watershed, including some national monument sites.\nIf the legislation is enacted, the park service would administer the Chesapeake Gateways and Watertrails Network, which encompasses about 200 places located within the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\nHowever, the bill states that the Department of the Interior, through the National Park Service, would only acquire land and land-based resources within the recreation area boundaries from voluntary transfers by landowners. The bill also specifically states that the park service has to work with the Department of Transportation to minimize traffic around the bay as well as create an advisory board made up of nine representatives each from Maryland and Virginia.\nThe management and acquisition of sites would come from the park service's annual budget under the Department of the Interior, which is approved by Congress.\n\"Establishing the Chesapeake National Recreation Area expands resources for environmental protection and makes it clear that the United States cherishes the Chesapeake, the birthplace of American identity,\" Dunn said. \"As a great gift to future generations, this legislation ensures public access to our nation's largest estuary while providing for the needs of those who live here and depend on the Bay for their livelihood.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Texas-based company acquired the plant in December 2021.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation called the ruling \"a huge win for clean water and the health of the Chesapeake Bay's tributaries.\"\nChesapeake Bay Foundation Maryland Advocacy Director Alan Girard said Valley Proteins contributes to the nitrogen discharged in the the Transquaking River watershed. He said the original permit didn't ensure the river and Higgins Mill Pond are safe for swimming, fishing and wildlife habitat.\nFriends of the Nanticoke River President Jay Martin said in the news release that his organization is \"encouraged\" by the court's decision.\n\"The court has sent a clear message that we need more comprehensive oversight to ensure our waters are safe and healthy for all species that rely on them,\" he said.\nMatt Pluta, Choptank riverkeeper and director of riverkeeper programs at ShoreRivers, said the decision \"recognizes the value of clean water.\"\n\"Higgins Mill Pond and the upper Transquaking River are valuable resources that have repeatedly been neglected, and we hope that — through this remand — the state will seek opportunities to meaningfully protect and restore them and reverse the long history of pollution impacts,\" he said in the news release.\nThis is not the only time Valley Proteins has gotten into hot water for its practices.\nIn June, the Maryland Department of the Environment fined Darling Ingredients $15,000 for repeated pollution violations at its Linkwood facility. According to a news release from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, department inspections revealed 51 violations made between August 2023 and March 2024 by the owner of Valley Proteins.\nIn 2022, the facility was put under a consent decree with the Maryland Department of the Environment, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, ShoreRivers and Dorchester Citizens for Planned Growth. The consent degree ordered the facility owners to pay $540,000 in civil penalties to the state for its more than 40 violations of a discharge permit issued by the state. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "71-year-old spends season in Glacier National Park\n\n November 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: News \n \n 480\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot County resident Cheryl Krebeck spent a good chunk of her 72nd year in Montana's Glacier National Park. From April to October, she lived on the west side of the park in the northern Rockies.This curious woman loves to travel and is not letting a little arthritis get in the way.\n\"Traveling has been my passion, but when I turned 70, I decided I wanted this decade to be my most exciting,\" she said.\n\"I want to do more than just visit for a week or two,\" she said. \"I really wanted to get to know this park. I went online, applied and got a job. I was hired to work in a hotel that was built in 1910 by the Great Northern railroad. I was a front desk person from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.\"\nWhen she was not making coffee and being a concierge for guests, she had regular challenges — like figuring what to do when a guest accidentally set off bear spray inside the hotel.\nWhen she was not working, she got out into the park.\n\"Your best friends are the ones who have the same days off as you. You don't want to hike alone — there are a lot of grizzlies out there. That is what you are concerned with. Mountain lions could get you. I never saw one, but I had the feeling they were there,\" she said.\nThe more remote part of the park is the east side. When the snow subsides in mid June, the Sun Road opens and connects the two sides of the park.\n\"You see sharper peaks, more glaciers and more snow on top of the mountains. Most of my animal sightings were on the east side. Partly because there are less people,\" she said.\nShe hiked the Highline Trail up at Logan Pass. It reaches 6,600 feet.\n\"It was high for me. I saw a black bear on that hike. It was nice it was not a grizzly,\" she said.\nAnother aspect of the journey was that she was much older than most of her fellow workers. A lot of college students take a summer to do this.\n\"When I look back to being 19 years old, I don't think I had an appreciation for what 70 might have felt like. Some of the first hikes I went on were with young people. They were kind. It really added to it,\" she said.\nKrebeck thinks her traveling has given her a big sky kind of attitude. She loves being outside and inhaling. She is thinking a trip to the Amazon is next.\n\"It is a big world out there, and I feel like I have a perspective because I have traveled. Sometimes you meet closed-minded people and can tell they haven't been anywhere. They haven't talked to anybody from anywhere else. There is a big old world out there, and it is worth checking out,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Annabelle was brought to the zoo in May 2018 with the plan to have her mate with Jimmie, the elder statesman to Plumpton Park.\nAt the age of 25, however, Jimmie had to be euthanized because of declining health. He was the oldest giraffe in captivity at the time. Annabelle succumbed to an incurable infection in May 2023.\n\"We've been fundraising for a new giraffe since we lost Annabelle,\" said Cheryl Lacovara, director of Plumpton Park Zoo. She said the zoo needs about $175,000 more to purchase females available from facilities in Louisiana and Arizona.\n\"The daddy at Louisiana is getting really amorous, and they don't have the facilities to keep them separate,\" Lacovara said recently. A veterinarian familiar with Plumpton Park's conservation efforts has recommended that female should be relocated to Rising Sun.\nThe staff at a conservation center in Arizona heard about the zoo's conservation efforts and wants to participate. That's how Plumpton Park will get that second giraffe.\nSince becoming owners of Plumpton Park Zoo in 2010, Cheryl and Nicholas Lacovara have been working with international conservation organizations on efforts to preserve this species of giraffe known as reticulated.\nAccording to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife these giant animals are threatened by loss of habitat, poaching, climate change and other issues, which have shortened the wild population by 77% since 1985. It's being called a \"silent extinction\" because it is happening slowly and without notice.\nThere are eight species and two sub-Saharan species of giraffe — Kordofan and Nubian — are now classified as critically endangered. The reticulated giraffe — which includes Kazar, Jimmie and Annabelle — is considered endangered but because of its dwindling wild population may soon be reclassified as critically endangered.\nLacovera is hoping to get help from the community to raise the needed funds to bring two females to the zoo. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "New Cambridge solar ordinance will have 'immediate effect'\n\n December 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 561\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Along with passing an ordinance regarding solar energy systems on wooded lots, the Cambridge City Council has directed city staff to look into removing community solar from a 350-acre maximum on solar permitted in the city.During a City Council meeting on Dec. 9, the council unanimously approved an ordinance amending the city's Unified Development Code for solar energy systems on wooded lots. Specifically, the amendment allows small-scale solar and community solar on wooded lots as long as the solar project complies with the city's Forest Conservation Ordinance or the state's Model Forest Conservation Ordinance.\nBefore the ordinance was passed, Cambridge Planning and Zoning Director Brian Herrmann said it was consistent with the city's comprehensive plan and the Planning and Zoning Commission had approved it in early November.\nHerrmann said the ordinance would apply to sites that are at least 40,000 square feet. He said requirements of the ordinance include that the area cleared on the wooded lot cannot exceed 10 acres and impacted trees must be replanted at a 2-to-1 ratio or a fee be paid in lieu.\nSmall-scale solar energy systems are typically located on a homeowner's property, Herrmann said.\n\"It's essentially generating electricity where it is used,\" he said.\nCommunity solar energy systems provide power to the residents of a community. Herrmann said that in Maryland, 40% of the output of a community solar system must serve low- to moderate-income residents.\nDuring the meeting, Tony Kupersmith, a lawyer representing a renewable energy company, said the company he represents has a community solar project on Leonards Lane and this ordinance is \"critical\" for that project.\n\"So I get to let you know that what you do tonight would have an immediate effect for an actual project that is ready to go forward, that wants to go forward, and the only issue right now holding us up is the wooded lot issue,\" Kupersmith said before requesting the council adopt the ordinance.\nHerrmann told the council that the city's 350-acre solar maximum — which it is close to reaching — limits the impact of this ordinance.\n\"We have two projects in the final stages of the development review process,\" he said. \"If those two are to go through, we're going to be at 325 acres. So there's only about 25 acres left before we actually hit this amount. So I guess you can see we're not talking about a lot of solar systems that are going to be built even if this does pass.\"\nCommissioner Brian Roche asked why community solar is included in that 350-acre maximum that also includes medium- and large-scale solar energy systems. He said it should be excluded.\n\"We don't want to see our entire land base covered with solar panel projects, but the way I understand community solar is really it is to the benefit of people that cannot either put it on their roof (and) they want to collaborate ... or they otherwise may not be able to have it,\" he said. \"To me, I would strike that out from that maximum.\"\nRoche asked that only medium- and large-scale solar energy systems be included in the 350-acre maximum and not community solar energy systems.\nCity Attorney Patrick Thomas said that because Roche's request goes \"beyond the scope\" of the ordinance on the table, it would need to go through a separate text amendment process. He said a separate ordinance to address the maximum could be prepared. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Our collective work will ensure the health and enduring legacy of the National Wildlife Refuge System.\"\n\"This is the future of conservation,\" Williams said at the establishment ceremony on Dec. 13. \"This is a time of hope. … We have seen nature heal when we give it a chance.\"\nThe Southern Maryland refuge marks the sixth addition to the Refuge System under Haaland.\nThe department has also announced the expansion of several existing national wildlife refuges, which will allow for the voluntary conservation of up to 1.13 million acres of important wildlife habitat, the release said.\nCharles County Commissioner President Reuben B. Collins II (D) said that by conserving these lands Southern Maryland can help provide sanctuary for those who seek somewhere to get away from the hustle and bustle of daily life.\nThe 31-acre parcel near Nanjemoy is the first of several intended donations by The Nature Conservancy that over the next few months will permanently protect and conserve more than 300 acres of interior forest and riparian wetlands habitat, supporting northern long-eared bats, forest-interior songbirds, box turtles and several species of salamanders that are of conservation concern, the release said.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said, \"Now, we're going to have that kind of amazing place right here in Southern Maryland.\"\nMore than half of Maryland's forests and wetlands have been lost in the conversion of important natural areas to other land uses, with more than 1 million acres developed since 1973. The region's population is projected to surpass 20 million people in the next 10 years, according to the release.\n\"There's no better time to do it,\" President and CEO of the Chesapeake Conservancy Joel Dunn said. \"A recent report shows a 73% decline in the average size of modern wildlife population throughout the world … which is very disturbing.\"\n\"I am thrilled to welcome the Southern Maryland Woodlands National Wildlife Refuge into the National Refuge System,\" Haaland said. \"We must address inequitable access to nature and its benefits for underrepresented communities.\"\nRecreation at national wildlife refuges supports regional economies with approximately $3.2 billion per year and supports more than 41,000 jobs, the release said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "New Southern Maryland wildlife refuge hailed as future of conservation\n\n December 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Matt Wynn mwynn@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 539\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n If you were a bird migrating along the Atlantic Flyway, your rest stop options now include Southern Maryland.Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Martha Williams joined partners and community members in Charles County on Dec. 13 to celebrate the establishment of Southern Maryland Woodlands National Wildlife Refuge as the 573rd and newest unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System.\nA newly acquired 31-acre parcel in Nanjemoy is the first of several donations that will become part of the new refuge and provide a crucial protected habitat for threatened and endangered species and expand outdoor recreational opportunities for the 10 million people who visit, live and work in the Washington-Baltimore metropolitan region, a release from the Fish and Wildlife service said.\n\"Today, we mark an incredible milestone in locally led conservation efforts as we welcome the Southern Maryland Woodlands National Wildlife Refuge into our National Wildlife Refuge System,\" Haaland said. \"Across the nation, the Biden-Harris administration has partnered with local communities, partners and tribes to protect treasured places, bolster climate resilience, and ensure current and future generations have public lands and waters to enjoy and recreate. Our collective work will ensure the health and enduring legacy of the National Wildlife Refuge System.\"\n\"This is the future of conservation,\" Williams said at the establishment ceremony on Dec. 13. \"This is a time of hope. … We have seen nature heal when we give it a chance.\"\nThe Southern Maryland refuge marks the sixth addition to the Refuge System under Haaland.\nThe department has also announced the expansion of several existing national wildlife refuges, which will allow for the voluntary conservation of up to 1.13 million acres of important wildlife habitat, the release said.\nCharles County Commissioner President Reuben B. Collins II (D) said that by conserving these lands Southern Maryland can help provide sanctuary for those who seek somewhere to get away from the hustle and bustle of daily life.\nThe 31-acre parcel near Nanjemoy is the first of several intended donations by The Nature Conservancy that over the next few months will permanently protect and conserve more than 300 acres of interior forest and riparian wetlands habitat, supporting northern long-eared bats, forest-interior songbirds, box turtles and several species of salamanders that are of conservation concern, the release said.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said, \"Now, we're going to have that kind of amazing place right here in Southern Maryland.\"\nMore than half of Maryland's forests and wetlands have been lost in the conversion of important natural areas to other land uses, with more than 1 million acres developed since 1973. The region's population is projected to surpass 20 million people in the next 10 years, according to the release.\n\"There's no better time to do it,\" President and CEO of the Chesapeake Conservancy Joel Dunn said. \"A recent report shows a 73% decline in the average size of modern wildlife population throughout the world … which is very disturbing.\"\n\"I am thrilled to welcome the Southern Maryland Woodlands National Wildlife Refuge into the National Refuge System,\" Haaland said. \"We must address inequitable access to nature and its benefits for underrepresented communities.\"\nRecreation at national wildlife refuges supports regional economies with approximately $3.2 billion per year and supports more than 41,000 jobs, the release said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A map geek’s quest to clean the nation, 1 watershed at a time\n\n December 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Alisha Camacho Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 1411\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n By 11 a.m., Jon Merryman had collected 45 tires, 38 bags of trash, packs of shingles, a mattress, a playpen and remnants of an accident swept under a guardrail near College Park, Maryland.Merryman, 62, was frustrated and restless. The Nov. 6 election hadn't gone his way. A veteran and a man of action, he turned to a lifelong passion to cope: picking up trash.\nOver the following days, he cleaned up roadsides in 22 counties spanning Virginia and West Virginia.\n\"I call it channeling my anger,\" Merryman said, tone dropping.\nPhysical work helps him maintain his emotional and mental health. When he returned home to Catonsville, Merryman felt more rejuvenated and ready to face what came next. For him, cleaning up litter is a way to reclaim control, one piece of trash at a time, in a world that can feel overwhelming.\n\"I want people to feel like one person can make a difference,\" he said.\nMerryman traces his passion for protecting the environment to campaigns from his childhood. Campaigns like \"Smokey the Bear.\" \"Woodsy the Owl.\" The 1970s commercial \"Keep America Beautiful: The Crying Indian.\"\nWhile controversial today, the \"Keep America Beautiful\" ad had a simple message for 7-year-old Merryman: \"People start pollution. People can stop it.\" Inspired, he planned a post-Halloween mission to clean up wrappers and litter. With a full bucket, Merryman marched down to a storm drain, thinking that's where the trash should go.\n\"Thank God an adult was there,\" he said. The passerby explained how storm drains lead to rivers. He didn't know it yet, but Merryman would dedicate much of his adult life to rectifying this mistake.\nThe makings of a soldierMerryman's cousins, conservationists on Maryland's Eastern Shore, took him under their wings and ignited a passion for studying the environment. They invited him on bird banding and counting trips. Merryman remembers the sky filling with \"rivers of birds\" for 15 minutes at a time. Clicker in hand, he counted birds until his hand grew weary.\n\"You're witnessing the miracles of being on earth when you see stuff like that,\" Merryman said.\nHis cousins later dissuaded him from becoming a marine biologist.\n\"They got me geared up for this life of studying animals, then said, 'Oh, you don't want to do that. It's a life of chasing grants.'\"\nMerryman entered the University of Delaware as a biology major. Switched to geology. Jumped to civil engineering. His GPA plummeted. He pivoted to part-time status while working for the university. Eventually, he found his footing in geography while programming educational software. Also minored in photography.\nHis first summer out of college, Merryman worked as a volunteer ranger at the Grand Canyon, giving talks, leading groups and picking up trash in front of the visitor center. \"Funny thing is, that's what I love to do now: pick up trash.\"\nThe staff liked him and encouraged him to apply for a seasonal park ranger job, but then Congress slashed funding, so the job didn't exist.\nMerryman took on seasonal jobs. While working in the Everglades, he saw a billboard promoting the army's college fund.\nIt offered $20K for two years of service.\n\"Great option,\" he thought. He enlisted in the army and spent six years in the National Guard.\n'My wife puts up with a lot'When Merryman returned to civilian life, he worked in instructional technology. \"As it turns out, there's a lot of commonality between arranging the elements of a map and arranging the elements on a computer screen,\" he said.\nBut his passion for the environment remained. One day, while working at Lockheed Martin, Merryman came across a trash-strewn creek and park. He spent five years turning it into a sustainable habitat.\nHis hobby of picking up trash also found its way home. \"My driveway was full, I mean seriously, full of scrap metal,\" he said. He sold the metal from cleanups to fund his kids' robotics team. \"The things we do,\" Merryman chuckled.\nThrough it all, he said, it took a lot of patience from his wife, Kirsten. \"The spouses that put up with it are angels, too. They are. My wife puts up with a lot.\"\nTurns out, so do his kids.\nLitter everywhere in the middle of nowhere\nA common conundrum Merryman encounters is people acknowledging a problem but not taking responsibility. \"Someone else is doing the littering. It's those people,\" they think.\nMerryman became determined to show that littering is everyone's problem. During a road trip with his son to Los Angeles, an idea emerged, and they cleaned up trash in one county per state, adding two counties for Texas.\nWhen they arrived \"in the middle of nowhere\" in Turkey, Texas, Merryman found \"litter everywhere.\" He wanted people to realize that we are all responsible for this pile of trash because of all the things we buy and the resources we use.\nTo illustrate the extent of trash pollution, he started placing green dots on a map of counties he'd clean up.\n\"I'm a map geek,\" Merryman said. He had been tracking all the counties he visited for years, a hobby shared by fellow geographers. Now, he aims to pick up trash in every county for as long as possible.\nRecently, he picked his daughter up from school in Ithaca, New York. As they left Ithaca and crossed over into the Chesapeake Bay watershed, an idea \"dawned on me,\" he said.\nHe'd picked up trash in counties between Ithaca and Baltimore, having done this drive many times. \"I put those on the map,\" Merryman said when he realized he was nearly halfway done. \"I bet I could do them all\" in the watershed.\nHe now focuses on watersheds rather than state lines. Water carries pollution across borders, so \"state boundaries don't matter as much as the watershed,\" he said.\nOn Dec. 1, 2024, Merryman reached his goal. He picked up trash in all 206 counties in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Bringing his total count to 524. One-sixth of all counties in the United States.\nSharkey d'SharkOn February 2, 2022, at 2:22 p.m., Merryman retired — a moment he carefully planned. \"I walked out the door,\" said Merryman. \"I just thought it was funny.\"\nA few months later, Merryman found his retirement buddy, Sharkey d' Shark, on the side of the road. The abandoned toy-turned-sidekick became a playful way to engage others in cleanups.\nSharkey has a social media presence. \"It's a lot easier to have a back-and-forth conversation with Sharkey,\" Merryman said, \"as opposed to writing posts and getting crickets in response.\"\nMerryman hopes Sharkey can help educate and inspire younger generations to partake in cleanups. For now, \"about 90% of Sharky's fans are middle-aged women,\" he laughed.\nNature is innocentWhen not traveling to pick up trash, Merryman volunteers with Lights Out Baltimore, searching for dead or injured birds hit by windows due to disorienting artificial lights.\n\"Nature, as far as I'm concerned, is all innocent,\" Merryman said. Migrating birds navigate at night using the moon and stars, but lights lead them to windows. \"There's a reason it's happening. It's not because the bird's stupid,\" he said. The birds can't see the glass.\nNot long ago, Merryman found an old Facebook post when he first joined the group and held a bird for the first time in decades. Now, he's active in several Facebook groups where he educates others about window strikes. Sharing photos of the dead birds tends to upset people, especially those who have already seen them.\nOn the one hand, Merryman speaks to newcomers who aren't aware of this issue and spreads awareness \"over and over and over again.\" On the other hand, some people complain and don't want to see the photos.\n\"I'm sorry if it makes you feel squeamish,\" Merryman said, his tone serious. He paused. \"Actually, I'm not. I'm not sorry,\" he said with a wry laugh. \"I hope that it will make you care about it.\"\nIt is a difficult line to walk — getting people to care without turning them away. \"I'm just not good at drawing that line personally,\" he admitted.\nBut he is good at showing up and doing the dirty work. \"I'm happy to be the grunt, the foot soldier.\"\nMerryman has a plan for the rest of his retirement. He is going to pick up trash in every county in the United States. Until he physically can't anymore. Then he hopes to write a book.\nSo far, he's crossed off Arizona, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, and New Jersey while nearing the finish line in Pennsylvania and Virginia.\nMaybe he won't reach his goal. \"But I'm gonna die trying.\" And maybe the world will be a little cleaner, with a few more birds in it. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

These new voices will bring a wealth of expertise to ShoreRivers, including equal opportunity and civil rights, social and economic justice, grantmaking and local governance, and environmental policy and conservation. Paired with a deep commitment to clean water and healthy Eastern Shore communities, these new members will strengthen the organization's robust science-based advocacy, restoration, and education efforts.\"\nBroderick is a retired federal manager and longtime community activist and leader on Kent Island who serves on numerous local and state boards and committees, including the Maryland 250 Commission and the Bay Bridge Reconstruction Advisory Group.\nA former captain in the U.S. Army, he retired in 2021 as the director of equal opportunity for the National Guard Bureau, U.S. Department of Defense, after 34 years of combined Federal military and civilian service. Broderick lives on Cox Creek and enjoys crabbing, fishing, hunting and spending time on the water.\nThe former executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, Swanson has spent four decades as a leader in Chesapeake Bay restoration and been recognized for her work on a regional, national and international scale. Swanson was the catalyst for the early formation of the Chester River Association and the Sassafras River Association — two of ShoreRivers' legacy organizations.\nIn recognition of that, and her tireless efforts on behalf of the Bay and its landscapes and communities, she was the winner of ShoreRivers' inaugural Award for Environmental Stewardship in 2019.\nWeinstein spent her career at the helm of nonprofit and philanthropic organizations addressing issues of gender parity and social and economic justice. Now retired, she served for two decades as the CEO of Jewish Women International, an organization committed to protecting the rights of women and girls, and is a founder of the Washington Area Women's Foundation, a philanthropic organization that has provided more than $16 million in grants to organizations in the Washington, D.C., region since 1999.\nShe has a love of Eastern Shore waterways that inspired her to deepen her commitment to environmental stewardship, and is also a Master Gardener.\nIn addition to its new members, the board also recently elected its Executive Committee for 2025, which consists of Marian Fry, chair; Barbara Boyd, vice chair; Frank Lewis, treasurer; Maura Bollinger, secretary, and Gene Lopez, at-large.\nShoreRivers also celebrates several long-time board members whose terms end this year: Meta Boyd, Bruce Abel, Ron Rothman and Philp Webster. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Rock fish advisory board sides with no action for now\n\n January 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 995\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON DC — On Dec. 16, during an Atlantic State Marine Fishery Commission meeting, through the Atlantic Striped Bass Management Board, a decision was reached to keep the current recreational fishing regulations in place for 2025.The motion passed with two parties opposed — Maine and New Hampshire.\nNo changes were made, unlike in January of last year, where the commission approved new rules limiting recreational anglers, permitting only one fish per person within 19 to 24 inches, a decision not popular with many anglers on the Eastern Shore.\nThe commission arrived at the decision of no-action early in the afternoon, choosing to \"initiate an addendum to support striped bass rebuilding by 2029 in consideration of 2024 recreational and commercial mortality (dead fish), while balancing socioeconomic impacts.\"\nCapt. Rob Newberry, chair of the Atlantic Fishery Association who has appeared before Kent County Commissioners numerous times over these issues, is not convinced the commission needs to take any action now or in the future. As one of many that attended the Dec. 16 meeting virtually, he outlined the reasons for the board's December ruling.\n\"They weighed in on the side of caution. They'll collect more data and make a decision Oct. 23-25, their annual meeting, with changes applying to 2026 season,\" he noted.\nUltimately they will reduce limits in recreational and commercial, adjusting seasons, setting limits and no-harvesting or no-targeting closures.\nNewberry described it as \"kicking the can down the road.\"\nBoard Chair Megan Ware told Shore Daily News in a recent interview: \"We understand that many will be disappointed in the board's decision to initiate an addendum versus taking immediate action. However, after deliberating for more than three hours about the path forward, the board came to the conclusion that the best course of action is to proceed with an addendum which will allow for clarity on 2024 removals and additional analyses.\"\nThe Dec. 16 board meeting was led by Ware in collaboration with presenters Tyler Grabowski, chair of the Technical Committee, and Emilie Franke, the FMP coordinator.\nIn the virtual meeting, Grabowski presented a list of options that would possibly lead to at least a 14% reduction to the fisheries to reduce mortality rates under the status quo based on current projections.\nThese included shortening fishing seasons, changing recreational slot limits, (fish size) adding closures in specific regions (like the Bay) and discussions of no-harvest and no-target. He used Marine Recreational Information Program data highlighted in their assessment report.\n\"I want to thank the TC (technical committee) board for their heroic effort of getting these to us for our meeting,\" Ware said, recognizing their time restraints.\nFranke presented, previously responding to over 2,000 pages of the public comment summary and advisory panel report, since they do not have an acting chair there.\nBoard members were advised to focus on questions only to enable their vote.\nAs of Sept. 10, Franke reported they received comments from 40 organizations, 976 comments through four form letters and 1,621 individual comments. Of those, 2,853 supported taking action and 517 wanted no action.\nQuestions and comments were posed like how much of a reduction, how the reduction be split among commercial and recreational fishers, how to split reductions between states(equity), how to change size limits, among many other topics of concern.\nThere were two options on the board then: addendum and motion to action.\nThe amended action option was offered by board member Adam Nowalsky of New Jersey, seconded by Emerson Hasbrouck of New York, calling for action in 2025 to achieve a 9% reduction and decrease the commercial quotas by 5%.\nBoard members decided on the addendum instead, matching with the 2024 Stock Assessment Update that indicates while the resource remains overfished it is not currently experiencing overfishing.\nNewberry is not hopeful of this resolve. His solution is more simple, not requiring much deliberation at all. Get out of the commission, he stated, and pull back the $750,000 a year to be a part of the compact; Maryland can establish their own fishery board.\nIn Newberry's opinion, the commission's metrics for measuring rock fish mortality is not accurate. For one, he stated, Maryland's commercial fishermen operate under a three-tiered system when it comes to reporting, and is reliable. But how can the commission report numbers reliably for over 200,000 or more recreational anglers?\n\"Have you ever met a fisherman honest about his catches,\" he joked but made the larger point the measuring methods cannot be trusted.\nDuring the board meeting, the states that tended to side with Maryland on many issues were Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Virginia, Rhode Island and Connecticut, he said.\nBut North Carolina, Florida and Maine were opposite of Maryland on many issues.\nNewberry said that states like Maine, not having a rockfish fishery allocation, should be disqualified from voting.\nFurthermore, he claimed that the commission as it currently operates is unconstitutional, and lamented that it is grown to such a bureaucracy as it has today, what was originally founded to ensure fish for the public and fish oil to use for our military weapons.\n\"The opinion of the Delmarva Fisheries Association, Maryland Charter Boat Association and our legal council is that ASMFC has been unconstitutionally been applying regulations on the commercial and recreational fishers since 1984.\"\nIn 1984 there was a decision to enforce fisheries, but was never ratified by Congress, Newberry said. Newberry was referring to the passage of the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act, which gave the ASMFC authority to require states to adopt measures to manage striped bass, in response to the collapse of the Atlantic striped bass population in the 70s and 80s.\nHe warned of the compact between states, that operates under majority rule, mentioning failure to comply is enforced by federal government through the Department of Commerce.\nDepartment of Natural Resources science writer Joe Zimmermann said there are no plans nor discussions for getting out of the commission.\nHe referred to some sources the public can see how the Maryland Department of Natural Resources contribute to the ASMFC data: The Maryland Department of Natural Resources contributes data, such as the Maryland young-of-year striped bass index at maryland.gov/dnr. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lakeside permit challenge rejected by Maryland Appellate Court\n\n January 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 580\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TRAPPE — The Maryland Appellate Court has rejected a challenge by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation arguing that a groundwater discharge permit does not comply with water quality standards.The Maryland Department of the Environment issued the permit to the Town of Trappe in 2020, authorizing the spraying of treated wastewater on land from the Trappe East Wastewater facility owned by the Town of Trappe and Lakeside at Trappe developers.\nThe spray irrigation is part of a plan to service the Lakeside at Trappe development, which is proposed to bring more than 2,000 homes to the area when complete.\nIn an opinion filed by Judge Stuart Berger on Dec. 23, the court found the permit incorporates a nutrient management plan that meets the requirements needed for use on the property.\n\"The Department determined that the measures included in the Permit and (nutrient management plan) would achieve the assurance of complete uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus from the effluent as required by EN § 9-1110 (requirements for the facility that 'assures' 100% uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus in the effluent). That determination was supported by substantial evidence and the decision to issue the Permit was well within the Department's discretion,\" the opinion states.\nAdditionally, the opinion said Maryland law requires the department to encourage the use of reclaimed water as an alternative to discharging wastewater effluent into the surface waters of the state.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation was represented by attorney Paul Smail, vice president for litigation and general counsel for the foundation. In a statement sent to the Star Democrat, Smail said though the decision was not in the foundation's favor, the foundation is still considering different options moving forward.\n\"The decision is disappointing, and we are weighing our options,\" Smail said. \"Maryland's General Assembly explicitly requires zero net discharge as a condition of land application of treated wastewater from community sewerage systems such as this. If the legal requirement of no additional pollution cannot be guaranteed under all circumstances, then Lakeside at Trappe's treatment system simply should not be permitted.\"\nThe foundation initially filed a lawsuit in February 2021 challenging the permit with partners. In September 2023, the foundation appealed the Talbot County Circuit Court's decision to uphold the department's discharge permit with the Appellate Court of Maryland.\nSmail argued that under state law, Lakeside would need to assure 100% uptake of nutrients, meaning that all nitrogen and phosphorus from the wastewater discharge must be taken up by vegetation so as to not pollute nearby land and water.\nThe foundation argued the approach the department has taken is inappropriate and violates federal and state law. But the department maintained the permit meets or exceeds groundwater quality standards.\nAttorney Matthew Patrick Clagett represented the Maryland Department of the Environment. Clagett said the central question is whether or not the department should have issued the permit as a state discharge permit or a federal discharge permit.\nAdditionally, he said the court should reject arguments made by the foundation because the permit authorizes discharge only to groundwater protected exclusively by state law, and the permit protects the groundwater quality by incorporating the nutrient management plan as required by Maryland.\nChesapeake Bay Foundation shared in a statement its concerns with the appellate court's decision.\n\"The court's decision to uphold the permit allows (the Maryland Department of the Environment) to continue permitting land application of municipal wastewater on an ad hoc basis without an appropriate regulatory framework that assures a zero net discharge to reduce nutrient pollution to our waterways, as required by Maryland law,\" the foundation said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Marine fishery insider explains rockfish decision\n\n January 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 516\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Maryland officials are standing firm with Atlantic coast partners in their mission to rebuild striped bass (rockfish) populations by 2029 despite pushback from local fishing industry leaders over current restrictions.The Atlantic State Marine Fishery Commission voted Dec. 16 to maintain existing recreational fishing regulations for 2025, with only Maine and New Hampshire opposing.\n\"The stakes would be too high\" to abandon interstate cooperation, said Maryland Department of Natural Resources Associate Director Mark Luisi, responding to industry calls for Maryland to establish its own commission. The decision affects fishing limits across multiple states from Virginia to Delaware.\nLuisi, a native of south New Jersey, has been working at the governor's office for 25 years now, and is a board member on the ASMFC, sitting as the proxy on the administrative side under Lynn Waller Fegley, DNR director, Fishing and Boating Services.\nServing alongside Luisi, are governor appointee Russell Dize, a certified licensed captain from Tilghman, and Maryland Delegate Dana Stein and proxies David Sikorski, executive director of Coastal Conservation Association Maryland and Allison Colden, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\nCapt. Rob Newberry, chairman of the Atlantic Fishing Association, challenged the commission's data collection methods, particularly for recreational fishing. He praised Maryland's three-tier commercial tracking system but argued recreational catches lack similar oversight.\nHis emboldened message to the ASMFC was \"leave us alone,\" in hopes Maryland would establish their own fishery commission, breaking from the compact of Atlantic states formed in 1942 by Congress.\nNewberry was not satisfied with the decision from ASMFC, claiming they were kicking the \"can down the road,\" then called in question the reliability of their recording methods which will determine how many fish anglers catch in 2026.\nLuisi emphasized there are no plans for Maryland to abandon the ASMFC. He said the stakes would be too high, and too many states depend on the organization. What affects Virginia, for example also affects neighbors, Delaware and Maryland and so on.\nSo, since breaking from ASMFC is not an option, Luisi said he strives for accuracy and understanding, hearing concerns from stakeholders as they move to the goal of rebuilding the stock (Atlantic striped bass, or rockfish population) by 2029.\nLuisi defended the commission's approach, noting that rockfish's status as the East Coast's most popular sport fish — with over 200,000 recreational anglers — provides reliable data through dock surveys.\n\"It just provides an estimate,\" Luisi said, \"and I'm pretty confident of the numbers we get in rockfish.\"\nThe commission uses computer modeling similar to weather forecasting to predict mortality rates. Their latest assessment found waters \"slightly overfished,\" leading to last year's limit of one rockfish per person.\nAccording to Luisi, to control population levels, regulators can only:\nLimit or close seasons.\nSet size limits.\nControl the number of fish that can be kept.\n\"Outside of that, such as environmental factors affecting population, we can't control effort,\" Luisi concluded.\nDespite Newberry's claims, Luisi insisted these regulations are not there to hurt the fishing industry. On the contrary, the surveys encourage fishers to be \"right in the middle\" of the decision-making process.\nThe commission will decide on further action at their October meeting, following eight months of stakeholder discussions. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jay Jacobs (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) noted disappointment with DNR's recent response to the avian influenza and reiterated better communication is needed for concerned citizens to get help they need without a runaround.\nKurtz noted the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control was also following a similar model and the two states are now working to stay consistent in informing the public on available tools.\nKurtz noted additional DNR developments for the Eastern Shore, including working with Caroline County on a public lands bill to assist Program Open Space funding.\nFunds that come into DNR's \"user pay, user benefit,\" model go directly to programs to benefit the community, he said.\nDNR recently received one million dollars from the Middle Chesapeake Sentinel Landscape Resilience Project for easement purchases near Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and Fishing Bay, according to Kurtz.\nDNR also received a grant from the Environmental Protection Agency for $43 million to improve forest management on 1,000 acres of the Eastern Shore and help develop a regional forestry management plan, he said.\nTRANSPORTATIONFocusing on long term strategic planning to improve operating rail lines, the Maryland Department of Transportation is moving toward the establishment of a public-private partnership, according to Jaclyn Hartman, assistant secretary of transportation investments.\nThe Eastern Shore has a total of 92 miles of rail line, with 65 in active use. The rail lines are currently owned by the Maryland Transit Administration and operated by the Maryland and Delaware Railroad Company, Hartman said.\nWith the current operating lease is expiring, MDOT is thinking strategically about how to secure a long term operator and improve service delivery and maintenance on those routes.\nMoving to a public-private partnership will ensure one entity has authority, rather than it being split between the operator and the state. The partnership will instigate long-term plans for the rail lines, \"and unfortunately that's one of the things that we're kind of lacking today,\" Hartman said.\nFor the maintenance of the rails, MDOT would establish a private financing, expecting the private operator to invest some of its own money in the rail lines with the ability to keep those revenues in the future as a return on investment.\nMDOT considered the project a win-win opportunity that most closely resembled the successful Seagrit Marine Terminal public private partnership established in the Port of Baltimore in 2008, Hartman said.\nIn the next couple of months, MDOT will begin industry outreach and move forward on requests for proposals for the private operator.\nMARITIME MUSEUMPresenting an outline of program facilities preserving the cultural legacy of the state, Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum officials sought the Eastern Shore Delegation's help replacing aging HVAC systems in two buildings filled with irreplaceable artifacts.\nPete Lesher, chief historian for the museum, noted since 1965, CBMM has been dedicated to visitors and locals alike, preserving the environment and cultural heritage of the area as a tourism center, as well as a community museum.\nCBMM preserves 90,000 objects of historical significance and tell local stories of the Bay at its campus in St. Michaels.\nThe museum also serves as a key economic driver for the Eastern Shore, bringing in visitors and millions of dollars to the area, said Jeff Vogel, CBMM Government Relations Committee chair.\nRecognizing it was an exceedingly difficult budget season, Del. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) noted CBMM was more than a local asset, but a landmark of history for the state.\nTRAIL NETWORKSeeking to connect the area and strengthen community through the Maryland Eastern Shore Trail Network, Owen Bailey, director of land use and policy of the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy, and Patti Stevens, chair of the Worcester County Bike and Pedestrian Coalition, presented visions and goals to connect communities through a safe and sustainable trail network.\nThe mission of the Eastern Shore Trail Network Group is to galvanize a coalition of communities to support, plan, promote and advocate for diverse trail systems, Bailey said.\nSmaller municipalities in particular on the Eastern Shore wanted more trails but lacked capacity, expertise, and funding to plan, develop and design, according to Bailey.\nWhile the Eastern Shore represent 30% of the state's landmass and areas of recreation and economic development impact, it only included about 9.2% of the state's roads-separated trails, Stevens said.\nThis deficit came to light with updates to MDOT's five-year bike and pedestrian plan, according to Stevens.\nInteractive mapping across the state marked trails as green and while urban areas like Baltimore and Annapolis had so many green off-road trail markings \"it looked like plates of robust pesto spaghetti,\" Eastern Shore counties merely had \"little flecks of parsley,\" according to Stevens.\nTrails have benefits to economic development as well as to health, and as a safe transportation alternative, Stevens said.\nDel. Steve Arentz (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) said electric bicycles are good options for mobility but speed can be issues on trails and should be addressed. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Last year, the Town of Rock Hall began working with ShoreRivers, a nonprofit organization promoting healthy waterways.Last March, ShoreRivers submitted a grant to the Chesapeake Bay Trust to seek funding for concept-level designs for two community parks that when implemented, will control storm water, enhance community enjoyment, encourage habitat and biodiversity and reduce runoff in the Chester River and Bay. The effort would fuse community needs and environmental benefits, according to the press release from ShoreRivers.\nOver the summer, that grant was approved.\nIn November, Parks and Recreation members held a community visioning session, welcoming Chester RiverKeeper, Annie Richards and coworkers Katie Drummond, landscape architect and Community Restoration Coordinator Jennifer Klug Vaccaro.\nUsing technology and surveys, they engaged in a series of activities to draw input from residents pertaining to both Civic Center Park and the ball park.\nGoing through the presentation slides, Klug Vaccaro emphasized that although the grant is to focus on environmental factors, storm run-off and native species, it is also to create something pleasing for the public.\nKlug Vaccaro asked for input as to how many people in the community, drive as oppose to walking, what entrances are they more likely to use in the parks, what activities would they like to do there, and several other questions to gauge the level of activities at the parks, their impressions of the parks, and what they would like to see in the future.\nDog walking, shade trees, bocce ball and playground use were all popular answers from the community.\nResidents were afforded ample time to ask ShoreRivers questions, before the recreation commission commenced with other business.\nDrummond noted they will engage a smaller steering committee which will be a representative of the town to provide feedback to help them narrow down what they will present in June at a similar meeting.\nFor those not at the meeting, ShoreRivers left papers at the Rock Hall office to pick up, and is sharing the QR code to take the survey.\n\"You all have been good sports, this is great data for us, thank you,\" Richards said to attendees, for providing ShoreRivers' design team the initial building blocks for these public spaces.\n\"Nicely done, that was a great interactive presentation,\" Mayor James Cook added.\nTheir press release summed up ShoreRivers mission going forward: \"Throughout the course of 2025, ShoreRivers will look to design effective green stormwater practices to help alleviate nuisance flooding and bolster local resilience to climate impacts, while also providing essential and threatened habitat for migratory songbirds and native pollinator species.\"\n\"In addition to identifying stormwater projects and opportunities, ShoreRivers plans to incorporate passive and active recreational features into the park based on public feedback, and ultimately produce designs that authentically reflect the community's needs and desires.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Fifty years ago scientists theorized what rising levels might cause. They put ideas into models.Early models predicted temperatures would rise 0.2 to 0.5 degrees Celsius per decade. Other models predicted changes in weather conditions and ice melt.\nNow, after more than 40 years recording data, it is seen that neither the temperature rise nor the changes that were predicted have occurred. The latest IPCC report now says that the actual rise is 0.008 degrees per decade and that the contribution of carbon dioxide to the temperature is uncertain. The IPCC is now making significant changes to models.\nThe latest IPCC report also notes that plant life is spreading and crop yields improving. Slow incremental warming and more carbon dioxide are manageable and beneficial. The early hypotheses of threatening outcomes have been disproven. There is no doubt that human activity is changing the mix of matter in the atmosphere. It is also clear that earth systems are either unaffected by the change or benefitting from it.\nIt is time to end climate change funding and use the funds to address real problems.\nPAYNE KILBOURN\nNeavitt \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

ShoreRivers and fellow clean water advocates see 2025 as an opportunity to bolster Maryland's efforts to implement this new agreement by advocating for strong policies that protect our natural resources and local rivers.\nFindings from the Chesapeake Bay Program's CESR Report (A Comprehensive Evaluation of System Response) continue to influence ShoreRivers' priorities and complement the Bay agreement's vision for restoration goals for years to come.\nThese efforts are no small challenge, as fiscal pressures loom large this session due to a $2 billion-plus deficit facing the state coupled with current financial instability at the federal level. This pressure, combined with Maryland's focus and attention to meet renewable energy goals, means that ShoreRivers and our members will be working harder than ever to shine a spotlight on Eastern Shore water quality — and the policies we need to protect and restore our rivers.\nKey efforts this year include the following, though additional bills and legislation are likely to be added to this list as they are introduced and prove to be in line with ShoreRivers' mission of protecting Maryland's Eastern Shore waterways through science-based advocacy, restoration, education and engagement.\nThe Nearshore Farming and Finance Act (SB898/HB1175), a bill that will increase nutrient application setbacks and improve incentive programs for nearshore habitat restoration on agricultural operations within the critical area. This bill will also establish the state's first incentive payments for leased land agricultural operators.\nThe Maryland PFAS and sewage sludge bill (SB732/HB909), which will establish testing requirements to identify PFAS concentrations in biosolids and set enforceable limits to prevent further contamination, protecting Maryland's food and water sources and ensuring a healthier future for all.\nA bill to improve on–dite sewage disposal systems in climate vulnerable areas (HB671), which will limit septic siting within the 500-year floodplain, and ensure that low-income households have access to Bay Restoration Funding to make necessary improvements to failing or poor performing units in climate vulnerable areas.\nDefending important funding sources through budget advocacy will be another important priority for ShoreRivers this session. With conflicting pressures from the Bay Program's goals of accelerated restoration work and a budget deficit pressuring Maryland legislators and advocates to \"do more with less,\" ShoreRivers is committed to defending historically beneficial environmental funds such as the Bay Restoration Fund, the Coastal Trust Fund, the Chesapeake Bay Trust, State Aided institutions and Program Open Space, and funding appropriated through the Tree Solutions Now Act 2021.\nAt ShoreRivers, we engage in legislative advocacy because addressing non-point source pollution — or \"runoff pollution,\" the leading contributor of pollutants to our rivers — is often most effective by updating policies that address modern challenges and support restoration goals.\nBy combining locally driven restoration efforts with river-friendly policies, we are encouraging the behavioral changes needed to improve land use practices and better manage the landscapes responsible for nutrient and sediment runoff. ShoreRivers looks forward to a productive legislative session with members of the General Assembly and fellow environmental advocates.

Currently, the lab is working with the city on a flood mitigation project along the Choptank River.\nGetting to community engagement, Sieracki brought up what Horn Point already does to connect with the Cambridge and Dorchester County community. Along with the flood mitigation project, he mentioned the school's weekly Tuesday lab tours, its annual open house in October and the science talks it hosts. He also talked about student internships, K-12 programming and a summer camp the lab hosts called Toadfish Adventures.\nIn looking at where community engagement could expand, Sieracki brought up ideas of supporting local oyster aquaculture and expanding the number of internships and K-12 student programming available. He also mentioned workforce development.\n\"And I want to just challenge you to talk with us about new ideas or directions that we could go that would impact our town,\" he said to the commissioners at the meeting. \"I'm a citizen and resident of the City of Cambridge, so I'm interested in what happens here.\"\nAfter his presentation to the council, Commissioner Shay Lewis-Sisco talked about her experience working with Horn Point as a Dorchester County Public Schools employee. She said the district has a student apprenticing at Horn Point this year and she would love to expand those opportunities.\nCommissioner Brett Summers talked about an idea to promote tourism through oysters in a partnership with a variety of players, like Horn Point, ShoreRivers and the Richardson Maritime Museum.\n\"Perhaps creating some kind of destination where you get to enjoy oysters, learn about what Horn Point's doing and just the history of our area,\" he said.\nSummers said the city could help develop this potential \"oyster trail.\"\n\"And I'm interested,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Environmental nonprofits forging ahead despite federal funding uncertainty\n\n February 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 581\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Isabel Hardesty, executive director of ShoreRivers, said the days following the White House's freeze on federal grants and loans last month brought \"disarray\" and \"chaos.\"The freeze, enacted by President Donald Trump's budget office Jan. 27 via a memo calling for officials to bring federal spending more in line with \"the will of the American people,\" was rescinded two days later. But it left some local nonprofit organizations pausing on certain projects or without funds to run business as usual.\nAs Hardesty looks toward the next four years of the current administration, she says the uncertainty faced by nonprofits such as ShoreRivers will only persist.\n\"We don't have a lot of faith in this being the only attempt to renege this funding,\" Hardesty said.\nFor ShoreRivers, $2 million in federal funding for 2025 could potentially be impacted by any freezes in the future, over a quarter of its total budget. Nearly $270,000 of this year's budget is currently affected, according to ShoreRivers.\nMost of the money passes through ShoreRivers and goes to local companies and businesses. Those small businesses or groups are often the ones completing projects, such as stormwater improvements, wetlands restoration and educational programs.\n\"Where it gets tricky is where we have funding from federal sources, and we have subcontracted with construction companies or other design teams, and they are working on projects on the ground,\" Hardesty said. \"We're having to think ahead. If we have access to the federal funding now, can we go forward with this one phase?\"\nEastern Shore Land Conservancy President and CEO Steve Kline says millions of dollars would be in flux if the administration enacts future holds on federal funding. Despite what some may think, Kline says ESLC stewards its dollars diligently.\n\"These dollars are not being wasted,\" Kline said. \"They are going, in nearly every case, to local small businesses that are moving dirt. They are doing real benefit for the natural resources that we all appreciate.\"\nThe conservancy sent stop work orders to small businesses in the days after the initial pause. In a newsletter to the community, Kline explained that projects such as conservation easements were temporarily paused.\nThose pauses affected the everyday construction worker or equipment operator, Kline and Hardesty both say. In an email newsletter, Kline emphasized that those community members may think twice before spending their hard-earned money. ShoreRivers' Hardesty echoed the same sentiment.\n\"That's the biggest message that we're trying to get to people,\" Hardesty said.\nSince most grant programs are reimbursement-based, Kline said Eastern Shore Land Conservancy is constantly considering its own financial sustainability. If the nonprofit pays a contractor to carry out work for a project, it may take some time before the grant money is reimbursed.\n\"You're carrying some cash exposure in the meantime,\" Kline said, \"even when they work well.\"\nHe said that cash exposure only worsens as concerns grow over whether reimbursements will continue to operate in a smooth manner.\nHowever, amid the widespread concern nonprofits are experiencing, Kline said work isn't stopping at the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy. Community support is critical and Kline's team is keeping \"a laser focus on the books.\"\n\"In terms of keeping the lights on and the staff working, that's something we really depend on our individual donors for in the community,\" Kline said. \"We try not to depend on grants for staff time. And as a result, we have a pretty lean, nimble staff. There's not a lot of bloat in our staff.\"\n\"We're going to continue this work no matter how high the tide gets,\" Kline said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Craving more energy, Maryland looks to nuclear power\n\n February 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RACHEL MCCREA Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 933\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — In a legislative session dominated by energy issues, some state leaders are exploring the idea of more nuclear energy as an option for power generation in Maryland.Bills introduced by Gov. Wes Moore and Democratic leadership would open the door to building new nuclear energy projects in Maryland. The governor's bill would also count nuclear energy towards the state's clean energy goals.\n\"To address resource adequacy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, I think there's a large number of people who say we should pursue this as aggressively as we can,\" said Paul Pinsky, director of the Maryland Energy Administration.\nThe state's clean energy goals and worries about having enough power are putting pressure on lawmakers to consider building more nuclear. Maryland already has one nuclear power plant, which provides about 40% of all energy produced in the state.\nBoth the ENERGIZE Maryland Act and the Next Generation Energy Act would create a procurement process for new nuclear projects. The ENERGIZE Act is being sponsored by state leaders in the House and Senate at the governor's request, and the Next Generation Energy Act is part of an energy package introduced by Maryland General Assembly leadership.\n\"Alongside the state legislature and other stakeholders, the Moore-Miller Administration is continuing to explore all available options, including nuclear energy, to help meet Maryland's environmental and clean energy goals,\" the governor's office said in an emailed statement. \"The governor understands the need for sustainable and cost-effective infrastructure to ensure the reliability of our grid and build the economy of the future in our state, which is why this session he has introduced the ENERGIZE Act, to help create more in-state clean energy generation, invest in Maryland's workforce, and help Maryland ratepayers.\"\nThe ENERGIZE Act would also classify nuclear as clean energy. It may not be a renewable source of energy, Pinsky said, but nuclear doesn't emit greenhouse gases, and the bill would count it towards the state's clean energy goals.\n\"I think if you're looking for affordable and reliable and clean energy, nuclear does check those three boxes,\" said House Minority Whip Del. Jesse Pippy (R- Frederick).\nDel. Chao Wu (D-Howard, Montgomery) is a co-sponsor of the ENERGIZE Act and supports nuclear as a source of clean, affordable energy.\n\"I think by managing nuclear power safely, we can offer a better future for our residents,'\" Wu said.\nNot everyone is supportive of new nuclear energy in the state.\n\"Maryland should be alarmed that state leaders want to build out these astronomically expensive and dangerous nuclear plants in Maryland to meet the state's energy needs,\" said Jorge Aguilar, the southern region director for the nonprofit Food & Water Watch.\nThese plants would be expensive to build and produce hazardous nuclear waste, he said. He thinks Maryland should be pushing the grid operator to approve renewable energy projects faster.\n\"I think Maryland leaders really need to double down on truly clean energy, like wind and solar, as well as batteries,\" he said. \"Not nuclear.\"\nWu says that the state has been safely managing its nuclear energy for decades.\n\"We have nuclear power in Maryland already,\" he said. \"It's not that we're doing something new.\"\nDel. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) said that new nuclear power may be built in Maryland if these bills pass. She's uncertain when any new projects would be built, though, because modern nuclear technologies are still too new.\n\"I think at some point it will probably be available, and if we pass these bills, I suspect it will get built here at some point,\" she said.\nCharkoudian supports other bills about long-term energy planning and analysis to get a better idea of when new nuclear installations could be up and running.\nNew nuclear technologies include small modular reactors, or SMRs. They're supposed to be quicker to build and take up less space, Pinsky said, though none are operating in the United States yet.\nCharkoudian is sponsoring the Abundant, Affordable Clean Energy Act, which focuses on building quickly deployable energy projects like battery storage and solar. It also supports relicensing the state's nuclear plant.\n\"It is clear to me that we need to keep our current nuclear plants running and relicensed,\" she said.\nResource adequacy — making sure energy supply matches demand — has been part of this push to explore nuclear.\nThe grid operator, PJM, \"has made a whole lot of mistakes,\" said Sen. Jim Rosapepe (D-Prince George's, Anne Arundel), leading to high rates and worries about energy reliability.\nHe's co-sponsoring the Decarbonization Infrastructure Solutions Act that would classify nuclear as renewable energy and set up a procurement process.\n\"Nuclear is not the solution. Nuclear is potentially a part of the solution,\" he said, one of many options for the state to consider.\nHigh energy prices have led lawmakers to consider more nuclear energy, said Adam Dubitsky, the consulting state director of the Maryland Land & Liberty Coalition. He supports relicensing the nuclear power plant in Calvert County and exploring new nuclear development in the state.\n\"It's really only been over the last couple of months in Maryland that families and businesses have seen their electric bills go through the roof. As a result, politicians are scrambling to find a solution,\" he said.\nPippy said that recent state energy policy is at fault because its emphasis on environmental goals caused energy producers to leave Maryland. Maryland's current energy situation represents \"self-inflicted wounds,\" he said, and he hasn't heard of any proposed short-term solutions.\n\"I think Marylanders are at a point where they're fed up,\" Pippy said. \"They expect their government to assist them in providing affordable and reliable energy.\"\n\"When you consider nuclear, the fact that it is reliable, affordable, and clean energy … I think that's certainly something that we should look at,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "ESLC talks land values at Dorchester County Council meeting\n\n February 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 608\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — When it comes to acreage and land value, Dorchester County is expected to be one of the most affected counties by sea level rise and storm surge in the year 2100, according to the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy.During a Dorchester County Council meeting Feb. 18, Eastern Shore Land Conservancy Land Use and Policy Director Owen Bailey presented data on land value throughout the Eastern Shore. Bailey said the data was acquired with the help of Urban3.\nThe land trust estimates that an average of three feet of sea level rise in 2100 would mean the loss of 270,000 acres of the Eastern Shore and $2 billion in property tax values.\n\"And then when you add in storm surge, then that really puts into perspective the financial distress that our communities are going to face in the future with the loss of properties and property tax revenues,\" Bailey said.\nAfter Bailey showed a map that accounted for storm surge in 2100, County Council President Lenny Pfeffer pointed out that more than half of Dorchester County's land is projected to be gone.\nBailey said Cambridge alone is projected to lose 280 acres and $63 million in value by 2100.\nThroughout his presentation, Bailey advocated for concentrated development on the Shore to increase property value. At the same time, he spoke about the importance of maintaining the value that could be loss to sea level rise.\nBailey said the efficiency of land use can be measured by looking at value per acre.\n\"You take the appraised value of each parcel and you divide it by how many acres it sits on,\" he said.\nWhen the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy applied this to the Eastern Shore, it noticed historic downtowns are \"much more productive than the more suburban, car-focused development\" that has been popular since the 1950s. This means that those downtowns, which often are more vulnerable to sea level rise, bring in more property tax revenue per acre than more sprawling areas of the Eastern Shore.\nBailey said that before the Bay Bridge was built in 1952, only 10,000 acres of land — valued at approximately $560,000 per acre — had been developed on the Shore. An additional 163,000 has been developed at less than half of that value since.\nWith the additional developed land, there has been a need for more sprawling infrastructure, he said.\n\"So we've built all this infrastructure,\" Bailey said. \"But we haven't really built the value to help us with the maintenance of that infrastructure, which is why a lot of our jurisdictions, pretty much all of our jurisdictions, are struggling with how to keep up with that kind of maintenance.\"\nBailey said many historic communities on the Shore, which bring more value per acre, are built on waterfronts, meaning sea level rise will most likely affect them.\n\"So we're encouraging every town to think about how are you going to account for that,\" he said. \"How can you either move that property, protect it or replace that value somewhere else in our community?\"\nAlong with concentrating development, Bailey recommended the county look at zoning restricting the county from allowing value to grow.\n\"This is something we're encouraging every jurisdiction to take a look at,\" he said. \"It's not our job to tell you what to do. We just want to provide the data and perspective. ... Use your land wisely.\"\nAt the end of the presentation Dorchester County Council Vice President Mike Detmer asked if the land trust had any recommendations specific to Dorchester County zoning ordinances.\nBailey said they have been focusing on municipalities, looking at zoning in historic districts.\n\"And how can we ease up on that zoning just to allow that historic pattern to continue,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Of the 4.4 acres of woodlands, the applicant will clear 2.3 acres and authorization has been received from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to disturb one bald eagle nest located within the on-site forest wetland to be removed, he said.\nAnd the Maryland Department of the Environment has authorized the disturbance of a non-tidal wetland and its buffer, Johnson said.\nA 30-foot wide, seven foot tall berm will be planted along the perimeter of the expansion area with loblolly or white pines and eastern red cedar trees, he said.\nAs the project's stream disturbance falls within drainage to Long Marsh and Mason Branch known to support several endangered mussels, the applicant must adhere to all best management practices for sediment and erosion control and avoid altering hydrology in the area, as stated by the Maryland Department Natural Resources, according to Johnson.\nAn annual compliance inspection in November found no violations with the current operation and environmental health has approved the expansion, Johnson said.\nThe applicant anticipates approximately 13.2 million cubic yards of material would be removed by the operation in 47 years, equating to an annual removal rate of about 277,000 cubic yards. The finished depth of the mine is expected to be 50 to 55 feet, he said.\nUpon the completion of the operation, four ponds will remain with locations for two future residences, Johnson said.\nThe project's history has been underway since 2015 and Charles Schaller with Baker Donelson on behalf of Bridgetown Development Company noted the expansion is simply a continuation with no changes proposed.\nPlanning Commission Chair Sharon Dobson noted the mine has been a well maintained project for removing materials. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Future generations will be unable to admire the beauty of rural areas because they will be destroyed. I have lost faith in the mayor, the Town Council, and the County Council. It is almost as if they are failing in their part of working for the community, making them not earn my vote for the next election year. They care more about the opinions of people who have decided to move here after only visiting once or twice a year rather than people who have lived here their entire lives, going back generations.\nThey could learn from the Eastern Shore Land Conservatory, Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation and the Town of Oxford. As a rural community, we must protect farmland, wildlife, wetlands, trees, etc.\nIt should be a law that any farmland put up for sale should be bought by farmers, not by developers who want to ruin it. Or use the Farmland Protection Policy Act, a law created to protect farmland from non-agricultural uses. The last thing the Eastern Shore needs is another development meant to destroy the rural beauty, environment and small-town charm.\nThe building of developments can wreak havoc on the environment by causing habitat loss, pollution, resource depletion and water quality issues. Many people in rural communities depend on the environment for their jobs, such as watermen, farmers, hunters, etc. Besides ruining the rural landscape and environment, the influx of city people will cause traffic issues and increase living costs in a small town.\nI hate seeing a new development being built because it means this rural and beautiful part of the Eastern Shore will be gone forever and never return. Sometimes, I wonder if the town I grew up in will be here for future generations. With all the city people coming in and making unnecessary changes, will Easton still be the small town I grew up with? Because if it's not, I don't want to live in it. And it would break my heart to say goodbye to my home. Forever.\nLILLI TIBBITT\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Mary Beth Carozza (R-Somerset, Worcester, Wicomico), who is sponsoring the legislation along with Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard, Montgomery) and Sen. Mike McKay (R-Garrett, Allegany, Washington), said she is excited about the bill.\n\"This plan will contribute to bat conservation efforts, but at the same time doesn't prohibit the other activities in the forest,\" she said.\nHill said under federal law, incidental takings of endangered species are legal with a habitat conservation plan. She said although the likelihood of a forest-harvesting, or tree-cutting, operation harming a bat is very unlikely, the issue needs to be addressed.\n\"We harvest less than one percent of our forest land in Maryland every year,\" she said. \"But we still need to address the likelihood that there could be a bat in the area.\"\nThe bats species listed in the legislation include the Indiana bat, the tricolored bat and the northern long-eared bat.\nHill said these bats are known to exist in every county in the state. In Dorchester County, the northern long-eared bat and the tricolored bat are found at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.\nAll three of the bat species have experienced declines in population due to white-nose syndrome, which is a deadly disease that affects birds across the continent, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Indiana bat and northern long-eared bat are considered endangered species by the federal government. A proposal was announced by the Fish and Wildlife Service in 2022 to list the tricolored bat as endangered.\nThe proposed bill essentially adds these species to a list so that habitat conservation plans can be established for the bats and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources can issue incidental take permits. A hearing for the cross-filed bill in the House of Delegates, House Bill 894, was held Wednesday. A hearing is scheduled in the Senate March 4.\nAt a Dorchester County Council meeting Feb. 18, the council voted in favor of sending a letter of support for the bill.\n\"This is really something that could have a big impact, particularly on our local forestry industry,\" Council Vice President Mike Detmer said.\nCarozza said that on the Eastern Shore, the forest industry is often less discussed than the farming and fishing industries. She said although a very small amount of Maryland's forests are harvested every year, the industry has an economic impact of $3.3. billion and supports close to 13,000 jobs in the state.\nHill said the Maryland Forests Association — which advocates for forest, wildlife and natural resource management — believes in forest conservation. She said forest management plans in the state, which include harvesting, often have to do with wildlife and habitat improvement projects.\nCarozza said it is \"significant\" that this bill has such \"broad support\" across Maryland.\n\"To me, what is really key, and what I think will help ensure passage, is that you have the Maryland Department of Natural Resources,\" she said.\nWhile the Department of Natural Resources is in support of the bill, it would like another bat species, the small-footed bat, to be added. Gregg Bortz, who is with the department, said the small-footed bat is considered endangered in Maryland, but not by the federal government.\nHill said the Maryland Forests Association is behind the Department of Natural Resources' request for the addition of the small-footed bat to the legislation.\n\"We want to do the best we can to help this species rebound and continue to have a good plan to keep our forests healthy and vibrant,\" she said. \"We stand ready to work with DNR on a plan for all that.\"\nThis article has been updated to correct a description of federal policy surrounding incidental takings. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Scarcity v. abundance at the Talbot County Free Library\n\n February 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Life \n \n 1012\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When I set out to write about a little boy growing up in a monastery in the seventh century and the friendship he forms with a hermit who lives on a nearby mountain, I read all the books I could find on monastic life and the so-called \"Dark Ages,\" and I went on retreat as often as possible at a Cistercian abbey in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. But I still wanted to know more.So, telling myself it would give me a better feel for what it would be like to live in a monastery that kept the silence (and that it would also be a lot of fun), I decided to hike up into the Blue Ridge Mountains and spend a three-day weekend camping alone on the slopes overlooking the Shenandoah River.\nClimbing into the Blue Ridge that day, so many years ago now, I began to hear a strange popping noise in the trees around me, as if a gentle rain were falling down through the woods. But there was no rain, the sky overhead was clear and blue.\nIt took me a while to work out what the sound was. Eventually, I realized it was frass, the excreta of caterpillars. The entire mountainside had been invaded by Gypsy moths, millions upon millions of them.\nFrass consists of dry, harmless pellets, no real bother to me, and all the caterpillars meant the trees were full of birds. So I hiked on, enjoying the birdsong.\nThat was probably the only time in my adult life that I have gone three whole days without speaking aloud once. I remember I even tried to silence my mind, put a stop to the ceaseless interior blather that we tell ourselves is thinking but in my case often seems to be little more than passing, inconsequential billboards.\nIt was an interesting experience, and I think it helped me write the book.\nWhen, some 10 years later, I finally placed the last period at the end of the last sentence in \"The Oblate's Confession,\" I found myself thinking there ought to be a way to mark such a milestone. So I decided to hike back up into the Blue Ridge to see if I could find my old campsite.\nAnd I did, but the place had undergone a complete change.\nThe Gypsy moths were gone, but the damage they had done was clear. As far as the eye could see, not a single oak or walnut remained alive, and most were no longer standing. Light now flooded the mountainside, and the dense forest I had known had been replaced by an airy wood of serviceberry, not a single tree more than twenty feet tall. But that's tall for serviceberries, which out here on the Eastern Shore are usually called shadbush, with the emphasis on the second syllable.\nI knew about serviceberry, had planted a couple in my backyard to attract birds, but I had never seen any like these before. Each was as tall and as healthy-looking as a mature dogwood, and they were all loaded with ripe, delicious fruit. It seemed a second Eden.\nWhich, interestingly, is sort of the point of Robin Wall Kimmerer's new book, \"The Serviceberry.\" Of course, I checked the thing out thinking it would be a natural history of the tree, and there is some natural history in the book, but it mostly ends up being about, of all things, economics.\nBefore you turn to the opposite page hoping to find an article about something more appealing, let me add that Kimmerer is interested in the contrast between the economics we were taught in school and the economics of nature.\nSchool taught us that competition is the driver of a healthy economy. Similarly (and not surprisingly considering the way one school of thought tends to influence another), the traditional view of nature has been that competition drives evolution. By this way of thinking, survival of the fittest explains both humanity's rise to global dominance and Elon Musk's.\nBut Kimmerer points out that new research in both biology and economics is finding that competition drives success only when the unit being measured is the individual. She writes, \"When the focus shifts to the level of a group, cooperation is a better model, not only for surviving but for thriving.\"\nA Distinguished Professor of Environmental Biology at SUNY and an enrolled member of the Potawatomi tribe, Kimmerer sees in my experience with the serviceberries on that mountainside all those years ago an example of what she calls a \"gift economy.\" Instead of looking upon resources like water, land and minerals as commodities, her people survived for millennia by seeing them as gifts to be shared.\nShe quotes a South American hunter-gatherer who, when asked why he didn't store the surplus from his hunt instead of giving it away at a village feast, replied, \"I store my meat in the belly of my brother.\"\nKimmerer believes the difference between a gift economy and our market economy is the latter \"incentivizes scarcity.\" In a market economy, she says, when a resource becomes scarce, the wise investor buys up access to that resource and then doles it out to the public at a profit. What had been a shared resource — say open range or timber — becomes a commodity. The individual benefits at the community's expense.\nAt a time when humanity's acquisitive, extractive nature seems to be in danger of chewing up every last morsel of food, fuel, and land left on the planet, I found Kimmerer's notion of a gift economy appealing. But is it also achievable? In a country that was founded on private property rights, is it possible to reset the template, to change from a land of individuals to one of community?\nOf course in some areas of modern life such a shift wouldn't be necessary. The perfectly human instinct to share remains alive and well in modern institutions like food banks, Toys for Tots, and Habitat for Humanity. Indeed, I was able to read Kimmerer's book and consider its thesis thanks to one of the greatest proofs of our culture's surviving desire to share: our local public library. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Striped bass restrictions head to Supreme Court\n\n March 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: HANNAH COMBS hcombs@kibaytimes.com | Section: Local News \n \n 911\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — A coalition of Maryland fishing associations and charter boat operators have escalated their legal battle against new striped bass fishing restrictions, filing an emergency petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to block the regulations. Captain Robert Newberry, chairman of Delmarva Fisheries Association stated, \"We will take this case to the highest court until this matter is resolved — it is far from over.\"The Delmarva Fisheries Association and the Maryland Charter Boat Association, along with two individual commercial fishermen, argue that the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's (the Commission) recent measures impose \"drastic, unwarranted, and illegal limitations\" on striped bass fishing in the Chesapeake Bay and along the Atlantic coast. The petition, filed March 4, claims the restrictions violate the U.S. Constitution and could jeopardize the livelihoods of many small businesses.\nThe case follows months of legal disputes in lower courts, where the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to halt the Commission's 2024 striped bass management plan, known as Addendum II. The plan, approved in January by a 14-2 vote, reduced commercial quotas, shortened fishing seasons, and limited recreational anglers to catching just one striped bass per day instead of two.\nMaryland and New Jersey voted against the measure, but Maryland ultimately implemented the restrictions under pressure from the Commission and federal agencies. The Maryland Attorney General's Office acknowledged in a letter that failing to comply could trigger a federal moratorium on all striped bass fishing in state waters.\nWhen confronted with having to cut the catch limitation in half, Assistant Director and Fisheries Manager at the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and proxy to the Marine Fisheries Commission Michael Luisi, warned the Commission that limiting Maryland's charter boat clients' catch to one fish a day \"will put people out of business.\"\nDocuments filed with the court by the plaintiffs state Luisi was \"pointedly correct in this assessment but the ASMFC and its federal and other illegally voting partners as well as other member states, including Maryland at that point, decided that its guesstimate on fish-spawning futures five years into the future was more important than the impending demise of these family-run, small businesses.\"\nNewberry said, it is was \"extremely perturbing that Governor Moore and Attorney General Anthony Brown turned their backs on us in the seafood industry in Maryland and also all of us here on the Eastern Shore.\" Moore never weighed in on this constitutional issue affecting those in the seafood industry, but will \"spend millions of taxpayers dollars defending the citizens of Maryland against the so-called constitutional violations of President Trump,\" Newberry said. \"We have not only been left behind, we have tire tracks on our backs from where we have been run over, and left behind.\"\n\"The economic damage is undeniable,\" said Brian Hardman, president of the Maryland Charter Boat Association. \"We've seen a 75-85% decline in business, boats being sold off, and captains leaving the industry. The Commission rushed through regulations without considering the devastating impact on local livelihoods.\"\nHardman continued, \"...the 2025 numbers are continuing to be off by the same ratios or worse; that an unprecedented 53 charter boats have been sold or listed for sale since 2024; and, that 43 \"for hire\" Charter Boat businesses have already been forced to close their doors with another 11 companies losing money at a rate that will soon bring about the same result.\"\nThe legal challenge focuses on alleged constitutional violations, including the 10th Amendment's prohibition on federal overreach, the 5th Amendment's protection against government takings without just compensation, and the 14th Amendment's due process clause. The plaintiffs also argue that the Commission, originally established as an advisory body, has unlawfully assumed regulatory powers without proper state and federal oversight.\nDespite warnings from industry representatives that the new rules would cripple the state's fishing economy, the Commission stood by its decision, citing concerns about overfishing and the need to rebuild the striped bass population by 2029. However, critics claim the commission relied on faulty data, pointing out that the agency's own projections have fluctuated — from a 97% chance of population recovery in 2023 to just 15% in 2024, before rebounding to 50% in 2025.\nIn a statement, the Commission defended its methodology, emphasizing that conservation measures are necessary to prevent further declines in the striped bass stock.\n\"The science may be imperfect, but the consequences of inaction could be severe,\" said a Commission spokesperson. \"We understand the economic hardship this creates, but the long-term health of the fishery must come first.\"\nYet the plaintiffs stated, there are in excess of 240 million striped bass in U.S. waters and the annual number of fishing removals is approximately six million.\nThe Supreme Court previously declined to hear an emergency appeal in May, citing a lack of prior appellate review. The plaintiffs now return to the high court after exhausting their legal options in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which ruled in February that the lawsuit should be dismissed because the plaintiffs had sued the Commission rather than the state of Maryland.\nWith the 2025 fishing season set to begin in May, the petitioners are urging the Supreme Court to issue an injunction that would restore previous fishing limits while the legal battle plays out. Without relief, they warn that more charter businesses will shut down, further damaging Maryland's historic fishing industry.\n\"The Supreme Court is our last hope,\" Hardman said. \"We're not asking for special treatment—just the right to keep our businesses afloat.\"\nA decision on the emergency petition filed March 4, could come within weeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Environmental leaders warn Oxford Conservation Park, other projects at risk amid potential state cuts\n\n March 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 457\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Proposed budget cuts by the state could significantly endanger the work done for park maintenance and improvements projects, conservation experts warn.The Eastern Shore Land Conservancy says potential cuts to Maryland's Program Open Space and the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Trust Fund could devastate projects such as Oxford Conservation Park, which is undergoing a 30-acre expansion.\nLarisa Prezioso, the conservancy's enhanced stewardship manager, said Oxford park improvements are at a \"critical point.\"\n\"If you don't intervene now, this is going to be a much more expensive and labor-intensive project down the road,\" Prezioso said.\n\"We can make the new portion of park,\" she added, \"but I think some of the maintenance concerns of the existing park area might suffer from not having additional financial support.\"\nThe calls to protect Program Open Space and other land conservation programs have come from many local organizations, including ESLC and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\nAdvocacy has peaked as the state's Department of Legislative Services recommended cutting funds for land preservation to help offset the state's nearly $3 billion deficit this fiscal year.\n\"There are many ways to modify the transfer tax formula to offset general fund expenditures,\" a budget analysis to the Department of Natural Resources reads. \"Perhaps the most straightforward way is to eliminate, for fiscal 2026 through 2029, the funding allocated for land preservation.\"\nOwen Bailey, director of land use and policy for the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy, said the recommended cuts \"floored\" the organization.\n\"It's sort of fighting for the survival of this type of industry,\" Bailey said of their advocacy. \"Maryland's been a leader in the United States for conservation and for developing parks and open spaces, and there's a whole industry that's sort of grown up around this.\"\nFunding for Program Open Space and the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Trust Fund largely comes from the transfer tax and gas and car rental fee taxes, respectively.\nBailey says it feels like the state would be breaking its promise — a promise to offset those industries with funding for open space and conservation — if it were to accept these recommendations.\n\"There's value in these programs, value that sometimes is hard to calculate,\" Bailey said. \"It's sometimes hard to get across in a budget hearing. But there's still value.\"\nOxford Conservation Park was a community-led effort to transform old farmland into a habitat for wildlife with trails for residents to enjoy. As expansion and improvement efforts continue during uncertain budgetary times, Bailey and Prezioso worry for what else may be negatively impacted by state cuts.\nBailey said one would be \"hard pressed\" to find a park or playground in Maryland without a sign noting it received funding from Program Open Space.\n\"These cuts mean that the next Oxford Park project won't happen,\" Bailey said.\nThis story has been updated. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I am writing to you in order to highlight the extensive problem of litter and plastic pollution on the Eastern Shore and to offer a solution.Of the 5.5 billion beverage containers (metal, glass and plastic) sold each year in Maryland, more than 4 billion are left in the environment, along roadsides, in waterways, on our beaches. Plastic beverage containers break up into smaller pieces that pose health risks to marine life and land animals, as well as humans.\nThe passage of the Maryland Bottle Bill (HB 232/SB 364) which is now before the Maryland General Assembly would go a long way toward decreasing the littering of these beverage containers. A small deposit would be added to the price of beverages and would be refunded when the containers are returned. Think of it as purchasing the beverage and renting the containers. Bottles bills already exist in 10 states and have proven to be highly effective. When containers can be redeemed for cash, fewer are littered or likely to remain littered.\nWe need Maryland residents to help get this bill passed into law by contacting their Maryland state senators, state delegates, and Gov. Moore and requesting their support. Find your representatives using this link and then click on \"lookup\": mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/members/district.\nPlease voice your support now. Each year passage of this bill is delayed, another 4 billion beverage containers will be left to spoil our otherwise beautiful Maryland environment.\nCINDY DILLON\nOcean Pines \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It will also provide nitrogen for the soil and promote the return of some native plant species, including wildflowers, members of The Nature Conservancy said.\n\"This will work out great,\" Deborah Landau, director of ecological management at the conservancy, said before two concurrent burns took place. \"A controlled burn is when we're bringing fire back to the landscape.\"\nA controlled burn was conducted in Nanjemoy last year, but the process can be a bit complicated to get off the ground as there is a written, specified prescription for the land where strict conditions must be met.\n\"For myself, really I just try to focus and pay attention to the lead of the team,\" Risharda Harley, one of the members in charge of ignitions that day from the Accokeek Foundation, said. \"As I'm in there working, I try to take time to not have my head down and appreciate what's going on.\"\nMicah Selengut, another igniter, said that he takes careful attention to look out for his team members and potential hazards.\n\"We're here to bring back fire to the land, which hasn't had fire in a really long time. It's a huge deal,\" Selengut said.\nGabe Cahalan, one of the chiefs in charge of the burn, said that usually smaller trees get killed and the mid-story of the forestry will be thinned.\n\"Thick bark trees are pretty fire resistant,\" Cahalan said, addressing a group and answering their questions Monday morning. \"Invasives can come back. … We do get a flush of wildflowers sometimes.\"\nFire increases a forest's biodiversity, making it more resilient. When a stand of trees includes many different species rather than a few, they are less likely to be wiped out by threats like pests or disease, according to the conservancy.\nCrews from different organizations fly in from all over the country to participate in the burns, with some coming from North Carolina, Louisiana and as far as California.\nBefore any burning was done, crews swept parts of the forest floor with leaf blowers to help keep the burn from going out of control.\nA test burn was conducted around 11:30 a.m., and when the conditions looked desirable, the real burn began.\nWorking along Port Tobacco Road directly outside the Nanjemoy Volunteer Fire Station, the crew worked its way to the intersection of Beaver Dam Road where they essentially burned a triangle between the two roads, carefully avoiding residences nearby.\nAny hazards were quickly addressed by crews and a high-pressure hose.\nNow, it's a waiting game to see what will spring from the ash. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The rest of these containers unfortunately end up in landfills, incinerators, or, worst of all, along our roads and eventually in our waterways. Plastic breaks down into micro and nano-plastics that have unknown effects on humans and other species.\nThe Maryland Bottle Bill (HB 232/SB 364) would set up a deposit program where customers would pay a small deposit when they purchase a beverage, which would be refunded when the container was returned.\nBottle bill programs have been shown in other states to increase recycling rates up to 90%. This means reducing the need to manufacture virgin plastic, glass, and aluminum, all of which use energy and cause pollution.\nPlease let your state senator and delegate know that you support this bill. In my case, I will be contacting Sen. Johnny Mautz and Del. Tom Hutchinson.\nELAINE TAMA\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Advocates urge Congress to keep funding Chesapeake Bay cleanup\n\n March 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WHITNEY PIPKIN Chesapeake Bay Journal | Section: News \n \n 1315\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON, D.C. — The director of the Choose Clean Water Coalition began the group's lobbying day luncheon in Washington, DC, by asking how many members had been affected by federal funding freezes and cuts so far this year. Almost half of the people in the room raised a hand.The coalition, representing more than 300 organizations that work on clean water in the Chesapeake Bay region, goes to Capitol Hill annually to urge lawmakers to keep funding the Bay's cleanup.\n\"But this year … is different,\" the coalition's director Kristin Reilly said to invited legislators, their staff and nearly 100 advocates at a luncheon in a legislative office building on March 5. \"This year, we're not just here to advocate for future funding. We are, for the first time ever, also here to advocate for current funding — funding that has already been appropriated.\"\nThe Trump administration has frozen the release of hundreds of millions of dollars of funding that had been previously appropriated for environmental work in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Funding for a handful of those programs has since been restored, while others appear to have been permanently defunded.\nBut many more funding sources remain in limbo, with nonprofits waiting for a memo to update them after being told that their funding was \"under review.\"\nPresident Donald Trump's executive orders have expressly directed federal staff to curtail funding and programs supporting certain DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) and climate initiatives. But the funding cuts are also reaching other areas, including programs that benefit wildlife habitat, reducing flooding and help farmers pay for costly water quality improvements on their land.\nOne of the president's orders specifically targeted the disbursement of funds appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022. The act included an additional $19.5 billion to help farmers improve soil health, reduce runoff into waterways and complete energy projects. Nonprofits that assist with these programs report interruptions of longstanding grants they've received from the U.S. Department of Agriculture or other federal agencies, many of which were then supplemented with IRA funds.\nOther programs have been terminated, according to memos received by grant recipients. The U.S. Forest Service canceled a $75 million grant to the Arbor Day Foundation to support a Community Roots program focused on planting trees in urban areas. The Rappahannock Tribe and the nonprofit Friends of the Rappahannock were scheduled to receive $300,000 from that grant to pay for forest management and conservation job training on the tribe's ancestral lands on Virginia's Northern Neck.\n\"We had fully secured contracts, and we had already started doing some work,\" said Bryan Hoffman, deputy director of the Friends of the Rappahannock. \"We are going to get reimbursed for most of what we spent up until Feb. 21, but this was supposed to be a three-year agreement.\"\nHoffman said the friends group has seen another $1.5 million frozen from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, money that was headed to a group of nonprofits helping farmers implement pollution-reduction practices on their land.\nTwo environmental justice-related programs within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have been terminated, grant recipients report. But grantees receiving funds through the EPA's Environmental Justice Problem Solving Cooperative Agreement were notified in late February that their program was reopened, according to Choose Clean Water.\nIt's still unclear how many federal employees working for agencies such as the National Park Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association in the Chesapeake watershed have been affected by probationary firings. The firings impacted not only new employees but also some with decades of experience who were considered probationary because they had been recently promoted to new positions. Others may have left their jobs in response to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management's \"fork in the road\" buy-out offer.\nChoose Clean Water and other nonprofits are cobbling together anecdotes and numbers from peers they've worked with in the field — and members of Congress seem to be, too. Speaking at the coalition's luncheon on March 5, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) asked nonprofits and state agencies whose federal funds have been frozen or who have lost contact with agency staff to continue reaching out to his office. He contended that both the grant freezes and the firings were unlawful.\n\"When Congress on a bipartisan basis passes a law that allocates funding to important funding purposes, presidents … don't get to pick and choose which funds they release and which they don't,\" Van Hollen said to the group.\nThe next day, March 6, a federal judge in Rhode Island ruled to extend an existing court's block on the Trump administration's attempt to freeze payments for federal grants and other congressionally approved government programs. It's not clear exactly how or when such efforts would result in the flow of funds being restored. Other lawsuits contending that even probationary federal employees cannot be fired without cause have also gotten traction.\nEven if the majority of frozen funds are eventually disbursed, advocates say damage has already been done to organizations' relationships with local farmers, tribal members and private landowners who make the clean water work possible.\n\"To have this happen is so devastating for those relationships that have taken years to cultivate,\" Reilly said. \"I'm extremely concerned about the long-term impacts [that the funding freezes] will have.\"\nReilly and other advocates also have to focus on future funding appropriations. Among their requests to lawmakers during the lobbying day was that the EPA's Chesapeake Bay Program office continue to receive an annual appropriation of $92 million, two-thirds of which would be passed through state and local communities \"for on-the-ground restoration work.\"\nEarly in the first Trump administration, the president's budget suggested zeroing out all funding for the Bay Program, which at the time came to $73 million.\n\"But by the end of the [first] Trump administration, we worked on a bipartisan basis to restore that funding and increase it from $73 million to $85 million,\" Van Hollen said at the luncheon.\nVan Hollen also introduced an additional funding stream through the Chesapeake WILD (Watershed Investments for Landscape Defense) Act in 2019. Advocates are requesting that the program, which focuses on public lands and wildlife, continue to be funded at $15 million.\nOne of Van Hollen's longtime partners in the effort to fund the Chesapeake Bay cleanup has been Congressman Rob Wittman (R-VA), who also serves as vice chairman on the House Natural Resources Committee. Advocates at the luncheon were eager to hear from Wittman, who had booked the room for the event but arrived just minutes before it ended, to see whether the Bay remained a priority amid so many proposed federal spending cuts.\nIn his remarks, Wittman acknowledged the need to rein in federal spending but seemed to hold the line on Bay funding priorities. He also said level funding for the Bay Program would likely be protected in the short-term under a continuing resolution for the federal budget through later this year.\n\"As we look to try to bend the spending curve down, it's very clear that there is a federal role for the Chesapeake Bay,\" he said. \"There is a constitutional mandate to say we are going to do this as an interstate effort … and the federal government has a statutory obligation in that realm under the Clean Water Act to do those things.\"\nWittman also acknowledged the challenges ahead and the fact that the Bay Program's funding has been at stake in the past. During the 119th Congress, he will co-chair a Chesapeake Bay watershed task force in the House with Sarah Elfreth (D-MD), Andy Harris (R-MD) and Bobby Scott (D-VA) to continue pushing for Bay restoration funds.\n\"In the past, there've been efforts to say, 'No, we shouldn't fund the Chesapeake Bay Program,\" he said. \"And our response is, \"[buzzer sound], wrong answer.\"\nWhitney Pipkin is a Chesapeake Bay Journal staff writer based in Northern Virginia.

This new special tax was designed to directly tie development to available funding for open space and recreational facilities for the public good. Now because of the state budget deficit the Program Open Space funds are being threatened with total removal for the next four years.Program Open Space supports parks, forests and wildlife management areas and is an important contributor to the state's conservation commitments and goals. It also supports community playgrounds, ball fields, tennis courts, hiking trails, historic sites, Chesapeake Bay water access and multiple other community benefits. These programs are important for citizens' wellbeing and also have substantial economic benefit. Quality of life is a very important factor in home and business investment in a community.\nI am impressed with the value of open spaces when I visit the Oxford Conservation Park and see the park being enjoyed by people of all ages and abilities. I see toddlers running around, senior citizens — some proceeding slowly with the help of a cane, dog owners with their enthusiastic pets and many others enjoying the outdoors.\nI am particularly mindful of the many citizens who safely walked in the park during the worst days of the pandemic for exercise, tranquility and inspiration. The park also has become a highly valued locale for viewing wildlife with, for example, a large number of bird species identified, including recent sightings of quail.\nProgram Open Space provides very important benefits to residents of the Eastern Shore. I encourage you to contact our Talbot County representatives ask that they continue funding for Program Open Space.\nSARAH RAMSEY\nOxford \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This past winter brought about 13 inches of snow and temperatures dipping down to the single digits.But how did this year's Maryland winter compare to those in the past?\nAs March comes to a close, Capital News Service analyzed the state's winter snow and temperatures over past decades. For the purpose of this analysis, Maryland winter is defined as December to March.\nHere's what we found.\nHow have Maryland winter temperatures changed over the years?\nThis past winter marked the coldest season the Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport national weather station has reported in six years.\nBWI reported the average temperature between December and March so far as 39.3 degrees Fahrenheit. Last winter, the average temperature was 42.9 degrees. And six winters ago, the average temperature reached 38.5 degrees.\nWinter temperatures reported at BWI have remained largely variable\nDespite this year's cold winter, all 48 contiguous states across the nation have experienced winter warming throughout the past few decades.\nAverage winter temperatures across the 48 states have increased by about 3 degrees since 1896, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The agency's website stated that the increase, which aligns with reductions to snow and ice season, can generally be attributed to global warming.\n\"The same general trend that we've seen is still present,\" Alfredo Ruiz-Barrada, an associate research professor in the University of Maryland's atmospheric and oceanic science department said. \"The trends in temperature are increasing.\"\nWhen does Maryland typically see the most snowfall?\nAlthough January is nationally known as the snowiest month, BWI has recorded February as the snowiest month in Maryland over the past two decades.\nSince the winter of 2004-2005, the weather station has recorded about 140 inches of total snowfall in February and around 130 inches in January.\nAverage snowfall reported at BWI has fluctuated over the past two decades\nFebruary often sees the most snowfall in Maryland because it's the state's coldest month, according to James Hyde, a manager from the University of Maryland's atmospheric and oceanic science department. The state sees more snowfall in February because of influences from the Atlantic Ocean, he explained.\nWhat has Maryland snowfall looked like over the past two decades?\nMaryland has seen a handful of blizzards over the past two decades.\nThe most notable was in February 2010, when a snowstorm dubbed the \"Snowmageddon\" made history as it swept over the East Coast. The blizzard, which produced over 32 inches of snow, was the heaviest single-snowfall recorded by the Washington Dulles International Airport weather station.\nBut this past winter, BWI only recorded around 9 inches of snow in January and around 4 inches of snow in February. Still, this is the most snow that Marylanders have seen in three years. In the winter of 2021-2022, BWI reported roughly 14 inches of snow.\nIt is difficult to predict when the next blizzard will hit Maryland, since temperature and humidity conditions have to be just right, according to Ruiz-Barradas.\nYet Hyde said there is good chance another blizzard will hit Maryland within the next decade. Although Maryland has gotten \"less snowy\" since the 1800s, he said, big blizzards typically still occur every five to seven years.\nThe area is also seeing a gradual decrease in \"minor events,\" or two- to six-inch snowstorms, Hyde said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Its regenerative grazing practices help improve Bay water quality and healthy animals, ecosystems and food systems, the release said.\n\"The Creamery is one of only four regenerative grazing dairy farms that directly market their milk, butter, ice cream, and yogurt to consumers. They are well known at farmers' markets in Annapolis, Salisbury, and Chestertown, and also support local food bank systems,\" it said.\nThe trees were supplied by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation's Claggett Farm, a regenerative farm in Upper Marlboro. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They are a major source of omega-3 fatty acids, so they are also used to develop human and animal supplements.\nIn actuality, Maryland already had strict restrictions in place regarding harvesting of menhaden, also known as mossbunker or bunker, which are small, oily, bony filter-feeding fish that play a vital role in the ocean's food chain.\nScientists worldwide consider the menhaden \"the most important fish in the sea\" due to their importance to the health of the ocean and coastal economy.\n\"Menhaden play a critical role in marine ecosystems as a forage species,\" local nature conservationist Sal Icaza said at the panel discussion held at the Twin Beach Library. \"They provide a vital link between lower and higher tropic levels. Menhaden are also crucial in nutrient cycling because their filter-feeding activities remove excess nutrients from the water column. They help maintain water quality and prevent an over saturation of runoff resulting in lack of oxygen to aquatic life.\"\nIcaza is primarily concerned with the impact that the over harvesting of menhaden already has on the local osprey population. With Virginia granting the green light to companies to harvest the menhaden in the lower Chesapeake Bay in large quantities, the number of osprey, which feed on the fish, in the bay and neighboring estuaries continues to plummet.\n\"In 2019 on Poplar Island, Maryland, there were more than 50 young ospreys produced in 28 nest platforms,\" Icaza said only days before the fourth annual Maryland Osprey Festival took place at its new home in North Beach. \"Sadly, last year there were only three osprey chicks that survived in two nest platforms out of 28 pairs attempting to nest.\"\nBoth Reed and Icaza noted the petition and prevailing suit seek to accomplish several things, including to enact a moratorium on harvesting menhaden in the bay; require no less than 40% of harvest from federal waters; codify a one-mile shoreline buffer; establish a permanent one nautical mile shoreline buffer along Virginia's shoreline; and establish proper industry oversight. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Planned salmon farm's discharge permit challenged in Cecil County court\n\n April 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jane Bellmyer jbellmyer@cecilwhig.com | Section: Business \n \n 563\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ELKTON — The Chesapeake Bay Foundation has filed a petition for judicial review in Cecil County Circuit Court against AquaCon, the Norwegian company that plans to build a land-based salmon farming operation at the Bainbridge Development Corporation property in Port Deposit.According to CBF, there are concerns about the Maryland Department of the Environment's discharge permit, which would allow AquaCon to send 1.9 million gallons of post-production water back into the Susquehanna River daily. Paul Small, CBF Vice President for Litigation, pointed to similar companies in Florida and Canada that have not had the best results on the native habitat, with reports of fish kills in North America and fires and potential water contamination in Denmark.\n\"Land-based salmon farms are relatively new and unpredictable,\" Small said. \"Knowing the prior failures of these types of plants, and that the Susquehanna River is already overloaded with nutrient pollution, MDE's permit must protect against these risks.\"\nIn court papers, CBF noted that the company modeled its discharge permit paperwork after a similar operation in Maine that — to date — has not begun production or its permits have expired.\nAquaCon, based in Oslo, Norway, announced last August that it plans to build its Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS) facility on 160 acres of the former US Navy training base where it would draw water from the Susquehanna, grow salmon in large indoor pools and sell the fish to wholesalers and the restaurant industry.\nToni Sprenkle, Executive Director of BDC, was excited that the first tenant of the property had been announced. She was assured that there would be no environmental impacts.\n\"This is a very good use for Bainbridge,\" Sprenkle said in August. \"There are unique attributes with this. It's close to the Susquehanna River so it can pull large amounts of water.\"She added that the company recycles and treats that water on site and when it is finally discharged it would \"come out cleaner than it went in.\"\nCBF begs to differ. In the court documents, the foundation argues that not enough is known about the science of these operations, pointing the fragility of the river and the harm that could come with discharges of nitrogen, phosphorous and sediment. This could mean the degradation of oxygen levels, grasses and impact recreational and commercial fishermen as well as hunters.\n\"The Susquehanna River is already overloaded with nitrogen and sediment pollution that runs off of farms and suburban developments,\" said Gussie Maguire, CBF Maryland Staff Scientist. \"While we have made tremendous progress reducing that pollution, development pressure continues to strain the health of our waterways. MDE must adequately consider this risk for new, experimental projects like AquaCon.\"\nJust before being released to market, these salmon are moved to purge tanks where they will slough a protein that — if left in place — would make the fish unpalatable. That protein, geosmin, is not included in the discharge permit, according to CBF.\nThe discharge permit requires the company to have net-zero discharge. However, it allows AquaCon to purchase credits to offset the amount of its nitrogen, phosphorous and sediment.\nAquaCon had plans to build its RAS plant in Caroline County but residents of the Federalsburg community fought back claiming the plant would endanger the Atlantic sturgeon population in Marshyhope Creek. In October 2022, AquaCon agreed and withdrew its pending Maryland Department of the Environment discharge permit application. Sprenkle pointed out that Marshyhope Creek is a smaller body of water. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "'Serious local consequences': Trump cuts could hit wildlife refuges\n\n April 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 674\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Trump administration announced in February that the U.S. General Services Administration plans to close more than 2 million square feet of office space used by the Department of the Interior nationwide.The list includes ranger district offices, historic buildings, and museum spaces, with 33 National Park Service facilities on the list. Among the affected locations is the Blackwater Wildlife Refuge in Cambridge, which could, in turn, threaten the future of the Eastern Neck Wildlife Refuge.\nIn response, Bill Burton, president of Friends of Eastern Neck, and vice president Bonnie Ford are calling on business leaders, as well as county and town officials, for support.\nAt the Kent County Commissioners' regular meeting on March 15, Burton and Ford made their requests, receiving a positive response.\nCommissioner John Price said, \"Eastern Neck Island is a wonderful place. I often visit it with my grandkids, and we are as concerned as you are about the future.\"\nPrice motioned to prepare a letter \"sooner rather than later\" to support Friends of Eastern Neck. The letter would address the budget situation and call for a meeting with Maryland Rep. Andy Harris and Senators Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks, who serve on committees that could help preserve the refuge.\n\"Rep. Harris is our priority, given his role as majority party leader,\" Ford said.\nThe letter received unanimous support from the commissioners.\nFord pressed for swift action, noting, \"Time is of the essence\" due to the upcoming reconciliation process within the government. Her concerns center on two areas: the Department of the Interior's budget and potential reductions in staff.\nThe Blackwater Refuge, located 12 miles south of Cambridge, is 10 times larger than Eastern Neck and is currently operating with a skeleton crew. Ford explained that many staff members with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service there are retiring early, but the goal remains to maintain staff who work on the ground.\nFor the past two years, some Blackwater staff have driven four hours to Eastern Neck Island to maintain the grounds. Further cuts could end these visits, Ford said.\nKent County plays a significant role in maintaining the refuge, including upkeep of roads to Bogles Wharf and the Ingleside Recreation Area.\nFord added that more cuts could affect the over 70,000 annual visitors to Eastern Neck, many of whom travel from out of town to enjoy the 100-year-old hunting lodge, gift shop, museum, bookstore, and trails.\nShe warned that without U.S. Fish and Wildlife oversight, volunteer work and community outreach programs through Friends of Eastern Neck would be severely limited or halted.\nA full closure would have devastating consequences, Ford said. Invasive plants would go unchecked, migratory waterfowl populations would be at risk, hunts would end, litter would accumulate, and the island could be subject to vandalism.\n\"This is a national issue with serious local consequences,\" Ford told commissioners.\nThe group is once again calling for unity to protect the area, referencing the refuge's establishment in the 1960s. A decade earlier, a developer had subdivided a large tract into 293 lots for a housing development. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acquired the island between 1962 and 1967 to preserve its valuable wildlife habitat.\nEastern Shore wildlife refuges feature bald eagles, osprey, swans, ducks, geese as well as other species of birds, reptiles and butterflies.\n\"Our community spoke up to preserve the land more than 60 years ago,\" Ford said. \"We need to do it now, while we can still make a difference.\"\nTo expedite the process, Burton and Ford prepared a packet and a template for the commissioners to review, which they were happy to do.\nBurton and Ford also encouraged members of the community to reach out for support at 410-639-7056 or visit friendsofeasternneck.org\n\"Tell your local lawmakers what Eastern Neck National Wildlife Refuge means to you and our community,\" they said.\nFriends of Eastern Neck is a non-profit organization with about 300 members and 400 volunteers. Their mission is to support the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in preserving and protecting the area. Volunteers assist with the butterfly garden, the contact station (open Friday to Sunday), lodge repairs, and education programs for both children and adults. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Easton Airport is awaiting a permit to pull up the concrete slab.\nAccording to Easton Airport's website, an environmental assessment was started in 2006 to plan for future safety improvements, modernization and to determine how the airport would conform to new FAA airport design standards.\n\"After an exhaustive 12-year assessment, Easton Airport's plan was approved in 2018,\" the website reads. \"The Airfield Modernization Program design process and work on enabling projects moved forward soon after.\"\nThe modernization project, now in its second phase, includes upgrades like LED lights, multiple new on-ramps, and creating two 1,000-foot grass fields at each end of Runway 422. The airport will grade the area level to each end of the runway that runs roughly north and south.\nIn the process of leveling out the grass fields, Easton Airport included a 13-acre wetland site to help avoid pollution in the Chesapeake Bay and to help process stormwater at the airport.\n\"We made a lot of improvements already in Phase 1,\" Risher said. \"We put in these long, shallow ditches that will run into this wetland down here, and that will just act as a natural filter to clean stormwater runoff as it leads to the problem.\n\"This project has so many positive environmental improvements,\" he said.\nThose improvements include removing 13 acres of pavement.\n\"That's going to help the runoff situation,\" Risher said. \"When rain hits pavement, it just runs right off fast. When it hits natural land, it's absorbed, it slowly goes through.\"\nPhase 2 is expected to be completed this fall, he said.\nWhile Phase 2 plays a big part in the next steps of the modernization, Risher said Easton Airport has another vision he hopes can be achieved during the modernization project.\n\"We don't have a time frame yet, but plans are absolutely in the works to put a small community park out here once it's all said and done,\" Risher said. \"I've had that vision for years, where people can come in and see the airplane, like an aircraft viewing area.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Additionally, it would impose a fee of at least 10 cents on each paper bag and reusable carryout bag provided to a customer.\nEnvironmental groups such as Queen Anne's Conservation Association, ShoreRivers, Plastic Free QAC, and the Chesapeake Watershed Semester at the Gunston School highlighted the excess of plastic bags as a major source of litter and its detrimental effects on health, wildlife, and the environment.\nChester RiverKeeper Annie Richards said the ordinance could set a precedent for state policy and help \"turn the tide\" on plastic pollution.\nSmall businesses such as Sunkissed Flower Farm in Stevensville, Fat and Happy Farms in Grasonville, and Lowery's Farm in Chester supported the ordinance, noting that plastic bags often become a nuisance in machinery.\nMembers of the Queen Anne's County Watermen's Association, voicing support for the ordinance, stressed the impact of discarded plastic bags on the Chesapeake Bay, a vital resource for local livelihoods and recreation.\nA Kent Island High Schooler voiced concern for the long-term and yet-unknown overall impact of plastics and encouraged the lessening of their use as soon as possible.\nReiterating data previously presented to the commissioners, Bente Cooney, Plastic Free QAC founder, noted the growing number of businesses already embracing paper over plastic and encouraged a mindset less focused on \"bag bans\" and more on \"bring your own bag.\"\nNeil Bates, a member of the Kent Island Four Seasons Environmental Club, said, \"I know this is a hard change, but it's one worth making.\"\nThe League of Women Voters of Queen Anne's County, represented by President Elizabeth Hammond, voiced support for the ordinance, backing its solid waste management position on reduction, recycling, and conservation.\nVoices in support of the county-wide ordinance also cited the success of the Town of Centreville's elimination of single-use plastic bags, enacted in 2024. Initially met with some natural resistance and hesitation, Centreville Town President Ashley Kaiser said in a letter to the Commissioners that town residents have since adjusted well, leading to improvements in the Chesapeake Bay, local farms, and the overall shore environment and quality of life.\nThe Maryland Retailers Alliance (MRA) has long been in favor of a \"ban and fee structure\" for retailers to keep bag fees, according to MRA representative Sarah Price.\nWhile not a money-maker for businesses, the fee structure directly offsets the costs of more expensive paper bags, she said.\nTo ease transition and provide consistency for the community, the MRA urged the commissioners to mirror Centreville legislation, notably allowing pharmacy and restaurant bags to be exempt from the 10-cent fee, according to Price.\nOpposed to the ordinance as it was currently drafted and requesting full restaurant exemptions, Brendan Mahoney of the Restaurant Association of Maryland said paper bags for restaurant takeout can get messy, especially when carrying steamed crabs, and reusable totes may not be food-safe.\nPublic comment remains open, and decisions are expected at the County Commissioners' next meeting on May 27 at 5:30 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moore to veto solar bill\n\n May 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 626\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Eastern Shore legislators, House Republicans and agricultural advocacy groups in Maryland are making one last effort to nix controversial solar energy legislation by asking for a veto from Gov. Wes Moore.Senate Bill 931, the Renewable Energy Certainty Act, was passed by the General Assembly in April. It aims to increase the state's solar generation by streamlining the regulatory process for solar projects. Fencing, setback and vegetation requirements would be standardized.\nHouse Republicans and the Eastern Shore Delegation both wrote letters to the governor urging him to veto the bill. While Moore (D) hasn't publicly signaled whether or not he's considering a veto, some believe it could be in play given he hasn't yet signed the legislation.\n\"I've heard it is possible,\" said Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) in an interview Wednesday. \"I'm hopeful that he would see the opportunity and the wisdom and just say, 'No, not yet.'\"\nQualms with the solar legislation largely relate to a reduction in the control local governments would have over solar project approvals, and the increase in Public Service Commission authority.\nThe legislation outlines a cap on how much land the Maryland Public Service Commission can grant to solar projects in each county — 5% of land designated for agriculture and forests.\nRepublicans attempted but failed during session to lower that cap.\nDel. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said Thursday that Eastern Shore counties could have thousands of acres up for solar development even with the 5% cap.\nAt a legislative wrap-up discussion in Easton Wednesday, Mautz said solar interests came into Annapolis and \"cleared the decks.\"\n\"They wanted to set up their own regulatory system, they wanted to set up their own siting system,\" he said. \"And they wanted to run this through the Public Service Commission.\"\n\"It puts an X on the Eastern Shore,\" Mautz added. \"We are the prime target for solar investment.\"\nThe Chesapeake Climate Action Network, an environmental nonprofit that's one of the bill's many advocate groups, encouraged supporters to contact Moore's office and lobby for no veto. Brittany Baker, the organization's Maryland director, said rumors of a veto were floating.\n\"The rumor mill was churning, and no one had a concrete answer here or there,\" Baker said.\nBaker said in addition to streamlining processes that otherwise vary greatly across the state, the bill is set to codify best practices. And it could help local farmers who are looking to remain economically viable, she said.\n\"It provides another way for people to be able to stay on their farms and make revenue,\" Baker said.\nPUSH TO VETO\nThe governor's office didn't comment specifically on whether Moore is considering a veto, but did provide a statement.\n\"As Governor Moore reviews the hundreds of bills put forward this session, he will continue to work with the State Legislature, local leaders, and all partners involved to ensure that we are signing legislation that will make Maryland safer, more affordable, more competitive, and the state that serves,\" the statement read.\nBaker said despite rumors, the Chesapeake Climate Action Network believes Senate Bill 931 will become law.\n\"We're pretty sure at this point that the governor will not be vetoing this bill,\" she said.\nMautz acknowledged a veto is a tricky, party-line situation. He said it would be messy, but \"less messy\" than what happens down the line if the bill becomes law.\n\"For the governor to veto it, he's going to cross his own party,\" Mautz said. \"He's going to cross some of his own advocates. It's going to be extremely controversial.\"\nAdams acknowledged that vetoes are rare. But he said the bill not yet being signed may signal \"at the minimum, that the governor's paying attention.\"\nIf Moore doesn't sign the Renewable Energy Certainty Act by May 27, it automatically becomes law. The governor's next slate of bill signings is scheduled for May 20. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The Corsica River saw a 17% overall improvement from last year.\nThe dominant land use surrounding Chester is agriculture and when it comes to natural resources protecting the waterway, the Chester is in a deficit as Kent and Queen Anne's counties that make up the entirety of the Chester Watershed are \"tied for the least treed counties in Maryland,\" she said.\nAgricultural and septic systems play a contributing role in pollution which in turn is exacerbated by increased rainfall due to climate change.\nAccording to the Comprehensive Evaluation of System Response (CESR) report from the Chesapeake Bay Program, stormwater runoff is the fastest growing pollution source across the state, Richards said.\nPhosphorus and clarity often correlate as phosphorus has to bond to sediment in order to move into the waterway, and both phosphorus and clarity levels improved throughout the Chester and most other watersheds this year, Richards said.\nHow swimmable are local waterways? The Swimmable ShoreRivers Program promotes public access and recreation and monitors for bacteria and the accumulation of forever chemicals, she said.\nRainfall flushes bacteria from the land into waterways and bacteria levels were notable this year despite low rain, she said.\nProviding opportunities for students and connecting with the community, ShoreRivers and partners work collaboratively to increase awareness of issues, inspire behavior change, and implement practices for healthier river systems, Richards said.\nCritical Area Commission Chair Erik Fisher noted that the critical area is a 1,000 foot ribbon of land around all the tidewater in the state.\nThe goals of the commission lie in minimizing impact of runoff on water quality and conserving habitats while also accommodating growth with attention to adverse affects, building reliance to coastal hazards and provide resources for landowners\nWhile it is a state wide commission, the Critical Area Commission has a distinct focus on local action, he said.\nThrough over 40 years of state and local partnerships the commission has reviewed thousands of development projects and worked to preserve contiguous forest.\nFuture rising tides will impact nearshore habitats in the critical areas and marshes will shift, increasing rainfall and hotter and saltier environments, according to Fisher. Looking at general growth patterns, the Commission is working to update maps continuously to help local communities factor equity and climate change data into future projects, he said.\nThe future of the Chester River starts with the community and everyone who uses the water, Richards said.\nHighlighting open participation, ShoreRivers' community engagement includes advocating for better public access to waterways and local participation is encouraged every step of the way to ensure quality waterways for generations to come, Richards said.\n\"When you recreate [engage] with your environment, that fosters environmental stewardship. You can't love what you don't know,\" she said.\nMore information about ShoreRivers, including upcoming events can be found at https://www.shorerivers.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore (D) signed two prominent energy bills into law on Tuesday, bills largely opposed by Eastern Shore Republicans during this year's Maryland General Assembly.Senate Bills 931 and 937 were part of an expansive energy package lawmakers wrestled with this session. While Moore vetoed the package's third bill, due in part to budgetary reasons, he put pen to paper for the others.\nThe Renewable Energy Certainty Act, or SB931, aims to increase the state's solar generation by streamlining the regulatory process for solar projects. Specifically, it provides the Maryland Public Service Commission with approving authority for projects under the 2-megawatt threshold.\nTuesday, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said the legislation creates \"a clear path forward for solar and battery storage projects to eliminate local barriers and allow local government to join in community solar programs.\"\n\"It is essential that we have more affordable and cleaner, Maryland-made energy,\" Ferguson said.\nBut Eastern Shore legislators, as well as county representatives, don't see it the same way.\nRepublican legislators unsuccessfully pushed for Moore to veto the bill amid concerns it strips away local control over solar project approvals and places too much authority at the hands of the Public Service Commission.\nCaroline County Commission President Travis Breeding said it will override the county-instituted 2,000-acre solar cap.\nPer the legislation, the Public Service Commission can grant solar project approvals on up to 5% of land designated for agriculture and forests. County leaders say the amount of land prone to solar development could quadruple.\n\"It's going to change the landscape, it's going to change the look of the county,\" Breeding said in an interview, citing concerns on food production and agricultural jobs. \"It's going to change our economy.\"\nBreeding noted the commissioners are \"pursuing solutions at the federal level\" in the form of reaching out to Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.). Breeding hopes there can be federal restrictions on solar project subsidies so developers \"cannot offer these lucrative deals to entice landowners.\"\nSENATE BILL 937\nThe Next Generation Energy Act, or SB937, focuses on ratepayer relief after a winter of skyrocketing energy bills — a trend Ferguson said was a \"wake-up call\" and not just a \"temporary spike.\"\nFerguson noted $200 million will go toward ratepayer refunds — an average of $80 per household, Ferguson said, split between winter and summer payments.\nThe bill looks to increase in-state generation by trimming permitting processes as coal and oil plants reach their ends.\n\"We know that older coal plants and oil plants are being retired based on private action, and we have not built up enough alternative energy to fill it fast enough, and so the General Assembly had to act,\" Ferguson said.\nDel. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said the bill's framework doesn't do enough to incentivize nuclear energy or in-state generation. Adams and other Republicans have also disagreed with Democrats on the premise that the bill provides necessary relief to ratepayers.\n\"Maryland is still ... dependent on other states to bring us energy,\" Adams said in an interview last week. \"It's expensive, and that sole political decision is what's creating the ratepayer difficulties that we're experiencing and will experience moving forward.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If approved, it would challenge the Renewable Energy Certainty Act, which Falstad and other opponents believe threatens the state's agricultural lands.\n\"We have a long way to go,\" Falstad said, acknowledging the uphill battle of gathering signatures within a short time.\nThe Renewable Energy Certainty Act, or SB931, aims to increase the state's solar generation by streamlining the regulatory process for solar projects. Specifically, it provides the Maryland Public Service Commission with approving authority for projects under the 2-megawatt threshold.\nMay 20, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said the legislation creates \"a clear path forward for solar and battery storage projects to eliminate local barriers and allow local government to join in community solar programs.\"\n\"It is essential that we have more affordable and cleaner, Maryland-made energy,\" Ferguson said.\nBut Eastern Shore legislators, as well as county representatives, don't see it the same way.\nRepublican legislators unsuccessfully pushed for Moore to veto the bill amid concerns it strips away local control over solar project approvals and places too much authority at the hands of the Public Service Commission.\nThe bill increases any pre-existing cap on solar development within a county's priority preservation areas, or agricultural land to 5%. Falstad and the Farmers Alliance for Rural Maryland argue that it opens the door for the widespread conversion of agricultural land to solar farms.\n\"The position of the Farmers Alliance is that no agricultural acre ought to be taken up for solar projects when you have other surface options available,\" Falstad said. \"If we're going to hold true to that principle, then why would we accept 5% and many tens of thousands of acres?\"\nDozens of people stopped their Memorial Day activities to sign Falstad's petition at the North County Park Monday.\nFalstad has made his way around the Mid-Shore, collecting signatures and raising awareness about the issue. He plans to visit Centreville, Kent Island and Federalsburg in the coming week to continue rallying support.\nDespite the challenge of the tight timeline, Falstad remains determined.\n\"So the overall number of acres of farmland consumed for solar projects on the Eastern Shore alone is tens of thousands of acres. In Kent, Queen Anne's, Caroline, Talbot County, it's well over 10,000 acres alone, and that type of impact will surely have implications,\" Falstad has said.\nThe petition and referendum aim to challenge a significant provision of Senate Bill 931 that could allow the conversion of more agricultural land to solar production, which Falstad argues could have far-reaching repercussions for Maryland's agricultural community and the businesses that rely on it.\nTo sign the petition you must be a registered voter.

Both schools went through a two-year application process through MAEOE to be come Green School certified.\nAlthough directors for programs at the schools said the program was intense, they said the help they received from the community was surprising and made the process go much smoother.\n\"You have to work together, and we divided and conquered,\" said Julie Strange, pre-k teacher at and program coordinator for Green Schools at Denton Elementary. \"You have to contact people at the board office. You have to contact contact your cafeteria. You have to contact people I didn't even know did jobs.\n\"It's an intense process, but again, eye-opening how helpful everybody was and that there are people for everything.\"\nWithin that application for the program there are different subcategories for which the schools must show evidence they met the objective.\nThe application also comes with a curriculum that must be completed by the students, and the school must provide one example of outdoor or environmental instruction per grade level.\n\"Through our curriculum and standards, we're able to teach these kids sustainability practices and how to take care of the Earth, just learning about the Earth through those environmental literacy standards. It's one of my passions. I really enjoy doing it,\" said Zellie Kneller Kidigarden, a teacher and program director for Green Schools at Greensboro Elementary.\nThroughout the application process, the elementary schools have been able to produce multiple projects that help compost, save energy and grow fresh foods.\nOne project at Denton Elementary involves collecting breakfast bags in the morning after breakfast. According to Strange, the school lets third graders create boxes and put recycle signs on them to put in their classrooms to collect bags in the morning.\n\"Every day, we get breakfast in plastic bags per child, and our school is about 650 kids. So that's 650 bags that go in the trash every day,\" Strange said. \"The kids were so excited about it, and they did it... the kids are responsible for putting their bag in there when they're done their breakfast instead of throwing it in the trash.\"\nOne of the projects Greensboro Elementary conducts is planting in multiple gardens.\n\"We do strawberries, herbs in our garden tower and then we have our pollinator garden. Our Environmental Club also planted native plants everywhere in our swales. Before the end of the school year, we're going to plant native plants in our courtyard,\" Kneller said.\nKneller credits community partners for being helpful in their pursuit to becoming a green school.\nSome of the organizations Greensboro Elementary has partnered with are Pickering Creek Audubon Center, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Tuckahoe State Park, Wetlands on Wheels and many more.\n\"I'm so grateful that we're a community school because being a community school allows us to work with... stakeholders in the community, and we get wonderful things from all the members in the community,\" Kneller said.\nGreensboro Elementary has been a green school since 2021 and will go through a renewal next year. The school has been able to secure multiple grants that will lead to future projects, including tree planting and much more.\nBoth Kneller and Strange believe every school should be Green School certified.\n\"It's really, really, really important work and every school should be green school certified,\" Kneller said. \"It is life-changing for a lot of students and adults and I would say everyone because this is the planet that we live on and everyone needs to learn how to take care of it because we don't have anywhere else to go.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If we only focus on one area, we risk losing much more of Maryland's shoreline than we realize.\nAs a high school student studying this issue through a civic action project, I believe the state must do more to expand nourishment efforts statewide. Coastal erosion affects everyone—whether we live near the beach or not—and it's time we treated it like the urgent environmental issue it is.\nSKYE LIZMI\nQueenstown \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Floating solar panels could power Chestertown’s future\n\n June 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 576\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — A quiet corner of Chestertown may soon become home to a cutting-edge floating solar array, thanks to a newly approved lease agreement between the town and Third Pillar Solar, a renewable energy company working on a large-scale project atop the town's wastewater lagoon.The site, located off John Hanson Road, already houses the town's wastewater treatment plant and serves as a popular birding location, with more than 160 species reported.\nThe Town of Chestertown is working with Tom Dietz, the environmental committee's energy adviser, on the project, which is still in the design phase.\nIf constructed, the solar array would feature 7 megawatts of floating solar panels anchored to the lagoon and connected to Delmarva Power. The system would be built and operated by Third Pillar Solar, a U.S.-based company specializing in floating solar arrays on municipal and industrial water bodies.\nAt its June 3 meeting, the Chestertown Council approved a lease agreement allowing Third Pillar to proceed with development. The same night, Dietz's plan to begin project design was approved.\nProject developer Michaela Hunt Hess attended the meeting to answer questions, though council members and Mayor David Foster had few, having already heard from Third Pillar Vice President of Development Ned Horneffer at previous meetings.\nAt the May 5 meeting, Horneffer presented a detailed overview of the project. He said the company, now about 20 employees strong, has grown rapidly, attracting professionals from major firms and securing backing from Glentra Capital, a private investment firm committed to fully funding the project.\nHorneffer said the project has two phases: development and construction.\nDuring development, Third Pillar will work with Delmarva Power to identify an interconnection point. In this phase, the company will pay the town $15,000 annually in rent, with increases of $3,000 per year.\nIf Delmarva determines the project is viable, Third Pillar will move into construction. At that point, the company will seek a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Maryland Public Service Commission, a process Horneffer said typically takes about a year.\nOnce construction begins and energy production is confirmed, the rent paid by the company will increase to approximately $81,000 annually, based on $12,000 per megawatt.\nThird Pillar will cover the cost of any infrastructure upgrades required by Delmarva, estimated between $1 million and $3 million.\nA decommissioning bond will be issued to the town as insurance in case the project becomes obsolete or is not completed.\nTown Manager Larry DiRe asked whether the town would receive solar energy credits. Horneffer said no, but noted Chestertown could benefit by becoming an anchor subscriber to the energy output.\nFoster raised questions about environmental impact and bird activity. Horneffer said that birds are often drawn to the floating panels and that the company may install deterrents, such as washers, to manage that.\nFoster noted that the project involves a 42-year lease agreement — a long-term commitment for the town.\nBefore construction can begin, the next step will be approval of a transmission easement to run cables from the site. Horneffer said he would return to the council for that authorization.\nHe emphasized that Third Pillar would assume all project risk — owning, operating and maintaining the system, and subcontracting construction and maintenance to Maryland-based companies.\nFloating solar arrays have gained support in Maryland as an alternative to projects that use farmland. Horneffer said Third Pillar is developing similar projects across Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and hopes to add Chestertown to that list soon.\n\"We look forward to working with you all going forward,\" he told the council. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — At the May Commissioners of St. Michaels meeting, the commissioners received an update on San Domingo Creek.Roy Myers, chairman of the Climate Change and Sea Level Rise Commission, and Anna Johnson, project engineer and Bay Land representative, gave a presentation on San Domingo Creek and Back Creek Park Living Shoreline.\nThe presentation consisted of the findings from a mitigation study as part of the San Domingo Creek area study. The study found that the bulkhead, a wall-like structure that serves as a barrier to the creek, was severely broken down and leaning seaward.\nAccording to Johnson, the best solution is to build a living shoreline.\n\"Given the calm environment of San Domingo Creek, likely the best solution for this area is the build a living shoreline,\" Johnson said.\nThe proposed solutions were to make a pebble and sand fill with marsh plantings, cut the bulkhead and cover with upland plantings, and add protection structures with soft launch.\nTo pay for this project, the town received a grant from the Department of Natural Resources Resiliency Through Restoration Division for $204,776 to design and construct a 100-foot living shoreline with climate-resilient natural features along the San Domingo Creek and Back Creek Park.\nBay Land and DNR have been working together since the town received the grant in October.\nCommissioners President Jay Hudson said the presentation was helpful.\n\"I think the presentation was was great. I think she (Johnson) covered a lot of things that needed to be covered as far as proposed materials and plantings,\" Hudson said.\nOne conversation brought up during the meeting was about what materials should be used for the Kayak launch area. Hudson said the town will look at alternative materials.\n\"I think what was left was that we were going to be looking at alternative materials for the kayak launch,\" Hudson said. \"Because there was some astroturf, there were some concerns about small pebbles marring the the plastic of the kayak, we're looking into alternative kayak launch materials that would be able to be submerged in water but also protect the integrity of of those vessels.\"\nAccording to Hudson, in late August, about 60% of the design documents and construction will be done. By November all of that will be completed. Hudson said the commissioners will be receive another update in January. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "AI's potential benefits are extraordinary, but so are downsides\n\n June 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MICHAEL DAVIS | Section: Columns \n \n 841\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Buried in the 1,038 pages of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a dangerous clause that prohibits any state from regulating artificial intelligence for 10 years. Even Marjorie Taylor Greene is against it, as well as other Republicans: Sens. Blackburn (R-Tenn), Tillis (R-NC), Hawley (R-Missouri), Rounds (R-SD) and Young (R-Ind.).Recently, Trump rescinded federal regulatory controls on AI that were imposed by a Biden executive order. Because language in the budget bill goes further and eliminate all state regulation of AI for 10 years, this would leave an AI regulatory vacuum with only Trump in a position to regulate AI by executive order or by initiating federal legislation.\nAI involves making and spending hundreds of billions of dollars. The company that developed ChatGPT-4, OpenAI, is valued at $300 billion, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world. Anthropic, a relatively small AI company that developed Claude.ai is worth $60 billion. Other companies involved in AI are Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Google. Microsoft invested $13 billion with OpenAI. Trump recently announced a $500 billion private investment in AI infrastructure.\nAI's potential benefits are extraordinary. There are also serious concerns about predictable negative consequences if there is no government oversight at the federal or state level. One major concern about AI is how the companies creating AI programs have exploited people and physical resources. The companies have a disgraceful history of hiring impoverished people in Africa and Venezuela to review the worst images posted on the internet so these AI companies can block the images from the rest of us.\nAnother concern is how AI contributes to energy and land exploitation. Trump brags about the $500 billion private investment in AI infrastructure that will start this year. Unregulated, AI requires massive amounts of electricity to power computers in data centers. Even before Trump announced the $500 billion in infrastructure for AI, designs were underway for data centers requiring as much power as is needed to run two to three cities as large as San Francisco.\nOne gross estimate is that by 2030 8% of all electricity generated in the U.S. will be used for AI. There is no national planning underway for managing that new power load.\nData centers also require vast quantiles of fresh water to prevent overheating. The supply of freshwater in the world is plummeting to critical levels due to shifting weather patterns, growing needs by agriculture, industrial pollution and saltwater incursion. In 2022, Google was designing a data center in Chile that was going to use several million gallons of fresh water every day — enough for tens of thousands of families. The Chilean government intervened to stop the project.\nAI companies aggressively hide the data about environmental exploitation. Independent researchers are banned from company sites. In-house researchers are prevented from publishing data on the environmental impact of AI. They also project rosy scenarios that have not happened, such as claiming AI will solve climate change. But the environmental damage by data centers will happen long before those fixes are, if ever, in place.\nThe unaddressed impact of AI on employment is huge. One AI executive predicted that by 2030, AI will be able to do every entry-level white-collar job. Under this scenario the unemployment rate will be as high as 20%. Companies will no longer need to hire new medical diagnosticians, engineers, computer programmers, business managers, research scientists, writers, artists, accountants, musicians, and so on. That will be a disaster even if it takes twice as long for AI, say 10 years, to achieve this.\nOur own Andy Harris should worry. Today there are AI-programmed anesthesiology machines that could easily put him out of work. Those machines are not used on humans only due to Federal Drug Adminsitration (FDA) regulation.\nIn its short life, AI has a controversial history. AI programs have created graphic child pornography in texts and pictures, created deep fakes, written Nazi propaganda, created propaganda that influenced elections around the world and convinced several people to kill themselves. Even more alarming, this year an AI program spontaneously wrote code to prevent someone from turning it off.\nThe AI companies don't want their programs used for these abuses, but they have not been able to stop it. The companies have set up internal safety organizations with a mixed record of successful control. In March 2023, industry leaders in AI issued an open letter saying all progress on AI should stop for six months to give governments time to develop regulations. Over 13,500 programmers cosigned the letter. The pause did not happen.\nThere is essentially no government regulation of AI, but states could jump in and protect against AI abuses. The provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, if the Senate accepts it, would prevent state regulation for a decade, leaving Trump with immense and exclusive power. This doomsday scenario is not fear mongering. It is playing out in real time. In the history of the world, no profound technology has ever been so quickly introduced with no institutional guardrails whatsoever. Politics aside, AI regulation is necessary to protect the common good. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This marks one of the most severe declines since surveying began in 1990.\n\"The red flags are flying for blue crabs,\" said Allison Colden, the foundation's Maryland executive director, in a statement by the foundation. \"With more than five years of below average crab numbers, it is clear that changing conditions in the bay are undermining the current management of this important species.\"\nA statement released earlier this month by the foundation attributed the population drop to multiple environmental pressures, including climate change, habitat loss, invasive predators and polluted water.\nThe health of blue crab populations is closely tied to underwater grasses — a critical habitat for the crustacean's youth stages. When these grasses disappear, juvenile crabs are left vulnerable.\nThe rise of invasive species like blue catfish, a vicious predator, has also added pressure.\nAdditionally, climate change and polluted runoff are further stressing the population, specifically young and spawning crabs.\n\"Blue crab numbers are crashing just as the Trump Administration dismantles programs restoring water quality and underwater habitat like grasses vital for crabs,\" Keisha Sedlacek, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation's federal director, said in a statement.\nEarlier this year, bay residents through a survey told the foundation that they believe blue crabs are the species in greatest need of protection.\nThe foundation is calling for stronger conservation measures. Among its recommendations include Maryland and Virginia reducing their harvests.\nLocal and state watermen associations did not return requests for comment.\nThe foundation urged Maryland to enhance protections for female crabs and reduce imports of Virginia-harvested crabs. Meanwhile, Virginia should explore ways to limit male crab harvests, which have increased in recent years.\n\"Given the continued decline of males in the population, Virginia should look for ways to reduce harvest of male crabs, which has been a growing part of our crab harvest,\" Chris Moore, the foundation's Virginia executive director, said in a statement.\nThe group also urged for fully funded programs and agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Environmental Protection Agency, which support clean water initiatives essential to crab habitat.\n\"Saving the bay and its iconic species like crabs has always been a bi-partisan effort,\" Sedlacek said. \"Congress must work together to ensure federal investments in restoration continue.\"\nMaryland and Virginia are currently conducting comprehensive stock assessments of the blue crab population, the first since 2011. Results are expected in late 2026.\n\"Managers must heed those assessment results, and act swiftly to protect the opportunity for the next generation to experience the joy of a summertime crab feast,\" Colden said.\nDespite the ongoing efforts at the state level, Sedlacek said decisions made by Congress are essential for the future of blue crabs.\n\"We cannot backtrack on blue crabs or the bay,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Estuarine center's annual bay report card shows lackluster grades\n\n June 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Reid mreid@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 585\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Recently, the University of Maryland Center Estuarine Sciences released its 2024 Chesapeake Bay and Watershed Report Card.The 19th annual report, which a news release stated is \"the most comprehensive annual assessment of the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed,\" gave the Chesapeake Bay an overall grade of C (50%), and a C+ (57%) for the health of the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\nThe overall bay score, which dropped five points from a year ago, also saw decreases in almost all indicator scores.\n\"My first takeaway is that we did have a bit of a downturn from previously, but if you look at the data from the mid-1980s the scores are improving,\" UMCES Integration and Application Network Director Heath Kelsey said. \"They are not improving really fast, but it is improving over time and it's important for people to know that.\"\nKelsey continued, \"A lot of things have happened in the watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay in that time period [such as population increase, development and agriculture] and all those things can impact a watershed. The fact that we are still making progress, even slow progress, is remarkable.\"\nThe report stated one possibility for the downturn is recent extreme rainfall patterns combined with heat. While parts of the watershed experienced drought, brief but intense downpours also caused runoff into bay waters.\n\"The thing we're always fighting is runoff,\" said Friends of Mill Creek Coordinator Ted Haynie, whose Calvert organization tests 150 sites each year, including 26 watersheds. \"When rain falls, the longer it has to leech into the ground, the better it is to keep the nutrients where they belong, instead of when you have these heavy rainfalls everything just rushes into the water. Retention is the biggest thing.\"\nThe university estuarine center stated that long-term improving trends can be attributed to management and restoration efforts at the regional, state and local levels, the upgrading of wastewater treatment plants and the implementing of programs to reduce nutrient and sediment input. State efforts include seagrass restoration, oyster plantings and watershed planning.\nDissolved oxygen (A+), total phosphorous (A), total nitrogen (C+) and Benthic community earned top grades, followed by low grades for aquatic grasses (D+), chlorophyll (D-) and water clarity (F).\n\"We've seen a downward trend in water clarity for quite a long time,\" Kelsey said, \"and there's been a lot of discussion about what does that mean and what's causing that.\"\n\"I think we thought we were making some good progress,\" Haynie said, \"but it never seems like enough.\"\nBoth agree that impervious surfaces — which are any hard surfaces that carry rain along with pollutants, fertilizer, chemicals, pesticides, oils, greases and plastics to name a few — into the water systems are key.\n\"The better option is for that rainwater to soak into the ground,\" Kelsey said.\nHaynie said there are ways to increase the grades, but it will take work.\n\"It is doable, but how much willpower do people have?\" he asked. \"It does take personal sacrifice, and you do not have to live on the water to have a personal responsibility in the health of the bay and our surrounding waterways. I don't have a lot of faith in people's willingness to sacrifice anything.\"\n\"Even though our scores are going up, they're going up very slowly and I wouldn't consider that to be on track,\" Kelsey said. \"We all want the Chesapeake Bay to be in A-plus condition and we're a long ways from that. We've demonstrated that we can have an impact from the things that we do, so I don't think it's a pipe dream at all.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She thanked the community for its support in reducing carbon emissions, recycling, composting, maintaining animal habitats, creating pollinator-friendly areas and supporting alternatives to fossil fuels.\nNow that the drop-off site is being prepared, Freebery updated Kent County News on the project's progress.\nBetween the Chestertown Armory and the Semans-Griswold Environmental Hall at Washington College, 485 S. Cross St., two 95-gallon bins will be placed, courtesy of Shore Soils, a composting company in Stevensville owned by Ryan Silbaugh.\nAfter touring the Shore Soils facility, Freebery said she was impressed by the clean, odor-free and environmentally friendly operation.\n\"There was no smell, no indication of vermin,\" she said, noting that Silbaugh's method includes aerating the organic matter — even meats, bread, cheese and chicken bones — to speed up decomposition.\nWhat happens to all that nutrient-rich compost?\n\"The town gets it back,\" Freebery said, explaining that it will be used to grow plants in parks and other beautification projects.\nCommercial haulers will pick up the bins weekly, replacing them with fresh containers to ensure a clean process. Freebery said the bins will be visible from the road. Fencing and signage will be added in the coming days.\nFreebery expressed optimism about the program's environmental benefits.\n\"Food waste takes up one-third of people's garbage,\" she said. \"Composting reduces landfill space, lowers the carbon footprint and prevents food from breaking down into methane gas. We're turning our food into a reliable resource.\"\nItems labeled compostable will be accepted in the bins.

The shell is washed off the boat onto the waiting river floor below the surface.\nThe Wye River Oyster Program seeks to make plantings an annual tradition and encourage more neighboring rivers to join in initiatives to locally support their waterways, according to Burleson.\nThe Wye River Oyster Program Fund is a non-profit of the Mid Shore Community Foundation.\nMore information about Seed to Shuck Ventures can be found at seedtoshuck.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Gardener supplied 85 bushels of oysters, which equates to about 25,500 oysters.\n\"I'm always a big proponent of the environmental work that oysters do and so when we can farm oysters and make money on them, whether they're being sold for food or restoration purposes, it's all good,\" said Farrington, who called oysters \"habitat engineers.\"\nAccording to Ewing, the St. Mary's River Watershed Association began planting oysters in the river in 2013 and it became an oyster sanctuary in 2017.\n\"I'd say [the oysters make] a big difference,\" Ewing said. \"Talking to the guys on the waterfront who are out here every day they say the water's clearer and we've definitely seen more fish, blue crabs. This area right here the 5-acre reef site is an extremely popular fishing and crabbing area because of all the oysters we've put in this area.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I thought that was sad and amazing.\"\nTidwell's new book, \"The Lost Trees of Willow Avenue,\" looks beyond Takoma Park. It examines extreme weather events and climate change happening across the state. And other experts agree that the impact is vast, including on the Eastern Shore, where more dead trees can be found in the \"ghost forests\" of Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.\nThese things are happening because temperatures in Maryland have never been warmer.\nSince the 20th century, temperatures in the state have risen around 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration. But it's more than just heat. Federal data shows the state is experiencing increasing precipitation, a higher probability of summer droughts, more extreme weather events and flooding accompanied with rising sea levels.\nThe impact of climate change on the state is as varied as its landscape. From vast forests and rolling farms that line the Eastern Shore to the 80.9 square miles of Baltimore City scattered with heat islands, different areas of the state will be affected by climate change in vastly different ways.\nTo hear Tidwell and other environmental experts tell it, the state's poorest communities will face the greatest climate challenges. Communities on the Eastern Shore — where farmlands are becoming wetlands — and Baltimore's city neighborhoods are at particular risk.\n\"There are certain communities, especially marginalized communities that won't have the resources to adapt,\" Tidwell said. \"We just have to stabilize the climate before we face those truly nightmarish impacts.\"\nThe changes Maryland is likely to face are detailed in the federal government's fifth National Climate Assessment — but the Trump administration deleted all that data from the internet on June 30. However, the Local News Network at the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism downloaded all that data months ago and used it as the basis of this story and the accompanying county summaries.\nHere's a closer look at what's happening to the climate, and what's expected to happen, across the state:\nEASTERN SHOREThe remnants of Harriett Tubman's birth home sit in a dying forest in Dorchester County.\n\"They found the original foundations of her home and you now can't even get there because it's in the middle of a ghost forest,\" said Kate Tully, a researcher and associate professor at the University of Maryland College of Agriculture and Natural Resources.\nGhost forests — which are either partially or completely dead — can be found throughout the lower Eastern Shore in Dorchester, Somerset, Worcester and Wicomico counties. These ghost forests result from saltwater intrusion, or what Tully refers to as \"invisible floods,\" where seawater creeps inland as temperatures and waters rise.\n\"That's essentially when the salt burns the tree from the inside out,\" Tully said.\nHigh tides, droughts and groundwater pumping all contribute to this increasingly common phenomenon. Eventually, land plagued by saltwater intrusion turns into either marshland or open water.\nAs a result, Tubman's home — only discovered just a few years ago in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge — is now inaccessible.\nIn the lower Eastern Shore, there are over 70,000 acres of forest classified by the state as ghost forests, with 90% of those acres classified as severely or very severely impacted. For a forest to fall under these classifications, at least half of its trees would be dead.\nBut saltwater intrusion isn't just killing forests.\n\"There are farmers that are being highly impacted by the saltwater intrusion and the loss of productivity of their land,\" said Elliott Campbell, director of the science and research division of the Watershed and Climate Services at Maryland's Department of Natural Resources.. \"There's not really a way to, like, get the salt out.\"\nFarms along the Eastern Shore, including northern counties such as Cecil, Kent, Talbot and Caroline, are known for growing corn and soybeans, used primarily to feed livestock, Campbell said. But these crops don't grow well in salty soil, and Campbell said there is no perfect alternative.\nWhile there are vulnerable farms throughout the entire shore, Tully said Black communities in the lower Eastern Shore are being disproportionately impacted by saltwater intrusion.\n\"We've already lost so many Black farms in Black communities on the Eastern Shore,\" Tully said. \"There's actually a whole history that's already gone underwater that we will never get back.\"\nIn the Antebellum period, the lower Eastern Shore became home to many free Black people escaping slavery from Virginia and other Southern states. The tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay helped provide a living for many formerly enslaved people. But Tully said these communities — and their deep-rooted history — will disappear soon if they're not already underwater.\nThe Chesapeake Bay region is the United States' third-most vulnerable area to sea level rise behind Louisiana and South Florida, according to NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\nBecause the low-lying, largely flat area is so vulnerable, the effects of an increasing climate are much more intense than in other parts of the state. The Chesapeake Bay has already risen from 1.3 to 1.5 inches each decade over the past 100 years, and increasing temperatures would drastically increase precipitation.\nThe land isn't the only thing vulnerable to climate change. Throughout the entire Eastern Shore, the fishing industry is changing.\n\"One very clear example is that we never had a shrimp industry in the state until the last couple years,\" Campbell said.\nCampbell also said blue crabs populations, which do well in warmer waters, will thrive. But the effects on the bay aren't all positive.\nWarmer waters will kill fish at an increasing rate, Campbell said. Similarly, an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases the acidity in the ocean water, which can deplete oyster populations.\nAs for the Eastern Shore's farmland and ghost forests, Campbell said the best case for this land experiencing saltwater intrusion is for it to transition into wetlands. The state has a pilot program to help farmers with that transition.\n\"In some cases, you see marshes forming under those forests,\" Campbell said. \"But in some cases, they eventually will transition to just open water and you lose that ecosystem.\"\nCapital News Service reporter Rachel McCrea contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He worked with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation identifying and monitoring national economic risks to the banking industry, with a focus on the Northeast (Maine to Maryland).\nA resident of Chestertown and self-proclaimed naturalist, Gilchrist will join the board's conservation programs committee.\nOn his new role, Gilchrist said, \"Our recent migration from Philly to Chestertown felt like coming home. My sister lived in Salisbury and Tyaskin and my youngest son lived and worked on Tilghman Island. My annual treks have exposed me to the natural beauty of the Eastern Shore, and I am now at a stage of life where I can focus more on things greater than myself. I am honored to be associated with ESLC, and hope I can find some way to add value to their already excellent work.\"\nNatalie Birrell brings 36 years of financial services industry experience to the ESLC board of directors' finance, investment and audit committee.

    "content": "State struggles to meet ambitious climate goals\n\n July 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RACHEL McCREA Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1547\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As the planet logs some of its warmest years on record, Maryland is trying to make good on some of the most ambitious climate goals in the country. But the state is struggling to keep up with deadlines it set for itself.Maryland is halfway to its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions — the primary driver of climate change — by 60% by 2031, though progress has been at a standstill since 2020. It has another, more ambitious goal on the horizon: net zero emissions by 2045.\nThe state also is trying to transition to renewable energy, aiming for half of its electricity to come from renewables by 2030. That includes a significant chunk from solar energy, though experts say reaching these goals is proving difficult.\nFederal opposition to state climate action poses a problem, too. In an April executive order, President Donald Trump directed his administration to halt the enforcement of state climate laws, calling them a threat to national security, the economy and \"American energy dominance.\"\nAdding it all up, environmentalists see Maryland's climate ambitions as laudable — but threatened.\n\"Maryland is not on track right now for either its renewable energy goals or for its climate goals,\" said Josh Tulkin, director of the Maryland Sierra Club. \"That doesn't mean that it can't be on track, though, because there's a lot of positive programs that will help improve people's lives and reduce pollution and help with the climate.\"\nReducing emissions\nMaryland's plans for emissions reductions are among the nation's most ambitious — but the state is struggling to keep up with its ambitions.\nA 2022 state law says by 2031, Maryland must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 60% compared to 2006. By 2045, it must produce net zero emissions of the gases that cause global warming.\nGetting to a 60% reduction by 2031 would require programs to cut emissions of carbon dioxide — the main driver of climate change across Maryland's economy — and cost $1 billion a year, according to the state's Climate Pollution Reduction Plan.\nMaryland reduced its emissions 30% by 2020, halfway to the 2031 goal, according to the state Department of the Environment's greenhouse gas inventory.\nBut the state hasn't made progress since then. Though emissions vary across economic sectors, state officials are expecting to see a slight increase in statewide emissions from 2020 to 2023. This is because transportation emissions — the largest category — have increased 6% since the end of the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown as emissions from electricity have dropped 10%, according to preliminary state data.\nMeanwhile, the state hasn't found a source for the $1 billion annual investment needed to reach its emissions goals.\n\"We don't have cash coming in the door,\" said Kim Coble, executive director of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters. \"So that will slow down the implementation and meeting those reduction goals, no doubt about it.\"\nOn top of that, the state just passed legislation to speed up permitting for new natural gas power plants amid concerns about high energy prices. That could worsen greenhouse gas emissions, though natural gas-fired power plants are cleaner than coal or oil plants.\nCoble said she believes the state remains committed to its goals, but she's pessimistic about meeting them on time because of money issues — including the Trump administration's impact on climate funding.\nThe federal administration has made cuts to state climate grants and dismissed climate researchers. It's also started rolling back environmental regulations as it tries to reinvigorate the country's fossil fuel industries.\n\"Under the [Joe] Biden administration they had billions of dollars going toward it, and I would have been far more optimistic,\" Coble said. \"But that money is in jeopardy, and those of us working in this field … don't even know if it's going to get deployed and how, what that looks like.\"\nRenewable energy\nMaryland has been moving toward renewable energy for decades, but as of right now, it's not on track to hit the goals set by the General Assembly six years ago.\nHalf of Maryland's electricity consumption is supposed to come from renewable sources by 2030, according to a 2019 law. Within that half, 14.5% of consumption must come from solar power.\nBut the state is falling behind.\n\"At this rate, we won't meet the 14.5% [solar] carveout by 2030,\" Paul Pinsky, director of the Maryland Energy Administration, said at a briefing earlier this year.\nHe was introducing a report published by the Maryland Energy Administration, which concluded renewables in Maryland and the surrounding region aren't growing fast enough to keep up with state goals.\nExperts also point to issues with the state's system of incentivizing renewable energy. Electricity suppliers can either provide renewable energy by buying \"credits,\" or pay a fine that goes to a state fund for clean energy grants.\nBut in 2023, the latest year for which the state has data, renewable energy credits met less than half of the state's goal and fines made up the rest. That's a big drop from previous years, and the state said it happened because it was less expensive in 2023 for electric utilities to pay the fine than to pay for renewables.\nA 2024 executive order from Gov. Wes Moore set another goal: 100% clean, in-state energy by 2035. The order told the Maryland Energy Administration to create a plan to get there.\nReaching that goal by 2035 is \"extremely, extremely unlikely,\" Pinsky said at the briefing.\nMaryland is struggling to build renewable energy within state borders for a number of reasons.\nIt can be expensive and difficult to build large-scale facilities like solar farms in Maryland, said Evan Vaughan, executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition's advocacy arm, MAREC Action. Land constraints, high land prices and a crowded transmission grid complicate such efforts, he said.\nA backup in project approvals on the regional electricity grid has also caused difficulties.\n\"While the state certainly does have a strong and growing renewable energy supply today, it does have some unique challenges,\" Vaughan said. \"You find … common trends across a lot of the smaller, land-constrained states on the East Coast in particular.\"\nAnother law sets a goal of 8.5 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2031, equal to over half of Maryland's total energy sales in 2023.\nHowever, that buildout is in peril. The Trump administration paused leasing and permitting for new offshore projects earlier this year. On top of that, Rep. Andy Harris, State Sen. Mary Beth Carozza and Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan have asked the secretary of the interior to halt a federally approved project off Maryland's Atlantic coast. There has not yet been a formal response from the Trump administration.\nWithout new leases for offshore wind, the state won't be able to achieve its goal, according to the Maryland Public Service Commission. The Trump administration's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" passed in July, will end tax breaks for renewable energy projects such as wind and solar.\nAdding it all up, advocates and experts agree Maryland is not where it needs to be.\n\"You keep on hearing people say, 'Maryland is a leader in clean energy,'\" said Adam Dubitsky, consulting state director of the Maryland Land & Liberty Coalition, a conservative clean energy advocacy group. \"And it is simply not true.\"\nIncremental progress\nSo, in light of the state's progress and aggressive goals, can Maryland meet its climate and energy goals on time?\n\"I am not sure,\" said State Sen. Malcolm Augustine, a Democrat from Prince George's County who serves as president pro tem of the Senate and chair of an energy subcommittee. \"But what I do know is that we're going to work hard to try to achieve that.\"\nThe energy package the General Assembly passed this year moves the state in the right direction, he said. It doesn't mean the state is backing off its goals but finding a \"more achievable route.\"\nThe goals remain state law and Maryland still takes climate change seriously, said State Sen. Brian Feldman, a Democrat from Montgomery County and chair of the Education, Energy and the Environment Committee. He was a lead sponsor of this year's solar siting bill and sponsored the 2019 law that boosted Maryland's renewable energy goal to 50% by 2030.\nBut some advocates felt there wasn't enough of an emphasis on climate action during the spring legislative session.\n\"Climate didn't stay in the conversation the way it should have,\" said Tulkin, the Maryland Sierra Club director.\nThe future is still cloudy for state climate action, though, thanks to the Trump administration's slew of changes to federal climate and energy policy. Among a host of other actions from the administration, a Trump executive order directs the U.S. attorney general to identify and stop state laws addressing climate change, emissions or environmental justice issues.\nPinsky wrote in response that the move was \"worse than irresponsible\" and disruptive, accusing the administration of interfering with state matters during a global crisis.\nEven so, other climate advocates note Maryland is moving in the right direction despite the challenges it faces.\n\"What we need to do is just keep taking steps forward,\" Coble said. \"We just keep chipping away at it, and if we continue to take two to three steps forward every year, it is a whole lot better than doing nothing, that's for sure.\"\nYou received this email because you are subscribed to the CNS Clients (CNSCLIENTS) mailing list.

    "content": "Cambridge commissioners remove solar cap\n\n July 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 483\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Cambridge City Commissioners adopted an ordinance at last week evening's meeting to amend the city's unified development code to exempt medium, large and community solar energy projects from the town's current 350-acre cap.The move essentially removes the cap, which was implemented in 2014, paving the way for a community solar project from Pivot Energy, a Denver-based renewable energy provider and independent power producer. Commissioners unanimously voted in favor of the ordinance to remove the cap.\nThe plan for community solar was first introduced to commissioners in December, 2024, when Pivot Energy's lawyer Anthony Kupersmith said getting rid of the cap would be critical to the project's success.\nCambridge City Planner Brian Hermann presented Pivot Energy's community solar proposal to commissioners again last week. \"The community solar projects are designed to provide opportunities for residents of the community who don't own their house, or are living in the woods and have shade, or don't want to look at solar panels,\" Hermann said.\nCommunity solar is a way for multiple individuals to share in the benefits of a single solar installation, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. \"The term refers to the pooling of resources to develop a community-scale solar energy project that provides the benefits of solar energy to a group or neighborhood,\" the USDE website states.\nAfter around an hour of questions from commissioners, Mayor Lajan Cephas thanked the gentlemen from Pivot Energy and attempted to move on to the next agenda item, but Commissioner Roche had one more question he 'demanded' be answered before voting on the ordinance.\n\"So at the end of the day, how do we know, and how does the state know that this power is actually for its intended purpose, which is to lower the utility rates of, in many cases, income constrained individuals, or the community, where it's located?\" Roche asked.\nKupersmith told Roche this word isn't neutral and lends authority to regulatory oversight from the Public Service Commission through an application, bonding, subscriber certification and annual reporting to ensure benefits, especially for low- and moderate-income customers.\nHermann and Pivot Energy representatives were uncertain of how many acres they will need for the new community solar project, but it will exceed the current cap. Kupersmith and Pivot Energy Development Project Manager John Shields made it clear that if the city does not remove the cap, Pivot Energy is willing to go to the state, which can supersede the city's code.\nCommissioners asked if there were decommissioning protocols for the end of the project's life or in case of damage. The decommissioning plan and bond would follow the city's existing zoning rules and Public Service Commission standards.\nWhen it comes to what exactly the community solar project will look like, Pivot Energy is keeping its options open.\nShields said at the current moment, there is not a drawn-up project plan. \"We'd rather kind of look at it more holistically if we can,\" Shields said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "EPA faults state on offshore wind permit process\n\n July 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Local News \n \n 525\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified that the Maryland Department of the Environment was mishandling a key offshore wind permit by misinforming the public about how to appeal it, prompting both technical corrections and political firestorms.The dispute centers on a permit for US Wind's proposed wind farm off the coast of Ocean City and could temporarily delay or complicate the project's future. According to the EPA findings, MDE improperly issued a federal air permit under the Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations and MDE has been ordered to reissue the permit with corrected appeal instructions or face legal backlash.\nRep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) said that the EPA's ruling was a \"major victory for the Eastern Shore, the environment and our local economies that are existentially threatened by this project.\"\nHarris cited environmental risks of offshore wind projects as disturbance of the sea bottom and ocean ecology, toxic hydraulic and lubricating fluids that could leak and the risk of turbine damage.\nHarris said a similar project in New Jersey led by Atlantic Shores led to the developer abandoning the project after the appeals. These appeals came after President Donald Trump signed an executive order after taking office in January that froze new federal wind leases and permits while reviewing existing projects.\nAccording to Harris, constituents are concerned over the impacts on Ocean City and commercial fishermen saying U.S. Wind has not honored its promise to keep turbines at least 17 miles offshore and allegedly now plans to build turbines as close as 10 miles.\n\"Writ large, the problem with Maryland is that we have not had a good energy policy for years exemplified by the fact that we have to import 40% of our power from surrounding states, including West Virginia and Pennsylvania, which generate their electricity from fossil fuels,\" Harris said. \"So it's unclear to me why we would attempt to brag about, you know, going to 100% renewable energy when we know that's probably not possible.\"\nMaryland agencies like MDE may not be fully equipped to handle federal delegations for such projects and ultimate authority is retained by federal agencies. Because of this, companies like Atlantic Shores in New Jersey canceled its project and plans to come back when the political climate is more favorable, according to a PBS news report.\n\"We received the letter and are reviewing it now. MDE is committed to ensuring all our permit processes are transparent and in accordance with the law,\" Jay Apperson, deputy director of communications for MDE said in a statement to the Star Democrat.\nHarris said he is categorically opposed to offshore wind energy but is not opposed to alternative sources of clean energy like geothermal and small modular nuclear reactors, which he said are much safer alternatives.\n\"Such as the Vienna Power plant that is scheduled to close in five years, and obviously has permitting to generate power there. Locations like that might be ideal for small modular reactors,\" Harris said.\nWhile the EPA identified procedural issues with how MDE directed the public to appeal the permit, Harris characterized the letter as validation of broader concerns about the project's approval and local opposition. US Wind did not respond for a comment. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Temperatures in the state have not risen 2.5° F since the 20th century. The 20th century ended 25 years ago, and temperatures have not risen 2.5° F since then. NOAA reports a temperature increase of 2.5° F since the mid-19th century.An increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere does not increase the acidity of ocean waters. Ocean and Bay waters area buffered solutions with an alkaline pH. Increased carbon dioxide absorption may cause a slight decrease in alkalinity, but cannot turn Bay water acidic.\nThe article states that federal data shows the state is experiencing increasing precipitation, higher probability of summer droughts and more extreme weather events. The fifth National Climate Assessment data was taken down because the data had been massaged to prove the assertions that droughts, floods, extreme weather events and higher precipitation levels were on the rise, when they have not been.\nThe article asserts that warmer waters will kill fish at an increasing rate, while noting that crabs will thrive and shrimp are migrating into the Bay. The \"will kill fish\" assertion is without basis.\nThe article asserts that low-lying flat areas make them more vulnerable to the effects of an increasing climate. What on earth is an \"increasing climate?\" Mr. Tidwell notes that \"we just have to stabilize the climate.\" Regional climates are beyond the control of humans, and they are inherently unstable. His statement is pablum.\nIt is apparent that the Chesapeake Bay is experiencing geological changes as evidenced by rising water levels and brackish water intrusion into land that affects flora. These were well described in the article. Attributing these effects and other imaginary effects to man-made global warming, as the article does, makes it, as a whole, a work of propaganda.\nPAYNE KILBOURN\nNeavitt \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Shrimp, an Eastern Shore tradition\n\n July 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1529\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Growing up on the farm, surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay as well as the many rivers, we ate many types of seafood, but shrimp was not my favorite dish.Shrimp has a long history in the Delmarva region, particularly in the Chesapeake Bay and its estuaries. While not typically fished with a large-scale commercial harvest due to gear restrictions like the beam trawl ban, shrimp populations have been present and studied for decades. Recent observations suggest increasing shrimp populations in the area, possibly due to factors like warming waters.\nShrimp have always been found around the Chesapeake Bay, which is replete with the marshy, muddy habitat they love. Shrimp like to bury in sediment and can be found in both the Bay and its river estuaries, from shallow to deep water. Around the last week of October each year, a sudden drop in temperature drives the shrimp to funnel out of the Bay and into the southern Atlantic, where the water is a little warmer.\nThe shrimping industry is most popular in the Gulf states of Louisiana, Alabama, Florida and Texas. In the last five years, shrimp sales volume increased from 275 million pounds to 415 million. The percentage of households buying fish has also increased from 44.2% to 48.6%. This growth is seen in all areas of the country.\nShrimp is an excellent, affordable meal option for families. Shrimp can be enjoyed as an appetizer, snack, main course or side dish. Shrimp is a great addition to many popular favorites as it's easy to toss some shrimp into a creamy pasta or grill up some prawns to top your preferred cut of steak.\nIn later years, I discovered shrimp and became a \"shrimp lover.\" My parents really didn't care for shrimp, so therefore when I became a cook in my own kitchen, I ventured into exploring many different foods. The same happens generation after generation, introductions to different foods.\nJUMBO STEAMED SHRIMP\n1/2 cup vinegar, 1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning, 3/4 cup water, 1 tsp salt, 1 1/2 lbs jumbo shrimp.\nIn a medium sized saucepan combine vinegar, Old Bay, water and salt. Bring these ingredients to a boil. Add shrimp. Stir gently to coat the shrimp in the liquid. Cover and steam for 5 to 6 minutes or until tender. Drain and serve.\nSHRIMP AND RICE\n1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup chopped onion, 1/4 cup chopped green pepper, 3 tbsps flour, small can tomato sauce, 1 cup water, 1/2 tsp hot sauce, 1 1.2 lbs pre-cooked shrimp, rice.\nMelt butter, add onion and green pepper, mix well with the butter. Mix in flour, stirring until bubbly. Add tomato sauce, water and hot sauce. Cook slowly for about 10 minutes. Add shrimp and cook slowly for another 10-15 minutes. Serve over cooked rice.\nSHRIMP SCAMPI\n1 1/2 cups olive oil, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 4 crushed garlic cloves, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp black pepper, 4 lbs raw shrimp (shelled and deveined).\nIn a large skillet, place olive oil, lemon juice, garlic cloves, salt, and pepper. Heat thoroughly and add shrimp. Stir well and cook until the shrimp are pink. Serve with rice.\nSHRIMP STIR FRY\n2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, 1 lb shrimp (peeled and deveined), Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 small head of broccoli (cut into small florets), 1 red bell pepper (seeds and ribs removed, thinly sliced), 8 oz sugar snap peas, 3 garlic cloves (minced), 1 tbsp finely chopped peeled ginger, 1/2 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce, juice of 1 lime, 2 tbsps light brown sugar, 1 tbsp cornstarch, pinch of crushed red pepper flakes.\nIn a large wok or skillet over medium heat, heat olive oil. Add shrimp; season with salt and black pepper. Cook, turning halfway through, until pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a plate. In the same skillet over medium heat, heat sesame oil. Add broccoli, bell pepper, and peas and cook, stirring and adding a splash of water if browning too quickly, until softened, about 7 minutes. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more.In a small bowl, whisk soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, cornstarch, and red pepper flakes. Add to the skillet and toss to coat. Add shrimp and cook, tossing frequently, until heated through, about 2 minutes.\nOLD BAY SHRIMP BURRITOS\nFor Old Bay aioli: 1/3 cup mayonnaise, 1 1/2 tsp Sriracha, 3/4 tsp fresh lime juice, 1/2 tsp Old Bay seasoning (plus more for serving), Kosher salt. For shrimp filling: 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 yellow onion (finely chopped), 1 small green bell pepper (diced), 2 cloves garlic (thinly sliced), 1 lb small shrimp (peeled and deveined, tails removed), 1/4 tsp ground cumin, 1/4 tsp paprika, Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper. For assembling burrito: 4 large flour tortillas (warmed), 1 cup cooked long-grain white rice, 1 cup cooked black beans (rinsed and drained), 3/4 cup shredded Mexican cheese, 1 cup shredded lettuce, 1 cup pico de gallo (drained), 1 avocado (thinly sliced), 2 tbsps chopped chives (plus more for serving).\nMake aioli: Whisk together mayo, Sriracha, lime juice, Old Bay, and 1 teaspoon water. Season with salt, if desired. Make shrimp filling: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add oil, onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden, about 2 minutes. Stir in shrimp, cumin, and paprika. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until opaque and just cooked through, about 4 minutes. Assemble burritos: Lay a tortilla on a serving plate. Add 1/4 cup each of the rice and beans. Top with ¼ each of the shrimp filling, cheese, lettuce, pico de gallo, and avocado slices. Sprinkle with chives and drizzle with aioli. Roll the burrito tightly and repeat with remaining tortillas and ingredients. Slice each burrito in half and serve with more aioli, Old Bay and chives.\nSWEET CORN, SHRIMP & RICE SKILLET\n1/2 cup basmati rice, 1 bunch scallions (divided), 1 medium red bell pepper (chopped), 6 garlic cloves (5 roughly chopped, 1 minced), 4 tbsps white miso, 1-inch piece ginger (thinly sliced), 1 1/4 tsp turmeric powder (divided), 1 tsp Kosher salt (plus more for seasoning), 1 tsp granulated sugar (optional), 1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper (optional), 4 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil (divided), 1/2 lb medium shrimp (peeled and cleaned), freshly ground black pepper, 3/4 cup water, 1 cup frozen corn (rinsed in warm water and drained), lime wedges for serving.\nRinse rice well, until water runs clear, then transfer to a medium bowl and cover with water. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Cook 5 roughly chopped garlic cloves and ginger in a pan for around 1 minute. Remove roots and ends from 4 green onions and roughly chop into pieces. Add chopped scallions to blender or food processor, along with the bell pepper, garlic cloves, miso, ginger, 1 teaspoon turmeric, salt, and sugar and cayenne if using. Blend until all ingredients are finely chopped and thoroughly mixed, then slowly drizzle in 3 tablespoons olive oil while running the food processor or blender. Blend until mixture is smooth. Pat shrimp dry and transfer to a medium bowl. Add remaining turmeric and minced garlic clove, and season with salt and pepper. Heat remaining tablespoon of oil in a 12-inch oven safe skillet over medium heat. Add shrimp and cook until opaque, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove cooked shrimp into a bowl just big enough to fit and cover with a plate to keep warm. Return the skillet to heat and add prepared puree. Cook on medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the liquid has cooked out and paste has darkened, 8 to 10 minutes. (You'll know it's done when the oil starts to separate from the paste! Reduce heat to medium and whisk in water until smooth. Strain rice, and add rice and corn. Drain any cooking juices from the shrimp into the skillet, using the plate to keep the shrimp from falling in. (Be sure to keep shrimp covered. Stir to incorporate everything, then bring mixture up to a simmer. Place in a preheated oven and cover tightly with a lid or sheet pan. Bake until all liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 23 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, thinly slice remaining green onions for garnish. Fluff rice with a fork, then scoop into serving dishes. Top with cooked shrimp and green onions and serve with lime wedges on the side.\nSHEET PAN SHRIMP\n1 lb. baby red potatoes (quartered), 1 1/2 lb raw medium shrimp (peeled and deveined), 2 ears of corn (cut crosswise into 4 pieces each), 2 links smoked andouille sausage (thinly sliced), 2 lemons (sliced), 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning, 2 tbsps melted butter, 2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, 2 tbsps freshly chopped parsley for garnish.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook potatoes until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain. In a large bowl, combine cooked potatoes, shrimp, corn, sausage, lemons, garlic powder, Old Bay, melted butter, and oil and season with salt and pepper. Toss until combined, then divide between two large baking sheets. Bake until shrimp is cooked through and corn is tender, 13 to 15 minutes. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Unfounded assertions in letter\n\n July 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 389\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Converting the words of scientists into layman's language is a challenging but important task for journalists. In the July 11 article about global warming the reporter cites state, federal and university scientists to describe its effects here in Maryland and in Chesapeake Bay. Payne Kilbourn disputes some of the language and assertions of the article in his July 19-20 letter. In the process he makes unfounded assertions himself.For example, the reporter cited a scientist from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources when writing that \"warmer waters will kill fish at an increasing rate.\" Mr. Kilbourn says in his letter that this \"assertion is without basis.\" The facts suggest otherwise. Warmer water holds less oxygen. Reduced levels of dissolved oxygen in Chesapeake Bay waters is one of the primary causes of fish kills.\nMore concerning is Mr. Kilbourn's assertion that the Fifth National Climate Assessment was removed from federal websites \"because the data had been massaged to prove the assertions that droughts, floods, extreme weather events and higher precipitation levels were on the rise, when they have not been.\"\nHe offered no proof for this claim. In fact, over the last five years there have been on average 23 extreme weather events per year that cause over $1 billion in damage whereas in the 1980s there was an average of 3.3 such events per year, adjusted for inflation (source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). Mandated by Congress, National Climate Assessments are produced every four years by hundreds of volunteer experts from agencies and institutions across the country and undergo thorough review. It is implausible at the least to imagine its findings as \"massaged.\"\nMore plausible is that the current administration deleted the report because it provided strong counter arguments to its position that climate change is a hoax. This would be consistent with the dismissive attitude about science evidenced by the president's repeated denials of scientific findings and by the deep cuts to the government's ability to conduct science.\nIndeed, work on the next climate assessment, due in 2027, came to a halt when all the federal staff who coordinate it were fired in April. So, yes, the climate is getting more unstable, as noted in the July 11 article, and fish will die at increasing rates in Chesapeake Bay. We just won't have the science to help us deal with it.\nBILL GOLDSBOROUGH\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chesapeake Bay needs bigger appetite for blues\n\n July 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 648\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Chesapeake Bay has a long history of challenges to its health and sustainability.Its ability to not only survive, but also to thrive are threatened by:\nRegular discharges of untreated wastewater from malfunctioning wastewater treatment plants in Baltimore.Runoff from farms, streets, parking lots, and development.Sediment discharges from Susquehanna River overflows at the Conowingo Dam.Constantly fluctuating levels of native species.\nIf history is any indication, the prospects of meaningful action on any of these challenges is not promising.\nThere is one constant on all of these challenges. When all is said and done about them, a lot has been said, but almost nothing has been done.\nAnother serious challenge that has not received widespread attention has been the steadily increasing numbers of blue catfish in the Bay.\nBlue catfish are not a new challenge.\nThey first appeared in the Bay over 50 years ago after they were originally introduced into rivers on Virginia's western shore.\nAll expectations were they would remain in those rivers since conventional thinking was blue catfish prefer a freshwater environment.\nDefying expectations, blue catfish adapted to higher salinity levels more than anticipated. As a result, they successfully migrated into the Bay where their numbers continue to expand.\nThey were then and continue to be classified as an invasive species. Their numbers are not only increasing in the Bay, but they are also in every major river in Maryland.\nWorse yet, they have no natural predators and are voracious predators of other native species such as blue crabs, clams, mussels, oysters, striped bass (rockfish), menhaden, American eel and other economically and ecologically important species.\nTheir appetites are so voracious they have been known to devour small blue catfish.\nScientists who follow the Bay ecosystem have concluded that completely eradicating blue catfish in the Bay is not realistic.\nInstead, the goal is reducing their numbers in the Bay to a point where native species can at least coexist with them and not become extinct.\nEfforts to reduce the blue catfish numbers have had relatively limited success at best.\nOngoing marketing efforts by Maryland's Department of Agriculture to promote eating blue catfish to chefs, consumers, restaurants, grocery stores and distributors have not made a dramatic difference in demand.\nApparently, many consumers view blue catfish as foul-tasting muddy water bottom feeders.\nIn reality, many who have eaten blue catfish, me included, have found them to be not only edible, but also nutritious, healthy and delicious.\nEven with greater human consumption of blue catfish, more action is needed.\nOne way to do that is to significantly increase the overall market for them.\nThat is the goal of legislation that was introduced in Congress earlier this month, the Mitigation Action and Watermen Support Act, or MAWS Act.\nIf approved by Congress and by President Trump, the MAWS Act is intended to increase blue catfish harvests for use as dog and cat food.\nAchieving that goal could lead to greater harvesting of another invasive fish species in the Bay.\nSnakehead fish are comparable to blue catfish in terms of being nutritious, healthy and delicious, despite their unappetizing name and appearance.\nGoing forward there are encouraging developments on the MAWS Act.\nIt currently has bipartisan sponsorship with two Republican House members from Virginia — Rob Wittman and Jen Kiggans and two Democratic House members from Maryland — Sarah Elfreth and Steny Hoyer.\nWittman, Kiggans and Elfreth are members of the Subcommittee on Water, Wildlife, and Fisheries of the House Natural Resources Committee.\nThe MAWS Act also has support from the Pet Food Institute of America, whose members make the vast majority of dog and cat food purchased by an estimated 65.1 million households in America who have dogs as pets and an estimated 46.5 million households in America who have cats as pets.\nHopefully, timely enactment and implementation of the MAWS Act will not only help the Bay with two invasive species but also serve as a catalyst for less talk and more action from elected and appointed national, state and local officials to address all the Chesapeake Bay blues. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She is a certified naturalist, a Master Gardener and a member of the Chestertown Environmental Committee.\nCoomer and other club members have beautified Fountain Park and Memorial Park with flowers and vegetation since the 1970s, transforming Fountain Park from a parking lot into a lush green space. The club also partners with the town on various beautification projects.\nThe club is seeking new members. Its next meeting will be held at 10:30 a.m. Sept. 2 at the Chester River Yacht and Country Club. Guest speaker David Culp, author of \"The Layered Garden: Design Lessons for Year-Round Beauty from Brandywine Cottage\", will give a presentation.\n\"You won't want to miss it,\" Boardley-Davis said. \"It will be an excellent presentation.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Underwater grass populations see slight decline in Bay\n\n August 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES | Section: Headlines \n \n 496\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Underwater grass abundance in Maryland's portion of the Chesapeake Bay — a key indicator of water quality — fell from 38,188 acres in 2023 to 36,794 acres in 2024, according to data reviewed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. This acreage remains short of the state's 2025 restoration goal of 79,800 acres.The annual survey of submerged aquatic vegetation was conducted by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science between May and October 2024.\nIn Maryland, despite an overall loss of underwater grass acreage, freshwater populations did well in 2024, and all or part of five rivers surpassed their restoration goals.\n\"The resilience we're seeing in freshwater SAV beds this year is encouraging and reflects years of targeted restoration, outreach, and monitoring,\" DNR's SAV Program Chief Brooke Landry said. \"But sharp declines in widgeon grass across the mid-Bay are concerning, especially given how quickly this species can respond to changes in water quality. These shifts underscore the need for sustained action to improve local conditions and maintain the habitats that so many Bay species rely on.\"\nSubmerged aquatic vegetation plays a critical role in the health of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. Commonly known as bay grasses, these underwater plants provide essential habitat and nursery grounds for fish, blue crabs and other aquatic life, while also improving water quality by absorbing excess nutrients, stabilizing sediments and slowing shoreline erosion. SAV also helps buffer the Bay against the impacts of climate change by sequestering carbon and reducing acidity in the water.\nIn the 2024 survey, rivers surpassing their restoration goals include the North East River at 165%, the Bush River at 133%, the Back River at 275%, the upper Chester River at 274%, and Mattawoman Creek on the Potomac at 110%.\nTwo additional segments reached 75 percent or more of their restoration goals. The northern Chesapeake Bay segment 2, which encompasses the Susquehanna Flats, reached 90% of its 12,149-acre SAV goal and the northern Chesapeake Bay segment 1, which is the area just south of the Susquehanna Flats, reached 88% of its 754-acre SAV goal.\nThe expanse of freshwater SAV populations was overshadowed by the loss of grasses in the mid-Bay, which supports underwater vegetation acclimated to slightly saltier conditions, like widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima) and sago pondweed (Stuckenia pectinata). Substantial losses were observed in Eastern Bay (-36%), at the mouth of the Choptank River (-41%), in the Little Choptank River (-83%), in Fishing Bay (-83%), and in Tangier Sound (-8%).\nWidgeon grass is the most widespread SAV species in the Bay due to its broad salinity tolerance. However, widgeon grass is sensitive to abrupt changes in salinity and water quality, which made it susceptible to loss after storms that delivered fresh, turbid water during the spring and early summer of 2024.\nAdditionally, reports from the department's SAV Program suggest that widgeon grass populations throughout Maryland's tributaries appear to have produced fewer seeds in 2023 than normal. Department scientists are looking into the possibility that widgeon grass seed production is impacted by abnormally high water temperatures. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Without adequate staffing, Eastern Neck could be shuttered, public access curtailed and the visitors center closed.\nThe cuts also could put migratory waterfowl at risk, end hunting opportunities and allow invasive plants to grow unchecked, organizers said.\nThe meeting is open to the public and sponsored by Citizens Connect, a grassroots initiative founded by Joan Caivano and Eileen Kessler to bring people together in Kent County to discuss the impact of federal policies on local interests.\nThe idea for Citizens Connect emerged from a Washington College class called \"Bridging the Divide,\" which explored finding common ground among people who disagree politically. The planning group, which includes people holding views from progressive to conservative, shares concerns about how new federal policies affect their community.\nThe group plans a second meeting for Sept. 15 at the Cultural Alliance, where Anthony Flaccavento, founding director of the Rural-Urban Bridge Initiative, will discuss how to communicate across political differences.\nFor more information, contact info@citizensconnectkc.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trump's bid to nix greenhouse emissions rules puts U.S. at climate crossroads\n\n August 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS msunnucks@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1095\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Trump administration wants to strike down federal regulations related to greenhouse and carbon emissions from motor vehicles and engines.The federal policies targeted by Trump have been key to efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions and curtailing climate change, environmentalists contend.\nKathleen Rogers, president of Washington-based EarthDay.Org, said the 2009 policy on the chopping block \"established that carbon dioxide, methane, and other climate change-causing greenhouse gases are considered harmful pollutants.\"\n\"This granted the EPA authority to regulate them under the Clean Air Act,\" she said. The Earth Day group is an environmental advocate and organizes events centered on the annual April event.\nThe Trump camp advocates for rescinding the Obama-era 2009 Endangerment Finding utilized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for greenhouse gas emissions regulations related to cars and trucks. The finding was used to argue for electric vehicle mandates instituted by former President Joe Biden.\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said late last month the 2009 Endangerment rule has been used to justify more than $1 trillion in federal environmental regulations.\nZeldin said the rollback \"will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America.\"\nThe policy shift must go through the federal rule-making process (including accepting public comments) and likely will face legal challenges from the environmental groups.\nThe move is just one of President Donald Trump's reversals of environmental and climate change policies from the Biden and Obama administrations.\nThat includes rollbacks of tax credits for wind and solar energy projects and electric vehicles, promoting more oil and gas drilling (including offshore and on public lands) as well as coal mining and nixing potential federal regulations of appliances and shower-heads. The Republican administration is also trying to nix tougher emissions mandates and electric vehicle goals set by California and other Democratic states.\n'ADVERSE IMPACTS'\nAdvocates worried about climate change don't like the Trump moves, especially with the continuing string of record-setting hottest years, intense heat waves and larger and more destructive storms and natural disasters.\n\"The potential health and environmental risks of eliminating all greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, basically increasing CO2 emissions could have a variety of potentially adverse impacts on our environment,\" said Masahi Kitazawa, a professor of environmental and occupational health at the University of California, Irvine.\nKitazawa said broader environmental impacts of increasing CO2 emissions include the potential for more extreme weather including heat waves and reducing PH/oxygen levels in bodies of water.\n\"These changes could damage marine ecosystems,\" he said.\nOther climate change observers worry about a warming planet changing ocean currents which could cause major meteorological disruptions.\nRogers worries that the Trump administration's actions will allow emissions from cars, power plants and factories to run amuck.\n\"Going forward, the EPA would no longer have the authority to regulate greenhouse gases or base its decisions on whether emissions pose a health and welfare risk. It would be forced to focus on the domestic 'energy emergency' and prioritize fossil fuel solutions,\" Rogers said.\nShe said the rollbacks and shift in climate change benefit oil, gas and coal industries that backed Trump in the 2024 campaign and his \"drill baby, drill\" mantra for energy policies.\n\"This is the same administration that has received hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign contributions from organizations linked to the fossil fuel industry, allowing these corporations to reap billions in payback for their support of the President,\" Rogers said.\nAn analysis by Climate Power (a Washington-based environmental group) found oil and gas interests spent $450 million last year supporting Trump during the 2024 presidential election.\n\"Corporate greed in the fossil fuel industry is smothering our opportunity to become a global leader in the growing renewable energy sector,\" she continued.\n'REAL-WORLD CONDITiONS'\nTrump has railed against windmills, in particular, and has characterized the Biden administration's and the Democrats' \"Green New Deal\" as a collection of wasteful policies that make the U.S. too dependent on foreign energy sources.\nZeldin and other Trump administration officials said rescinding the car emissions rule would save $54 billion annually for businesses and consumers.\nAmerican Trucking Association President and CEO Chris Spear welcomed the effort to erase the emissions rule and an accompanying Biden administration electric truck mandate that would have required 60% of new trucks and 25% of long-haul semis sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2032.\n\"This electric-truck mandate put the trucking industry on a path to economic ruin and would have crippled our supply chain, disrupted deliveries, and raised prices for American families and businesses,\" Spear said.\n\"Moreover, it kicked innovation to the curb by discarding available technologies that can further drive down emissions at a fraction of the cost. For four decades, our industry has proven that we are committed to reducing emissions. The trucking industry supports cleaner, more efficient technologies, but we need policies rooted in real-world conditions,\" Spear continued.\nEnergy industry groups — such as American Petroleum Institute, American Energy Institute and American Energy Alliance — and GOP lawmakers welcomed the Trump EPA move.\n\"The era of weaponizing environmental policy against American workers is over. President Trump and Administrator Zeldin chose prosperity and common sense over the climate cult's radical agenda,\" said U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis,, R-Wyoming,\n\"Wyoming energy is a vital resource, not an emission to be regulated out of existence by D.C. bureaucrats.\"\nConservative policy groups also welcomed the Trump emissions push,\nThat includes the Heritage Foundation (whose Project 2025 policy recommendations have been the blueprint for Trump's austerity and deregulation pushes, including rolling back EPA powers and reversing Democratic administration's climate change policies).\nThe Heritage Foundation argues the effects of climate changes \"are vastly overstated\" and should not be used to regulate the energy or automobile industries.\nDiana Furchtgott-Roth, director of the Heritage Foundation's Center for Energy, Climate and Environment, said the changes would be \"profound.\"\n\"If adopted, the proposal would ensure consumer choice of vehicles and help with affordability, performance, and safety,\" she said. \"For years, transportation has been the linchpin of climate regulation. If the justification for regulating greenhouse gases from vehicles collapses, the rationale for regulating other sectors, such as power plants, is even weaker.\"\n'IMMEDIATE, WIDESPREAD & DEVASTATING'\nClimate change advocates say an increase in emissions will have public health consequences, include more asthma attacks from poor air quality and the health impacts of more extreme heat waves and storms.\n\"The public health consequences will be immediate, widespread and devastating,\" said Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network.\nRogers contends that environmental deregulations that exacerbate climate change will impact public health via reduced air quality as well as heat waves and other extreme weather. She argues more destructive storms and droughts will increase prices for food, raw materials and insurance premiums.\n\"Everyone will be forced to pay, whether it be with their health or their wallets,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The bill focuses on maintaining accessory solar, which is residential solar that is generating power for a property's electrical use.\nAfter discussing several definitions they wanted to revise, the commissioners raised concerns about donating money to the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation. The commissioners have no problem with donating to agricultural land preservation, they said, but they want to make sure the money is going back to farms in Caroline County.\nThe county contributes $20,000 per year to the land preservation foundation. On top of that, commissioners said, when solar projects come into Caroline County on agricultural land, the solar company has to pay an agricultural transfer fee, which the county also donates to MALPF.\nCommissioners Vice President Larry Porter's concern is if the state funding was cut on MALPF would the county still receive financial help to preserve agricultural land.\n\"If we collect money in Caroline County, I want it to be used to preserve farmland in Caroline County,\" Porter said.\nNo official decision was made on donation of the funds, and the county will continue to discuss options at future meetings, the commissioners said.\nThe county officials will discuss some changes to the proposed bill and move the bill to an official legislative bill with the purpose of having the first reading at the next county commissioners meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Common ground: Citizens Connect launches with focus on saving Eastern Neck\n\n August 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 768\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Inspired by Washington College's class \"Bridging the Divide,\" Chestertown residents Joan Caivano and Eileen Kessler formed Citizens Connect, a forum designed to find common ground among people who disagree politically.Kessler said Citizens Connect's mission during the administration of President Donald Trump is to bring attention to the impact of federal policies and budget cuts on local interests.\nCaivano said since Trump was elected, there are many areas of concern — including immigration, health care and education — that the group seeks to discuss in a nonpartisan way.\nThe group's first public meeting focused on Eastern Neck Island, a major tourist attraction in Kent County and the Upper Shore.\nThe discussion, \"Eastern Neck: Can it Survive Federal Budget Cuts,\" was held Aug. 18 at the Unitarian Universalist Church in Chestertown, where Caivano and Kessler are members.\n\"The survival of Eastern Neck Island is in jeopardy,\" Kessler told an audience of about 80.\nGuest speakers included Friends of Eastern Neck President Bill Burton and Vice President Bonnie Ford. They described the work of their nonprofit organization, which has about 300 members and 50 volunteers. The group assists the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which maintains the refuge and whose work could be threatened by budget cuts.\nBurton, who has worked in environmental sciences for 44 years, said the group has been instrumental in projects such as repairing the slate roof of the 1930 lodge and replacing windows, a $55,000 expense. They also staff the visitor center, tend the butterfly garden and help with repairs wherever needed.\nBut those services could be threatened, he said.\nFord said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is part of the U.S. Department of the Interior, so cuts to the department affect the refuge.\nFord added that over many years, there have been cuts regardless of which party controlled the White House.\nIn Maryland, Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, located 12 miles south of Cambridge, operates the Chesapeake Marshlands complex of four refuges, one of which is Eastern Neck Island.\nThe Blackwater staff has diminished over time.\n\"In 2007, there were 23 employees. Currently there are 11,\" Ford said. \"And Eastern Neck currently has no on-site staff but relies on those from Blackwater.\"\nFord said although the problem seemed bipartisan, Elon Musk's email across federal agencies concerning voluntary retirement and mandatory buyouts led to further staff reductions.\n\"Some at the beginning of the year took the retirement offer and Blackwater staff dropped from 14 to 11,\" she said.\nAdditionally, an executive order signed Feb. 25 requires department heads to submit a reduction in force plan. The speakers said this has decreased morale among U.S. Fish and Wildlife personnel.\nThe reduction in force plan has not been made public, but Friends of Eastern Neck want to be proactive. Their goal is to avoid further losses and keep staffing at current levels.\nBurton said the staff is essential.\n\"Staff are not just there to mow the lawn,\" he said. \"They are specialists and biologists employing scientific techniques to maximize the refuge's potential. They do controlled burns. They raise and lower levels in ponds. They grow habitats for wildlife and much more.\"\nWithout their services, the refuge would close, Burton said. Friends of Eastern Neck said it is a place they cannot lose, drawing 70,000 visitors annually.\nFord urged attendees to join a letter-writing campaign to local, state and federal lawmakers. More information is available on the Friends of Eastern Neck website, friendsofeasternneck.org.\n\"Don't just assume because of politics they will not seek to protect the refuge. Seeing people care about this has been a very humbling experience for me,\" she said.\nShe said there is common ground between hunters, anglers, environmentalists and politicians on the need to \"maintain a refuge … as a refuge.\"\nPublic comment produced more ideas.\nOne person suggested involving the public school system by having children draw pictures of the refuge to influence lawmakers. Another suggested mobilizing people to raise awareness about climate change. Someone else recommended enlisting business bureaus.\nDucks Unlimited and other outdoor organizations have strong lobbying influence, said one woman active in politics.\nShe noted that U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who serves on the appropriations committee, and U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md. 1st) are particularly involved in this issue.\nPeople exited the meeting energized and united over the local issue, which pleased the organizers. Afterward, membership in Citizens Connect increased, Burton said.\n\"I think Burton and Ford did a beautiful job speaking across the political spectrum and to the community,\" Kessler said.\nThe next Citizens Connect meeting will be Sept. 15 at the Kent Cultural Alliance. The topic will be how to talk with people from different backgrounds and political views. Anthony Flaccavento, founding director of the Rural-Urban Bridge Initiative, will be the guest speaker. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge man urges water caution after 'flesh-eating bacteria' infection\n\n September 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 942\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Facing a life-altering bacterial infection from the local river, a local couple is urging the community to be more informed swimmers.A typical day at the shore turned a couple's lives upside down after a sharp step opened a wound on a man's leg and exposed him to bacteria in the Chester River last summer.\nFor over a year, Kyle \"Slade\" Register, of Cambridge has been fighting Vibrio, a \"flesh-eating\" bacteria found in local rivers.\nRegister and Audra Williamson were swimming in the Chester River on Aug. 16, 2024 when Register stepped on what they presume was a sharp oyster shell and cut a small, deep gash on the inside of Register's left foot. The couple quickly went to work cleaning the wound with peroxide and rubbing alcohol and scrubbed it with antibacterial soap before wrapping it.\nGoing to bed as normal, \"We never dreamt we would wake up the next morning to his foot being the size of a bowling pin with a red streak starting up his leg,\" Williamson said.\nRegister spent a week at the hospital in Easton before being transferred to University of Maryland Shock Trauma, where he stayed for the following month. While there, Register had four surgeries to save his leg.\n\"It's been a year, and he is still going to wound care twice a week,\" Williamson said.\nRegister is unable to work full-time with the wound, as the two-inch gash ended in the entire inside of his left calf and the inside of his left foot being cut out, with a wound vac attached for months.\nThe couple went from having a \"pretty normal life,\" to losing work and having their lives turned upside down, Williamson said.\nNow beginning to get back on their feet, the two are sharing their story as a precautionary tale to others taking a dip.\n\"We just want to prevent this from happening to others,\" Williamson said.\nAccording to the U.S Environmental Protection Agency, Vibrio are naturally occurring bacteria found in brackish environments like the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, such as the Chester River. In rare cases, swimmers can develop illnesses or infections if an open wound is exposed to polluted water.\nA \"tough construction worker type,\" who never thought twice about what was hidden in waterways, Register said his entire view of the water changed after that incident.\nA \"fish,\" all his life, Register now looks at the water with \"abject sadness.\"\nTaking it one day at a time, the Cambridge couple still drive around the Chesapeake Bay, estuaries, and areas like Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge to look at the water \"but I don't go in,\" Register said.\nLooking back on the treatment and recovery he has faced and the journey still to come, \"I don't want a parent to feel that pain,\" Register said and seeks to share his story with others.\nNot to scare people, but to help them understand the possibilities, Register said. \"The public needs to be more educated about this,\" he said.\nWilliamson encouraged checking out the local environmental organizations information and the EPA website before swimming or boating.\nRegister welcomes the opportunities to share his story and can be reached at sladeregister81@gmail.com.\nAccording to Shorerivers' Swimmable ShoreRivers Bacteria Monitoring Program Report, \"Is it safe to swim in the river?\" is one of the most common questions Riverkeepers hear from community members. There are inherent risks with coming in contact with water in a living estuary, and ShoreRivers works to understand the bacterial levels associated with enterococci, an EPA recommended indicator for human health risks.\nEnterococci includes more than 17 species of fecal bacteria and is found in the intestines of warm-blooded animals. High levels of enterococci can indicate elevated risks for human contact with pathogens and other bacteria, such as E-coli. While there are natural bacteria levels in local rivers due to wildlife and decomposition, there are also pollution sources such as failing septic systems and faulty sewer lines, pet waste, mishandling of boat waste, and some organic fertilizers that can pose threats to human health.\n\"There are additional risks with open water swimming that we do not regularly monitor, including vibrio, toxic algal blooms, and other biological and chemical toxins,\" according to the report.\nShoreRivers' seasonal bacteria monitoring program regularly monitors nearly 50 sites where people frequently come in contact with water, including popular swimming locations, marinas, yacht clubs, and towns. Swim Tester volunteers collect water samples every Thursday morning from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Riverkeepers then analyze the samples and distribute data on bacteria levels in the river, aiming to provide the public with the information needed to make educated decisions about their contact with the water.\nThe Swimmable ShoreRivers program utilizes the standardized EPA criteria for recreational swimming of 104 Colony Forming Units (CFU)/100ml for analyzing a single bacteria sample. Anything equal to or higher than 104 CFU is a failing sample, and anything below 104 CFU is a passing sample. Not all test sites are designated swimming areas.\nAccording to Shore Rivers, bacteria levels can change, particularly as a result of significant rain events.\nShoreRivers always recommends following best practices when recreating in local waterways including rinsing off after swimming, avoiding swimming for 24–48 hours after a rain event, and staying out of the water with open cuts or wounds to minimize exposure to potentially harmful bacteria.\nAs part of its ongoing work to protect and restore local rivers and creeks, ShoreRivers weekly bacteria monitoring reports are posted every Friday from Memorial Day to Labor Day at www.shorerivers.org/swim.\nThough the seasonal Swimmable ShoreRivers testing has wrapped up for this year, a full report on each regularly monitored site is expected in October.\nInformation on how to prevent and respond to possible infections, can be found in the Maryland Department of the Environment. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Sand storm: Federal cuts to beach erosion projects spark worries along America's coastlines\n\n September 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Adams MultiMedia | Section: National \n \n 892\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Beach preservationists and coastal communities are sounding the alarm over federal spending cuts for money allocated for sand erosion and replenishment projects across the country.The federal fiscal year 2025 budget did not include any beach erosion renourishment money for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\"They provided no funding for beaches,\" said Howard Marlowe, president of the American Coastal Coalition as well as president of Maryland-based Warwick Group Consultants LLC.\nMarlowe has tracked federal spending on beach erosion and replenishment projects for decades and said this is the first time the Army Corps' budget has been zeroed-out.\nBeach nourishment projects entail bringing in new sand to replenish shorelines and installation of dunes, sea grass and other natural buffers.\nThere are still funds for beach projects in federal disaster packages.\nBut uncertainty about the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and increased beach erosion from bigger, more destructive hurricanes and tropical storms as well as rising sea levels have sparked consternation about the future of coastlines. The Trump administration is looking at a major downsizing or reengineering of FEMA and turning over more disaster management and response to state governments.\nThe American Coastal Coalition (ACC), American Shore and Beach Preservation Association (ASBPA) as well as states and local communities that rely on federal funding to help counteract beach erosion are lobbying Congress to include funding in the next fiscal year 2026 budget.\nACC would like to see Congress allocate $200 million toward beach renourishment projects, citing historical and contemporary funding precedents.\nACC Executive Director Dan Ginolfi said the current House FY 2026 budget allocates $25 million to the Army Corps of Engineers for beach projects.\nThe Senate is currently in its budget process.\n\"We have been tracking coastal funding for 30 years. The inflation adjusted average is $166 million per year, and that is inadequate because several projects are only getting 85% of the sand they need,\" Ginolfi said.\n\"Dredges are in high demand, and there are several upcoming projects in FY26 (FY25+FY26) with tight environmental windows. This compresses the timeline heavily and only one or two bidders per project ultimately leads to higher costs,\" he continued.\nThe funding cuts are impacting nourishment projects on the Jersey Shore and could impact beaches in Delaware and Ocean City, Maryland.\nASBPA Executive Director Nicole Elko prefers proactive and planned out beach replenishment funding rather than approaching the issue reactively after hurricanes and other storms. \"$200 million annually would be a smart way to invest in federal beach management,\" she said\nWarmer oceanic temperatures have resulted in larger, more destructive hurricanes and tropical storms. The monster storms impact, flood and erode beaches along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts.\n\"Beach erosion impacts are becoming more severe,\" Elko said.\nGinolfi agrees.\n\"The need for beach nourishment has increased in recent years due to storms and erosion,\" Ginolfi said. \"Beach nourishment is the best solution for maintaining sandy beaches and protecting life and property from storms and wave attack. In order to reduce dredging costs, we need greater competition in the dredging market.\"\nElko said climate change has also brought higher sea levels and higher \"king\" high tides that can bring flooding and erosion.\nCurrent disaster supplemental beach and shoreline erosion funding includes $67 million to restore beaches in Sarasota and Manatee counties in Florida hit by Hurricane Milton, $2 million to repair the Marshall Levee System in Minnesota and $18 million for erosion mitigation work in Portsmouth, Ohio.\nElko said states and local communities usually rely on federal funding for beach projects, including constructing or replenishing dunes.\nSome of those projects have been fully reliant on federal money while others have 65%-35% (federal, state/local split).\nIn addition to their economic and tourism impacts, beaches are home to their own ecosystems and help filter oceanic waters and their dunes serve as buffers against floods and storm surges.\nBeach erosion projects are slated in Florida, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and other coastal states.\nJon Kramer, acting city engineer in Venice, Florida said local beaches impacted by Hurricane Ian in 2022 are slated for a $22.6 million sand replenishment project.\nHurricane Ian inflicted $112 billion in damage, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). That's the most costly in Florida history and third most costly in U.S. history.\n\"Beach renourishment remains a state and federal legislative lobbying priority for the city,\" Kramer said.\nOfficials in Sarasota County said right now their federal beach funding is coming from federal disaster and FEMA allocations with the area still feeling the impacts of recent storms.\nSome Florida coastal communities are also facing challenges with federal funding because of the Army Corps requirements of getting easement agreements from beach property owners.\n\"The federal spending cuts are not directly impacting our nourishment projects,\" said Tony Fabrizio, spokesman for Pinellas County.\nThe county includes St. Petersburg and Clearwater and was hit by Hurricanes Helene and Milton last year.\n\"However, we are unable to access federal funding because we cannot meet the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' requirement to obtain perpetual easements from all property owners where sand has traditionally been placed,\" Fabrizio said.\nElko said the easement problem has been a challenge for Florida beach projects.\nShe said there are some instances where localities, such as Dare County on North Carolina's Outer Banks, pay for beach infrastructure and sand projects themselves\nFabrizio said a new $125 million nourishment project is being funded by local hotel bed taxes and state grants.\nBut for the most part they rely on federal funding for all or most of the tab. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This year, they saw reproduction again.\nThe watershed fills a nursery tank at St. Mary's College of Maryland with power-washed oyster shells with circulated river water for two days, Ewing said. Then they place 2.5 million oyster larvae from Horn Point Oyster Hatchery on the Eastern Shore into the tank.\nThey wait two days for them to attach to the oyster shell before turning back on the circulated river water so they can eat the algae.\n\"When I was a kid, the oysters in Breton Bay were in such demand, it was hard to get them,\" Larry O'Brien, vice president of the St. Mary's Watershed Association, said.\nIn the Chesapeake Bay, oysters \"play a large role in supporting other aquatic life and the health of an ecosystem,\" the release said.\nOysters filter the water and build reefs where striped bass, blue crabs and other animals take refuge. Maryland designated many Chesapeake Bay tributaries, including Breton Bay, oyster sanctuaries to protect the population and make oyster harvest limited.\nState and federal partners had Breton Bay on the list for restoration, but it was revoked in 2018 due to low oyster population, poor water quality and lack of annual oyster reproduction, the release said. Community groups decided to step up and encourage future investment.\n\"What we're doing here is working,\" Ewing said. \"We are restoring the oyster population.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

GoodLife identified the damaged section of pipe, which was removed and replaced the same evening. The system was returned to full operation shortly thereafter.\nAn estimated 500 gallons of untreated wastewater were discharged, with 1,500 gallons recovered during the response effort, the press release said. The affected yard area was cleaned using vacuum trucks, and lime was applied by the Talbot County collection crew to stabilize and disinfect the impacted ground surface.\nThe event was reported to the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Talbot County Office of Environmental Health.\nAccording to the press release, based on the location of the sewage discharge and the quick response, the discharge did not reach any navigable or shellfish harvesting waters. Environmental Health has determined there is minimal to no public health risk.\nIf the public has any questions regarding the public health determination, they may contact Brennan Greene, director of Environmental Health, at 410-770-6880. For questions regarding the discharge or the corrective action, contact Ray Clarke, county engineer, at 410-770-8170. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — On Wednesday, Roy Meyer of the Climate Change Sea Level Rise Commission and multiple engineers presented key sea-level rise mitigation projects to the St. Michaels commissioners.Meyer said the projects were for the wellbeing of the town of St. Michaels residents and tourists.\n\"If there's one thing that impacts the town and the Maritime Museum in the same way, it's sea level rise and flooding,\" Meyer said. \"So I mean their campus is going to be flooded, our roads are going to be flooded.\"\nThe projects, which will be carried out in two phases, will potentially raise road elevations to five feet. An Advanced Systems grant with FEMA and a state grant will help the town cover the cost of the projects.\nPhase one involves raising Mill Street, Burn Street, the Harbor walkway and the end of Cherry Street to an elevation of five feet. It also includes demolishing and rebuilding Honeymoon Bridge at a higher elevation and wider size, rebuilding piers at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, installing a larger culvert system where Mill Street meets the tidal area, and adding a north sidewalk along Mill Street.\nThe cost of Phase one would be more than $5.3 million.\nPhase two will address Mulberry Street, Muskrat Park, and Church and Green streets. Phase two features two options, short-term and a long-term solutions.\nThe short-term would include modifying the parking lot and existing swale in the park to provide immediate relief from flooding by getting water off the streets faster. This solution is expected to be effective for daily high tides until 2050 and cost $708,366.\nThe long-term approach raises the roads, similar to phase one. It would also move the roads away from the pipe system and allow for overland flow, separating stormwater and tidewater.\nRaising to elevation five feet is the ideal solution, but challenges exist with a wall along Church Street near a cemetery and columbarium, engineers said. The long-term approach would cost $896,724.\nThe commissioners elected to proceed with prioritizing the already advanced Phase one construction plans and will follow up with the Maritime Museum to discuss options.\nThe commissioners selected the short-term solution for phase two, saying the town will develop a detailed long-term plan for Muskrat Park. The commissioners also said they would defer action on Mulberry Street until more clarity emerges from private development plans. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Halo Energy is the parent company of Halo Cordova.\nThe energy would go out to 500 to 1,000 small businesses and homes annually, Lossia said. At minimum, 40% would be reserved for low- to moderate-income households; those people would receive a 10% deduction in their electricity bills, he added.\nLossia said the property is zoned agricultural conservation. If approved, the project would be screened with trees and fencing. It complies with county zoning, Lossia and Talbot County assistant attorney Andrew Meehan said.\nPublic Utility Law Judge Kristen Lawrence resided over the virtual hearing. No members of the public attended nor wrote in comment ahead of time. A second public hearing, which is yet to be scheduled, will be held in person in Talbot County at a later date. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Uncertainty faces state renewable energy projects\n\n October 6, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARY BURKE Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 944\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — In August, the Trump administration revoked hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for Maryland renewable energy infrastructure projects.The Maryland Offshore Wind Project and the Maryland Solar for All initiatives took significant blows after President Donald Trump canceled grants for renewable projects across the nation.\nTrump has described wind and solar as \"expensive and unreliable energy sources,\" seeking instead to promote domestic fossil fuel production.\nSince the onset of his administration, Trump has signed 15 executive orders shifting federal policy away from renewable energy initiatives toward more traditional energy sources such as oil and coal.\nWIND PROJECTOn Sept. 12, the Trump administration filed a court order to reconsider approval of the Offshore Wind Project in its entirety. Despite a revocation of federal funding, Maryland Offshore Wind Project officials expect to win a legal challenge to the order.\n\"We intend to vigorously defend those permits in federal court, and we are confident that the court will uphold their validity and prevent any adverse action against them,\" Nancy Sopko, US Wind's vice president of external affairs said in a statement.\nThe Trump administration order is just the latest setback to the project. On Aug. 25, the administration filed a court order to revoke the federal government's approval of funding for a steel manufacturing plant in Sparrows Point in Baltimore County.\nThe factory would provide steel for projects Marwin and Momentum Wind, which are wind energy farms being constructed off Maryland's coast. The projects represent the first two of three planned phases of implementing offshore wind infrastructure in Maryland.\n\"The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (\"BOEM\") is in the process of reconsidering its prior approval of the Maryland Offshore Wind Project Construction and Operations Plan,\" the suit states.\nUS Wind, the developer behind the offshore construction project, filed a counterclaim on Sept. 3, contesting the Trump administration's environmental and economic concerns.\n\"Federal Defendants' decision to vacate represents a drastic departure from their prior full-throated support and defense of the Project, and Federal Defendants have failed to acknowledge or offer a reasoned explanation for their about-face,\" the filing in the U.S. District Court in the District of Maryland states.\nThe counterclaim also alleges that the revocation of US Wind's permits was due to \"political pressure … applied to the Federal Defendants' decisionmakers.\"\nThe Sparrows Point project is also slated to continue, according to Sopko.\nOn Aug. 29, the Department of Transportation announced that it would withdraw nearly $680 million from offshore wind projects, including nearly $50 million in federal funding for the nearly-completed wind turbine production facility in Maryland.\nThe Sparrows Point project and a dozen other wind projects lost federal funding due to a lack of alignment with the \"goals and priorities of the administration,\" according to a Transportation Department statement.\nSecretary of Transportation Sean Duffy indicated that these funds likely would be redirected into supporting the domestic maritime industry.\nAs part of a larger Maryland Offshore Wind Project, US Wind established the manufacturing plant in Sparrows Point to supply materials for the in-state construction of wind turbines. In November 2023, the Department of Transportation's Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP) awarded the $47 million in grant funding to help construct the factory.\nTalks of constructing a Maryland wind farm began as early as 2010, when the federal Bureau of Offshore Energy Management put out feelers for interest in wind energy ventures off the East Coast.\nIn 2014, US Wind, Inc. won a bid for the 80,000-acre lease off the coast of Ocean City that would be the base for its Maryland Offshore Wind Project facilities.\nThe wind farm project was approved for construction by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2024. Overall, the project was expected to cost around $2.6 billion.\nThe Maryland Offshore Wind Project includes the construction of up to 114 wind turbines, along with four offshore substations and a meteorological tower. If completed, the wind farm would be able to power over 700,000 homes across the Delmarva Peninsula.\nMany Ocean City officials and business leaders have long opposed the project, citing concerns that the turbines will disrupt tourism and wildlife and hurt property values.\nPhase 1 of the project's construction was anticipated to be completed in 2029.\nSOLAR FOR ALL\nThe Maryland Clean Energy Center, located in College Park, also saw a cancellation of over $62 million in EPA solar-related funding on Aug. 7. The grant was administered last year through the national $7 billion Solar For All program, which has since been canceled.\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the end of the Solar For All program, stating that the \"EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.\"\nThe Solar For All program, created by the Biden administration in April 2024, aimed to provide resources for residential solar projects in low-income areas. The grant to the Maryland Clean Energy Center would have helped to fund around 1,000 solar projects, adding a projected 10,000 households to solar power infrastructure.\nTrump has remained critical of solar projects' impacts on farmland, disapproving of federal investment in such programs.\n\"We will not approve … farmer destroying Solar,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"The days of stupidity are over in the USA!\"\nThe Department of Energy earlier this month posted on X: \"Wind and solar energy infrastructure is essentially worthless when it is dark outside, and the wind is not blowing.\"\nCritics pounced on the post as uninformed, pointing out that wind and solar systems use storage batteries.\nCalifornia Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's press office replied on X: \"We're excited for the Trump Admin to learn about BATTERIES (we have them here in California, and they've helped the Golden State shift to green, clean energy AND keep the lights on).\"\nThe Maryland Clean Energy Center declined to comment for this story. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Baltimore County residents are fighting a local landfill’s plans to double runoff into the watershed\n\n October 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ALEXANDRA MAREK Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 582\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Community members and lawmakers are pushing back against an effort by Days Cove Rubble Landfill to more than double the amount of leachate it discharges into two nearby rivers.Leachate is the contaminated liquid that forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or waste materials. If the state approves the request, the landfill in Baltimore County would be allowed to increase the daily limit from 12,000 gallons to 25,000 gallons.\nThe proposal is sparking outrage, and one Baltimore County councilmember plans to introduce a resolution to shut the landfill down altogether this month.\n\"The county government needs to take a position on this. There's no benefit to Baltimore County. It's completely beneficial to those making a profit,\" said Republican Councilman David Marks. \"It's time to not only oppose the permit, but also ask that the state not renew the lease for this property.\"\nMarks is not the only one raising concerns about the permit's impact on the community. Hundreds of residents and many county and state representatives attended a recent public hearing to oppose it. Speakers highlighted risks to the river's recreational use, harm to local ecosystems, and potential economic consequences.\nDays Cove Rubble Landfill is an 83-acre rubble landfill located in White Marsh, Baltimore County, near the Bird and Gunpowder Rivers. The landfill opened in 1991 and initially hauled leachate offsite to the Back River Water Treatment Plant, according to the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) factsheet. In 2023, the landfill began disposing of treated leachate into the watershed.\nDays Cove wants to increase its maximum discharge allowance per day due to the \"treatment plant's current setup and operational efficiency treating the leachate,\" according to the factsheet.\nThe landfill has a history of permit violations. From April 2023 to February 2025, the landfill exceeded its permit limits 20 times, according to the agency's website. They were fined $15,000 by the Water and Science Administration Compliance Program for exceedances that occurred in 2023, according to the factsheet.\nDays Cove Rubble Landfill did not reply to requests from Capital News Service to comment.\nAfter its hearing in Sept., the MDE pushed the period for public comment from Sept. 22 to Oct. 22. After review, the MDE plans to publish a comment response document and make a final decision on the permit.\n\"We encourage everyone who would like to provide comments to submit them to us in writing. We will carefully consider all comments as we make a final determination on this application,\" said Jay Apperson, communications director of MDE.\nDel. Ryan Nawrocki, R-Baltimore County, was one of the lawmakers to attend the hearing. He is concerned that the permit allows for \"backsliding\" and could lead to areas with low dissolved oxygen levels or \"dead zones\" in the river.\n\"People on the far left to the far right and everywhere in between are saying this is not a good project. You don't often get that in today's world,\" said Nawrocki.\nTheaux Le Gardeur serves as the executive director of the Gunpowder Riverkeeper non-profit organization. The organization works to protect, restore and conserve the watershed through education, advocacy and environmental monitoring.\nGardeur said he is concerned that the public notice for the permit application did not include key information, such as the presence of endangered species in the watershed and total amount of discharge allowed per day.\n\"It is important for people to understand that if endangered species are within the basin it would be reasonable to assume that the public notice would indicate that,\" said Gardeur. \"That should indicate stricter permit conditions, rather than looser permit restrictions.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Troubling water news washes down with summer rain\n\n October 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Columns \n \n 454\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As summer gives way to fall and we wrap up our seasonal Swimmable ShoreRivers program, we can't help but feel a bit disappointed by what our bacteria results have shown this year — from pass rates 24% lower than last year across our watersheds and our first ever site that failed to meet safe swimming standards 100% of the time it was tested, it's been impossible to see the data come in week after week and not have concerns.This spring and summer have brought more rain than usual — in May alone, parts of Maryland received nearly 9.5 inches of rain — five inches more than the 10-year average. June added another 4.5 inches, again above average. And while we know that rain replenishes our farms, gardens and forests, too much too quickly has consequences for our rivers. Stormwater runoff carries with it everything on the land — fertilizer, pet waste, sewage from failing septic systems and pollutants from roads — sending it downstream into the places where we're swimming, fishing and boating.\nThrough our Swimmable ShoreRivers program, we monitor bacteria levels weekly at over 50 recreation sites across the region from Memorial Day to Labor Day. This year's rainfall has meant more frequent \"fail\" results under the Maryland Department of the Environment's (MDE) threshold for safe swimming.\nHere's why it matters. The MDE standard for swimming areas is 104 colony-forming units of enterococci per 100 milliliters of water. That's a technical way of saying: once bacteria concentrations reach that level, the likelihood of gastrointestinal illness, skin infections or ear infections goes up. It's not a magic line where danger suddenly begins, but a benchmark informed by decades of epidemiological data.\nAt ShoreRivers, we believe the story doesn't end with failure — it begins there. Our job is not just to measure problems but to provide solutions. Rain will always fall, but what happens on the land before it reaches our rivers is up to us.\nSo how do we move forward? Together. We need investments in green infrastructure that slow and filter runoff, stronger agricultural best practices and upgrades to outdated septic systems and aging sewer infrastructure. And just as importantly, we need access to reliable information and shared values — families checking bacteria results before they swim, neighbors cleaning up after pets, and all of us recognizing that actions on land have impacts downstream and that these are issues that have to start being priorities at every level.\nThe higher fail rates we've seen this season are not reasons to give up — they're reasons to lean in. With science as our guide and community as our strength, we can make our rivers swimmable — rain or shine.\nBEN FORD, MATT PLUTA, ANNIE RICHARDS, ZACK KELLEHER\nShoreRivers Riverkeepers \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2025-10-14",
    "author": "MARY BURKE Capital News Service",
    "content": "Spotted lanternflies are everywhere — what you can do\n\n October 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARY BURKE Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 776\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Over the past few months, invasive spotted lanternflies have emerged in massive numbers across Maryland.Originating in Asia, the spotted lanternfly is an invasive pest that feeds on a variety of plants. The lanternfly was first detected in the United States in Berks County, Pennsylvania, in 2014. It is suspected that the species was accidentally carried into the United States through an international shipment of stone.\nAlthough the insect first appeared in the United States over a decade ago, it has only been seen in Maryland since 2018. Since then, the species has spread throughout 20 out of 23 counties in the state, according to the Maryland Department of Agriculture.\nWhat harm do they pose?\nSpotted lanternflies are not directly dangerous to humans. Although their flitting around can be irritating, the insects do not sting or bite. There also has not been evidence of spotted lanternflies being poisonous to eat or being dangerous to pets.\nHowever, because they feed on plant sap, spotted lanternflies pose a threat to the well-being of a number of plant species in Maryland. Grapes are particularly at risk of harm: their feeding risks killing off grapevines. They also enjoy feeding on maple and willow trees.\nWhen feeding, lanternflies excrete honeydew, a substance which is known to grow fungus. This \"sooty mold\" fungus will not directly kill a plant, but in large quantities, may stifle photosynthesis by blocking its access to sunlight. The fungal growth may also prevent crops from being sold.\n\"They're seeing damage, almost permanent damage, to things underneath of the trees,\" Jessica Boyles, the coordinator for the Maryland Department of Agriculture's spotted lanternfly response program, told Capital News Service.\nBoyles mentioned that she has heard reports of damage to landscaping, siding, and outdoor equipment such as grills and furniture due to honeydew and sooty mold.\nExcess honeydew may also pose another threat: attracting unpopular stinging insects, such as wasps, hornets and honeybees.\nWhy are they everywhere?\nSpotted lanternflies are notorious for hitchhiking to new places on cars and trains.\nBecause each female typically lays between 30 and 50 eggs, lanternfly populations can explode in just a few years. These egg masses can be hard to spot, closely resembling mud splotches.\nWithout native natural predators, lanternfly populations can develop under the radar over several years until they emerge in unignorable numbers.\n\"It really wasn't all of the sudden,\" Dr. Michael Raupp, a professor of entomology at the University of Maryland, said.\n\"They were really here for several years, but at low levels,\" Raupp stated. \"Now, because they've had time for their populations to increase, we're seeing them everywhere.\"\nWhat can you do?\nContrary to popular belief, some experts say that killing an individual spotted lanternfly does little to curb the insect's population growth.\n\"The thing that regulates their population are predators, parasites and diseases,\" Raupp said. \"So, by stepping on some spotted lanternflies, it's kind of like spitting in the ocean and thinking you've turned back the tide.\"\nInstead, Maryland's Department of Agriculture recommends installing circle traps, which capture spotted lanternflies without using chemicals that may put other insect populations at risk.\nThese traps wrap around trees to funnel spotted lanternflies into a dead-end container, and can be either purchased or made at home. It may also be helpful to dispose of egg masses if you see them.\nSpotted lanternflies prefer to feast on the Tree of Heaven plant, which is another invasive species from Asia. Removing a Tree of Heaven (roots and all) from your yard can help avoid attracting the insect.\nLastly, checking your vehicles before traveling can also help to prevent the spread.\n\"Make sure that you don't bring spotted lanternfly with you on your daily commute,\" Boyles said.\nUltimately, however, experts forecast that spotted lanternfly populations will eventually subside once they begin to face more predation and disease.\n\"Eventually, Mother Nature will take care of this, as she does with many of our invasive species,\" Raupp said.\nSome areas have already begun to see population declines due to an increase in predators and disease.\n\"We now have more than 1,000 observations of indigenous vertebrates and invertebrates eating spotted lanternflies,\" Raupp said.\nSome of these predators include spiders, mantises, chickens and pheasants.\nThis is not to say, however, that stomping lanternflies is futile.\n\"If you're killing one…you are making sure that that spotted lanternfly can't essentially quadruple its numbers,\" Boyles said.\nAs lanternflies continue to lay eggs up until the first frost, often in December, it can still be worth it to squash the pests, experts say.\nWhy bother reporting?\nCurrently, the state's Department of Agriculture is still accepting reports of spotted lanternfly sightings across Maryland.\nAlthough officials acknowledge that total eradication of the species is unlikely, reporting helps the agency to allocate resources to areas experiencing large populations of lanternflies.\n\"That information is vital,\" Boyles said. \"It does help us.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One of the issues that came up during conversations with farmers in Southern Maryland was invasive plant species.\nNurture Natives was created to address this agricultural issue and the broader environmental issue of invasive species.\nThese sustainable efforts helped the National 4-H Council select her as one of the 2026 4-H Youth in Action Award winners. Nurture Natives has planted 2.4 million native seeds, distributed 70,000 seedlings and engaged more than 10,000 young people to help protect native plants and pollinators, according to a release from 4-H.\n\"Pollination is what keeps our world functioning,\" Bonney said. \"Pollination is so key to both our agriculture and our environmental systems.\"\nJeremy Tidd, owner and founder of Bona Terra, looked for ways to give back to the community and get more engagement about his native plant nursery when he decided to start giving seedlings away for free as part of a grant application, he said. Bona Terra grows 30 native plant species and is working to give away one million seedlings a year.\n\"There's no shortage of seeds in the world,\" Tidd said.\nBona Terra became involved with Nurture Native's mission when Bonney called local nurseries to put pamphlets on display racks, Tidd said. Bona Terra invited Nurture Natives to the nursery.\n\"They saw that I was giving away seedlings and they wanted to volunteer,\" Tidd said.\nBona Terra and Nurture Natives partnered to decide how to run seedling giveaway events and what training sessions to offer, Tidd said. They had their first training in March.\n\"Every time the world changes it's because we've taught the next generation,\" Tidd said. \"Young adults … were taught … that we had to do something about it and now it's just accepted, common knowledge.\"\nNurture Natives is at the intersection of environmental stewardship and youth mental health, Bonney said. The organization is meant to help young people find meaning through environmental action who feel disconnected from nature or who feel powerless when hearing about the biodiversity crises.\n\"You might notice a lot of people who have a passion for gardening are older,\" Bonney said. \"A discussion that has been pretty consistent … has been how do we bridge this gap?\"\nBonney is a freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park and hopes to continue to grow Nurture Natives as a fellow with the university's Do Good Institute, where she will work on expanding the nonprofit's initiatives, she said.\n\"The coolest thing about the seedlings is it has made people brave,\" Tidd said. \"This is a learning opportunity. Plants are amazing and have so much to teach us.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This could delay or jeopardize rebuilding the striped bass population by the 2029 target — a goal set by fisheries managers at the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.\nAccording to the survey, the 2025 young-of-year index for Maryland was four fish per sample. This is slightly higher than last year's index of two, but significantly lower than the state's long-term average of 11. In Virginia, the index was 5.12 fish per sample. This is slightly higher than last year's index of 3.43, but still below the state's historic average of 7.77.\nTo address concerns for striped bass, the fisheries commission is considering stronger protections for the species. At their next meeting on Oct. 29, ASMFC's Striped Bass Management Board will vote on Addendum III — a response to the 2024 striped bass stock assessment and recommendations made by ASMFC's Technical Committee. The analysis determined that striped bass are overfished, and that without additional action, it's unlikely the species will rebuild to their target numbers by 2029.\nEastern Shore watermen have vocally opposed changes outlined in Addendum III, which would trim total removals and could add more closures. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Sewage seeping onto streets sparks Cambridge flood debate\n\n October 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 506\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Cambridge city commissioners met for a work session Monday to review a presentation from the \"Make Cambridge Resilient\" team and to ask questions about the project — and there were many.The initiative is a shoreline and stormwater flood risk-reduction project, but some commissioners and elected officials have expressed concerns about its scope and goals. The design phase is now 30% complete, but without secured funding and support from the city, county and elected officials, the effort may stall.\nCurrent goals include:\nDesigning and constructing a living shoreline.Creating a stormwater system with nature-based water storage and control features.Gathering public comments.Institutionalizing floodplain management and flood risk reduction.Developing a green infrastructure plan.Implementing additional nature-based solutions.Reactivating and maintaining the stakeholder group.Providing support to property owners to identify risk-reduction strategies.\nDuring recent City Council meetings, Commissioner Brett Summers raised concerns about toilet paper in the street, an issue caused by floodwater entering the sewer system through manhole defects. Director of Public Works Wayne Suggs said during the meeting that three spots remain where sewage and floodwater are still connected.\nSuggs said three elements must be addressed to control these issues: top-down flooding, pump station capacity limits and creek water entering the system.\nThe Trenton Street Pump Station, which takes in most of the city's stormwater, is 97 years old and failing. When floodwater enters wastewater lines, it is pumped to the nearly century-old station, which doesn't have the capacity to handle it. As a result, toilet paper and sewage rise onto the streets.\n\"So can this project help us with that problem — and when?\" Summers said.\nProject Manager Larry White responded that adding pumps at the end of streets, repairing older infrastructure and constructing a living shoreline will help with sewage issues, but the project itself does not cover wastewater.\nThe city has published a bid to rehabilitate the Trenton Street Pump Station, but it's a $7 million project.\n\"Even if we moved and we awarded the bid tomorrow for Trenton Street, it will be 18 months before that system can be brought online,\" City Manager Glenn Steckman said.\nSen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said a mutual understanding of the project's goals is lacking and needs to be developed.\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R- Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) expressed concerns about the project, saying there has been mixed feedback from constituents and comparing the initiative to the \"failing\" Strand Beach project in Oxford.\nOther concerns included insufficient outreach — particularly to Black and Hispanic communities and city park users — a lack of coordination with state agencies such as the Department of Natural Resources and the Maryland Department of the Environment, and long-term maintenance responsibilities.\nHutchinson said he contacted stakeholders listed on the project's website and many raised similar concerns.\n\"I had the opportunity to talk to DNR Secretary Kurtz, and he wasn't aware of the project,\" he said.\nSome stakeholders, including Debbie Cornwell with the Maryland Department of Planning, expressed concerns about transparency.\nCommissioners agreed to make the council chambers available for future public \"Make Cambridge Resilient\" meetings to improve transparency, but no further action was taken during the work session. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The show assembled horticultural entries, representing 175 of the best specimens currently growing in local gardens and numerous design entries, creatively expressing the joys of the coming holiday season — Halloween through New Year's.While entries came primarily from club's talented gardeners and designers, members of seven other Eastern Shore clubs also participated. And Young Gardeners (kindergarten to eighth grade) shared their enthusiasm and creativity with floral craft and design entries — TCGC's first flower show to include competition by youngsters.\nFlower show prizes were awarded in 12 different categories by officials, who assessed entries according to National Garden Club rules. Many plant-loving friends and neighbors attended.\nBoots Michalak chaired the flower show. She was assisted by a team that included horticultural experts Trish Reynolds and Pam Keeton, plus design expert Ingrid Blanton and Young Gardeners chair Gretta McDonald.\nThe Talbot County Garden Club has worked to enhance the beauty of the local environment since 1917 by supporting civic greening projects, maintaining public gardens and other public spaces, sharing a deep knowledge of gardening, encouraging the conservation of natural resources and fostering the art of flower arranging.\nNoteworthy projects include overseeing the gardens of the Talbot Historical Society, Talbot County Free Library in Easton, and the Fountain and Children's Gardens in Idlewild Park. The club has donated plantings along Easton's Rails to Trails and at the Easton post office and Christ Church. The club hosts outreach activities for students, people living with disabilities and the elderly, among others. There are currently 118 active, associate and honorary members. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",
