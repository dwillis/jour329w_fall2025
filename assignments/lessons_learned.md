# Lessons Learned

This is one of the few assignments in this class where I do NOT want the LLM to do the writing. I want to hear your thoughts. In your directory, create a file called `lessons_learned.md` for your submission.

Here are the questions I want you to address and I do not want your total response to exceed 750 words. You can include links to your work in this class or other sources.

1. How has your understanding of what LLMs are useful for in a journalism context changed during this class?
2. What are the biggest problems you've had using LLMs for the work in this class?
3. What specific advice would you give to fellow journalism students about using LLMs to understand news stories or archives?

When you are finished, add, commit and push your `lessons_learned.md` file and submit the URL of it in ELMS.
