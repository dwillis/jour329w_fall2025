    "content": "Seaweed boom? - The global market for seaweed could see significant growth; can the U.S. get in on the aquaculture and ecological wave?\n\n September 11, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; APG National Enterprise Editor | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 1208\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Is there a future for seaweed farming in the U.S.?Could seaweed farming see a big global aquaculture boom - along with helping clean up ocean waters challenged by climate change and environmental degradations via natural filtering systems?Rafael Cuevas Uribe and Rick Zechman want to find out - and see potential on both fronts.Zechman is associate dean of marine operations and Cuevas Uribe is a fisheries biology professor at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt (Cal Poly Humboldt).They are leading a new university effort to farm seaweed (bull kelp) off the far northern coast of California.They want to see if the U.S. can boost its overall production of seaweed - which serves as a natural cleaning filter for bodies of saltwater confronted by climate change and in need of environmental remediation.Right now, the U.S. seaweed farming is concentrated in Maine, Hawaii and Alaska, according to the Cal Poly researchers.U.S. kelp and seaweed production is barely a blip in a marketplace dominated by China, Indonesia and other Asian markets in a sector that is projected to grow to $14.3 billion by 2028, according to research firm IMARC Group.The Cal Poly school created a seaweed farm in 2019 leasing space in Humboldt Bay from the local harbor district. It recently harvested a small crop of kelp from that farm.Cuevas Uribe said the school's operation is for research purposes.\"Our system is purely experimental. A commercial operation would be much larger,\" he said.Graduate students help work the farm and with research into its production and viability. Its most recent harvest entailed analyzing kelp planted onto various types of ropes \"to test growth rates and viability\" with the aim of helping \"future aquaculture entrepreneurs,\" according to the school.· MARKETPLACE AND GROWTH POTENTIALSeaweed (or kelp) can be farmed for food and dietary uses - including sushi nori as well as for uses in soups, salads and snacks. It is an especially popular food in Asia, but could see growth as global diets look for alternatives to traditional proteins and face food insecurity challenges spurred by climate change and geopolitical conflicts.Zechman said certain types of seaweed can be used in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals as part of compounds and ingredients. Seaweed has long had herbal and homeopathic uses.Brooklyn-based business research firm IMARC pegs the worldwide commercial seaweed market at $7.5 billion in 2022, according to a new analysis released late last month. The group sees the industry growing to $14.3 billion by 2028 with an 11.64% annual growth rate between 2023 and 2028.\"The rising demand for seaweed in dietary supplements, owing to its nutritive content, flavor-enhancing, and weight loss properties, is primarily catalyzing the global seaweed market,\" IMARC writes in its August analysis.That bullish outlook has plenty of company.An Aug. 30 market analysis by Redding, California-based Meticulous Market Research Pvt. Ltd., sees significant growth potential with seaweed-based fertilizers.\"Recently, there has been a growing interest in seaweed fertilizers for higher crop production and soil quality improvement. Seaweed nutrients boost plant growth, enhance soil fertility, improve crop yield, and boost plant resistance to diseases and pests. This can reduce the need for inorganic fertilizers and pesticides, leading to safer food production,\" the group writes in its research report.Fertilizer supply chains have also been recently challenged by U.S. and European sanctions against Russia and Belarus - two of the leading fertilizer producers - over the Ukraine war.Another August report by the World Bank sees substantial growth in the seaweed aquaculture space.The international financial institution sees the potential for a $11.8 billion boom in growth in seaweed farming by 2031 with potential gains in using seaweeds/kelps in pet food, animal feed, nutritional supplements, protein alternatives and methane reducing additives.\"Seaweed farming demonstrates how development, climate and nature work together to generate value and uplift communities. Seaweed farming will be a source of nutrition security as well as an alternative to synthetic fertilizer,\" said Martien van Nieuwkoop, World Bank's global director for agriculture and food in a statement last month on the growth potentials.· HELPING THE OCEANS, ECOSYSTEMS AND THE PLANETFor Zechman, it's not just about monetary gains and an industry boom. He sees more seaweed cultivation as a way to help clean up ocean waters.He said seaweed in animal feed could reduce methane emissions from cows.The world's 1 billion cows produce an estimated 40% of global methane emissions through manure and 'burping' - a contributor to climate change, according to the Environmental Defense Fund.Seaweed-based animal feed could help reduce cow burps and flatulence.Zechman said kelp beds off the California coast have been decreasing significantly because of a decline in sea stars. The sea stars feed on sea urchins, which feed on kelp and seaweed. More sea urchins mean less seaweed which helps keep ocean waters clean via their natural filtering.\"The technology that's involved in starting a farm for seaweed can also be used for conservation,\" he said.· U.S. growth and market potentialSo, what about the U.S. getting in on a potential seaweed boom?Global seaweed aquaculture production has grown to 35 million tons annually.Data from FAO in 2019 showed North American seaweed production at 23,000 tons.Ninety-eight percent of the seaweed harvested globally over the past two decades has occurred in Asia with China (57%) and Indonesia (29%) leading the marketplace, according to a 2022 study by researchers with China's Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University.Other major seaweed cultivating markets include South Korea, the Philippines and Japan. Isolated and food-challenged North Korea has accounted for 1.68% of the world's seaweed farming, according to Fujian researchers' analysis.Currently, U.S production is barely a blip in the global marketplace.The Western Hemisphere has only accounted for 1.36% of global seaweed/kelp farming the past two decades, according to U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization date cited in the Fujian study.Chile has accounted for 88% of the total.That's where the Cal Poly efforts come in, according to Cuevas Uribe and Zechman.They want to see how their farming efforts work out and whether more cultivation can be brought to California, the Pacific coast and other domestic coastlines.Cuevas Uribe said pollution levels and other external factors such as oil drilling and other commercial marine uses could mean the waters are not clean enough for seaweed farming for food production and other commercial uses.But seaweed aquaculture and its natural filtering could help those same bodies of water - including the dead zones and environmentally challenged areas of the Gulf of Mexico and Chesapeake Bay, according to the U.S.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Kelp forests can grow along coastal areas in temperate climates, such as the Puget Sound, helping fish and other marine life, according to NOAA.Seaweed is best grown and cultivated on coastlines with inlets and protected bays.\"It requires fairly calm inland waters,\" Cuevas Uribe said, pointing to places such as the Atlantic coastline of Maine. \"It's got to be sheltered waters.\" \n \n Caption: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/CREATIVE COMMONS/JAKUB HA£UN\n \nSeaweed farmers in Myanmar\n \nRAIYAN I MUHARRAMAH/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS\n \nAsian markets - including China, Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea - accounts for the vast majority of seaweed and kelp aquaculture with projections of global economic boom for the sector.\n \nCOURTESY CAL POLY HUMBOLDT\n \nCal Poly students unload a harvest from Humboldt's commercial, open-water seaweed farm.\n \nPETER SOUTHWOOD/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS\n \nA kelp forest off New Zealand's Hen and Chicken Islands \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Partner of oyster company petitions for dissolution - Petition follows history of legal violations by company's other partners\n\n October 19, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: A3 | Section: News \n \n 688\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE-A majority partner at Orchard Point Oyster Company is petitioning to judicially dissolve the company due to the two other partners' previous legal violations.The petition, filed Oct. 2 in Queen Anne's County Circuit Court by Orchard Point partner Hal McBee, asks the court to dissolve the company, appoint a receiver to take charge ofits assets and operations, and later liquidate these assets.The need for the petition, McBee said, stemmed from his ongoing concerns with the actions ofOrchard Point's two other partners, Scott Budden and Brian Connelly, and the duo's alleged mishandling ofthe company's operations.After Orchard Point's formation in 2018, the three men were appointed to different roles: Budden as president, Connelly as treasurer and McBee as secretary.Budden and McBee each have 40% ofstocks in the company and Connelly has 20%.Both Budden and Connelly share the responsibility ofmaintaining Orchard Point's permits and registration cards.Though McBee was only responsible for Orchard Point's nursery, which is located at his personal residence, his name is on the aquaculture lease used by the whole company.As the lease holder, McBee said he was made aware earlier this year that the company was operating without renewed permits for 2023 and attempted to stop the two other partners from continuing their work.But when McBee headed into the office one day, he heard the fridge running and discovered 3,000 freshly harvested oysters obtained without an up-to-date permit-a blatant violation, which prompted him to approach the Maryland Natural Resources Police in March.In an interview, McBee said he felt reporting his partners was the only thing he could do. And if he didn't report it, he would be part of the problem, he said.All three men were charged with numerous Department ofNatural Resources permitting violations in April, including. Charges were later dropped for McBee.Budden and Connelly were both found guilty ofengaging in aquaculture without a permit on July 6. Each received probation before judgment and several hundred dollars in fines.And on July 7, Budden was again charged by DNR with failing to obtain a permit for not having authorization for wet storage and operating wet storage outside the boundaries ofa lease in connection to issues in 2022.The lease in question was under McBee's and Connelly's names.McBee's petition also asserts that Orchard Point is operating under McBee's Tidal Fish Dealer license, a state-issued license that gives the company the ability to process, pack, resell, market or deal fish caught in tidal waters.In the petition, an attorney for McBee said the continued use ofhis license by the company, especially considering past unlawful oyster harvesting, creates a risk to him and administrative action from the DNR.Damages to property McBee contributed to Orchard Point were also raised as points of contention.According to the petition, McBee allowed the company to use two ofhis workboats, a 3,600 square-foot office space converted into an oyster processing plant with offices, two residential properties in Stevensville and various pieces of aquaculture equipment.The workboats were utilized under the assurance from Budden and Connelly that Orchard Point would purchase the two boats for their original cost - $150,000. However, the boats were never purchased and no rent was paid for the use ofthe two boats, according to the petition. Failure to properly maintain the boats also incurred damages in excess of$30,000.The two other partners of Orchard Point vacated the company's Stevensville office space on Sept. 1 and failed to remit additional rent or remove alterations made to the office, resulting in property damage ofover $25,000, the petition stated.McBee's capital contributions and loans since 2018 totaled over $250,000 in financing and tangible property.According to the petition, the relationship between McBee and Orchard Point's other shareholders has \"deteriorated to a point where Mr. McBee is no longer consulted regarding Orchard Point's operations or finances.\"Budden declined to comment on the peti-tion. The Star Democrat was unable to reach Connelly in time for publication ofthis article.No further documents have been filed in the circuit court at this time. \n \n Caption: COURTESY oF MPT\n \nOrchard Point Oyster Company in Stevensville manages oysters the company grows on a float lease in Eastern Bay. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Shockley said they would be talking about the future of the oyster industry.\"With respect to environmental markets, with respect to creating a new, better way forward for the watermen to be able to profit, not only from the products they bring in, but also from the results and the value of those products once they go out in the market,\" he added.Shockley said it was \"fantastic\" to give Lierman a tour. He said he wants Lierman to know how beneficial oysters can be in cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay. He called oysters \"mother nature's natural filtration system.\" \"We've now got some guidelines on how we can use oysters to do that work, to clean that water, based on an economic incentivized platform,\" he said. \"The watermen community can be a major player in making those things happen.\" Before the tour began, Pfeffer said he was excited to show Lierman \"all of the wonderful things that are going on here.\" \"I hope that we can continue (the) great relationship that Dorchester County has with the comptroller's office,\" he said.On her final stop in Easton, Lierman learned more about the Eastern Shore's designated regional navigator for trafficking victims, For All Seasons.\"When I was a state delegate, I set up legislation to create a system of regional navigators for trafficking victims so that they would always have one designated place to go in their area,\" she said.Lierman said she is learning about the work For All Seasons does in behavioral health and rape crisis treatment.After that final stop, Lierman said she was off to to the Supreme Court of Maryland to commemorate a judge.\"It's always great to be on the Shore,\" she said of her visit.Reporter Tom McCall contributed to this article. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nBrooke Lierman, Comptroller of Maryland, at left, speaks with Kristy Mirando, director of Victim Services and Beth Anne Dorman chief executive officer of For All Seasons.\n \nTOMMCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nComptroller of Maryland Brooke Lierman visits with staff of For All Seasons and other Talbot County officials.

And Fisherman's Inn donated cocoa and apple cider to benefit the Not My Child Program.\nAs the skies began darkening, the crowd began gathering at the site of the trees, waiting for a special guest to light up the area. Bob Timms of Kent Island Methodist Church gave a blessing of the fleet and Captain Buck Lynch, of the \"Stephanie II\" Head Boat and representing the Waterman's group, gave moving welcoming remarks.\n\"We need you and you need us,\" he told the crowd.\n\"By working together we can make things better.\" Sounds of sirens came moments later with shouts of \"Santa\" by the youngest attendees. Sure enough, here he and Mrs. Claus came, escorted by members of the Kent Island Volunteer Fire Department.\nCommissioner Jack Wilson attended the event, and he estimated that the crowd was three times more than in previous years.\n\"I love this event,\" Wilson said. \"Here we highlight the important work of the watermen in our own community.\nThis is what small town America is all about.\" \n \n Caption: REBECCA PLACEK\n\n 'Hark the Herald Angels Sing', God Bless America, Snoopy and water scenes were a few of the many themes on this year's tree.\n\n LAURA TAYMAN\n\n Camden Luecking participates at the Queenstown Lions Club's craft table at this year's event put on by the Queen Anne's County Waterman's Association.\n\n LAURA TAYMAN\n\n Santa and Mrs. Claus flip the switch to light the crab basket Christmas trees at this year's event put on by the Queen Anne's County Waterman's Association. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Appreciating oysters\n\n January 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1416\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Having grown up on the Eastern Shore, the oyster has been a much-appreciated seafood in my life.My mother made some of the greatest tasting oyster fritters on the Mason Dixon line. There are no watermen in my family, but we lived close enough to the water to respect the life of the waterman and the delicious delicacies that were a result of their hard work.\nIn our local area here, the most popular oyster varieties include Malpeques, Well Fleet, Blue Points, Delaware Bay, Chesapeake Bay, Chincoteagues, Apalachicola Bay and Gulf Coast.\nEast Coast oysters range from slightly salty to sharp salt flavor (Chesapeake, Delaware and Gulf Coast oysters have a light salt taste; all others have a sharper salty taste).\nThe Chesapeake Bay has been home to oystering since the early 19th century. Chesapeake Bay skipjacks are the last commercial sailing vessels in the United States.\nThe dredge boats once numbered in the thousands. Today only about a dozen or so remain.\nSkip jacks are limited to 150 bushels of oysters daily. The dredging season runs from November through March 1. The recent ice has made it impossible for the boats to get out to perform their work — cutting into the ice and cutting into the pockets of our waterman and their families. Check your local newspapers and the Facebook posts of local fire departments, churches and organizations with upcoming oyster dinners and roast coming up for their fundraising events.\nI know that many seafood markets are featuring fresh oysters in the shell or by the pint and quarts or opened for you. I like to open my own — eating them on the half shell or cooking them fresh.\nTry going down to the docks and getting them from the waterman themselves. Support a trade that is slowly leaving our Eastern Shore. Thank a waterman who goes out in all kinds of weather laboring in a trade they must love that is full of obstacles. The weather has cleared, and the watermen are returning to the trade they love. I am on the way to the docks for oysters to prepare some of my favorite seafood dishes.\nEASTERN SHORE OYSTER FRITTERS\nDrain 1 quart of oysters, reserving the juice, and set aside. Beat 2 eggs, add the reserved juice to the egg and add Worcestershire sauce to taste. Add 1 1/2 cups flour with 1 1/2 tsps baking powder and mix well. Add the oysters and lightly mix. Fry in hot oil, browning on both sides. Drain on a paper towel and serve warm. When dropping the fritters in the oil, make sure you have at least 3 oysters to a fritter.\nTRADITIONAL MARYLAND OYSTER STEW\nIn a large saucepan, cook one-pint fresh shucked oysters, with juice, over low heat until edges begin to curl. Add 1 quart of milk, 1/4 cup butter, salt and pepper to taste. You can sprinkle some Old Bay seasoning on top if desired slowly, but do not boil. Serve hot with oyster crackers if desired.\nSCALLOPED OYSTERS\nIn a greased two-quart casserole, place alternate layers of oysters and fresh cracker crumbs, doting each layer with butter. For this process you will need one quart of oysters with liquid, 2 to 3 cups fresh crushed crackers and 1/2 cup butter or 1 stick margarine. You can also sprinkle each layer with salt and pepper to taste. End with a layer of crumbs, and pour one to two cups of milk over the top. Dot the top with remaining butter or margarine and bake at 350 degrees until browned, about 40 to 50 minutes. Makes 6 generous servings.\nOYSTER POT PIE\nIn a large saucepan place 5 or 6 diced potatoes, cleaned and peeled, with 5 or 6 carrots, 2 to 3 cleaned and diced onions, 1/2 pound of chopped ham, and 4 strips of uncooked bacon. Cook until done and add salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp parsley flakes and 1/2 tsp oregano. Mix 1 pint crushed tomatoes and the liquor of one pint of oysters. Add this to the already cooked ingredients. Bring to a boil; thicken with some cornstarch. When thick, add one pint of oysters. Cook until the oysters have curled edges. Pour into a baking dish lined with your favorite crust and place a crust over the top. Slightly prick the top crust with a fork, bake at 400 degrees until brown. This is so delicious for supper on a wintry day.\nBACON OYSTER LETTUCE TOMATO\n1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup cornmeal, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper, 2 dozen oysters (freshly shucked), 12 slices thick-cut bacon, vegetable oil (for frying; about 5 cups), 8 slices brioche or white sandwich bread toasted, mayonnaise, bibb lettuce, and sliced tomatoes. Whisk flour, cornmeal, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Working in batches, toss oysters in flour mixture, transfer to a plate. Working in batches, cook bacon in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium heat until crisp, 10–12 minutes per batch; drain on paper towels. Pour oil into a skillet with bacon fat to a depth of one inch and heat over medium-high heat until oil bubbles immediately when a pinch of cornmeal mixture is added. Working in batches, fry oysters, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about four minutes. Drain on paper towels, season with salt and pepper. Build sandwiches with mayonnaise, lettuce, tomatoes, bacon and fried oysters and serve.\nOYSTER CORNBREAD STUFFING\n8 tbsps unsalted butter (divided), 4 stalks celery (finely chopped), 1/2 yellow onion (finely chopped), 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 tsp rubbed sage, 1 tsp dried rosemary, 1 tsp dried thyme, 1/2 tsp coarse ground black pepper, 6 cups cornbread cubes, 18 ounces oysters (chopped, liquor reserved), 2 cups chicken broth, 2 large eggs. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and spray a 9x13 baking dish with vegetable oil spray. Add 4 tbsps unsalted butter to a large skillet on medium heat. Add in the celery and onions, cook for 6-8 minutes until translucent. Add in the salt, sage, rosemary, thyme, and black pepper and stir. To a large bowl add the cornbread cubes, vegetable mixture, and oysters and toss. In a second bowl whisk together the reserved oyster liquor, chicken broth, eggs, and melted butter. Pour the mixture over the bowl and toss gently to moisten the cornbread cubes. Pour the mixture into your baking dish and bake, uncovered, for 30-35 minutes until golden brown.\nSINGLE FRIED OYSTERS\n1 pint freshly shucked raw oysters, 2 cups buttermilk, 1¼ cup fine yellow cornmeal, ¾ cup all-purpose flour, 1 tbsp Creole seasoning, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 quart peanut oil. While the oil heats, pour the oysters into a colander or strainer and let them drain. Then, rinse with fresh water to wash off any debris or shell fragments. Pour the buttermilk into a medium-sized bowl and dunk the drained oysters. Let them marinate for 15 to 20 minutes. Place the cornmeal, flour, creole seasoning and salt in a shallow bowl or pie plate and whisk to combine. Remove the oysters from the buttermilk one at a time and dredge them in the cornmeal mixture. Toss gently and make sure they are well coated, then shake any excess bread off. Place the coated oysters on a metal cooling rack until all of them have been coated. Letting them sit for a few minutes helps to fuse the breading and buttermilk and keeps the breading from falling off when they are fried. Place a large stockpot, Dutch oven, or cast iron skillet with high sides over medium-high heat and add one to two inches of oil. When the oil reaches 370 degrees, carefully add the oysters, one at a time to fry. Depending on the size of your pan, it works best to fry in batches and only cook six to eight at a time. You do not want to crowd them. (Maintain a consistent heat of 370 degrees by increasing or decreasing the heat under the pan.)Let the oysters fry for about two to three minutes, stirring occasionally or until the breading is light golden brown and the meat is opaque with the edges slightly curled. Use a wire kitchen spider or slotted spoon to remove them from the oil. Place on a paper towel or wire cooling rack to drain. Repeat until all of the oysters are fried and serve immediately. Optional, garnish with fresh lemon or lime slices and serve with your choice of sauce and sides. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maritime Museum hosts watermen's stories\n\n January 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Business \n \n 992\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS — A crowd of 100 people gathered at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum on Jan. 11 to hear story swaps from seven watermen.Big storms and big hauls were remembered, as were the regulations, cost of gas and Venezuelan crab meat that made net profits difficult.\nThese salty tales from yesterday were moderated by Brent Lewis.\nThis was a rock star moment for these men and one woman, who normally get up way before dawn and head out in the darkness to find oysters and crabs. The crowd listened attentively and often gave hearty laughs.\nWaterman and politician George O'Donnell offered the age-old chestnut, \"If you don't know how to cuss, you buy a work boat, and you will learn real fast.\"\nThe event was recorded for posterity by the museum at the Van Lennep Auditorium, and it was sponsored by the Upper Shore Regional Folklife Center. On top of the 100 guests present, there were another 30 on Zoom.\nBeing a waterman is tough. There is no job security. There is no health insurance. If they get injured, they are out of work, and there certainly is no pension or 401(k).\n\"If you wake up a watermen, every day you wake up with nothing all over again. You gotta be a welder, you gotta be a carpenter, you gotta be a mechanic, you gotta be a bookkeeper,\" O'Donnell said.\nAnd yet there is a glimmer in the eyes of these watermen who love it.\nThe watermen speaking at the event included George O'Donnell, Calvert Thompson, Jeff Harrison, Rachel Fazenbaker, Eugene Austin, Joey Sadler and Troy Wilkins. From Miles River to Love Point to Harris Creek and many secret nooks on the Bay, they worked many different rivers on the Eastern Shore.\nSometimes there are big storms with 50 knots of wind and lightning. If you are out there, there is no place to hide, they said. More than one described the momentary blindness that comes after a big lightning strike out on the water.\nThe watermen shared the stories of times they thought they might not make it back to shore.\n\"I had a five gallon bucket, and I was bailing for all I could. The floor opened up and you could see where the gas had been at, but it was burning. Just flames, on top of the engine all the way to the canvas. It was a bad time for a few minutes there. I called up a friend and said, 'I have blowed up. I'm on fire' and he said, 'What?! What are you talking about?' He thought I was kidding. And then another boy up Mathews Creek he came along and towed me in after we got the fire out,\" Gene Austin said.\nHe continued, \"I was sitting on the board, and I just started shaking. It just hit me. What had happened. To this day, I believe in guardian angels. When that heating block blowed up. I had a short sleeve shirt on and not one hair was burned,\" Austin said.\nIn sheer volume, the biggest waterman, Calvert Thompson, was nick named \"Butterball.\" He had people in awe when he told the story of bailing out the cabin of a boat with five gallon buckets.\n\"There were 35 knot winds and seas were around 15 feet. We were early spring crabbin' in Cape Charles, Virginia. The tide ran so hard you couldn't see the buoys. You had to wait for the tide to slack up, and then you went as hard as you could go to fish your pots,\" Thompson said.\n\"And it was so rough that day that Raymond kept backing the boat up. We had scuppers in the back of the boat, when the water would come over the stern, it was just small holes in the back that would let water off of the gunnels. I had white boots on, and I had water over top of my boots from the floor up. I hollered up to the pilothouse and said, 'Raymond don't back up no more. Just sit. If he had backed up, we literally would have been gone. We were lucky.\"\nOne time when he was 23 or 24 years old, the engine died, so he stood on top of the cabin and threw the anchor as far as he could. Then he pulled the line in to move the boat. He said he went seven and half miles in two and a half hours until he was back home in Little Creek.\nThe one lady on the panel of watermen was Rachel Fazebaker. She could crack a joke and had the crowd going.\n\"When it starts blowing 20-25, I say bye boys,\" she said. \"One time I was in five-foot seas and 30 mph winds and we were dredging. It completely unspooled, and we had to lower the boom. My knees were shaking the whole time. The captain taught me a lot that day and I said, 'I am not going out, not doing it. Not going out.' That captain taught me what not to do,\" she said.\nAs a 12-year-old, O'Donnell's mom would not let him crab out of Winchester Creek, where she could look out the window and make sure he was OK.\n\"Crabs were, number ones, were $8 a bushel. It was in my blood. It was all I knew. I was pretty much a capitalist, so once I found out you could make some money doing it, I kept doing it. That is all the incentive I needed, so when I went to the carnival, when I got where I could make five dollars a day, that was pretty good money,\" said O'Donnell.\nThe crowd oohed and ahhed with each story. When an hour had flown by, the master of ceremonies handed the microphone to the people in the crowd, who got to ask about five more questions, the most poignant being, \"are you a dying breed?\"\n\"Aren't there any young people doing this?\"\nThe answer was sobering. The average age of a waterman now is 58. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) updated legislators on policy issues relating to the Eastern Shore that are \"on the horizon.\"Van Hollen told Eastern Shore legislators that the issue of blue catfish, an invasive species in the Chesapeake Bay, has received a lot of attention in Congress.\n\"We know that we've got to deal with this invasive species,\" he said. \"And probably the best way to deal with it is to eat our way out of it.\"\nAlong with U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md. 1st), Van Hollen said that he has been working to make it so that blue catfish are inspected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — like other fish products in the country — rather than by the U.S Department of Agriculture.\nVan Hollen said they are also trying to get additional funding for the prevention of more blue catfish in the Bay. He said a $750,000 grant for this was included in an appropriations bill that has been passed by the U.S. Senate but not yet passed by the U.S. House of Representatives.\nDel. Jay Jacobs (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) voiced his concerns with the the U.S. Department of Commerce's recent rejection of the state's request for a \"fishery resource disaster\" declaration. The request was made to address the damages caused by blue catfish and northern snakeheads in the Bay.\n\"These fish are growing so fast, and they're so aggressive that by the time everybody sees the financial disaster, it may be too late,\" Jacobs said.\nJacobs told Van Hollen that he hopes Van Hollen can \"keep the pressure on\" in the Senate.\nVan Hollen thanked Jacobs, saying he agreed with him about the risks and dangers of the invasive species.\n\"We are in the aftermath of the administration's decision on the disaster assistance,\" Van Hollen said to Jacobs. \"We are going back to them. We may reach out to you and your colleagues to get some additional information as we circle back.\"\nAt the meeting, Van Hollen also spoke about H-2B visas, which are important for seafood processing companies in the state.\nVan Hollen said that for fiscal year 2024, the number of these visas, which are for temporary nonagricultural workers, has increased to more than 130,000.\n\"The challenge remains that it's a lottery system,\" he said. \"And that it's impossible to run a business with certainty if your labor depends on a lottery system.\"\nTo address this, Van Hollen and Cardin have introduced a bill that would exempt seafood processors from the H-2B annual worker cap. Van Hollen said that although the bill has bipartisan support, it also has bipartisan opposition.\n\"And so we are trying to work that through the system and address concerns that have been raised on both sides of the aisle,\" he said.\nVan Hollen also spoke about infrastructure and the 2018 Farm Bill at the meeting Friday. He said $18 million has been secured for different projects on the Eastern Shore, including various infrastructure projects.\nOn the Farm Bill, Van Hollen said the Senate has extended the bill through September of this year. He said the bill has important provisions for farmers such as crop protection. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "'Plenty of shell'\n\n February 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1066\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — In July, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore signed an executive order to establish an Oyster and Shell Substrate Task Force, created to develop a \"proactive plan to keep and purchase oyster shells to ensure the state has enough hard surface to increase oyster abundance in the bay.\"This was tied in with another executive order of Moore's with the goal to create, \"healthy watersheds that benefit the environment, the economy and communities.\"\nRealizing a hearty oyster production creates cleaner water by filtering excess nutrients and sediments from the water, the task force now meets monthly. They discuss how to produce more oysters, transport oyster shells or talk about using alternative substrate in the water.\nDuring their meeting on Jan. 18, Kent County Commission President Ron Fithian responded to Chesapeake Bay Foundation Executive Director Allison Colden.\nIn a previous meeting Colden said the seed and shell program, which lasted for 46 years, was reported to be a waste of the state's resources.\nFithian refuted that, having observed the success of Maryland's past oyster program, the Maryland Seed and Shell Program, from 1960-2006.\n\"There's no copy of such a report or any facts to back up her statement,\" he told the task force.\nHe drew from his history on the Eastern Shore, urging the members to not accept her research as fact.\nFithian stated during the 46 years of the seed and shell program, the state spent $48 million, planting 190 million bushels of shell. That averaged out to 4.2 million bushels per year. Maryland harvested approximately 60 million bushels of oysters with a dockside value estimated between $400 million to $1.2 billion.\nDoing the math, Fithian said the program was \"hardly a waste.\"\nWhile he had their attention, he warned some groups deliberately deceive the public claiming there's not enough oyster shell in the Bay to place in the water — alternative sources are needed.\nFithian declared that false.\n\"The Bay is loaded with oyster shells from one end to the other.\"\nHe described the process. You find an area with shells with low oyster production and place them in productive areas.\nFithian pointed out there is a great supply of these shells at Man O'War Shoals in the upper bay. A 25-30 year supply even if Maryland decided to plant a million shell per year, he added.\n\"The transportation cost to the state, would be $2 or $4 a bushel.\"\nBut of late, he said, certain groups have taken away \"twenty-five percent of the most productive oyster bottom from commercial fishers.\"\nThey build sanctuaries — areas where the wild harvest of oysters is prohibited, Fithian said.\nAlthough, that may seem like a protective idea, it is not he told the task force.\nDeclaring an oyster bottom a \"sanctuary,\" means oyster bars sit undisturbed. This does not lead to oyster production. Oysters cease production and die of old age, Fithian emphasized.\nAn inactive oyster bed invites filth too, said the commissioner.\n\"Oyster larvae needs a clean shell to attach itself. That's why areas still harvested will generally have a higher spat count (oyster larvae that attach to the shell) more than closed areas.\"\nFithian brought up Harris Creek as a prime example of going from an open seeding area to a sanctuary.\n\"During the seed and shell program, the state would place dredge shell in Harris Creek. Then mother nature would provide it with oyster larvae. Some years the spat count would be between 800-2,000 a bushel. Shells at a specific size, were transplanted to other areas, with a survival rate of 97 percent.\"\nSince it was a highly successful spot, Fithian added, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation turned the area into a sanctuary thinking they'd also be a success.\nFithian called it a failed project.\n\"Spat count is less than 100 per bushel.\"\nThe site sits untouched, collecting sediment, making it unattractive for larvae.\nHe said the foundation was responsible.\n\"They supported spending $35 million and took the greatest natural oyster hatchery on the Bay and ruined it so it can never be a hatchery again.\"\nFithian posed a question to the task force, \"What's more wasteful? $48 million to produce 60 million bushels of oysters over a 47 year span and a dockside value too large to count? Or $38 million for the Harris Creek project alone?\".\nDespite these comments, Fithian remarked he's not completely opposed to sanctuaries. They need to be created using the right substrate, he added.\nThis is not happening and those who are creating sanctuaries continue to repeat the same mistakes.\nMistakes leading to more pollution.\nFithian claimed the foundation applied for a permit to create three oyster reefs in Lynnhaven River. After they did, waterfront residents reported plastic and paper waste. Also the Virginia Institute of Marine Science found, \"polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.\"\nHe said that the foundation was ordered to remove all the junk at the bottom.\n\"Someone needs to explain to these government agencies the Chesapeake Bay is not a landfill. It's the greatest resource the state has and should be treated as such.\"\nHe challenged the task force with a call-to-action.\nStop spreading falsehoods about the lack of natural shell.\nAllow the Department of Natural Resources to open up more areas.\nProvide ample amounts of substrate needed for aquaculture, the oyster industry and restoration.\n\"Stop experimenting with far-fetched ideas that continue to fail time and time again.\"\nAfter his remarks, Colden said she was taken aback, not expecting the commissioner to have so much time for a \"soliloquy.\"\nShe said he wasted everyone's fifteen minutes and encouraged Fithian to look through her research, evidence of her claims, in a Google Drive she shared with the task force.\nLater when Kent County News reached out to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, concerning Fithian's comments, they offered this statement.\n\"The Oyster Shell and Substrate Task Force was created to identify ways to increase the number of oysters in Chesapeake Bay across all sectors — restoration, aquaculture, and the public fishery by addressing the shortage of oyster shell. It will take expertise and cooperation across all groups and stakeholders to create innovative and durable solutions to this challenging problem. CBF looks forward to serving an important role in the task force moving these conversations forward.\"\nThere's no argument that oyster production is good for water health. But there is an ongoing debate about the manner of which that happens, and who gets to decide what's best for the bay.\nChair of the Delmarva Fisheries Association, Rob Newberry, backing Fithian's statements, said his facts and figures can be found in Maryland Department of Natural Resources Shellfish Monitoring and Assessment Program.\nThe task force will continue to meet monthly at: https://go.activecalendar.com/doit-md/event/oyster-shell-and-substrate-taskforce-meeting-3/. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mautz introduces oyster legislation\n\n March 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly | Section: General Assembly \n \n 1221\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — State Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) introduced legislation last month to require the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to develop an updated fishery management plan for oysters and to allow DNR to alter the boundaries of \"certain oyster sanctuaries.\"\"SB 922 repeals onerous requirements which prevent the Department of Natural Resources from updating oyster management strategies for sanctuaries, aside from the large-scale restoration projects that are covered by federal regulations,\" Mautz said.\nIn addition, the legislation would allow watermen to dredge by powerboat in the \"public oyster fishery area in Eastern Bay in Queen Anne's and Talbot counties.\"\n\"If there are areas that are conducive to power dredging, it's shown to be a phenomenal way to grow oysters and to restore the bottom, and it's proven time and time again,\" Mautz said.\nThe bill's co-sponsor is Sen. Jack Bailey (R-St. Mary's, Calvert) of southern Maryland. The bill is cross-filed with House Bill 1231, sponsored by Del. Chris Adams (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico).\nMautz said in a Feb. 17 interview that he and Bailey introduced the legislation \"to give the department the authority to adjust the boundaries on sanctuaries because the last five years of DNR's reporting on the status of sanctuaries is abysmal.\"\n\"Over half of them are dead. Some are doing okay, but most are failing or dead, meaning that oyster bars that used to be flourishing prior to the creation of the sanctuary (have) been covered over with silt and mud,\" Mautz said.\n\"The idea is that they need to be managed. They can't just be set aside,\" Mautz said. \"That's why jokingly some will say oyster sanctuaries are like oyster cemeteries, because those used to be vibrant oyster grounds.\"\nOpposition to the billAt an Education, Energy, and the Environment Committee hearing Feb. 27, Mautz's legislation was met with resistance by conservation leaders and officials from the Department of Natural Resources.\nOpposing the legislation was Dr. Allison Colden, Maryland executive director with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. She said nine areas of the Chesapeake Bay have experienced overfishing of oysters.\n\"If we continue to fish at these rates, we will locally cause those populations to go extinct,\" she said.\nMautz said \"a lot of the work\" the Chesapeake Bay Foundation does is \"fantastic — their science is needed. However, we need management, and we need to grow oysters.\"\nTouting the success of oyster sanctuaries, Colden said, \"For the past two years, with these sanctuaries in place, the oyster fisheries enjoyed the highest harvest on record since the 1980s. Additionally, modeling from the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science indicates that larval transport from these oyster sanctuaries does have the ability to contribute to harvest areas as we approach 2025.\"\nThe \"federal and state investment,\" along \"working with partners,\" in the \"big five\" sanctuaries has been \"in the ballpark of $39 million,\" DNR Assistant Secretary for Aquatic Resources Kristen Fidler said. She called the efforts made in those sanctuaries a \"massive success, and we're still studying all of the ramifications and just how they're impacting beneficially the larger ecosystem in the Bay.\"\nWatermen support the billHowever, Mautz and watermen speaking in favor of the legislation to open oyster harvesting in sanctuaries said working the bottom to clear silt and sediment smothering the oysters contributes to the health of the population.\nJeff Harrison, president of the Talbot Watermen Association and a member of the Oyster Advisory Commission, testified at the hearing.\n\"We basically are looking to have the ability to be able to go into these areas,\" he said. \"We're not talking about going out and catching oysters. We're talking about going in and putting something there.\"\nHarrison suggested that watermen plant and harvest oysters on a four-year rotational basis. Broad Creek was the best tributary in the Bay because watermen did restoration work that cost $1 million \"right alongside Harris Creek — (and it cost) $30 million.\"\n\"We did a much better job than what they did,\" he said. \"So we're saying give us a chance to go into these failing sanctuaries and try to do something.\"\nRobert T. Brown, president of the Maryland Watermen Association, said a group of sanctuaries on the western side of the Bay \"has been ignored,\" forcing commercial oystermen to fish farther up the Bay.\n\"There has been no money set aside to rebuild (the area from the Patuxent River to Holland Point) or do anything with it,\" Brown said. \"It is laying there and it is silty we can't work into it; we can't go in and cultivate it. We want to go into these places and plant spat on shell, wild seed, maybe dredging and bringing the shells up so we can get a natural spat set into it.\"\n\"The seed-on-shell program that once existed was a self-funding program,\" Mautz said. \"It didn't take these millions and millions of dollars coming from taxpayers. That's a big part of the system that we need to take a serious look at and consider in making these decisions moving forward.\"\nJim Mullin with the Maryland Oystermen Association and a member of the Oyster Advisory Commission, testified in favor of the bill.\n\"We look to go into some of these areas, rehabilitate them with financing and our own infrastructure to … get them viable again, because otherwise they're just sitting there. He wants to address \"these areas that are failing and bring them up to standard,\" he said.\nSen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Somerset, Worcester, Wicomico) and a member of the EEE Committee said her expectation since 2019 and working with DNR was that sanctuaries would improve, but \"we have basically dead oysters covered over.\"\n\"This is not the result that we were looking for,\" she said.\nProblem with power dredgingDave Sikorski, executive director of Coastal Conservation Association Maryland, said his organization is \"largely made up of recreational anglers,\" but attended the hearing \"to advise and educate the public on the conservation of marine resources.\"\nCiting his experience and credentials in the areas of sport fisheries and as a member of two oyster policy entities, he said he had a \"very unique experience\" to consider \"what is most important for the public, what is most important for clean water and what is most important for recreational fishing.\"\nSikorski said power dredging removes living oysters, displaces shell and allows for spat set, \"but it's important that we do consider things differently today than in the past.\"\n\"What hasn't changed is our understanding of destruction by power dredges,\" he said.\n\"I absolutely respect the watermen's perspective on that because they see it, but we must make sure we enfold this into the whole oyster management plan,\" he said.\nFidler said the \"onerous requirements\" Mautz wanted repealed was now a \"moot point.\"\n\"We were unable to explore, evaluate and implement changes to sanctuary boundaries unless and until the oyster management plan had been developed and approved by the Oyster Advisory Commission, and then incorporated by reference into our own regulations as the fishery management plan,\" she said.\n\"And so now that we have done that, and the Oyster Advisory Commission introduced an amendment to that plan, which has been adopted and is being finalized now and going through the COMAR process to be incorporated by reference into our regulations that will allow us the ability to explore, evaluate and potentially implement changes to sanctuary boundaries,\" Fidler said.\n\"It's taken a little bit longer than we expected, but we do anticipate that to be all wrapped up here very shortly,\" Fidler said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot council considers $100,000 to oyster credit program\n\n March 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 482\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — At a Tuesday evening working session, the Talbot County Council discussed the potential to fund Oyster Nutrient Trading credits and reviewed draft cannabis legislation.The Talbot County Council is considering allocating $100,000 to the Talbot County Oyster Nutrient Credit Pilot Program. If approved, the council will allocate $500,000 over five years for the program.\nNutrient credit trading allows municipalities and businesses to meet water quality permit requirements using oysters' pollutant-filtering capabilities to remove nutrients from the water.\nIn 2016, the Chesapeake Bay Program approved the use of oysters as a best management practice for nutrient reduction requirements for aquaculture. This practice removes nitrogen and phosphorus through aquaculture and generates tradable credits.\nCredits are generated when oysters are harvested from leased areas or public fisheries. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources verifies the harvest. Credits must be purchased in a 2:1 ratio to offset one pound of permitted pollution.\nThe program aims to plant oysters through the public fishery pilot to generate credits starting in year three. The county could use this program to offset agricultural pollution.\nThe $100,000 would initially fund two parts of the oyster nutrient credit program: the post-harvest credits from aquaculture leases and a new public fishery pilot program.\nPost-harvest credits involve purchasing credits already generated when oysters are harvested from leased areas. The pilot program would include investing in planting oysters in designated public oyster bars normally open to fishing.\nThe allocations between these two programs must be determined in consultation with the County Council. If funds are allocated, it will support local watermen and generate credits that could offset pollution from other sources like agriculture.\nCANNABIS\nThe council reviewed the state's limits on cultivation, processing and dispensary cannabis licenses. Patrick Thomas, county attorney, emphasized that cannabis dispensaries in Talbot County must not be unduly burdensome on cannabis businesses.\nThe council reviewed draft legislation about cannabis and the changes made by the county.\nThe council added language to regulate the zoning distance between dispensaries and preexisting schools, child care centers, places of worship, libraries, public parks and other similar buildings. Dispensaries would need to be at least 500 feet from these locations. This was not originally in state law but was added in the county ordinance.\nThere were distance restrictions for other dispensaries to be at least 1,000 feet — or just under a quarter mile — from each other.\nThomas noted a pending state bill that, if passed, may change the distance restrictions applied to dispensaries. House Bill 805 will alter the distance restrictions applicable to a licensed cannabis dispensary. If this bill passes, the required distance between dispensaries could change from 500 feet to 2,000 feet.\nThomas told the council that they are waiting until after April 8 to incorporate changes from the state legislative session into the county's proposed cannabis zoning bill. The state legislative session is scheduled to adjourn on April 8, so the county may better align with any relevant changes to the state law. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Linda Haddaway King led the ceremony, acknowledging the history behind the Blessing of the Fleet. King described the rich history of boat builders in Tilghman, returning to the early settlement in the 1840s and upholding mastery today.\nDavid McQuay, a lifelong boat builder, was awarded for his decades of master boat building and for preserving the craft. Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio, daughter of the late Herman Hardaway, a former boat builder, presented McQuay with a citation from the governor.\nIn her speech, she highlighted her childhood, shaped by the boat-building community.\n\"It was symbolic of a community coming together and helping each other out, and that doesn't happen everywhere,\" Haddaway-Riccio said. \"We are so fortunate that in Talbot County we still have that community spirit.\"\nState Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) presented McQuay with a citation from the Maryland Senate. Mautz read the citation that gave its sincerest congratulations in recognition of the remarkable talent and skill that McQuay had shared during his lifetime and the benefit it provided the community.\nState Rep. Christopher Adams (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) followed and presented McQuay with a lifetime achievement certificate for all his boat-building years.\nThe Bay Hundred Men then sang songs from \"America the Beautiful\" to \"Wade in the Water\" before local clergy prayed for the fleet's blessing.\nRev. Rob King then read a poem to the crowd about his appreciation for the watermen community.\nKing led the crowd in a final prayer before the blowing of the shofar, a musical horn fashioned from a ram's horn.\n\"When you blow the shofar, it announces God's presence,\" King said. \"And that's what we want for all of you — God's presence in that boat with you to begin the waters — because we can't do a thing without our God, and the Lord will make Himself known to you.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The new law provides more flexibility in this regard, the MARBIDCO release said. The interest rate charged for a loan made under this program is 3%.\nBeginning July 1, the program expanded to include watermen holding commercial fishing licenses issued by the Potomac River Fisheries Commission. In addition, the MARBIDCO Board of Directors has recently increased the maximum loan amount available under the program from $15,000 to $20,000 for equipment purchases, up to $30,000 for the purchase of a workboat, and up to $40,000 for the purchase of both a workboat and equipment. The minimum loan amount remains at $7,000.\nUnder Maryland law, a generational waterman is a licensed commercial waterman who can demonstrate that 50% or more of the waterman's annual income was derived from commercial seafood harvesting. The law further provides that two years of the most recent federal income tax returns must be submitted with an application. The waterman must hold a TFL license from the Department of Natural Resources, or a commercial license to catch finfish, crabs, clams, and oysters, issued by the Potomac River Fisheries Commission. The applicant must also have a minimum credit score of 620.\nThe State Budget included $500,000 for the microloan program in FY 2025.\nApplication forms are available on MARBIDCO's website — marbidco.org.

Mason has been telling me all about the crab cakes and steamed crabs he's been eating fresh out of the water and right into the steamer.Mason's brings back memories of the 1950s and 1960s adventures of crabbing. Mom would back the pickup out, and we would load the supplies, which included baskets with inner tubes attached to help the baskets float, chicken necks for bait, heavy string to tie the hook and sinker to, crab nets, towels, a picnic basket with sandwiches and a big jug of water.\nWe loaded up and rode in the back of the truck so we could hoot and holler at our friends as we rode through town. Our destination would be one of two country landings with docks for crabbing and areas for swimming.\nThe first was Mumford's Landing down off St, Martin's Neck Road (now a development off the Route 90 bridge outside of Ocean City), and the second was a dock called Little Georgetown, just down the road from our farm on the Delaware side.\nOne particular day, we were headed to Mumford's Landing. Upon arriving, Mom picked a spot to tie our strings on the dock poles. We took the lines and hung the nuts, bolts and sinkers on the bottom so the weight held the line down. Then we tied on the chicken neck for bait.\nYou had a choice — go swimming now or later — but you had to move down a good distance to stay away from the baited lines. Mom got two baskets ready with inner tubes to float the baskets, grabbed a crab net and walked along the shoreline crabbing. Someone stayed back with another net and basket to gradually pulled up the lines, placing the neck under the line to catch the falling crabs.\nUpon arriving at home, the still kicking crabs were unloaded, the fire started and the Old Bay seasoning was pulled out. Once the crabs were bright orange/reddish in color the fire was pulled away and the crabs pulled and placed on the picnic tables to be picked.\nOf course, we ate the delicious meat until we were full, and then we put it in containers to be carried to the kitchen to be made into dishes such as crab cakes, crab soup and much more.\nYou can purchase crabs locally at LNT Seafood in Preston, Blough's Seafood outside of Denton, Kool Ice and Seafood in Cambridge, Kayla's crabs in Federalsburg on Preston Rd, Trident Seafood on Rt 50 IN Hebron and Fat Boys Seafood on Old Ocean City Road in Salisbury. There are many other small local spots featuring fresh seafood catches, but trust \"word of mouth\" for the best recommendations.\nCRAB DIP8 ounces crab meat, 8 ounces cream cheese (softened), 1/2 cup sour cream, 2 tbsp mayonnaise, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp dry mustard, 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese, 1 pinch garlic salt (optional), 2 tsp Old Bay seasoning or JO seasoning.\nIn a large bowl, mix cream cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce and dry mustard until smooth. Stir in 2 tbsp of shredded cheddar cheese. Add crab meat into the mixture. Pour mixture into a 1-quart casserole dish. Top with remaining cheese, or more. But not too much because you don't want the cheese to overtake the taste of the crab. Add some of your favorite crab or seafood seasoning on top. Bake at 325 degrees for about 30 minutes or until the top is browned.\nCRAB MAC N CHEESE1 16 oz box dry Cavatappi pasta or elbows, 1 lb jumbo lump crab meat, ½ cup unsalted butter, ½ cup all-purpose flour, 1 ½ tsp seafood seasoning such as Old Bay or JO, ½ tsp garlic salt, ½ tsp ground mustard, ¼ tsp black pepper, 2 oz chive & onion cream cheese (softened), 5 cups whole milk, 5 cups shredded cheddar and Monterey jack cheese (divided). For the topping: 2 tbsps unsalted butter (melted), ½ cup panko breadcrumbs, 1 tbsp grated parmesan, ¼ tsp seafood seasoning, 1 tbsp chopped fresh Italian parsley.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 13-by-9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Set aside. Cook the pasta in salted water per the package directions until al dente. Drain well and set aside. Pick over the crab meat removing any shells and cartilage. Set aside. In a medium-size heavy bottomed saucepan, melt ½ cup butter over medium heat. To the melted butter add flour, 1 ½ teaspoon seafood seasoning, garlic salt, ground mustard and black pepper. Mix until the flour has been absorbed by the butter stirring constantly. Whisk in the milk. Whisk constantly to prevent clumping. Bring the milk to a boil then immediately lower the heat to low. Simmer for 3-5 minutes gently bubbling and stirring to prevent sticking. Turn off the heat. Add cream cheese to the sauce. Stir until melted then add 3 cups of Borden shredded Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese. Remove from the heat, stirring until melted. Add the cooked pasta and crab meat to a large mixing bowl. Pour the cheese sauce over and mix until fully coated and the crab meat is evenly distributed. Pour ½ into the baking dish. Top with 1 cup shredded cheese. Repeat with macaroni then top with the final 1 cup of shredded cheese. Topping: Melt 2 tablespoon butter in a small microwave safe bowl.. Mix with the panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and ¼ teaspoon seafood seasoning, Sprinkle on top. Place into the oven and bake for 30-40 minutes or until the top is golden and the edges are bubbly. Garnish with chopped parsley just before serving.\nCHICKEN, CRAB, SAUSAGE GUMBO1 cup bacon grease, 3 tbsps olive oil, 1 yellow onion (chopped), 1 red bell pepper (chopped), 2 cups andouille sausage (sliced), 1 cup all-purpose flour, 4-6 cloves garlic (minced), 3/4 gallon chicken stock, 1 15-oz can chopped tomatoes, 1 tsp apple cider vinegar, 2 cups stewed and shredded chicken, 3 tbsps fresh parsley, 1 tbsp dried basil, 1 tbsp dried oregano, 2 cups frozen okra, 2 cups crab meat, salt, white pepper, lemon juice and Tabasco to taste, shopped green onions and rice.\nAdd 3 tablespoons olive oil or bacon grease to a cast-iron skillet and cook the onion and bell pepper until soft and set aside. Cook the sausage in the same skillet until browned and set aside with the vegetables. Add1 cup of the bacon grease to the skillet over medium heat and stir in the flour. Lower the heat to low and cook for at least 1 hour, stirring every 5 minutes. The roux should be thick, but not chalky. When it is dark tan and smells like toasted nuts, it is done. In a large stock pot or Dutch oven, add the sautéed vegetables and sausage, and heat over medium high heat. Add the garlic and simmer for 2 minutes. Add stock, tomatoes, vinegar, chicken and all other dry ingredients. Simmer on low to medium heat for at least 1 hour. Add salt, white pepper, lemon juice and Tabasco to taste. Skim off about 3 cups of liquid from the pot (with as few solids as possible) and combine in a bowl with about 1 cup roux. Stir until it thickens and becomes paste-like. Add about half this mixture back to the pot on low heat. Stir well. Let simmer for a few minutes and add more roux mixture to thicken or water or stock to thin. The gumbo should be thick, but not as thick as gravy. Add half of the okra. Simmer on very low for at least 30 minutes. Be careful, as it can easily burn. Add the remaining cup of okra and the crab meat 5 minutes before serving. Taste again for salt, white pepper, lemon juice and Tabasco. Serve in bowls with rice and garnish with green onion.\nCHESAPEAKE CIOPPINO2 tbsps unsalted butter, 1 tbsp olive oil, 1/2 cup celery, (medium diced), 1 cup onion (medium diced), 1/2 cup fennel (thin sliced), 2 tbsps garlic (thin sliced or minced), 1 tbsp Old Bay or JO seasoning, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper, 1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 2 cups chicken stock, 3 cups tomato puree, 1/2 lemon (sliced), 1 lb shrimp, 1 lb Maryland blue crab meat, 12 oysters (shucked), 1 lb rock fish (cut into large cubes), 24 mussels (cleaned or frozen).\nCombine butter and olive oil in a medium stock pot.

    "content": "Watermen harvested 430,000 bushels of Maryland oysters\n\n August 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT | Section: News \n \n 320\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Maryland Department of Natural Resources estimates that over 430,000 bushels of oysters were harvested commercially in Maryland from Oct. 1 to March 31. This was the fifth season in the past 30 years when the harvest surpassed 400,000 bushels.\"Maryland's oyster population has notably improved in recent years,\" said Department of Natural Resources Shellfish Division Director Christopher Judy. \"This season's harvest far exceeded the average yield over the last several decades.\"\nThe preliminary harvest numbers are based on Maryland seafood dealer buy tickets. The estimated dockside value of this year's oyster harvest is $15 million, with an average dockside price per bushel of $35.\nLimited market demand partially disadvantaged the '23-24 oyster season's success, which pushed watermen to keep their boats tied up several days a week. In the past two seasons, when the harvests exceeded 700,000 and 500,000 bushels, oystermen were working and delivering product to the shucking houses virtually every day.\nAnother factor at play was oyster abundance. This season, there were generally fewer oysters in the population available for harvest than in the prior two seasons.\nOyster abundance is strongly affected by spat set, the quantity of newly-attached juvenile oysters growing on existing shells. Strong sets yield a robust population several years later. Low sets yield a lower population.\nThe very strong spat set of 2020 helped produce the recent high harvests of 500,000 and 700,00 bushels, but the lower spat sets of 2021 and 2022 offered a lower abundance of market oysters for the fishery currently.\nMost recently, the 2023 Fall Oyster Survey recorded a high spat set, spread across a broader geographic area than usual for Maryland. \"With the right environmental conditions, the notably widespread spat set from last summer could bode well for future harvests,\" Judy said.\nAll sectors of Maryland's oyster management efforts are experiencing growth. The 2023-24 season saw a record yield of oysters from shellfish aquaculture operations and many oyster sanctuaries are showing promising signs of recovery. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Clayton Company of Cambridge was named Advocate of the Year for his unparalleled work in protecting Maryland's seafood industry and the watermen who depend upon it for their livelihood.\nAs president of the J.M. Clayton Company, established by his great-grandfather in 1890, Brooks has a five-generation commitment to sourcing and advancing Chesapeake Bay seafood.\nAdvocating for supporting policies, Brooks represents the Chesapeake Bay Seafood Industries Association before regulatory and management agencies, the Maryland General Assembly and the U.S. Congress.\nCrab for the luncheon crab cakes was supplied by the J.M Clayton Company.\nThe Oyster Recovery Partnership was recognized as the Nonprofit of the Year. For over 30 years, ORP's mission has been to restore the Bay's native oyster population by building sanctuary reefs, rebuilding public fishery reefs, supporting the aquaculture industry, recycling oyster shells, and public involvement through hands-on volunteering and events, according to executive director Ward Slacum.\nSince it's founding in 1994, ORP has planted more than 11.5 billion oysters on 3,000 acres of reef and recycled more than 300,000 bushels of shell, Slacum said. Presenting the recognition, former Gov. Robert Ehrlich credited nonpartisan oyster restoration advocacy as one of the most successful aspects of his administration.\nSteve Phillips of Phillips Seafood was recognized as Philanthropist of the Year.\nGrowing up working the waters of the Chesapeake Bay with his grandfathers developed Phillips' love for local watermen catching seafood for Maryland restaurants everyday, he said.\nRecognizing \"nothing in the world is better than fresh Maryland crab,\" Phillips worked to introduce Asian crab to provide more opportunities for crab cuisine year round in the wake of high demand.\nAs CEO of Phillips Seafood, Phillips has donated over $70,000 to the Maryland Watermen's Association to protect the heritage and future of commercial watermen in Maryland. Phillips Seafood also provides shells for the ORP's oyster reef rebuilding efforts. According to Jim Purdue of Perdue Farms presenting the award, Phillips represented \"People who care when people aren't looking.\"\nRecognized for his vast knowledge of the oyster industry and dedication to community events, Herman \"Jeff\" Harrison was lauded as Volunteer of the Year.\nCurrently President of the Talbot County Watermen Association, Harrison is a member of the ORP board, has served on the Oyster Advisory Commission and has often been called upon to testify on waterman-related legislative issues.\nHarrison can regularly be found in his element of shucking oysters at countless community fundraising and public education events.\nHarrison credited a love of the Bay as why he does what he does and strives to a time when the Bay was pristine, \"and crabs were $3 a dozen,\" he said.\nHarrison continues his work for a sense of empowerment for himself and others and progress for future generations.\nRecognizing exemplary students pursuing cancer research, this year's Chesapeake Charities Cancer Research Scholarship was awarded to Alexandra Vlk, a fourth-year medical student in the Medical Scientists Training Program at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Earning her PhD in innate immunology in 2023, Vlk is currently interviewing for pathology residency programs with the goal to become a compassionate pathologist and further develop cancer research.\nPresenting the award was Michael Fisher, a retired gastroenterologist, who was offered a new perspective to view research and procedures now as a patient with two stage four cancer diagnoses himself, he said.\nThe scholarship was a unique award that promotes future benefits, not just past accomplishments, he said, and credited Vlk as driven to find oncology answers through an altruistic cause, having lost her own mother to cancer.\n\"There are no words to describe it, it's just incredible,\" Vlk said.\nCelebrating its 20th anniversary, Chesapeake Charities has supported over 140 local funds thrive by providing millions of dollars in investments, according to committee chair Audrey Scott.\nPrimarily relying on sponsorships, Celebration of Charity event marks Chesapeake Charities only yearly fundraiser as to not to compete with nonprofits also fundraising, she said.\nThe annual awards ceremony is a way to provide outstanding recognition, highlight partnerships and showcase that \"we're all in this together,\" Linda Kohler, Chesapeake Charities executive director.\nChesapeake Charities members wore red roses in recognition of the recent passing of Board Treasurer Diana Waterman.\nPre-luncheon oysters were donated by ProShuckers Seafood Catering.\nMore information about Chesapeake Charities can be found at chesapeakecharities.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Appreciating local oysters\n\n February 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1715\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Having grown up on the Eastern Shore, the oyster has been a much-appreciated seafood in my life.My mother made some of the greatest tasting oyster fritters on the Mason Dixon line. There are no watermen in my family, but we lived close enough to the water to respect the life of the waterman and the delicious delicacies that were a result of their hard work.\nIn our local area here, the most popular oyster varieties include Malpeques, Well Fleet, Blue Points, Delaware Bay, Chesapeake Bay, Chincoteagues, Apalachicola Bay and Gulf Coast.\nEast Coast oysters range from slightly salty to sharp salt flavor (Chesapeake, Delaware and Gulf Coast oysters have a light salt taste; all others have a sharper salty taste).\nThe Chesapeake Bay has been home to oystering since the early 19th century. Chesapeake Bay skipjacks are the last commercial sailing vessels in the United States.\nThe dredge boats once numbered in the thousands. Today only about a dozen or so remain.\nSkip jacks are limited to 150 bushels of oysters daily. The dredging season runs from November through March 1. The recent ice has made it impossible for the boats to get out to perform their work — cutting into the ice and cutting into the pockets of our waterman and their families. Check your local newspapers and the Facebook posts of local fire departments, churches and organizations with upcoming oyster dinners and roast coming up for their fundraising events.\nI know that many seafood markets are featuring fresh oysters in the shell or by the pint and quarts or opened for you. I like to open my own — eating them on the half shell or cooking them fresh.\nTry going down to the docks and getting them from the waterman themselves. Support a trade that is slowly leaving our Eastern Shore. Thank a waterman who goes out in all kinds of weather laboring in a trade they must love that is full of obstacles. The weather has cleared, and the watermen are returning to the trade they love. I am on the way to the docks for oysters to prepare some of my favorite seafood dishes.\nEASTERN SHORE OYSTER FRITTERSDrain 1 quart of oysters, reserving the juice, and set aside. Beat 2 eggs, add the reserved juice to the egg and add Worcestershire sauce to taste. Add 1 1/2 cups flour with 1 1/2 tsps baking powder and mix well. Add the oysters and lightly mix. Fry in hot oil, browning on both sides. Drain on a paper towel and serve warm. When dropping the fritters in the oil, make sure you have at least 3 oysters to a fritter.\nTRADITIONAL MARYLAND OYSTER STEWIn a large saucepan, cook one-pint fresh shucked oysters, with juice, over low heat until edges begin to curl. Add 1 quart of milk, 1/4 cup butter, salt and pepper to taste. You can sprinkle some Old Bay seasoning on top if desired slowly, but do not boil. Serve hot with oyster crackers if desired.\nSCALLOPED OYSTERSIn a greased two-quart casserole, place alternate layers of oysters and fresh cracker crumbs, doting each layer with butter. For this process you will need one quart of oysters with liquid, 2 to 3 cups fresh crushed crackers and 1/2 cup butter or 1 stick margarine. You can also sprinkle each layer with salt and pepper to taste. End with a layer of crumbs, and pour one to two cups of milk over the top. Dot the top with remaining butter or margarine and bake at 350 degrees until browned, about 40 to 50 minutes. Makes 6 generous servings.\nOYSTER POT PIEIn a large saucepan place 5 or 6 diced potatoes, cleaned and peeled, with 5 or 6 carrots, 2 to 3 cleaned and diced onions, 1/2 pound of chopped ham, and 4 strips of uncooked bacon. Cook until done and add salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp parsley flakes and 1/2 tsp oregano. Mix 1 pint crushed tomatoes and the liquor of one pint of oysters. Add this to the already cooked ingredients. Bring to a boil; thicken with some cornstarch. When thick, add one pint of oysters. Cook until the oysters have curled edges. Pour into a baking dish lined with your favorite crust and place a crust over the top. Slightly prick the top crust with a fork, bake at 400 degrees until brown. This is so delicious for supper on a wintry day.\nBACON OYSTER LETTUCE TOMATO1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup cornmeal, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper, 2 dozen oysters (freshly shucked), 12 slices thick-cut bacon, vegetable oil (for frying; about 5 cups), 8 slices brioche or white sandwich bread toasted, mayonnaise, bibb lettuce, and sliced tomatoes. Whisk flour, cornmeal, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper. Working in batches, toss oysters in flour mixture, transfer to a plate. Working in batches, cook bacon in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium heat until crisp, 10–12 minutes per batch; drain on paper towels. Pour oil into a skillet with bacon fat to a depth of one inch and heat over medium-high heat until oil bubbles immediately when a pinch of cornmeal mixture is added. Working in batches, fry oysters, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about four minutes. Drain on paper towels, season with salt and pepper. Build sandwiches with mayonnaise, lettuce, tomatoes, bacon and fried oysters and serve.\nOYSTER CORNBREAD STUFFING8 tbsps unsalted butter (divided), 4 stalks celery (finely chopped), 1/2 yellow onion (finely chopped), 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 tsp rubbed sage, 1 tsp dried rosemary, 1 tsp dried thyme, 1/2 tsp coarse ground black pepper, 6 cups cornbread cubes, 18 ounces oysters (chopped, liquor reserved), 2 cups chicken broth, 2 large eggs.\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees and spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with vegetable oil spray. Add 4 tbsps unsalted butter to a large skillet on medium heat. Add in the celery and onions, cook for 6-8 minutes until translucent. Add in the salt, sage, rosemary, thyme, and black pepper and stir. To a large bowl add the cornbread cubes, vegetable mixture, and oysters and toss. In a second bowl whisk together the reserved oyster liquor, chicken broth, eggs, and melted butter. Pour the mixture over the bowl and toss gently to moisten the cornbread cubes. Pour the mixture into your baking dish and bake, uncovered, for 30-35 minutes until golden brown.\nGRILLED OYSTERS WITH BACON AND CAYENNE BUTTER3 slices hickory-smoked or applewood-smoked bacon cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide strips, 1 cup unsalted butter cut into 1/2-inch cubes, 4 garlic cloves (peeled), 1 1/2 tbsps chopped fresh Italian parsley, 1 ½ tbsps chopped fresh cilantro, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 tsp coarse kosher salt, 2 tbsps fresh lemon juice, 24 freshly shucked oysters on the half shell.\nPrepare butter compound at least 2 hours ahead of time to give it time to firm. Cook bacon in a heavy medium skillet over medium heat until crisp. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to the processor. Add butter, garlic, Italian parsley, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and 1/2 tsp coarse salt. Blend until smooth, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl. With the machine running, gradually add fresh lemon juice and continue to process until blended. Place a large sheet of waxed paper on the work surface. Drop butter by heaping tbspfuls onto paper in a long log. Using paper as aid, shape butter into a 2-inch-diameter log. Wrap to enclose; chill butter until firm, at least 2 hours. Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Spread 1/2-inch-thick layer of rock salt on a large, rimmed baking sheet. Place the baking sheet on a grill rack and heat for 20 minutes. Cut 24 1/8- to 1/4-inch-thick rounds from cayenne-butter log. Transfer the hot baking sheet from the grill to a heat proof surface. Nestle oysters in hot rock salt. Top each oyster with a slice of cayenne butter. Return the baking sheet with oysters to grill. Close the grill and cook until butter melts and start to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Spoon a shallow layer of additional rock salt onto each of 6 plates. Nestle four grilled oysters in salt on each plate and serve.\nSINGLE FRIED OYSTERS1 pint freshly shucked raw oysters, 2 cups buttermilk, 1¼ cup fine yellow cornmeal, ¾ cup all-purpose flour, 1 tbsp Creole seasoning, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 quart peanut oil. While the oil heats, pour the oysters into a colander or strainer and let them drain. Then, rinse with fresh water to wash off any debris or shell fragments. Pour the buttermilk into a medium-sized bowl and dunk the drained oysters. Let them marinate for 15 to 20 minutes. Place the cornmeal, flour, creole seasoning and salt in a shallow bowl or pie plate and whisk to combine. Remove the oysters from the buttermilk one at a time and dredge them in the cornmeal mixture. Toss gently and make sure they are well coated, then shake any excess bread off. Place the coated oysters on a metal cooling rack until all of them have been coated. Letting them sit for a few minutes helps to fuse the breading and buttermilk and keeps the breading from falling off when they are fried. Place a large stockpot, Dutch oven, or cast iron skillet with high sides over medium-high heat and add one to two inches of oil. When the oil reaches 370 degrees, carefully add the oysters, one at a time to fry. Depending on the size of your pan, it works best to fry in batches and only cook six to eight at a time. You do not want to crowd them. (Maintain a consistent heat of 370 degrees by increasing or decreasing the heat under the pan.)Let the oysters fry for about two to three minutes, stirring occasionally or until the breading is light golden brown and the meat is opaque with the edges slightly curled. Use a wire kitchen spider or slotted spoon to remove them from the oil. Place on a paper towel or wire cooling rack to drain. Repeat until all of the oysters are fried and serve immediately. Optional, garnish with fresh lemon or lime slices and serve with your choice of sauce and sides. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "With crab season open, Talbot watermen tracking weather and economy\n\n April 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 483\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — As Maryland's blue crab season begins, local watermen have their eyes on the weather — and the economy.Jeff Harrison, president of the Talbot Watermen Association, said last week that he's expecting this year's crabbing outlook to be fair, perhaps slightly better than last year.\nHarrison said some crabbing diehards on the Eastern Shore found success in the first few days after the season officially opened April 1.\n\"When they wake up, they're hungry. That's when you tend to catch most of them, is when they first wake up,\" Harrison said.\nBut recent cold temperatures slowed that early success. Harrison said it's now a \"waiting game\" as temperatures warm up and June nears, the start of what he calls the prime season for crabbing, which runs through September.\nHarrison says the Watermen Association's main concern this year is the economy.\n\"We are in Maryland, where a lot of government workers have been laid off,\" he said. \"Those are the people that buy our crabs more than likely, and so that's kind of the concern that we might have.\"\nHarrison added that similar economic concerns have been prominent in oyster markets on the Eastern Shore since the pandemic, which changed the restaurant businesses landscape.\nLast week, Harrison said crabs began selling for around $150 per bushel off the boat. He says that price will likely increase in May.\nThe 2025 Blue Crab Winter Dredge Survey hasn't been released yet by the Department of Natural Resources, but 2024's survey showed Maryland's crab population at 317 million. It suffered a drastic drop from 594 million in 2019 to 227 million in 2022, before rebounding to 323 million a year later and remaining steady last year.\nHarrison noted decreases in small crabs is a concern. The juvenile crab population, per the DNR, was observed at 86 million in 2021, down 73% in a two-year span. The number rebounded to 138 million in 2024.\n\"They have been seeing not as many. We did have an increase last year,\" Harrison said. \"I think you'll see an increase this year.\"\nSTATE REGULATIONS\nThe crab season in the Chesapeake Bay runs from April 1 to Dec. 15.\nIn April and from October to Dec. 15, catching crabs is allowed in rivers, creek and tributaries a half-hour after sunrise until sunset. In May through September, it's allowed a half-hour before sunrise until sunset.\nIn the Bay itself, in April and from October to Dec. 15, crabbing is permitted a half-hour after sunrise until 5 p.m. In May through September, it's allowed a half-hour before sunrise until 5 p.m.\nThose looking to use trotlines, collapsible traps, net rings, seines or eel pots must acquire a license from the Department of Natural Resources. Unlicensed individuals can use handlines and dip nets, as well as up to two registered crab pots on private property.\nThe state sets bag and size limits for unlicensed and licensed individuals.

    "content": "Planned salmon farm's discharge permit challenged in Cecil County court\n\n April 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jane Bellmyer jbellmyer@cecilwhig.com | Section: Business \n \n 563\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ELKTON — The Chesapeake Bay Foundation has filed a petition for judicial review in Cecil County Circuit Court against AquaCon, the Norwegian company that plans to build a land-based salmon farming operation at the Bainbridge Development Corporation property in Port Deposit.According to CBF, there are concerns about the Maryland Department of the Environment's discharge permit, which would allow AquaCon to send 1.9 million gallons of post-production water back into the Susquehanna River daily. Paul Small, CBF Vice President for Litigation, pointed to similar companies in Florida and Canada that have not had the best results on the native habitat, with reports of fish kills in North America and fires and potential water contamination in Denmark.\n\"Land-based salmon farms are relatively new and unpredictable,\" Small said. \"Knowing the prior failures of these types of plants, and that the Susquehanna River is already overloaded with nutrient pollution, MDE's permit must protect against these risks.\"\nIn court papers, CBF noted that the company modeled its discharge permit paperwork after a similar operation in Maine that — to date — has not begun production or its permits have expired.\nAquaCon, based in Oslo, Norway, announced last August that it plans to build its Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS) facility on 160 acres of the former US Navy training base where it would draw water from the Susquehanna, grow salmon in large indoor pools and sell the fish to wholesalers and the restaurant industry.\nToni Sprenkle, Executive Director of BDC, was excited that the first tenant of the property had been announced. She was assured that there would be no environmental impacts.\n\"This is a very good use for Bainbridge,\" Sprenkle said in August. \"There are unique attributes with this. It's close to the Susquehanna River so it can pull large amounts of water.\"She added that the company recycles and treats that water on site and when it is finally discharged it would \"come out cleaner than it went in.\"\nCBF begs to differ. In the court documents, the foundation argues that not enough is known about the science of these operations, pointing the fragility of the river and the harm that could come with discharges of nitrogen, phosphorous and sediment. This could mean the degradation of oxygen levels, grasses and impact recreational and commercial fishermen as well as hunters.\n\"The Susquehanna River is already overloaded with nitrogen and sediment pollution that runs off of farms and suburban developments,\" said Gussie Maguire, CBF Maryland Staff Scientist. \"While we have made tremendous progress reducing that pollution, development pressure continues to strain the health of our waterways. MDE must adequately consider this risk for new, experimental projects like AquaCon.\"\nJust before being released to market, these salmon are moved to purge tanks where they will slough a protein that — if left in place — would make the fish unpalatable. That protein, geosmin, is not included in the discharge permit, according to CBF.\nThe discharge permit requires the company to have net-zero discharge. However, it allows AquaCon to purchase credits to offset the amount of its nitrogen, phosphorous and sediment.\nAquaCon had plans to build its RAS plant in Caroline County but residents of the Federalsburg community fought back claiming the plant would endanger the Atlantic sturgeon population in Marshyhope Creek. In October 2022, AquaCon agreed and withdrew its pending Maryland Department of the Environment discharge permit application. Sprenkle pointed out that Marshyhope Creek is a smaller body of water. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The organization educates underserved communities about the growing opportunities in aquaculture, its benefits and sustainability and sustainability's lasting impact.\nBlack, an Easton resident, is an Eastern Shore native through and through and works in oyster restoration. \"I just think there's so much power in a little oyster,\" Black said. \"And they do so much for us. In the water and out of the water.\"\nOysters clean the Chesapeake Bay through filter feeding, which helps clarify the water; nutrient cycling, which allows oysters to process nitrogen in a way that removes it from the water; and through habitat creation, where oyster reefs can provide essential habitat for other marine species.\nHer waterman heritage and Chesapeake culture heavily inspired Black's involvement in this type of work. She said she is proud of her Eastern Shore heritage and seeks to honor her family's legacy by representing the region.\n\"I love being on the Eastern Shore so much,\" Black said. \"I mean, I may not like living here sometimes because we don't have a lot of stuff, but I love the essence and I love the culture.\"\nMinorities in Aquaculture's mission focuses on workforce development. Black said that sometimes, the name can be a deterrent, but once people get past the buzz words of diversity, equity and inclusion, they start to understand the importance of this work.\n\"If we are going to have U.S. seafood competitiveness increasing like this administration wants us to, we're going to need skilled labor to be able to do that,\" she said. \"And so it doesn't really matter if you're Black, white, purple or, whatever, we need you and your skills.\"\nBlack and the 21 members of the coalition went to D.C. to advocate for consensus legislation that aims to create federal regulations and guidelines surrounding aquaculture, such as permitting and site regulations, fish health and welfare measures, labor and equity standards, and climate and sustainability standards.\nBlack said the bill has seen a tremendous amount of support, especially in Maryland and Virginia, but there is excitement and growing interest elsewhere too.\n{p class=\"p1\"}\"I think that people are getting more curious and want to strengthen their connection and understanding to agriculture and what's going on and things like that,\" Black said.\nBlack said if anyone is interested in following along with this new initiative or her other work or wants to get involved, they should visit the website mianpo.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The shell is washed off the boat onto the waiting river floor below the surface.\nThe Wye River Oyster Program seeks to make plantings an annual tradition and encourage more neighboring rivers to join in initiatives to locally support their waterways, according to Burleson.\nThe Wye River Oyster Program Fund is a non-profit of the Mid Shore Community Foundation.\nMore information about Seed to Shuck Ventures can be found at seedtoshuck.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Gardener supplied 85 bushels of oysters, which equates to about 25,500 oysters.\n\"I'm always a big proponent of the environmental work that oysters do and so when we can farm oysters and make money on them, whether they're being sold for food or restoration purposes, it's all good,\" said Farrington, who called oysters \"habitat engineers.\"\nAccording to Ewing, the St. Mary's River Watershed Association began planting oysters in the river in 2013 and it became an oyster sanctuary in 2017.\n\"I'd say [the oysters make] a big difference,\" Ewing said. \"Talking to the guys on the waterfront who are out here every day they say the water's clearer and we've definitely seen more fish, blue crabs. This area right here the 5-acre reef site is an extremely popular fishing and crabbing area because of all the oysters we've put in this area.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Oyster regulations to remain unchanged in upcoming season\n\n July 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BROOKE ENSMINGER | Section: Dorchester Star \n \n 455\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Maryland will maintain its current oyster harvest regulations for the 2025-26 season, even as oyster populations increase in many areas, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources announced in a press release last month.These regulations include rules on daily catch limits, the number of weekly harvest days and temporary area closures.\n\"Keeping the harvest limits as they are will contribute to stability and sustainability over time,\" DNR media relations manager Gregg Bortz said. Bortz said the decision to maintain, rather than increase, harvest limits was made to manage the fishery and oyster population conservatively.\nIn making its decision, DNR considered the new benchmark oyster stock assessment, harvest data trends and the fall survey results from 2023 and 2024.\nResults from the stock assessment show oyster populations have increased in most areas over the past five years.\nUnlike in other areas, the assessment shows oyster abundance in the Chester River continues to decline. As a result, the river will be closed to harvest in the upcoming season, except for fishery plantings.\nThe 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement set 2025 as the goal for fully restoring oyster habitats in five Chesapeake Bay tributaries. Maryland is on track to reach that goal by the end of the year, according to Allison Colden, Maryland executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\n\"Now that we know what works and how to do restoration efficiently, we should be able to achieve at least the same level of restoration, if not more, than we have over the past 10 years,\" Colden said.\nAccording to Colden, the results from this year's assessment are promising, but oysters are still at risk from disease and events that could cause mass die-offs. Population levels necessary for long-term sustainability have not been reached in some areas throughout the Bay.\n\"That's why continued investment and rebuilding efforts are so important to keep the population sustainable,\" Colden said.\nHarvest rules are established annually by DNR based on the status of the oyster population. While future regulations cannot be predicted, Colden said she hopes responsible harvesting of oysters remains a priority.\n\"We believe that, even though we're seeing a significant growth in the oyster population, it'll remain critical for DNR to stay the course and maintain its harvest regulations for the foreseeable future,\" Colden said.\nThe commercial oyster season runs from Oct. 1, 2025, through March 31, 2026 for use of patent tongs, hand tongs and divers. For power dredge and sail dredge, the season runs from Nov. 1, 2025, through March 31, 2026.\nCommercial harvesters are permitted to catch oysters Monday through Friday. Daily catch limits vary depending on the equipment used.\nThe recreational season runs from Oct. 1, 2025, through March 31, 2026. Recreational harvesters are limited to one bushel per person per day and may harvest oysters Monday through Saturday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hargrove was flanked behind a podium by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md., 1st) and state agriculture officials.\nRollins and Harris announced two efforts to aid the processing industry for wild-caught blue catfish, a species that outcompetes its Chesapeake Bay counterparts and preys on native fish and blue crabs.\nFirst, the USDA is opening $6 million in grant funding to seafood processors, a move Rollins and Harris say will help get the processing industry off its feet.\nHarris said it's all about beefing up the commercial market for current and new wild-caught blue catfish processors. He hopes more facilities like Tilghman Island Seafood pop up on the Eastern Shore.\n\"The bottom line is we have to do something. I hope it's not too late,\" Harris said. \"I think it's not if we can get this going. But the way to do it is to make sure we can develop a commercial market.\"\nIndividual grants will range from $250,000 to $1 million, per the USDA. Applicants must cover 50% of their total project cost. The application deadline is Oct. 6.\nHargrove said without grant dollars, his business is often \"paralyzed\" with how many blue catfish it can process and sell. He's sent shipments as far as San Francisco and Hong Kong.\nThe newly revealed available grant money could make a significant difference, Hargrove said.\n\"Hopefully, with this money, we can really automate a lot of our processes,\" he said.\nFor the second effort, Rollins announced the USDA, jointly with the Maryland Department of Agriculture, will purchase up to $2 million of Chesapeake Bay blue catfish in a one-year pilot.\nThe purchases will be done through USDA's Section 32 program, Rollins noted, directing food toward low-income areas and residents.\n\"This dual effort will support regional processors, remove invasive catfish from the Chesapeake Bay and produce nutritious protein to American families,\" Rollins said.\nHargrove took Rollins, Harris and other officials through Tilghman Island Seafood's facility before the formal press conference on Wednesday. Employees showed the process of readying the catfish, and one worker even gave the agriculture secretary a hands-on demonstration on how to properly slice a catfish.\nRollins said she was impressed by the Tilghman Island Seafood employees and the product they put out.\n\"To see it firsthand, to meet the workers, to see what happens out on the water, and to see the business that is being built and how we in the government can really help to support that is a big takeaway as I go back to D.C.,\" Rollins said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "U.S. labor secretary visits Cambridge oyster hatchery on workforce tour\n\n September 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 663\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer came to Cambridge to tour Horn Point Oyster Hatchery as her Maryland stop on the Secretary's \"American at Work\" listening tour. She chose the hatchery to preview one of Maryland's \"most important\" industries.Maryland was Chaves-DeRemer's 36th stop on her U.S. tour that focuses on workforce investments.\nFor Manager of the UMCES Horn Point Laboratory Stephanie Alexander, the goals of the visit were to foster dialogue.\n\"She (the secretary) was very engaged in the tour. She grasped what we were doing, and I think she really understood that we were kind of here for the trifecta of the oyster, the commercial fishery, the private aquaculture sector, as well as the restoration sector,\" Alexander said.\nChavez-DeRemer chose the Horn Point Oyster Hatchery in Cambridge because aquaculture is \"an important industry here in the state of Maryland.\" She said the tour made her think not only of the science that goes into the oysters but the future of the industry.\n\"I asked a question in there: had they thought about 3D printing oyster shells? Now, why would I ask that question? I was in Japan for the World Fair just a few months ago, and they were 3D printing coral and reintroducing that back into the ocean and would reintegrate and grow new coral. So it's those kinds of questions that I think about. How can we best fortify the industry?\" Chaves-DeRemer said following the tour.\nShe said her goal is to complete the remaining 14 states by the first week of December in hopes to provide timely, actionable feedback to President Donald Trump within the first year of both of their terms.\nChavez-DeRemer said feedback from the tour will shape workforce programs and federal grant decisions. She said the Labor Department's focus on jobs and training reflects the administration's priorities of accountability, innovation and community strength.\nChaves-DeRemer emphasized the \"Make America Skilled Again\" grants, which are intended to flow to state and local partners and fund targeted workforce needs, including apprenticeships. The hatchery had one apprentice last cycle and aims for two more next year.\nAlexander said she personally funded the apprenticeship in the previous year and that it was nice to hear of other potential funding opportunities.\n\"My ideal apprentice would be somebody who has ties to the oyster industry, who is looking to do things different than what has historically been done. I think that would be amazing to foster connections, not only between the industry and our community, but the environment,\" Alexander said.\nWhen asked about how to stimulate the workforce amid federal budget cuts, Chaves-DeRemer said the department is focused on preventing waste, fraud and abuse, aligning with Trump's budget with economic goals, which were central to his campaign and the early months of his current term.\nShe said this is done through inter-agency collaboration via memorandum of understandings.\nThe federal administration says it is cutting waste by modernizing operations such as using technology like AI, streamlining compliance programs, and upgrading systems to prevent fraud and inefficiency.\n\"Two out of every three new jobs is created by a small business owner,\" Chaves-DeRemer said. \"So right here in Maryland, this industry is important. It's important to the ancillary jobs that it will affect. So the more we grow this economy, the better off and more prosperity we'll have.\"\nAlexander hopes there will be future collaboration with the Department of Labor to build a highly skilled workforce in Maryland, especially in Cambridge.\nChaves-DeRemer said she is committed to personally conveying state-level insights to the president and coordinating across agency leadership for implementation.\n\"You really cannot understand what's happening on the ground and how it affects the local economy, the everyday average worker in America, unless you can talk to them,\" she said. \"So I wouldn't know about this laboratory unless I'm here on site to hear these reports, to understand the lovely woman who gave me the tour. She started off as an intern and 29 years later, here she is, talking about why the oyster industry is so important.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
