    "content": "A fresh look: Northern Ireland's troubled history is traced in PBS documentary\n\n August 24, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 518\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Typically and logically, some of the most telling documents of history are those related by people who actually lived through the given times.The timeline of the strains of life in Northern Ireland is well-known, and it gets first-person treatment in a PBS documentary that spans five parts and three nights. After first being presented as a streaming offering via the network's digital avenues last May, \"Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland\" makes its broadcast premiere nightly from Monday, Aug. 28, through Wednesday, Aug. 30 (check local listings).Co-produced with PBS with England's BBC and BBC Northern Ireland, the program by filmmaker James Bluemel showcases the memories of individuals who experienced daily challenges over the course of more than three decades, from the late 1960s - and the start of what were known as The Troubles, which ultimately cost an estimated 3500-plus lives - to the signing of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement in 1998.The Troubles technically began in 1966 with the Ulster Volunteer Army's opposition to the Irish Republican Army punctuated by several attacks on Catholics.As detailed in the program's opening hour, \"It Wasn't Like a Movie Anymore,\" the situation festered over several years and ultimately erupted into Bloody Sunday, the 1972 event that saw British soldiers shoot 26 unarmed civilians during a protest in Derry, Northern Ireland. Thirteen of the wounded died on the exact day, and one more succumbed to his injuries after several months.Part 2, \"Do Paramilitaries Lie Awake at Night?,\" picks up in the immediate aftermath of the massacre as other instances of violence occurred. While Catholics and Protestants were very divided in the face of bombings and rigid paramilitary patrols, young people on each side of the conflict found punk music to be a respite, particularly in giving voice to their emotions.The third part, \"So Many Broken Hearts,\" recalls how alarmingly common the discord in Northern Ireland became - encompassing assassinations and car bombings. Also, a hunger strike was waged by IRA prisoners to protest the policies of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.In Part 4, \"The Dirty War,\" the documentary moves along to the late 1980s. The ongoing violence was supplemented by an increase in the information war while the physical one raged on, with efforts to infiltrate paramilitary groups used as attempts to stop the conflict from within. Considerable paranoia resulted, as very few people were sure who to trust.The concluding portion, \"Who Wants to Live Like That?,\" involves a major diplomatic controversy: namely, U.S. President Bill Clinton's 1994 White House invitation to Gerry Adams, the then-leader of the Sinn Fein party, which was associated at the time with the Irish Republican Army. That move drew sharply differing reactions, but the same year, the IRA announced a ceasefire (which would last until 1996). Later in 1994, loyalist paramilitaries also issued a ceasefire, contingent on \"the continued cessation of all nationalist/republican violence.\" History bears out that the legacy of The Troubles continued for years, but \"Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland\" covers much of the essential information comprehensively. And a great deal of it remains troubling today. \n \n Caption: James as featured in \"Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We were having dinner with friends when the subject of the \"company store\" came up. I knew I'd heard that phrase somewhere.\"You haul sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt. Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go - I owe my soul to the company store.\" What was this company store and, more importantly, why did this guy owe his soul to it? Must be serious if his debt could forestall his death.As I've always said, if you need an answer, find a teacher.Welcome Richard Joyce, history teacher at Wilmington High School in Wilmington, Illinois, from whom I learned: Soon after the discovery of extensive coal fields in the 1860s, large corporations bought huge tracts of land, mines were sunk and \"boom towns\" exploded in size as miners flocked from eastern states and Europe. Life was horribly difficult for the miners and their families.The most common complaint of the miners concerned their pay and the total control that the companies had over their financial well-being.Companies sometimes paid in \"scrip,\" which was taken in trade only at the company store. At times, men who refused to buy from the company store were dismissed.Well, that certainly explains things. It's not only a song; it's a history lesson.Makes me thankful to be living in 2023 and not 1898.These days, stores care about their customers more than their bottom line.You know, it's good to take time for reflection now and then, to make sure we've learned from the mistakes of the past. After all, we sure wouldn't want to repeat them!Oh, we've come a long way, baby!Or have weftCO PYR IGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n \n Caption: MARY HUNT \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "State prepares to celebrate annual Maryland Day\n\n March 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Reid mreid@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 640\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It started with two ships sailing out of an English port in 1633 and led to the founding of Maryland on March 25, 1634.St. Mary's County Museum Division manager Karen Stone discussed the first Maryland colony as well as those in Virginia and Massachusetts during a \"Maryland Day History — Who Knew Who?\" presentation a week ago at the Leonardtown library.\n\"It is [overlooked], and it's actually the most important day in Maryland's history,\" Stone said. \"It's a very important date, and I think people remember it in passing, but like so much of history they don't really understand the full story of it. They don't understand what it meant to come here as Catholics and have a safe place to worship.\"\nSt. Clement's Island Museum celebrated Maryland Day on the actual day, Monday, March 25, with free admission and free water taxi rides. There was a Mass at 10 a.m. and a ceremony on St. Clement's Island at 2 p.m. A separate event was held at Historic St. Mary's City on Saturday, March 23.\n\"I think it's a day that everyone would take the opportunity to visit where Maryland began,\" said Stone, whose descendants arrived in the New England colonies in the late 1620s, while her husband has ties to the Virginia colonies.\nWhile there is no known official list of passengers that sailed on the Ark and the Dove and eventually landed at St. Clement's Island in the Potomac River, Stone said, the settlers that arrived between 1634 and 1680 are able to be identified by their claims for land.\nStone estimated there were about 32,000 settlers that arrived in Maryland between 1634 and 1680.\n\"What was needed was families to set up a community that would be a Catholic refuge and a personally profitable enterprise for the proprietor,\" Stone said. \"There were people who came to Maryland with the hope of economic prosperity, but the ruling men and their families came for religious freedom.\"\nEach settler was automatically entitled to 50 acres of land per person until the system ended in 1680. Though they were entitled to free land, the property itself was difficult to attain as the owner needed to acquire four different permits, each of which cost plenty. As a result, many settlers were unable to afford their \"free\" land and were forced to sell their acreage, she said.\n\"Prices were not set [at a fixed rate],\" Stone said, \"so [the permit sellers] made a living off these.\"\nAfter trying to colonize the island of Newfoundland in northeast Canada in the 1620s, George Calvert, who was the first baron of Baltimore and the founding father of Maryland, determined the climate was too harsh. So he requested and eventually received a charter of lands for 12 million acres just north of the Potomac River.\nJamestown was the first English colony in the New World and settled in 1607 by entrepreneurs, mostly single men, intent on making their fortune. It was a private venture funded by the Virginia Company of London. By the end of the first year, only 38 settlers were still alive but 100 new settlers and provisions arrived in January 1608, and a church was constructed.\nThe theme by John Smith, who was the council president, was, \"He that will not work shall not eat.\" The plan was to establish a silk colony, but a tree fungus forced them to start harvesting tobacco.\nPlymouth was also chartered by King James I and was supposed to be a private venture, but with families and it was established at the northern end of the Virginia territory. Its principal business was whaling.\nThe colonization of Jamestown and Plymouth ultimately helped the Maryland settlers because they had maps and friends, and Stone said they didn't \"have the language issues, they knew what to bring because lists had been set home, so they knew a lot more what to expect.\"\nTwitter: @MichaelSoMdNews \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They do not acknowledge or condemn the role of Hamas (first designated as a terrorist organization in 1997 by the U.S. State Department) in launching the current and ongoing war in a long history of wars between Hamas and Israel.\nThey do not acknowledge Hamas started this war on October 7, 2023, when they killed an estimated 2,000 innocent Israeli civilians, including children; and took 250 hostages, some of whom have died in captivity.\nToday's campus protesters are rabidly antisemitic who support the goals of Hamas — reject the right of Israel to exist, drive Jews from Gaza, erase Israel as a nation, and by extension, challenge the principles and values of western society.\nThey defend their actions based in part on American constitutional rights on freedom on assembly and freedom of speech.\nThat defense is absurd.\nAmerican constitutional rights do not defend verbal harassment, threats and inflicting physical harm on Jews, Jewish students, supporters of Israel or anyone else.\nThese rights do not defend illegally occupying buildings and grounds on college campuses to disrupt learning and related school activities such as graduations.\nColleges should never permit or tolerate any advancement of antisemitism under the guise of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.\nIt's time for public officials and college administrators to walk their talk on their historical and often stated deep commitment to the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion.\nOne way to accomplish that is to share widely the following story of Martin Niemöller, a theologian and minister in Germany before, during and after World War II.\nBefore the war, Niemöller, like many Germans, resented how Germany was treated after World War I. Niemöller was active in antisemitic political parties and organizations. He was enthusiastic about the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and voted for the Nazi party in 1933.\nEarly on during World War II he was aware of the Nazi's persecution of other Europeans, but he remained silent. Niemöller was especially supportive of persecution of members of political movements with whom he disagreed.\nLater during the war, Niemöller helped launch a new church denomination that opposed the Nazification of German Protestant churches. That led to his being sent to a concentration camp for seven years where he narrowly avoided being executed.\nFollowing the war, Niemöller went on a speaking tour throughout Germany. On that tour, he acknowledged and expressed great remorse over the impact of his own inaction on and indifference to the fate of victims in the Holocaust.\nNiemöller included the following remarks in his presentations about the German Nazis:\nFirst, they came for the communists. I did not speak out because I was not a communist.\nThen, they came for the socialists. I did not speak out because I was not a socialist.\nThen, they came for the unionists. I did not speak out because I was not a unionist.\nThen, they came for the Jews. I did not speak out because I was not a Jew.\nThen, they came for me, and there was no one left to speak out for me.\nOver the years, Niemöller varied the names of the groups the Nazis came for prior to coming for him. Sometimes he mentioned all the above groups and other times he selectively replaced them with others such as people with mental and physical disabilities and Jehovah's Witnesses. That was the universe he was aware of at that time.\nToday, our list could include the same groups plus other ethnic groups, the elderly, children, progressives, conservatives, liberals or virtually any readily identifiable group in our society.\nRegardless of using his original list, a revised list, or a combination list from both, Niemöller's overall message is as important today as when he first delivered it.\nAnother message that is as important today as when first expressed by philosopher George Santayana who warned \"Those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it.\"\nIt is my hope that sooner rather than later, college students, college leaders, elected officials and the American public will become more aware of and learn from Niemöller's history with antisemitism and will also heed Santayana's warning.\nThe messages from both are simple yet profound and timely.\nWe must not be silent, indifferent or inactive in response to hatred whenever it is directed at any of the groups identified above; plus any others I may have inadvertently missed.\nLikewise, we must accept if we do not learn from history, we are condemned to repeat it.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Shedding a tear on Memorial Day is appropriate\n\n June 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 579\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last Monday was Memorial Day.The origins of Memorial Day go back to the end of America's Civil War, the deadliest war in American history. In that four-year conflict more than 622,000 Americans died, more than died in World War I and World War II combined.\nBy the late 1860s, countless towns and cities across America launched springtime tributes at the graves of fallen soldiers from both sides of the civil war.\nThese tributes were often community-wide events during which businesses closed, residents decorated the graves with flowers and flags and recited prayers to honor and remember the fallen.\nThe historical practice of placing flowers on the graves of the fallen led these events to be widely referred to as \"Decoration Day.\"\nThe first national observance of what is now called Memorial Day occurred on May 30, 1868, in the Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C.\nThe speaker was Civil War veteran James A. Garfield, then a member of Congress and a future president.\nIn 1938, Congress officially approved Memorial Day as a federal holiday.\nFrom 1868 until 1970 Memorial Day was observed annually on May 30. That date was selected because it was not connected to any battle or end date of any war.\nOver the years, the scope of Memorial Day was expanded to honor and remember all the members of the United States military who died in World War I, World War II. Korean War, Vietnam War, Operation Desert Storm, the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan.\nIn 1971, Congress decided Memorial Day should be observed annually on the last Monday in May partly to provide federal employees a three-day holiday weekend.\nSadly, since then Memorial Day has largely been replaced by far too many Americans from being a solemn day of remembrance, to being just the third day of a long holiday weekend.\nIt is characterized as the unofficial start of the summer vacation season, trips to the ocean or mountains, family picnics and retailers holding sales events.\nIt is time to restore Memorial Day to what it was intended to be.\nIt is a time to reflect upon stories like the one below by June Wandrey Mann.\nJune Mann served as a dirst lieutenant in the U.S. Army Nurse Corps during World War II.\nBetween 1942 to 1946, she served in Africa, Sicily, Italy, France and Germany.\nIn her post war book — \"Bedpan Commando\" — she wrote about her experiences. In it she wrote, \"Working in the shock wards, giving transfusions, was a rewarding but sad experience. Many wounded soldiers' faces still haunt my memory.\"\nHer recollection of one experience in August 1943 while serving in Sicily is especially heartbreaking.\n\"An 18-year-old boy is carried into the shock ward, and he looks up at me trustingly asking, 'How am I doing, nurse?' I just kiss his forehead and say, 'You are doing just fine, soldier.' He smiles sweetly and says, 'I was just checking.' Then he dies. We all cry in private. But not in front of the boys. Never in front of the boys.\"\nWith all due respect to Nurse Mann who was a member of the \"greatest generation,\" I suggest that at least once on every Memorial Day weekend, it is not only OK, but very appropriate to cry … in private, in front of others, or do both.\nWe should do so in remembrance of all American military veterans who as Abraham Lincoln observed in his Gettysburg Address, \"gave the last full measure of devotion.\"\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Their valiant efforts helped preserve freedom in America, 1941-1945.\"\nAt that sacred spot, incoming Post Commander Tim Lloyd, a veteran of the Navy, provided remarks.\n\"We lost some good people, and their sacrifice gave us our freedom today.\"\nCommander Paul Showalter talked about the clandestine nature of the mission the Kent County soldiers trained for at the Armory.\n\"Two days prior to June 6, 1944, the activity to get prepared to go to Normandy wasn't mentioned in (President) Roosevelt's fireside chats,\" he said.\nRoosevelt only hinted at it.\nIn the armory, built in 1931, was where those soldiers trained.

As has been customary in election years, President Biden traveled to France to offer a speech to commemorate this anniversary.Most D-Day speeches have been largely forgotten … with one notable exception.\nThat exception occurred on the 40th anniversary of D-Day, when then President Ronald Reagan delivered a D-Day speech affirming his status as \"The Great Communicator\" and a master of the spoken word.\nEver mindful of the power of optics in communications, the setting for his speech was the U.S. Ranger Monument at Pointe du Hoc France, overlooking the landing beaches of Normandy.\nJoining Reagan at the event were 62 Army Ranger D-Day veterans, the Queen of Britain, the Queen of the Netherlands, the King of Norway, the King of Belgium, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg and the Prime Minister of Canada.\nFollowing Reagan's remarks, presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told the Washington Post: \"For sheer oratorical eloquence, it would become one of the most inspirational presidential speeches ever delivered.\"\nEven longtime CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite, who previously covered World War II as a correspondent (and was never a Reagan fan), was reportedly deeply moved by the speech.\nIn what is now widely known as the Boys at Pointe du Hoc speech, Reagan included the following remarks:\n\"We're here to mark that day in history when the Allied peoples joined in battle to reclaim this continent to liberty. For four long years, much of Europe had been under a terrible shadow. Free nations had fallen, Jews cried out in the camps, millions cried out for liberation. Europe was enslaved, and the world prayed for its rescue. Here in Normandy the rescue began. Here the Allies stood and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled in human history.\nWe stand on a lonely, windswept point on the northern shore of France. The air is soft, but forty years ago at this moment, the air was dense with smoke and the cries of men, and the air was filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon. At dawn, on the morning of the 6th of June 1944, 225 Rangers jumped off the British landing craft and ran to the bottom of these cliffs. Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the invasion: to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out the enemy guns. The Allies had been told that some of the mightiest of these guns were here and they would be trained on the beaches to stop the Allied advance.\nThe Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers — at the edge of the cliffs shooting down at them with machine-guns and throwing grenades. And the American Rangers began to climb. They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up. When one Ranger fell, another would take his place. When one rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb again. They climbed, shot back and held their footing. Soon, one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top, and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to seize back the continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five came here. After two days of fighting only ninety could still bear arms.\nBehind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that were thrust into the top of these cliffs. And before me are the men who put them there.\nThese are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war.\nAs memorable as Reagan's remarks are, I remember different D-Day remarks at a different time, in a different place. They occurred when I was in college during the Vietnam War.\nOne of our professors told us we would have a guest speaker at our next class. That was not unusual as our professor was well connected in the community and frequently secured prominent people to meet with us. He did not elaborate further so we had no idea who the speaker would be or why they were invited.\nWhen our guest arrived, we learned that he was not only a survivor of D-Day; he was one the surviving boys of Pointe du Hoc.\nThis veteran spent over an hour sharing his D-Day experiences.\nSadly, I no longer remember his name, but I remember his talk. He was low key, soft-spoken, reflective and humble.\nOccasionally, he paused as though the memories were too difficult to discuss. We could tell he was still deeply pained by his D-Day experience but was also glad his story was being heard.\nHis presentation was not a carefully crafted or rehearsed speech. There was no media coverage of it. His remarks were not recorded or distributed. There were no political dignitaries there, just a group of college students. Many of them were disdainful of older people (anyone over the age of 30) and disillusioned with the ongoing American military involvement in Vietnam.\nIn his closing comments, our guest said what so many of the greatest generation so often said after serving in the second world war: \"I didn't do anything special. I was not a hero.\"\nWhat happened next was totally unexpected.\nEvery student spontaneously stood up, shook his hand and thanked him for what he and his Army Ranger colleagues did. We told him what he did was very special, and he was a hero.\nThat was a special moment that I will always remember and cherish.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Schempp, struck down, 8-1, rules requiring the recitation of the Lord's Prayer or reading of Biblical verses in public schools.\nIn 1967, China successfully tested its first thermonuclear (hydrogen) bomb.\nIn 1972, President Richard Nixon's eventual downfall began with the arrest of five burglars inside the Democratic headquarters in Washington, D.C.'s, Watergate complex.\nIn 2008, hundreds of same-sex couples got married across California on the first full day that gay marriage became legal by order of the state's highest court.\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama extended some benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees.\nIn 2012, Rodney King, 47, whose 1991 videotaped beating by Los Angeles police sparked widespread outrage and who struggled with addiction and repeated arrests, died in Rialto, California, in an apparent accidental drowning.\nIn 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that states can't demand proof of citizenship from people registering to vote in federal elections unless they get federal or court approval to do so.\nIn 2017, the jury in Bill Cosby's sexual assault case declared itself hopelessly deadlocked, resulting in a mistrial for the 79-year-old TV star charged with drugging and groping a woman more than a decade earlier; prosecutors immediately announced they would pursue a second trial. (That trial resulted in Cosby's conviction, but Pennsylvania's highest court later overturned it.)\nIn 2019, Iran announced that it was breaking compliance with the international accord that kept it from making nuclear weapons; the announcement meant that Iran could soon start to enrich uranium to just a step away from weapons-grade levels. The Trump administration followed Iran's announcement by ordering 1,000 more troops to the Middle East.\nIn 2021, the Supreme Court, in a 7-2 ruling, left intact the entire Affordable Care Act, rejecting the latest major Republican-led effort to kill the national health care law known as \"Obamacare.\"\nToday's Birthdays: Actor Peter Lupus is 92.

Thomas Murphy, who brought the submarine to Piney Point, as well as members of the family of the German engineer who outfitted it with groundbreaking features, such as a snorkel.\nThe German submarine, which was also fitted with an experimental synthetic rubber skin designed to counter sonar devices, was on patrol off the coast of Ireland in 1945 when it faced an enemy attack. It dove to 570 feet and for the next 31 hours successfully hid from the Allies.\nThe captain claimed that 299 depth charges were dropped on it and caused no significant damage. One week later, the war ended and the Germans surrendered the sub.\n\"It's really important and I don't think people understand about it at all,\" Stone said. \"I'm sure they go by the buoy and think, 'What is that?' So this will help bring attention to it and help people understand how important the Potomac was for the Navy starting with the American Revolution and maybe before.\"\nSaturday's event will also feature the unveiling of several new panels in the museum's Black Panther exhibit, book signings by author Stephan Hamilton, who penned \"German submarine U-1105 'Black Panther': The naval archaeology of a U-boat,\" videos and a dive boat will be on hand to take members of the Battle of the Atlantic Research and Expedition Group out to dive on the wreck and do reconnaissance.\n\"It's a great historic park, but there's more to it; it's got a naval history to it,\" Stone said referring to Piney Point Museum and Lighthouse. \"It's renowned by submariners, but I think it should be renowned locally by the county as well.\"\nIn 1994, the sub was named Maryland's first Shipwreck Preserve.\nThe event will be followed by the museum's Family Fest, which will feature food trucks, story time, axe throwing, vendors, vintage boats and live music by The Sibling Rivalry Band.\nFor more information, go to www.museums.stmarysmd.com or www.facebook.com/1836Light. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Monumental advice on eve of Trump's inauguration\n\n January 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MELINDA BURRELL | Section: Columns \n \n 560\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I love watching the brides pose for photos by the Lincoln Memorial and the teenagers wriggle through TikTok choreography near the Washington Monument. Their modern hopes breathe life into the centuries-old wisdom of our capital city.I have lived in Washington, D.C., for years and still can't get enough of it. On sunny Saturday morning walks, my pace is casual, but the insights are profound.\nD.C. is a living lesson about what George Washington described as \"the last great experiment for promoting human happiness.\"\nThe inauguration brings new people to Washington, and I hope they will love and learn from the city as much as I do.\nOne of my favorite monuments is near the Capitol. Two iron cranes stand together. Their wings thrust upward and barbed wire falls from their beaks. Around them is a complicated mix of names: Japanese Americans who died fighting for us in World War II, and the internment camps to which their families and friends had been forced.\nYet I am fiercely proud to be an American when, amidst these names, I read President Reagan's words: \"Here we admit a wrong. Here we affirm our commitment as a nation to equal justice under the law.\"\nFew countries I've lived in have the strength to admit such a grave national error.\nThat urge for improvement is in our national genes. As the Constitution states, we're constantly trying to \"form a more perfect union.\"\nSure enough, a few miles away under a white marble dome stands a statue of Thomas Jefferson. He, too, speaks to us of striving for perfection: \"… Laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened … institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times.\"\nWhile I respect the somber challenge of those words, I love his next, more whimsical, sentence: \"We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.\"\nFrom a breezy hill in northeast Washington, D.C., President Lincoln also challenges us. It's the cottage where he and his family escaped the city's summer heat, though Lincoln daily commuted to the White House. His dusty horseback ride revealed the stakes of the Civil War: wounded soldiers bumping along in ambulances and former slaves surviving in hastily built camps after escaping behind Union lines.\nLincoln welcomed allies and adversaries alike to the cottage for advice, sometimes looking out from the veranda over the not-yet-completed Capitol and Washington Monument. As a modern visitor 150 years later, I can stand in the same place. The buildings are completed. But which of Lincoln's hopes and fears are still in progress?\nAt a newer memorial, Martin Luther King, Jr offers optimism about the timescale of our national effort: \"We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\"\nAt an even newer memorial closer to the Capitol, President Eisenhower puts a worldwide spin on our work of becoming a more perfect union: \"We look upon this shaken earth, and we declare our firm and fixed purpose — the building of a peace with justice in a world where moral law prevails.\"\nStrolling through the city, I love listening to leaders from different periods of our great experiment. I hope our elected representatives will as well. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "'Amazing fortitude and strength':New book details 1954 Chestertown explosion\n\n February 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 818\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Erika Quesenbery-Sturgill, historian and author, is set to revive a nearly forgotten chapter of Chestertown's past with her upcoming book, \"Working to Preserve Freedom When Suddenly Taken: The Great Chestertown Explosion of July 16th\". In her narrative, Quesenbery-Sturgill examines the devastating explosion at Kent Manufacturing — a government factory at 800 High Street that produced M-80s for military training — and the resilient spirit of a community in crisis.On July 16, 1954, without warning, a series of three explosions rocked the plant at 10:25 a.m., killing 11 people — 10 women and one man — injuring many and causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. The cause of the blast remains a mystery, although the historian theorizes that a spark in one of the drying tunnels in Building B ignited a canister of azide, setting off a chain reaction.\n\"I didn't write the book as a glorification of the tragedy. It's really an incredible way to honor these men and women who acted so nobly and honorably,\" Quesenbery-Sturgill said.\nAt the height of the Cold War, when civil defense broadcasts instructed students to duck under their desks and the Eastern Shore buzzed with industrial might — from Chestertown Hosiery Mill to Vita Foods — the explosion sent shock waves far beyond the factory walls. Kent Manufacturing, then owned by Chestertown's mayor and employing 350 workers — mostly women — was a vital part of the local economy with a biweekly payroll of roughly $25,000.\nEyewitnesses recalled that even people aboard ferries in the bay heard the booming blast, saw the swirling smoke and felt the tremors of destruction as debris flew as far as Quaker Neck. \"Today, people would be looking on their phones immediately and scouring the internet for information,\" Quesenbery-Sturgill said.\nIn the chaos that followed, rumors abounded. Some residents thought an enemy attack was underway while others speculated that a bomb had come loose from Dover or that a jet had broken the sound barrier — doing \"Top Gun before Top Gun,\" Quesenbery-Sturgill quipped.\nA week earlier, a canister of azide — roughly the size of a Ben and Jerry's ice cream container — had been reported stolen from the plant, adding another layer of intrigue to an already confusing situation.\nAs the town evacuated, many residents — some pushing baby buggies or strollers and others fleeing on foot — scrambled to escape the danger. In the Radcliffe swamp near the blast site, six elderly workers from Building B were later found hollering for help, wounded, after plunging into neck-deep water to escape the falling debris. \"They fell numerous times during the blasts, scaled two chainlink fences, and with their clothes being ripped, water was the safest course of action,\" Quesenbery-Sturgill recalled.\nFirefighters, forced to wait until the third explosion subsided, eventually combed through the wreckage, discovering human remains amid pockets of smaller blasts. A makeshift morgue was set up in the basement of the Chestertown Armory, where families sifted through blankets and personal items — sometimes only keychains or pieces of jewelry — in a desperate bid to identify their loved ones. \"You're talking about 300 people and their families traipsing through the entire armory, walking past blankets, without knowing if you'll see your loved one's remains.\"\nDespite the horror, a sense of calm soon prevailed. After the initial shock, a determined \"British stiff-upper lip\" emerged as neighbors began to clean up shattered glass and board up broken windows. Federal agencies later set up emergency phone lines and a Civil Defense Headquarters, but local residents largely took charge of the recovery effort. \"Clean up, carry on and pull yourself up by your bootstraps. They maintained their sense of place,\" Quesenbery-Sturgill said.\nIn the days following the tragedy, as military and federal officials arrived, the resilient citizens of Chestertown had already begun restoring order.\nThe locals were taking care of it, she noted.\nPerhaps, the author surmised, Chestertown's efficiency and poise was the reason for the very undramatic headline in the Kent News a week later too: \"Town Vicinity Near Normal After Tragedy.\" It probably was the case, Quesenbery-Sturgill said, with people all-hands-on-deck to get back to normal.\nToday, the Cadwalader Chapter of Kent Questers has placed a memorial marker at the former site of Kent Manufacturing, serving as a lasting tribute to those who lost their lives on July 16, 1954.\nIt reminds residents of this tragedy, but few have told the remarkable story of the stubborn, self-made, rugged, blue collar, can-do attitude of Chestertown in that bygone era.\n\"What is fascinating is there is such an intense interest in local history here. You live it, you breathe it and you talk with it every single day,\" she said, commending her inspiration for writing the book, local historian Joan Horsey, who experienced the tragedy firsthand.\n\"These are greatest generation people — showing amazing fortitude and strength,\" Quesenbery-Sturgill said, emphasizing the community's enduring spirit.\nFor more information on her research and previous works, readers can contact Quesenbery-Sturgill at erikaquesenbery@yahoo.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Colonizing Maryland is a true 48 hours mystery\n\n March 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Reid mreid@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 638\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n What's the difference between two days?A lot, perhaps as explained by Henry Miller during his presentation \"The Founding of Maryland 1632-1634\" held March 10 at the St. Mary's County Library's Leonardtown branch.\nIt is widely regarded that Maryland was founded March 25, 1634, when English settlers held a public mass and erected a large cross on St. Clement's Island in the Potomac River.\nBut Miller believes that \"a possible interpretation\" could be that it was actually founded two days later on March 27.\nThe Historic St. Mary's City Maryland Heritage Scholar refers to a \"very interesting document\" he discovered a decade ago at the British National Archives. There he found a timeline by fur trapper William Claiburne, who was \"arch-enemies for life\" with Lord Calvert.\nClaiburne often wrote letters complaining about Calvert and in May 1635 he filed a legal document and added a timeline of events. In it he wrote \"27 March 1634 Maryland was planted,\" which at the time meant settled or begun.\n\"I think we have to give credence to his knowledge of what was happening,\" Miller said, \"and I would suggest that the 27th of March might be considered the real founding day of the colony of Maryland.\"\nIn addition, \"A Relation of Maryland\" from 1635 states \"Thus upon the 27th day of March, Anno Domino (in the year of the Lord) 1634, the Governor took possession of the place, And named the Towne Saint Maries.\"\nRegardless, Maryland Day will be feted next Tuesday, March 25, at St. Clement's Island during the county government's annual celebration.\nMiller also spoke about the planning and voyage of the settlers from England to Maryland during his hour-long discussion earlier this month.\n\"I thought it was fascinating to hear how the colony was founded,\" said Marcia Doerr of Potomac, who said she attended St. Mary's College of Maryland so she was \"familiar with St. Mary's City.\"\n\"I learned a lot,\" Shawn Locke of Hollywood said. \"I didn't know a whole lot about the history, so it was very enlightening.\"\nLord Calvert requested permission to establish a new colony, and one of King James' requests was that the new colony be named after his wife, Henrietta Marie.\n\"Thank goodness she went by Queen Mary,\" Miller said, \"because 'Henriettaland' would have been what we had today.\"\nThe Maryland charter was passed June 20, 1632, with the goal of spreading Christianity, expanding England's realm and generate wealth.\nA year later, Father Andrew White and Cecil Calvert wrote a declaration of Lord Baltimore's Plantation that stated \"how Englishmen may become Angels, the King's Dominions be extended and the Adventurers attain Land and Gear; together with other advantages of that Sweet Land.\"\nThe Ark, a 40-ton sailing ship, was hired and The Dove, at 400 tons, was bought, and following several delays, the expedition set off in November 1633.\nSeveral stops were made along the way, including in Barbados to get corn for planting. A vicious storm even separated the two vessels at one point.\nAccommodations consisted of sleeping on straw mats and subsisting on barley gruel, rations of salt, pork, beans, hard tack and beer. A Christmas Day celebration of bad wine resulted in the deaths of 12 people.\nIn early March 1634, the Dove sailed up the Potomac to ask the Tayac people for permission to settle, which was granted.\nOn March 26, the settlers negotiated with the Yaocomico for land in what is now St. Mary's City under the famous Mulberry tree. \"A Briefe Relation\" states that \"to avoid all just occasion of offense, and color of wrong, we bought of the King for Hatchets, Axes, Hoes, and Cloths, a quantity of some 30 miles of Land.\"\n\"I was very impressed about the careful thought Lord Calvert put into how to legitimize this colony,\" Miller said. \"He was concerned about native peoples and was also worried about the Dutch, the Spanish, the French, all of whom were claiming land.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

History records the actions of recently emancipated members of the United States Colored Troops in the burial of Union soldiers who had been laid to rest in a mass grave at a former racetrack.\nIn 1868, General John A. Logan of the Grand Army of the Republic issued General Order No. 11, establishing Decoration Day on May 30. He called upon members of the Grand Army of the Republic to honor the memory of those who had died in the Civil War, one of the bloodiest conflicts in American history. His order reads:\n\"The 30th day of May, 1868, is designated for the purpose of strewing with flowers or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion, and whose bodies now lie in almost every city, village, and hamlet churchyard in the land. In this observance, no form or ceremony is prescribed, but posts and comrades will in their own way arrange such fitting services and testimonials of respect as circumstances may permit.\"\nThe ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery on May 30, 1868, is considered the first official Memorial Day celebration. Memorial Day became a national holiday in 1889, and a century later, in 1968, the holiday was moved to the last Monday in May, where it remains today.\nA native of Chestertown, Vanessa Isaacs Ringgold graduated from Chestertown High School in the Class of 1971. She earned a B.A. from the University of Maryland Eastern Shore and an M.A. from The Ohio State University. Recently retired and returned to Chestertown, she joined the Board of Sumner Hall in 2022 and currently serves as First Vice President and incoming Board President. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is set to be placed on Maryland Route 16.The marker is the result of work by Chief Archaeologist for the Maryland Department of Transportation Julie Schablitsky, whose team seeks to help people to better understand Tubman's early life through her home and her descendants.\nSchablitsky and her team began searching for signs of Tubman's early life in Dorchester County in late 2020. Through discoveries made during that time, the archeologists were able to tell a larger story of Tubman's young life.\nTubman's childhood was unearthed through the beams and bricks of her father Ben Ross' cabin. The team discovered a chest of drawers with an iron for pressing clothes inside, a variety of white ceramic dishes from England with designs similar to West African textiles painted on them, buttons and a tobacco pipe with an eagle motif.\n\"Perhaps this was a subtle, yet symbolic, public display of resistance, strength and even future aspirations for freedom,\" Schablitsky said about the eagle on the pipe.\nThe discovery of Ross' cabin, which is presumed to be Tubman's birthplace, has not only allowed for historic insights, but has allowed for Tubman's descendants to know her on a more personal level.\nTonet Cuffee, a fourth generation great niece of Tubman's, visited the site of Ross' cabin with Schablitsky's team. \"Harriet Tubman was born here in a rut of pain and injustice, but it was here that she learned faith, resilience, courage and compassion,\" Cuffee said.\nAccording to Schablitsky, Tubman spent much of her time in the area until being moved to Bucktown with her mother, eight siblings and enslaver, Edward Brodess. When Tubman became a teenager, she moved back to the Ross cabin in the wooded wetlands along Harrisville Road and the Blackwater River and began working with her father in logging, cutting and hauling timber.\nThe discoveries made by Schablitsky's team allow people to \"see the places she may have walked, the structures she may have known and the world it was that she was born into,\" Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said.\nDorchester County Council Vice President Mike Detmer made a point to remember Tubman's humanity at Monday's event. \"It's easy for us to celebrate and to honor her now, knowing how her extremely cinematic story of heroism, and tenacity, and toughness and single-mindedness. We know now how it turned out,\" he said.\nThough she lived through immense adversity, Tubman never gave up on her faith and freedom, her descendants said at the event.\nGov. Wes Moore spoke about Maryland's complex history as the \"northernmost southern state.\" He said this complexity is perfectly personified in Maryland's state flag, which is a combination of flags from the Civil War's Union and the Confederate armies.\nOn Monday, Moore spoke of the many hats Tubman wore throughout her life, including during the Civil War. Last year, Tubman was posthumously recognized by Moore as a one-star Brigadier General in Maryland's National Guard for her service in the Civil War.\n\"I learned and realized Harriet Tubman is the original 'leave no man behind,'\" Moore said.\nThe Harriet Tubman historical marker will be installed Monday near the Woolford Store along Route 16 east of Harrison Road. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It also launched Centreville's commemorations leading up to Maryland's 250th anniversary in 2026.\nA Patriot's Story\nWright, who grew up in Queen Anne's County, began his service to the American cause as a lieutenant in Maryland's Seventh Independent Company in early 1776. Later that year, he joined the Continental Army and fought at the Battle of Brooklyn, where the \"Maryland 400\" mounted a desperate charge against overwhelming British forces to buy precious time for Continental troops to retreat.\nWright was among those captured, enduring nearly two years aboard a British prison ship. Keynote speaker Patrick K. O'Donnell, historian and author of Washington's Immortals, described such ships as \"floating concentration camps.\"\nTwo-thirds of the Marylanders were killed or captured in the battle, O'Donnell said, but their sacrifice preserved George Washington's struggling army. \"They bought with their lives and bayonets an hour more precious than any other,\" he said.\nO'Donnell called them the first \"greatest generation.\" \"Their ideals saved the world,\" he said.\nMaryland's Role in the Revolution\nO'Donnell drew from his research to describe the harrowing conditions faced by the ragtag Continental Army — soldiers often lacking clothing, food or even shoes as they marched through winter. Many bought their own gear just to keep fighting.\nWith enlistments expiring and morale low, Washington depended on the steadfast resolve of the Marylanders. \"The dedication of Washington's Immortals saved the Continental Army and changed the course of the revolution, forever altering the fate of the United States of America,\" O'Donnell said.\nIt was this stand, he added, that later gave Maryland its nickname as the Old Line State. \"Marylanders have a lot to be proud of,\" he said.\nA Life of Service\nWhen Wright was finally released, he returned home and devoted his life to civic leadership. He served as Register of Wills, clerk of the county court, member of Maryland's Executive Council, Centreville town councilman, and adjutant general of the state militia.\nCentreville Town Council Member Sandy Huffer, Clerk of the Circuit Court Katherine Hager and Judge Lynn Knight each spoke about the historical roles Wright once held and the responsibilities those offices carried in his day.\nCounty historian Mary Margaret Revell Goodwin, who scripted the ceremony and organized the event, said Wright's legacy is essential to remember. \"Wright gave us a model for what it meant 250 years ago to be an American,\" she said. \"People need to know about this.\"\nLasting Tribute\nThe highlight of the ceremony was the unveiling of a bronze plaque on the Courthouse Square. The marker features an engraving of the ship where Wright was imprisoned and details both his military service and his civic contributions.\nThe Queen Anne's County Commissioners thanked Goodwin and the Centreville 250th Commission for their efforts in preserving the county's Revolutionary history.\n\"This is the first of many events planned for Centreville's Maryland 250th,\" Goodwin said. More programs will continue through 2026 to celebrate the county's role in America's founding.\nAs O'Donnell reminded the audience, the Maryland 400's courage at Brooklyn continues to inspire. \"The dedication of those men,\" he said, \"ensured a democracy that still shines today.\"\nFor more on O'Donnell's work, visit patrickkodonnell.com \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Grave marking ceremony held for Revolutionary War patriot\n\n October 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Riley Dauber rdauber@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 474\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It was an act of bravery nearly two and a half centuries ago, but it has not been forgotten.The Thomas Stone Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution, which includes members from Calvert, Charles and St. Mary's counties, dedicated a patriot grave marking to Hatch Dent, who fought in the 1776 Battle of Brooklyn, this past Saturday.\nThe ceremony took place behind the Dent Memorial Chapel at the Charlotte Hall Veterans Home, where Dent and his family are buried. The new patriot grave marking was installed in the center of the grass, right in front of Dent's grave, to remember his sacrifice on the battlefield.\nAccording to Mike Morthland, president of the Thomas Stone Chapter, the idea for the grave marking came from the late George Owings, who spoke at Morthland's induction ceremony in 2022.\nOwings was a member of the Thomas Stone Chapter and a former state delegate and secretary of Maryland Veterans Affair. He died in 2023 before the grave marking could be installed, so Saturday's ceremony honored both Dent's sacrifice and Owings' wish.\nMembers from other local organizations, including the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution, greeted the crowd following Morthland's introduction.\n\"Events such as this remind us that our freedom was hard won, and it is our responsibility to keep alive the memory of those who made it,\" Stacey Park, regent of the Major William Thomas Chapter of the DAR, said.\nSandy Sterrett, Dent's fourth great-grandson and a member of the Society of the Cincinnati, read Dent's biography and introduced the crowd to Dent's other fourth great-grandchildren.\nDent was born in Charles County in 1751. At the age of 24, he joined the First Maryland Regiment as a third lieutenant before being promoted to second lieutenant.\nHe was one of the only survivors of the Battle of Brooklyn, which took place on Aug. 27, 1776. About 65% of the Maryland army died in battle, and their sacrifice earned them the name \"Maryland 400.\"\nDuring the battle, Dent was captured and held until April 1778. He later resigned in 1779 and gave back to his community through his roles as a reader and rector at Trinity Church and principal and professor of languages at the Charlotte Hall School.\n\"Our organization … is dedicated to keeping the history of this wonderful county alive and perpetuated so that others in the future can understand both why we're here in such a unique place and the people that made this county what it is,\" Peter LaPorte, the executive director of the St. Mary's County Historical Society, said.\nAfter the marker was unveiled and the organization leaders delivered their wreath presentations, the Maryland Society SAR color guard performed a musket salute. U.S. Navy Veteran David Osborne played \"Taps\" while the crowd sang memorable renditions of \"America the Beautiful\" and \"God Bless America\" to remember Dent and his role in the Battle of Brooklyn. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
