    "content": "Fandom made 'Super': CBS premieres new competition series honoring music fans\n\n August 3, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dana Simpson | Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 436\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After decades of competitive reality shows committed to finding the most talented singers, dancers, performers and the like, CBS launches an unscripted series dedicated to the fans - well, to the \"superfans,\" to be exact. Honoring the most loyal of six celebrities' fan bases, the network's new competition series tests a group of contestants' knowledge in exchange for a chance to meet their idols up close and personal. Originally scheduled to arrive in June, \"Superfan\" premieres Wednesday, Aug. 9, on CBS, the CBS app and Paramount+.Created by executive producers Keltie Knight (\"Footloose,\" 2011) and Jodi Roth (\"Inappropriate Jeff,\" 2014), \"Superfan\" makes use of a classic game show model - think BBC's \"Mastermind,\" if you've seen it - testing players on a smattering of facts about the musician they all share a love for. Each week, beginning with LL Cool J (\"NCIS: Los Angeles\"), one music star is welcomed to perform and look on as their biggest fans settle the No.1-fan question once and for all.The series has a six-episode freshman season, and it is hosted by Canadian TV personality Knight and Canadian-American former NFLwide receiver Nate Burleson (\"The NFLToday\"). It features one new musical celebrity per episode, and following LL Cool J's inaugural episode, the weekly guests of honor include: Canadian country music legend Shania Twain (\"That Don't Impress Me Much,\" 1997); Cuban-American pop sensation Gloria Estefan (\"Rhythm Is Gonna Get You,\" 1987); Alabama-born country foursome Little Big Town (\"Pontoon,\" 2012); rapper and Miami native Pitbull (\"I Know You Want Me,\" 2009); and Tennesseean singer/songwriter Kelsea Ballerini (\"Miss Me More,\" 2017).As the artist's fans compete across several rounds to figure out who will come out as the one and only \"superfan,\" they each get the opportunity to interact with their favorite artist, thus making their music fandom dreams come true just by taking part. By the end of each episode, the artist in the spotlight will crown their No. 1 fan and present to them a unique set of prizes.While discussing his excitement about co-hosting the new show, Burleson stated that \"Superfan\" \"perfectly captures the energy of concert vibes and competition,\" adding that \"as a host, I get to meet music icons and watch everyday fans compete for a dream prize.\" As far as the at-home audience's interaction with the fun goes, Burleson notes, \"You will dance, laugh and even cry by the end of each episode, but more importantly, you'll walk away a superfan yourself.\" And Burleson isn't the only person delighted to be taking the game show genre to new heights; creators Knight and Roth also expressed their own love for the series in the CBS news release. \n \n Caption: Pitbull as seen in \"Superfan\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As Burrell and Mauro teach the contestants the skills required to master the kitchen once and for all, they hope to turn them, as Food Network says, from \"cooking duds into kitchen studs.\" In its description for the series, Food Network explains: \"The recruits not only learn how to make date-friendly dishes like sushi, spicy wontons and classic French pastries, they also go head-tohead in romantic dating-inspired challenges like the Cupid Games, the Bagel-orette and the Inferno Zone. In the end, only the most improved recruit left standing is awarded a $25,000 grand prize, bragging rights for their mentor and the ability to add \"great cook\" to their dating profile.The network continued with a deep dive into the season's first episode, dishing out some juicy details: \"Before picking teams, Anne and Jeff kick off the competition by having the recruits make their signature 'seal the deal' meal to show off their skills, or lack thereof, in the kitchen. Then in the main dish challenge, the teams learn to make duck paired with a fruit sauce. After assessing everyone's skills, Anne and Jeff reveal a unique twist when choosing their teams.\" During following episodes, these culinary (and relationship) hopefuls are introduced to some of the classic dishes of Italy, take a lesson on hand-pulling made-fromscratch noodles with chef Victor Huang and compete in a dazzling, Las Vegas-inspired challenge, recreating an over-the-top dish without a recipe.In the grand finale - a double date of its own, with the two final episodes airing back-to-back on Sunday, Sept. 10 - the two \"most improved\" chefs put their newfangled know-how to the test as they are asked to serve a three-course, restaurant-quality meal to a panel of expert judges, including chef Hawa Hassan, Christian Petroni (\"Food Network Star\") and Chris Scott (\"Top Chef \"). Whoever can serve the most date-worthy meal will go on to win it all.With twists, turns and romance in abundance, \"Worst Cooks in America: Love at First Bite\" premieres Sunday, Aug. 6, on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Anne Burrell, Jeff Mauro (middle) and the contestants from \"Worst Cooks in America: Love at First Bite\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In addition, it occurs 25% more often than a 15-17 no-trump, and it is difficult to compete against.(You must bid constructively, not obstructively, because you could have the values for game.) My wife and I love the weak no-trump and are well ahead from using it.West decided not to lead away from his black-suit holdings. Instead, he selected the heart seven: five, jack, ace.Declarer returned the heart nine, which East ducked, then the heart four. East would have done best to switch to a black suit, but he had been reading a learned article about surrounding plays, so he led the diamond jack.Declarer finessed the queen and then immediately paused for thought when West played the six. Clearly, East had switched from the K-J-9 of diamonds.Accurately, South unblocked the diamond eight from the dummy. Next, he led the diamond three: six, 10, king.Later, when declarer got into dummy with the spade king, he cashed the 13th heart.Finally, he led the diamond four and, when East played the two, finessed his five.Cute - it isn't often you have the A-5 sitting over the 9-2 that late in the play of a suit. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "celebrityq & a - Armando Iannucci\n\n August 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Adam Thomlison | Page: 12A | Section: News \n \n 266\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Q: What has Armando Iannucci been doing since \"Veep\" ended?A: Actually quite a lot. He had a whole HBO sitcom, \"Avenue 5,\" come and go since 2019, when his beloved, award-winning political comedy \"Veep\" ended.If you didn't know that, it's likely because \"Avenue 5,\" a sci-ficomedy about a space cruise ship that gets stuck far from Earth, never really found an audience.Its first-season ratings, in early 2020, were poor, and then the pandemic happened, which meant the second season didn't air for another two and a half years. By then, any momentum it had was lost, as reflected in the even lower Season 2 numbers.Sadly, it seems like maybe that experience has soured Iannucci on TV for a while. He's currently focused on the stage, namely a live-theatre adaptation of the classic film \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\" (1964).Even worse for TV fans: It's being staged across an ocean in Iannucci's native Britain.\"Dr. Strangelove\" offered a cutting satire of government war-making when it was released in the midst of the Cold War, but Iannucci told the BBC that its message is just as relevant today.As for why he chose the stage instead of the screen, the ever-topical Iannucci said it was also about timing and current affairs. \"In the last three years, we've been so enclosed in our homes because of the lockdown, and have got addicted to our screens, so actually going out and seeing something live and in the flesh is all the more exciting. That's what excites me about actually doing it as a live stage show.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The tale gives Adam West a big chunk of time as Batman's alias Bruce Wayne.\"The Jetsons\" (MeTV, Sunday, Aug. 13): A series about the future - even an animated one - would have to consider the computer age to be even mildly accurate, and the first-season episode \"Uniblab\" sees George Jetson's (voice of George O'Hanlon) career placed in jeopardy by a machine that seems capable of performing all of the same functions, without the requirement of a paycheck.\"Face/Off\" (AMC, Tuesday, Aug. 15): Director John Woo's 1997 melodrama has a great conceit, with an FBI agent (John Travolta) very reluctantly - and very literally - surgically switching faces with a master criminal (Nicolas Cage) in a scheme to thwart a major attack being planned by the felon. As far-out as the plot might seem, there's enormous entertainment value in watching each star approximate the other, as both characters and performers.\"The Lost World\" (FXM, Saturday, Aug. 19): Before he became the movies' \"master of disaster\" with the likes of \"The Poseidon Adventure\" and \"The Towering Inferno,\" Irwin Allen made his mark as a producer-director of science fiction, one example being this 1960 adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's story about an expedition's discovery of prehistoric territory, The special effects are rather primitive (pun intended) by today's standards, but there's still fun to be had; stars include Michael Rennie, Jill St. John, David Hedison and Claude Rains. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We want to go back every year and let our kids have these ideal summers, running around barefoot in the grass and swimming in the lake. It has a really wholesome feel that really resonates with us, and it's great to spend real time there.Q: How have you enjoyed working with your husband. actor Jonathan Silverman (\"Weekend at Bernie's\"), on A: He's one of the kindest, most generous people on the planet and if he's going to do something with me (professionally), I want our characters to be completely at odds with each other. Frankly, there's nothing more fun than when you've been in a long-term relationship with someone and you know them inside and out - and you don't fight with them much - to go at it with them on camera. I can't even tell you how cathartic it is.We see each other all the time, and part of a happy relationship is a healthy boundary. Many people have said to us over the years, \"Why don't you guys do a show together?\" Well, it's because I want us to stay married! One of the reasons The CW wanted this show is that Jonny is such a recognizable American actor, and I think that's a nice advantage.Q: How does that work for you yourself, in terms of being well-known in both the U.S. and your native CanadaftA: I think a lot of Canada doesn't even know I'm Canadian. I think I've done nine series at this point, and I've been on everyone's television for 24 years.Part of my excitement in doing this show initially was to boost my profile in Canada, because I have always been patriotic and proud to be a Canadian, though doing a strictly Canadian show is something I've very rarely done. In the way my character Lidia goes back home (in \"Moonshine\"), this was going back home for me as well. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The list is a blend of pop artists, veteran rock groups and indie singer/songwriters, from Elton John to Olivia Rodrigo.Music Industry How To's survey results do not focus on albums released during 2023, but reflect the downloading habits of subscribers across all genres and generations.The oldest album is from 1981, while the latest is from 2022. The total revenue figures are estimates based on Spotify's current payment rate of $0.004 per stream.Top Streaming Albums On Spotify in 2023THE WEEKND: THE HIGHLIGHTS (2021)Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, better known as rap artist The Weeknd, tops the list with a 2021 Greatest Hits collection, The Highlights.So far in 2023, the album has garnered 23 billion Spotify streams, earning over $9.2 million in revenue.His 2019 single \"Blinding Lights\" earned $1,468,012 from 3.6 billion streams on Spotify.ED SHEERAN: ÷ (DIVIDE) (2017)British singer/songwriter Ed Sheeran's Divide earns the second spot with an estimated 13 billion Spotify streams and potential earnings of $ 5,389,556.

    "content": "Rocking reflections: Paramount+ revisits Elvis Presley's 1968 comeback special\n\n August 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: 9A | Section: News \n \n 489\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Elvis Presley's legendary 1968 television special was a turning point not only for him, but for many of the other people involved in it.One was producer-director Steve Binder, who candidly told the \"King\" of music that the latter's career was \"in the toilet,\" so he needed to do the NBC-televised hour. The result quickly became a legendary piece of television, and Paramount+ looks back at it in the new offering \"Reinventing Elvis: The '68 Comeback,\" which starts streaming Tuesday, Aug, 15 - the night before the 46th anniversary of Presley's death, and following the project's limited showings in movie theaters globally.While incorporating many segments from the original show, \"Reinventing Elvis\" examines Presley's relationship not only with Binder (who narrates the bulk of the film), but also with Col. Tom Parker, the famously strict manager who kept tight control over Presley.Singers Darius Rucker and Drake Milligan are among those who offer comments, along with journalist Alanna Nash and Anita Mann, who was a dancer on the 1968 special.Also an executive producer of \"Reinventing Elvis,\" Binder maintains that he's \"real pleased with what they did\" creatively with the documentary, though he admits he was skeptical at first. \"When I was approached to get involved, I said, 'There are so many third-party stories about Elvis, why do we need another one?' Then they pitched me their idea, and it really covered 1968 as a whole. I was rooting for them from the sidelines, and I certainly was responsive to any of their requests for more material.\" Music-documentary veteran John Scheinfeld - who also has done projects on John Lennon, John Coltrane, Herb Alpert and Harry Nilsson - directed \"Reinventing Elvis,\" which also has music-industry legend Spencer Proffer, a longtime Binder associate, as the executive producer who conceived it.\"There are so few of us alive today who were there when it all happened,\" Binder reflects of the 1968 Elvis show. \"There have been specials and books about it, but I never felt that anybody who was there told the real story.\"I was there from the beginning to the end, and it's so gratifying today to realize what the public response to it was. A number of years ago, somebody approached me and said, 'Steve, you realize that no matter what you did in the past or do from here on in, you'll be remembered mostly for the Elvis comeback special' and I think they told the truth.\" The entirety of \"Reinventing Elvis\" serves as a reminder of how major a star Presley was in his time. \"We're so lucky that we partnered with Paramount+,\" Binder notes, \"because many of Elvis' movies were done at Paramount, so we were given access to their library and were able to include clips from his films.That was just a stroke of luck, and it sure adds to this. None of the other projects that have been done about the 1968 special were able to clear those rights, I guess.\" \n \n Caption: Elvis Presley in his 1968 comeback special \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Turner Classic Movies shows the mystery Sunday, Aug. 13, as part of a \"Summer Under the Stars\" day devoted to Newman - who displays a cynical detachment as Lew Harper that makes him great fun to watch as the sleuth interacts with various suspects in a man's disappearance.Lauren Bacall, Robert Wagner, Shelley Winters, Julie Harris and Pamela Tiffin are among those questioned, with Janet Leigh and Arthur Hill also on hand. Interestingly, in the Ross Macdonald novel that inspired the film (\"The Moving Target\"), the main character was named Lew Archer but Newman's success with movie titles that started with \"H\" (\"The Hustler,\" \"Hud\") prompted the switch to \"Harper.\" Perhaps that was overly superstitious, but the result here was another \"H\": a hit. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Only accessible by password - and to us lucky viewers - chef Bobby Flay invites the most talented in the industry to visit his underground kitchen and compete in another round of culinary's most exclusive competition: Season 2 of \"Bobby's Triple Threat\" begins Tuesday, Aug. 22, on Food Network.The series, hosted and orchestrated by Flay, follows as a trio of culinary titans (talented chefs handpicked by Bobby) head to the host's speakeasy-style kitchen, where they will face off in a secret showdown against some of the most skilled chefs in the game in order to see who really is the best of the best.This season, Flay welcomes titans including Brooke Williamson, who earned worldwide acclaim as the youngest female chef to ever cook at the James Beard House; Michael Voltaggio, a Michelin star-rated chef and \"Top Chef\" winner; and Tiffany Derry, a two time James Beard Award finalist, former \"Top Chef\" contestant, and current owner of Roots Southern Table.\"[The titans] have competed in and won countless tournaments, proving their culinary excellence and securing their names and reputations among the very best in the biz,\" Food Network explains. \"This time, though, they won't be competing to earn glory but to keep it.Over the course of three head-to head rounds, elite chef-contestants will battle the titans and have their food judged in blind taste tests.\" Making matters more complicated, Flay will choose an ingredient that must be featured in each dish.Whoever finishes the competition on top earns not only bragging rights, but a whopping $25,000 prize.\"Season 1 of 'Triple Threat' was just a warm-up,\" Flay recently claimed. \"In Season 2, I welcome 10 of the best chefs in the country to take on the titans. The challengers walk through the speakeasy door with the utmost confidence - but will they walk out with the same swagger and $25,000? Not if my chefs have anything to say about it.\" The competition will put Bobby's best to the test, however, as this season's guest competitors include \"Iron Chef\" stars Michael Symon and Jose Garces; \"Chopped\" judge Scott Conant; Kelsey Bernard Clark; Esther Choi; Kelvin Fernandez; Byron Gomez; Rashida Holmes; Mei Lin and Shota Nakajima.Season 2 of \"Bobby's Triple Threat\" begins Tuesday, Aug. 22, on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Bobby Flay and contestant Jonathon Sawyer in \"Bobby's Triple Threat\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was the press secretary to the vice president, then special assistant to the president, and then deputy assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs and press secretary to the United States Department of Defense.After that, Griffin went into the business of being an analyst on television, working online for The Hill's program and also appearing regularly on CNN - which she still does, while fulfilling her regular weekday job on ABC's \"The View.\" She had been a guest on the latter show's panel during 2021 and 2022, then was made a permanent co-host with the start of the series' 26th season in the fall of 2022 (along with Ana Navarro, who'd had a similar arrangement).Griffin came by her interest in public affairs naturally, being the daughter of Joseph Farah, who was an editor at both the Los Angeles Herald Examiner and the Sacramento Union. She wrote (as did her mother) for the website World Net Daily, which her father founded.Elsewhere, Griffin was the captain of her high school girls' soccer team, and she has a black belt in karate. She married Justin Griffin in 2021, and some members of her family boycotted her wedding - including her father and stepmother - because of their political differences with her. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Starring Rosario Dawson (\"Dopesick\") in the title role, the eight-episode series follows Ahsoka Tano as she takes on the not-so-small task of protecting the galaxy from imminent threats.Former Jedi Padawan-turned-Rebel Alliance member Ahsoka is one of the most beloved characters in the Star Wars universe among fans of the franchise's animated films and TV series. Before Dawson's live-action portrayal of Ahsoka in the Disney+ series \"The Mandalorian\" and \"The Book of Boba Fett,\" the character first appeared in the 2008 animated feature and subsequent TV series \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars\" as a teenage apprentice of Anakin Skywalker.The new series is set just after the events of the animated series \"Rebels\" and in the same timeline as \"The Mandalorian.\" Hayden Christensen (\"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,\" 2002) reprises his role as Anakin yet again in \"Ahsoka,\" after appearing in 2019's \"Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,\" and bringing the character back to life in the spinoff series \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" - presumably as a Force ghost, as he is long dead in this timeline.So, who will the baddies in \"Ahsoka\" be without Darth Vader to represent the dark sideft Returning to portray Grand Admiral Thrawn is \"The Witcher\" star Lars Mikkelsen, who lent his voice to the chilling Imperial officer in \"Rebels.\" Icy in demeanor and appearance - Thrawn is Chiss and his skin glows blue - he is only the tip of the villain iceberg in \"Ahsoka.\" Portraying even more adversaries challenging the Jedi and the universe at large are Ivanna Sakhno (\"High Fidelity\") as Shin Hati, Diana Lee Inosanto (\"The Last Tour,\" 2016) as Magistrate Morgan Elsbeth and the late Ray Stevenson (\"Das Boot\") as Baylan Skoll.\"Ahsoka\" also stars Natasha Liu Bordizzo (\"Day Shift,\" 2022) as Sabine Wren, Mary Elizabeth Winstead (\"Kate,\" 2021) as Hera Syndulla, Eman Esfandi (\"The Inspection,\" 2022) as Ezra Bridger and David Tennant (\"Doctor Who\") as the voice of droid Huyang, reprising his role from the Clone Wars series.Portraying a character that is as cherished as Ahsoka, and held in such high regard by one of film and TV's most active and vocal fan bases, is a daunting task. Dawson was up for the challenge, however, crediting stunt co-ordinator Ming Qiu (\"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\") with getting her into shape when it came to wielding a lightsaber like a Jedi, as she shared on the Dagobah Dispatch podcast in May: \"When Qiu said, 'This one did not make my eyes hurt,' that was the first compliment that I got, and I think I cried.\" \n \n Caption: Mary Elizabeth Winstead in \"Star Wars: Ahsoka\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Beverly D'Angelo, Annie Golden and Melba Moore also are in the cast of the picture, which boasts songs that became iconic - including the title tune, \"Aquarius,\" \"Let the Sunshine In\" and \"Good Morning Starshine.\" A particular showstopper is Williams' rendering of \"I Got Life.\" \n \n Caption: Treat Williams in \"Hair\" \n \n Memo: more retro rewinds\n \n\"The Idolmaker\" (Paramount+ With Showtime, streaming): Director Taylor Hackford's fabulous 1980 drama-with-music is informed by great original tunes and the excellent acting of Ray Sharkey as a would-be songwriter who becomes a self-styled late-1950s talent manager, transforming a naive restaurant worker (Peter Gallagher, also superb, in his movie debut) into a teen idol named Caesare. With success comes strife, though, as the new star becomes overwhelmed by sudden fame. Tovah Feldshuh, Joe Pantoliano and Maureen McCormick (yes, TV's Marcia Brady) also appear.\n \n\"The Monkees\" (Catchy Comedy, Sunday, Aug. 20): Though the musical quartet was formed for purposes of this comedy series, the foursome also had some genuine hit records (\"Daydream Believer,\" the Neil Diamond-composed \"I'm a Believer,\" etc.) - virtually all of which are heard here as a weekend marathon of the show continues.\n \n\"Ironside\" (GetTV, Wednesday, Aug. 23): After his long run as \"Perry Mason,\" Raymond Burr began another sizable weekly-TV stay in the two-hour pilot film for the series that cast him as San Francisco's chief of detectives, who becomes a special operative after being paralyzed below the waist by a sniper he is determined to track down. Don Galloway, Barbara Anderson and Don Mitchell also are series regulars. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

One of the latest examples on screen can be found in \"Puppy Love,\" a Freevee movie that makes its debut Friday, Aug. 18. The tale teams two performers who have had a strong television presence in recent years: Lucy Hale, who went on from \"Pretty Little Liars\" to star in \"Life Sentence,\" \"Katy Keene\" and \"Ragdoll\" and Grant Gustin, who wrapped up his nine-season run as \"The Flash\" earlier this year.Their \"Puppy Love\" characters, Nicole and Max, may have less success in matters of the heart than their dogs do - at least initially. The two humans' very different natures result in a date that does not go well, to put it mildly, making a second one seem highly unlikely. That's until they discover that their dogs made a much happier connection than they did, with evidence in the litter of puppies that the animals produce, causing Max and Nicole to reunite for the benefit of their suddenly larger family.And they just might find love with each other, too, the second time around.\"Puppy Love\" was inspired by a same-themed digital series from several years ago, \"Puppyhood,\" shown by BuzzFeed (which also had a hand in producing the new movie) and centering on a man whose closest friend and confidant turned out to be his dog. The film also stars someone else who is no stranger to viewers, Jane Seymour, who had a long and successful run in \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\" and has returned to television lately as the title amateur sleuth in \"Harry Wild.\" Hale plays it free and unpredictable in \"Puppy Love,\" and though she has displayed variety in other roles - particularly in going from the sunny spirit of \"Katy Keene\" to the pronounced darkness of \"Ragdoll\" - her defining image to date arguably is that of the level-headed Aria in the hugely popular \"Pretty Little Liars.\" Around those shows, she also has done such movies as \"Truth or Dare\" and \"Fantasy Island.\" \n \n Caption: Grant Gustin and Lucy Hale in \"Puppy Love\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That way, if it doesn't work out, you haven't wasted a whole day.\" At the bridge table, though, if you take an early finesse that does not work out, you might have wasted your contract.In today's deal, for example, how should South plan the play in three no-trump after West leads the spade queen?South starts by counting his top tricks and sees five: two spades, one heart, one diamond and one club. So, if the club finesse is winning, that will be an easy nine tricks for declarer. However, after taking the first trick with dummy's spade ace, South should realize that if West wins an early trick, he cannot continue spades without conceding a third trick in the suit. In contrast, if the club finesse loses, putting East on lead, a spade return through the K-10 establishes West's suit.So, declarer should endeavor to keep East off the lead until nine tricks have been set up.How does South do that?Right - at trick two, he takes a heart finesse. Yes, it loses, but as just noted, West cannot safely play another spade. He will probably shift to a diamond, but declarer wins in his hand and now takes the club finesse. If it succeeds, fine; declarer gains overtricks. Here, it loses and a spade is returned, but South takes that trick, crosses to dummy with a club and takes a second heart finesse, which is heavily favored to succeed.When it does, declarer can claim nine tricks: two spades, two hearts, one diamond and four clubs.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Whether you looked forward to a quinceañera, a sweet 16, your senior prom or another teenage milestone event, it seems more than likely that the day came and went with a certain level of anticipation and expectation. Unfortunately, those two feelings often team up to create unattainable standards, as is the case in Netflix's newest family comedy.In \"You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah,\" premiering Friday, Aug. 25, on Netflix, Stacey Friedman (Sunny Sandler, \"Grown Ups,\" 2010) is dead set on having the perfect bat mitzvah party. The film is based on the young adult (YA) novel of the same name by Fiona Rosenbloom, in which Stacey's desires are made very clear: all she wants is \"the perfect BCBG dress to wear, her friends by her side, and her biggest crush ever, Andy Goldfarb [Dylan Hoffman, \"Next\"], to dance with her (and maybe even make out with her on the dance floor).\" So naturally, when the day doesn't exactly go off without a hitch, Stacey is massively disappointed.Adding insult to injury, Stacey always seems to be in competition with her so-called best friend, Lydia (Samantha Lorraine, \"The Walking Dead: World Beyond\"), who is also hosting her bat mitzvah around the same time.When popularity, romantic crushes and other middle school dramas creep into the picture for Stacey, her flubbed ceremonial rite of passage threatens to ruin her reputation.While the last name Sandler is most closely associated with \"Billy Madison\" (1995) and \"Happy Gilmore\" (1996) comedian Adam Sandler, the entire Sandler family is on board for this new production. The plot may revolve around the character played by his youngest daughter, Sunny, but Sandler's wife, Jackie Sandler (\"The Wrong Missy,\" 2020), stars as a member of the Rodriguez-Katz family, while their eldest daughter, Sadie Sandler (\"Pixels,\" 2015), plays Stacey's sister, Ronnie. \n \n Caption: Sunny Sandler and Millie Thorpe in \"You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MGM+ presents the Mike Nichols-directed 1988 comedy Thursday, Aug. 31, with Griffith as a New York secretary who aspires to be more. Her candor frequently gets in the way of her aims, which she gets a fresh chance to attain when she goes to work for a self-involved boss (a wonderfully hilarious Sigourney Weaver).A skiing accident puts Boss Lady out of commission, giving Griffith's character the opportunity to mount a deal involving a sale of radio stations - and also involving a down-on-his-luck broker (Harrison Ford) who provides Griffith with a new chance at romance beyond her philandering boyfriend (Alec Baldwin). Smart, tremendous fun throughout, the picture also boasts a Carly Simon music score that features the Oscar-winning \"Let the River Run.\" \n \n Caption: Melanie Griffith, Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver in \"Working Girl\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Lately, he's launched his own, unlikely film franchise: the \"Fisherman's Friends\" movies.It started as an independently made British comedy, \"Fisherman's Friends.\" It was a runaway hit, based on a true story of a group of fishermen from the British region of Cornwall who sang sea shanties to pass the time but suddenly launched to fame after getting a global record deal.The success of the first led soon to a sequel, \"Fisherman's Friends: One and All,\" released last year. Purefoy stars in the films as one of the singers, and signed on as a producer of the sequel.The series' success must have been welcome for Purefoy, whose big-screen career was a bit tarnished by a pair of all-time flops. In the same year he did \"The Philanthropist\" (2009), he had the title role in the big-budget adventure film \"Solomon Kane,\" which didn't even earn back half of its $45-million budget. He followed that up with a leading role in 2012's \"John Carter,\" one of the most notorious bombs of all time. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Yes, if you make the wrong decision.One aspect of playing in an online duplicate is that you are always on the lookout for overtricks. If you fail to win one that you could have collected, it can be expensive.In today's deal, how do you think the play went in four hearts?All 16 tables played in hearts, 14 in game by South, one in game by North (after South opened two diamonds, Flannery, showing a minimum opening with 4=5 or 4=6 in the majors), and one in three hearts (when North only invited game and South declined). Note that three no-trump, even by South, would have failed after a club lead.It looked wrong to start with trumps. Usually, it would be better first to attack dummy's side suit that I wished to establish. So I played a diamond to the queen, which held. Robots rarely duck, so I placed the diamond ace with West. Now, though, I erred. I was too tempted by the club finesse, and when it lost, I was in danger of conceding a trick in each suit.Still, the robot gave me a second chance. Instead of immediately playing another spade, West cashed the diamond ace first. I could have played a trump to the board, ruffed a diamond, returned with another heart and discarded two spades on the diamond king and eight.However, I cashed both high hearts immediately and could not recover. My line could have done well, but it was little compensation that only one pair bid and made four hearts. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Then, when South jumped to six diamonds, North made a disciplined pass - the ace asker is always in charge.Declarer immediately saw that his heart loser could disappear on the spade ace.However, if he played a trump immediately, a second club would cut him off from the dummy.So, he won with his club ace and unblocked the spade king before leading the diamond jack, but East took that trick and returned a club. South won on the board, pitched the heart eight on the spade ace, led a heart to his hand and triumphantly cashed the diamond king.Not so fast! The Bridge Base Online dealing program had ensnared him again - diamonds were 4-1!\"Unfair\" was heard throughout the house.Then South apologized. \"I should play club ace, spade king, club to the king, spade ace for my heart discard and finally a trump, with East's ace collecting only low cards.\" \"Not so fast,\" answered East.\"When in with the diamond ace, I lead a third club, which promotes my partner's diamond 10 as a trick.\" \"Yes,\" said North, \"playing double dummy - or dummy dummy, if you like - you must play a low diamond from your hand at trick three.\" Too tough, they all agreed. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hot air balloons rise over Cordova - Chesapeake Bay Balloon Festival comes to Eastern Shore\n\n August 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Detmer; mdetmer@chespub.com | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 820\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CORDOVA - Hot air balloons rose above the hundreds of attendees of the Chesapeake Bay Balloon Festival on Aug. 26, at the Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.By dust, multiple balloons were inflated, one taking off with passengers and sailing over the treeline and beyond, another taking passengers on short riders and others giving people the chance for a closer look at the balloons, baskets and propane burners that lit up the area as the pilots kept their balloons inflated.Lehigh Valley Hot Air was there with \"Big Blue,\" a Blue 160 balloon. As the balloon inflated, it provided welcome shade to a large swath of the festival-goers enjoying the music of county singer Jimmy Charles, an Eastern Shore native, who is now based in Nashville.Chad Boushell hustled on the ground as the interior of the balloon warmed up, adjusting the tether rope system that allowed pilot William Randell to take passengers up and down on about a 50-foot flight when Big Blue was ready to fly.While conducting one of those flights, Randell was asked what he liked about being a hot air balloon pilot.\"No restraint, the fact that I can cut loose and say goodbye to everybody,\" said Randell, who lives in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and has being flying balloons for about 10 years.\"We went up in the air, and it was very high,\" said Bastion Baatine, one youngster who flew in Big Blue. When asked whether it was scary or cool, Bastion said, \"Both, but more cool than scary.\" Chesapeake Balloon Festival social media manager Mary Bryan said the event was going \"really well\" in light of the \"jumps, hurdles and speed bumps\" the organizers encountered. \"I think it's turned out really well,\" Bryan said.Joel Berka of Mystical Breeze Balloons was down from Binghamton, New York, with his 90,000 cubic foot balloon \"Colorscape.\" Colorscape's burners put out about 40 million BTUs in optimal conditions, and the basket typically holds four or five passengers for a flight.Berka said he flies balloons all over the world. \"I've been to New Zealand, Mexico, up and down the East Coast, Europe, all sorts of great places, and (I) meet all sorts of beautiful, nice people,\" he said of his experience.Berka said he has been ballooning since he was a year old, taking his first flight with his father, who was manning the adjacent balloon, \"Earthbound,\" at the festival.\"Ever since, I've been hooked,\" he said.Earthbound is 105,000 cubic foot, equivalent to roughly the same number of soccer balls, Berka said.Earthbound originally came from Dubai as a plain green balloon, but Berka had a face stitched on, one Berka said is open to some interpretation.The balloon certainly bears a strong resemblance to an alien. \"Everybody wants to know: 'What is it?What is it? I say it's whatever you want it to be,\" Berka said, \"Alien, cricket, grasshopper, frog, so long as it makes you smile.\" \n \n Caption: MIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nTOP: Big Blue, the first balloon of the evening, inflates at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nBria Hart of Stevensville gives the \"thumbs up\" as she poses with the pilot and passengers of a balloon about to take flight at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nBalloons rise over the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nA flames fill up a balloon and lights up the vicinity at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nYoungsters help to inflate a balloon at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nA pilot flies a balloon at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nA flame fill a balloon with hot air the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nEastern Shore-born Jimmy Charles performs at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nA girl reacts to the roar of the propane flame filling a balloon with over the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nThe glow of a balloon is viewed from another balloon at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nBalloon \"Colorscape\" stands between two other balloons at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nCrewmen keep tension on a line as a balloon is fixed with air at the Chesapeake Balloon Festival on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova.\n \nMIKE DETMER/DORCHESTER STAR\n \nThe Chesapeake Balloon Festival is seen from a balloon flight on Saturday, Aug. 26, at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Brooks and Allan Burns.The saga of Mary Richards, a local-TV-news producer negotiating her social life as well as her career, also had a major benefit in what Moore - whose company produced the series - understandably called \"the best ensemble cast\" when she addressed the studio audience after filming the final episode. Edward Asner, Valerie Harper and Cloris Leachman all got their own spinoffs, with Gavin MacLeod, Ted Knight and Georgia Engel also contributing mightily to the sophisticated fun. \n \n Caption: Mary Tyler Moore and Ted Knight in \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A series 'Reborn': 'The Wheel of Time' returns for Season 2\n\n August 31, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dana Simpson | Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 548\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Within the realm of the fantastic, several novels, movies, video games and series exist to tickle the adventure bone. However, despite the plethora of content, few franchises have the hold that Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and The Lord of the Rings do. One series that has recently re-entered the chat, however, is \"The Wheel of Time,\" which is about to begin its second season on Prime Video.First written by Robert Jordan beginning in 1990, the 15-book series was expected to comprise just six novels. In 2009, the book series was taken over by fellow fantasy writing powerhouse Brandon Sanderson, following Jordan's death two years earlier. As time progressed and more books emerged, fans of high fantasy craved a TV or film adaptation that would do the then-stillgrowing book series justice. Finally, in 2018, following nearly two decades of rights disputes, low-budget pilots and controversy, it was announced that Amazon Studios would partner with Sony Pictures Television to make everyone's otherworldly dreams come true.Now, following further setbacks brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and more, \"The Wheel of Time\" Season 2 premieres Friday, Sept. 1, on Prime Video.Already renewed for a third season ahead of the Season 2 premiere, WOT fans can rest easy knowing that the series' writers did not need to rush to fit several books' worth of content into one (potentially) final set of episodes. Instead, audiences get another eight episodes in the second season, while looking forward to even more come Season 3 (likely to be released 2024-25).When Season 1 began, viewers met Moiraine (Rosamund Pike, \"Gone Girl,\" 2014) as she began her quest to find the Dragon Reborn in the Two Rivers.As a member of the powerful Aes Sedai, an order of women with the ability to channel a form of elemental magic called the One Power, Moiraine has been called upon to find a kind of \"chosen one,\" the reincarnation of a channeller called the Dragon, who once destroyed the world. After gathering a small group - any of whom could possibly be the Dragon Reborn - Moiraine, her Warder, Lan Mandragoran (Daniel Henney, \"Big Hero 6,\" 2014), and the four new candidates - Perrin Aybara (Marcus Rutherford, \"Bulletproof \"), Mat Cauthon (played by \"Clique's\" Barney Harris in Season 1 and replaced by \"The Witcher's\" Dónal Finn in Season 2), Rand al'thor (Josha Stradowski, \"High Flyers\") and Egwene al'Vere (Madeleine Madden, \"Dora and the Lost City of Gold,\" 2019) - begin their quest to defeat a primordial evil known as the Dark One.For the sake of brevity and avoiding as many spoilers as possible, suffice it to say that the first season did not end on a high note for Moiraine and her tribe of villagers. Despite the unveiling of the Dragon Reborn, a battle between the reincarnation and a villain presumed to be the Dark One only appeared to awaken a more sinister energy. Needless to say, a war is on the horizon headed into this new instalment.\"In Season 2, threats new and very old seek out the young friends from the Two Rivers, now scattered over the world,\" the Prime Video description reads.\"The woman who found and guided them is now powerless to help, and so they must find other sources of strength. In each other, or themselves. In the Light or the Dark.\" \n \n Caption: Ayoola Smart in \"The Wheel of Time\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Milo Ventimiglia OF FORMERLY \"THE COMPANY YOU KEEP\" ON ABC\n\n August 31, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: 10 | Section: News \n \n 268\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Q: Now that \"The Company You Keep\" is over, what's next for Milo Ventimiglia?A: That remains to be seen. The actor put a lot into that ABC series, since his production company was heavily involved in it, in addition to his being the show's star. It also came pretty much on the heels of the end of his run on NBC's \"This Is Us,\" so he had been busy for quite some time.The much-acclaimed family drama, on which Ventimiglia played Jack Pearson, followed a string of other regular roles for him on series (\"Mob City,\" \"Chosen,\" \"The Whispers\") so if he should take a break from weekly television work for a while, it's understandable. It's also mandated, at least for the time being, given the work stoppage that has been prompted by the actors' and writers' strikes.Other shows on which Ventimiglia has appeared have included \"Gilmore Girls,\" \"American Dreams,\" \"The Bedford Diaries\" and \"Heroes.\" He's also not opposed to guest shots, as he proved on \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" as it was nearing its finale.Even if TV isn't the route Ventimiglia takes when show business gets back to business, he's done a sufficient amount of movie work that might inspire him to go down that path again instead. \"The Art of Racing in the Rain\" and \"Second Act\" are among his more recent films, as is \"Creed II,\" in which he reprised the role of Rocky Balboa Jr. that he first played in (aptly enough) \"Rocky Balboa.\" The relationship he developed with Sylvester Stallone on the latter picture led to Stallone's guest stint on \"This Is Us.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He took the offer, partially because of his belief that Griffith's series was about to end, though it actually lasted three more years beyond that (with Knotts returning for guest appearances).Turner Classic Movies salutes Knotts' big-screen work with a double feature Saturday, Sept. 2. The first attraction is the first picture he made under the arrangement with Universal, the 1966 horror satire \"The Ghost and Mr. Chicken.\" Then comes his turn as the unlikely publisher of a spicy men's magazine in \"The Love God?\" (1969). And yes, since it was Knotts, the question mark was part of that official title.On \"The Ghost and Mr. Chicken,\" Knotts had some familiar names and faces with him, since a number of other \"Andy Griffith Show\" personnel went to that project with him including such supporting players as Hal Smith (alias \"Griffith's\" often besotted and jailed Otis Campbell) and Hope Summers, plus director Alan Rafkin and writers Jim Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum. Knotts transferred a lot of his Fife-isms into the role of an aspiring reporter who spends the 20th anniversary of a murder-suicide in the allegedly cursed mansion where the crime occurred.\"The Love God?\" was the fourth of the five movies in Knotts' Universal deal, and the only one to carry what then was an \"M\" rating (now a \"PG-13,\" in that picture's case) for adult material, a somewhat surprising development for a Knotts vehicle. The subject matter justified it, however, as the star played a birdwatching-magazine publisher whose new business partner (Edmond O'Brien) transforms the periodical into something else altogether. An interesting byproduct was that some theaters evidently wouldn't book the film, since the traditional Knotts movie was designed for family audiences. And \"The Love God?\" surely was not. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Then, though, is the time to be frugal, to limit yourself to your contract and not risk going minus.In today's deal, how should South play in six no-trump after West leads the spade jack?South's two-no-trump response was an artificial inquiry. Three diamonds announced a maximum weak two with a diamond feature (ace or king). Then South, having no way to find out if the heart suit was solid, settled for six no-trump.West did well to find a safe lead.As soon as the dummy appeared, South wished he were in seven no-trump.Playing without thinking, he unblocked his heart ace, crossed to the diamond king and cashed the heart kingqueen, getting the bad news when East discarded a spade.Undaunted, declarer led dummy's remaining diamond. Disaster! East again failed to follow suit.Now South had to concede a diamond to West, who also cashed the heart jack for down one.Unlucky, yes, but South needed only five diamond tricks. When he led a diamond at trick three, he should have played low from the board. East might have won with the five and shifted to a club, but declarer could have won with his ace, crossed to the diamond king, gotten the bad news about the hearts, returned to hand with a spade and run the diamonds, taking three spades, three hearts, five diamonds and one club. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And while viewers have already gathered their fair share of Daryl details since his first appearance in TWD's Season 1 episode \"Tell It to the Frogs,\" audiences have never seen the troubled \"walker\"-fighting hero quite like this.\"Daryl Dixon\" follows the titular character as he \"washes ashore in France and struggles to piece together how he got there and why\" (per AMC). According to the official synopsis, \"The series tracks his journey across a broken but resilient France as he hopes to find a way back home,\" noting that as \"he makes the journey the connections he forms along the way complicate his ultimate plan.\" The title of this latest TWD spinoff was announced in October 2022, which is also when filming began in Paris. Despite AMC's initial desire to produce a series that followed another TWD character, Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride, \"The Mist,\" 2007), the network eventually landed on \"Daryl Dixon\" as a result of scheduling conflicts with McBride. That said, McBride is expected to reprise her role as Carol in at least one of the premiere season's six episodes.In fact, as mentioned by Vanity Fair writer Derek Lawrence in his November 2022 article titled \"Norman Reedus Unpacks the Walking Dead Finale and His 'F-ing Great' Spin-Off,\" Daryl himself made a nod toward his own future series in the final episodes of the flagship series' finale.\"It's not like we're never gonna see each other again,\" Daryl tells Carol in an intimate scene toward the end of 'Rest in Peace,'\" Lawrence writes, noting Carol's response: \"I'm allowed to be a little sad. You're my best friend.\" And while we have no idea what may be in store for Carol, fans can certainly expect more \"Daryl Dixon\" beyond the first six episodes. Just last month, AMC announced that the series had already been renewed for a second season.Also joining the cast for Season 1 is French actress Clémence Poésy, known for her roles in films such as the Harry Potter franchise (beginning in 2005), \"In Bruges\" (2008) and \"Tenet\" (2020), among others.Poésy plays Isabelle, a French woman with a dark Parisian past and a connection to a \"progressive religious group.\" She joins forces with Daryl on his journey. \n \n Caption: Louis Puech Scigliuzzi and Norman Reedus in \"The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jimmy Olsen (Jack Larson) and Perry White's sister (veteran character actress Mabel Albertson) vanish while investigating a voodoo cult in Haiti, sending Perry (John Hamilton) and Clark Kent (George Reeves) on a quest to find them.\"Freaky Friday\" (Freeform, Monday, Sept. 11): Filmed a couple of times previously and again since, this fanciful body-switch comedy has served the Disney studio well, including in this 2003 version. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan are quite enjoyable as the mother and daughter who magically make the exchange, a therapist and a would-be musician who each get a new and quite deep understanding of the other by walking in their shoes, quite literally. Mark Harmon and Chad Michael Murray also appear.\"Magnum, p.i.\" (getTV, Monday, Sept. 11): \"Limbo\" is an appropriate title for the episode that concluded Season 7 of the series, since it originally was intended to end the entire show but CBS ended up renewing it for one more round. A seriously wounded Magnum (Tom Selleck) is in a coma, and his ghostly self pays visits to his friends to consider the times he's had with each. Elements of the story continued to play out over the first couple of episodes of Season 8. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After making another Lifetime film titled \"How She Caught a Killer,\" she plays the title role in the Hallmark Movies & Mysteries feature \"Guiding Emily\" Friday, Sept. 8. The telecast helps to mark National Dog Service Month, for a reason that's quite clear in the story.Based on the same-named book by Barbara Hinske, the film's Emily is a successful career woman who experiences a major crisis when an accident robs her of her eyesight. Struggling to adjust to the situation, she gets a helper in a canine named Garth (whose thoughts are voiced by \"Will & Grace\" alum Eric McCormack), who is undergoing his own transition as he trains to become a guide dog and the two of them grow and benefit from each other as their symbiotic relationship develops. Antonio Cupo (\"Blood & Treasure\") and Sharon Taylor (\"Nancy Drew\") also are in the cast.In a statement she released before the SAG-AFTRA actors' strike, Drew said, \"Shooting 'Guiding Emily' was a deeply moving experience that allowed me to enter into the blind and partially sighted community in a very powerful way. We were honored to have two actresses from the community play roles in the film, and sitting with them both and hearing their stories was transformative for me and for our crew.\" \"I was also honored to visit the Guide Dogs of America open house the weekend before we started shooting,\" Drew noted, \"and was able to tour the facility and learn all about the process for raising service dogs and the sacrifice puppy raisers make to train them for two years, and then send them off to a member of the blind and partially sighted community to partner with them.\" \n \n Caption: Sarah Drew in \"One Summer,\" another Hallmark movie \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

What was the last one she did?A: As a series regular, that would have been \"Switched at Birth,\" on which she played one of the mothers whose daughters were well, check the title of the show again.She also had recurring roles on \"Scorpion\" (as the Katharine McPhee character's mom) and \"The Goldbergs,\" and she had a guest part last year on \"Star Trek: Picard.\" It's worth noting that Thompson also was a director on the latter two programs, and she's been spending a lot of time in that job - which she shares with her husband, Howard Deutch (\"Pretty in Pink\") - in recent times. She also has guided episodes of \"Will Trent\" (on which Deutch is an executive producer and occasional director), \"Resident Alien\" and \"Young Sheldon\" among other shows. Earlier, Thompson directed four \"Switched at Birth\" stories as well as two of the \"Jane Doe\" mystery movies in which she starred.Thompson's other major series credit as a star is the 1990s sitcom \"Caroline in the City,\" which ran almost as long as \"Switched at Birth,\" ending just short of 100 episodes.She'll have another shot at longevity on weekly TV when she returns in \"The Spencer Sisters,\" a Canadian import premiering Oct. 4 on The CW. She and Stacey Farber play a mystery-writer mother and police-officer daughter (despite the \"Sisters\" in the title) who decide to open a private-detective agency. Thompson isn't credited with directing any of that show yet, but that's likely to change if it continues for additional seasons. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Turner Classic Movies shows the picture Thursday, Sept. 14, to lead a memorial salute to Friedkin, who died in August.He won an Oscar for the fact-inspired 1971 police thriller (named its year's best picture at the awards), as did Gene Hackman as \"Popeye\" Doyle, a tough New York detective determined to get the goods on a seemingly untouchable international drug smuggler (Fernando Rey). Roy Scheider also attained stardom as Doyle's partner, and while there's much else to recommend about the movie, the chase that puts a wild-driving Doyle on the trail of an overload train is a highlight that's hard to beat.

Pumpkin-flavored everything, apple pies galore, cinnamon practically hanging in the air - no one does Autumn like Food Network, delighting with more tricks and treats in a new season of \"Halloween Baking Championship,\" premiering Monday, Sept. 11.Season 9 of the competition sees the return of John Henson (\"Wipeout\") as host, alongside the all-star panel of celebrity judges who reigned supreme in Season 8: chef Carla Hall (\"The Chew\") and patissiers Stephanie Boswell (\"Bake Or Break\") and Zac Young (\"Top Chef: Just Desserts\").Food Network has released descriptions for the series' first two episodes. According to the network, the season begins as \"host John Henson welcomes a dozen bakers to the Henson & Sons Carnival, where they're ready for the ride of their lives. First, they must layer a 'tarot-misu' depicting the carnival's untimely demise. Then, the bakers scare up a new carnival mascot by designing creepy clown cakes.\" Those lucky enough to make it to the second episode will face a frightfully gory night, with the Food Network promising a particularly \"bloody\" competition. \"Do-nut try to steal John Henson's dream job,\" they say, \"or things might get bloody. The remaining bakers make bloody filled doughnuts to commemorate an unfortunate accident.Then it's a joyful bake for some and doomed one for others as the competitors take judges [Hall, Boswell and Young] round and round on the creepiest carousel ever.\" Each episode will see two rounds of spine-chilling competition. The bakers begin with the \"Preliminary Heat,\" where they receive a bitesized, Halloween-themed challenge that must be completed within a tight time frame. The patissier who presents the spookiest (and most delicious) treat will gain a mystery advantage - a trick to play against their fellow bakers, perhaps - heading into the \"Main Heat.\" This second round sees some intense frights and delights, as competitors are given a new theme and a longer time period to create whatever creepy-crawly confection they'd like. The bakers must present something larger than life, as the winner of the \"Main Heat\" immediately advances to the next round while one baker is eliminated from the game. The final three (or four) then compete in a winner-take-all finale, with one monstrous baker winning $25,000.Sharpen your teeth and prepare to dine. Season 9 of \"Halloween Baking Championship\" begins Monday, Sept. 11, on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Carla Hall from \"Halloween Baking Championship\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Today's deal features one of them.How should South play in seven spades after West leads the diamond king to dummy's ace?After North described game-forcing values with three-card spade support, South used 14-30 Roman Key Card Blackwood to learn that his partner had three aces (key cards). He then jumped to seven spades.The unimaginative declarer who doesn't count his tricks or look for alternative lines of play quickly concludes that he needs the club finesse to work. If it does, he feels vindicated; if it loses, he complains that he never gets a break.A more perceptive declarer, who knows that a finesse is only a 50-50 proposition, will look for something better.Since dummy's trumps are so strong, he considers a dummy reversal. He sees that if the opposing spades divide 3-2, which will happen more than two-thirds of the time, he won't need a finesse.South cashes the spade 10 to check that the trumps aren't 5-0. Then he ruffs a diamond in hand and plays a spade to dummy's jack. If the trumps split 4-1, declarer must hope that West holds the club king. However, when both opponents follow suit, the play continues: diamond ruff in hand, heart to dummy's 10, third diamond ruff in hand, a club to the ace, draw the last trump (discarding the club seven from hand) and run the heart suit.South takes three spades, five hearts, one diamond, one club and those three diamond ruffs.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I have just found out that every month has Ides. It is the 15th in March, May, July and October, and the 13th in the other months.Caesar, while taking his bath before that evening's party, was reading an edition of New Zealand Bridge. He came across this amusing story: North opened one heart. South immediately asked for aces and then bid seven no-trump. As he tabled his dummy, North said, \"I'm sorry, partner. I think I've underbid my hand.\" Thumbs up!This deal was also in the magazine. After East opened with a weak no-trump (showing 12-14 points) and South made a penalty double, West's redouble announced a weak one suited hand. Doubling two hearts would have worked well, probably netting 500, but North-South didn't have the methods to accomplish this.Against three no-trump, West led the heart queen.When declarer ducked, West might have found the lethal club nine switch, but he continued with his low heart to dummy's king. Declarer took a diamond finesse and led the spade jack, trying to create a dummy entry, but East ducked. Now a spade went to the queen and ace.Endplayed, East cashed the club ace, but South missed his chance. If South had jettisoned his king, East would have had to concede an entry to the dummy in either black suit. Declarer could have picked up the diamond suit and collected nine tricks. When South played the \"automatic\" club five, though, East exited with a low club. South could do no better than play the ace and another diamond, finishing one shy.

If the contestant correctly identifies a genuine performer in the final round without hearing a single note, they're singing all the way home with the $100,000 grand prize. Whether the secret voices are retired vocalists, up-and-coming artists, hobbyist singers or just convincing fakes is only revealed once the contestant locks them in for elimination or their final selection.This season, Fox promises \"all-new theme nights,\" featuring duets between celebrity musicians and contestants' \"secret voices\" picks - for better or worse. The contestants don't know just how many of the six secret voices are good or bad singers, meaning that while each elimination round reveals the true voice of one of the lip-synchers, the contestants have no clue whether they're producing sweet music or a train wreck in the final duet performance.The duets ratchet up the nail-biting tension for the contestants, panelists, studio audience and musicians alike. Singer-songwriter and \"The Masked Singer\" winner, Jewel (You Were Meant For Me,\" 1995), made an appearance in the second season of \"I Can Hear Your Voice,\" and after having aided the night's contestant from the panel, she herself was nervous to hear if the secret voice really had pipes when they took the stage together.Luckily the secret voice was hiding a true talent for crooning.Contestants on \"I Can See Your Voice\" have limited information on the secret voices - they are defined solely by their occupation - leaving the lip-synchs as the most credible evidence of performance prowess.Throughout the elimination rounds, contestants get help from a panel of celebs anchored by Adrienne Bailon-Houghton (\"The Real\") and Cheryl Hines (\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\") with a rotating chair of guest judges and featured musical artists.In addition to the panel, contestants have the opportunity to use the \"golden mic\" (an impression from a celebrity offscreen about the lip-synch performances), a look into a day in the life of one of the secret voices, a testimonial from a secret voice's biggest fan and a peek into the secret voice's home.Not every clue is a helping hand, however, as the tools at the contestants' disposal are filled with both genuine hints as well as red herrings. \n \n Caption: Ken Jeong from \"I Can See Your Voice\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Oscar winner (for \"Les Miserables\") got her big break in \"Get Real,\" a Fox series that aired during the 1999-2000 season. The seriocomic show about a dysfunctional family also was the first major credit for Jesse Eisenberg (\"The Social Network\"), who played Hathaway's younger brother; Eric Christian Olsen, later of \"NCIS: Los Angeles,\" also portrayed one of the show's three siblings.Though the series lasted only that one season, it didn't take long for Hathaway's movie career to get going. \"The Princess Diaries\" was a big hit in 2001, and though its filming meant Hathaway had to miss her first semester of college, she said later that she didn't mind. Director Garry Marshall had thought of Liv Tyler for the part, but his granddaughters weighed in and convinced him to opt for Hathaway instead, and the picture earned her an MTV Movie Award.Returns were mixed on her movies that followed immediately, including \"Nicholas Nickleby\" and \"Ella Enchanted,\" but she sampled another medium by putting her singing talents to work in a 2002 New York staging of \"Carnival.\" She eventually got back on the box-office track with the 2004 sequel \"The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement\" and moved from that into a variety of screen projects encompassing \"Brokeback Mountain\" and \"The Devil Wears Prada.\" Hathaway has returned to TV on occasion, as a host of \"Saturday Night Live\" and the Oscars, and she also appeared in the streaming projects \"Modern Love\" and \"WeCrashed\" (serving as an executive producer of the latter as well). Additionally, her voice has been heard in episodes of \"The Simpsons\" and \"Family Guy.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Typically, noir pictures rely on stories of tough men (and, in many instances, tough women as well) informed by gritty storytelling and distinctively shadowy cinematography, and the five titles chosen for the festival are quite representative.First up is director Otto Preminger's \"Angel Face\" (1953), with the made-for-noir Robert Mitchum as an ambulance driver who has big doubts about an overly attentive heiress (Jean Simmons) who ropes him into marriage after possibly having been responsible for the car accident that killed her father and stepmother - a tragedy in which both of the new spouses are implicated. Known largely for comedy in later years, Jim Backus (\"Gilligan's Island\") plays the prosecuting attorney.Mitchum returns in the next attraction, the well-reputed \"The Night of the Hunter\" (1955), casting him as a murderer who impersonates a clergyman to find out from a widow (Shelley Winters) and her children (Billy Chapin, Sally Jane Bruce) where her husband - the killer's former prison cellmate - hid the take from a bank robbery. The only movie directed by actor Charles Laughton, the picture has a James Agee screenplay adapted from Davis Grubb's novel.Next comes \"Elevator to the Gallows\" (1958), French filmmaker Louis Malle's drama that literally takes place largely in an elevator, where two lovers (played by Jeanne Moreau and Maurice Ronet) become trapped after conspiring in the murder of the woman's husband who also was the man's boss. The very notable music score is by Miles Davis \n \n Caption: Gloria Grahame and Humphrey Bogart in \"In a Lonely Place \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I'm coming back for season 13. That is even more exciting because it plays right into the spookiness of all of it.\" Returning alongside Bennett are some of the series' fan-favorite, classic components, including pumpkin carving, cake decorating and sugar blowing - but be prepared for shocks galore, as this unlucky season promises some new and exciting surprises along the way.The series' first three episodes act as the \"Halloween Wars\" qualifying rounds, with Bennett asking the teams to complete a series of increasingly difficult tasks, including the \"Monster Mashup,\" where each group must choose two of the scariest monsters imaginable and meld both into one ghastly creation; a round based on the 1973 classic film, \"The Exorcist;\" and a fairy talebased challenge that just may lead to one team's \"happily ever after,\" as this season's judges - Aarti Sequeira (Season 6 winner of \"Food Network Star\") and Shinmin Li (\"Holiday Wars\") - eliminate one bunch of bakers, carvers and confectioners each round.Following episodes will be split into two challenges: the \"Small Scare,\" where teams have 45 minutes to complete an edible interpretation of a spooky theme, and the \"Spine Chiller,\" where the time limit is extended to five hours, allowing for ultimate creativity.Keeping to theme for this 13th season, this year's teams feature some of the show's spookiest puns yet, with names like Team Sweet Screams, Pumpkins Up the Volume, Snax Sabbath, Spice Ghouls, Pumpkin Posse, Trick or Sweet and more, with each team hopeful to prove their deliciously deadly talent in the kitchen and win the final, $50,000 grand prize.Season 13 of \"Halloween Wars\" begins Sunday, Sept. 17, on Food Network. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Being shown on MGM+ Hits on Friday, Sept. 22, writer-director James L. Brooks' 1987 comedy-drama comes from a world he already knew, having co-created the TV newsroom of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\" However, he fortified his effort by landing an adviser in CBS News veteran Susan Zirinsky, a veteran CBS News producer who's now the chief of that entire division.She's also the inspiration for one of the story's chief characters Jane Craig, a driven producer in a network bureau in Washington, D.C. The role made Holly Hunter a star, and perfect opposite her is William Hurt is cast as charismatic Tom Grunick, a newly hired reporter whose admission of not fully understanding the job repulses Jane, though she also can't deny her attraction to him. Albert Brooks completes the tale's romantic triangle as Aaron Altman, a correspondent who's more than capable at his job, though he lacks star quality. This is a film that remains enjoyable to watch time and again. \n \n Caption: William Hunt in \"Broadcast News\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

First is director Frank Capra's \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939), starring James Stewart as a newly appointed U.S. senator who finds many of his peers opposed to his idealism. Then comes \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955), which helped build James Dean's iconic screen image through his portrayal of a deeply troubled teen.Dreyfuss is sure to relate themes from those pictures to his own work choices, and the Academy Award recipient (for 1977's \"The Goodbye Girl\") has enjoyed quite a varied career that has spanned genres from love stories to science fiction. It's interesting to consider what might have happened for him (or not) had filmmaker George Lucas not chosen him for the part of cynically observational teen Curt in \"American Graffiti\" (1973). Though he made \"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz\" (1974) next, his subsequent role was shark expert Matt Hooper in \"Jaws\" and virtually anyone who even has heard the word \"movie\" knows what happened with that. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "The 'Continental' Experience: John Wick Franchise Gets Three-Night Tv Stay\n\n September 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 428\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For many of us, when we book a stay in a hotel (particularly a luxury one), comfort ranks above all else. Though the meaning of the word \"comfort\" varies from one person to the next and could encompass anything from the thread count of the bedsheets to one's proximity to the bar, \"comfort\" in the world of John Wick is most closely associated with personal safety.Those familiar with the John Wick franchise will already be aware of The Continental's most important rule: the assassins seeking refuge within the hotel shall not conduct any \"business\" on the grounds.Put simply, no hits will be tolerated on the premises.That said, NBC/Peacock is certainly hoping for a hit of its own (granted, a \"hit\" of a different kind) when the new miniseries \"The Continental: From the World of John Wick\" begins streaming Friday, Sept.22, on Peacock.John Wick (Keanu Reeves, \"The Matrix,\" 1999), the trained assassin who lends his name to the franchise supported by The Continental Hotel, first made audiences fall in love with him in the 2014 film, simply titled \"John Wick.\" Despite his former career as a hitman, Wick exhibits a soft side while taking care of a new beagle puppy in the wake of his wife's death. However, when a group of gangsters breaks into Wick's home and the puppy is targeted, Wick loses all sensitivity and comes out of retirement to avenge his furry friend. And while Wick's situation may change from film to film, one thing that remains a constant throughout the franchise is The Continental; and this is where Peacock's newest series comes in.Created by Greg Coolidge (\"Ride Along,\" 2014), Shawn Simmons (\"Wayne\") and Kirk Ward (\"The Turkey Bowl,\" 2019), \"The Continental: From the World of John Wick\" is a three-part noir-action miniseries that focuses on the history of the mysterious hotel chain that operates as \"neutral territory for members of the criminal underworld\" (per IMDb).Colin Woodell (\"The Flight Attendant\") stars as a young Winston Scott, the manager of The Continental's New York division and a character already known to franchise fans thanks to the work of \"Deadwood\" actor Ian McShane. The role of Winston is a meaty one for Woodell, filled with lots of backstory for both character and setting as the series' events dive deep into real-life New York crime history.While the specifics of the miniseries are being kept a secret for obvious reasons, there has been word that the events take place over three nights at The Continental in the 1970s and that there is a correlation to both the Winter of Discontent and the rise of the American Mafia. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

New episodes premiere Monday, Sept.25, on Fox.The network is no stranger to Ramsay's distinct - now practically trademarked - in-your-face, abrupt and (sometimes) devastatingly honest critiques, as Fox is currently home to four other shows hosted by the celebrity chef: \"Next Level Chef,\" \"MasterChef,\" \"MasterChef Jr.\" and \"Hell's Kitchen,\" which is slated to return with its 22nd season - dubbed \"Hell's Kitchen: American Dream\" - on Thursday, Sept. 28 (also on Fox).His most popular (and perhaps most quoted) series - \"Kitchen Nightmares\" - first aired in the U.K. as \"Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares\" before making its debut on Fox in 2007.The series ran for nearly 100 episodes before concluding in 2014, much to viewers' dismay.Later, in 2017, Ramsay told the Daily News: \"Yes, it was wrong to pull my own show off air. The biggest demand over the last four years is for 'Kitchen Nightmares' (to come back).\"Hungry fans have been waiting since then for word of the show's potential return.Now, with Season 8 around the corner, Fox has shared an updated synopsis for the series: \"Chef Gordon Ramsay hits the road to help struggling restaurants all over the United States turn their luck around. Ramsay examines the problems each establishment faces, from unsanitary refrigerators to lazy or inexperienced staff, and searches for resolutions. With help from his team, Ramsay redecorates each eatery to give it a fresh new look and updates the menu as needed.Ramsay's ultimate goal is to make the restaurants he visits popular and profitable, but it's up to the restaurateurs to take his advice and turn their business nightmare into the American dream.\"In each episode, Ramsay gives himself, restaurant owners and the rest of their team one week to turn their failing restaurant into spick-and-span, neatly operating (and with any luck, delicious) businesses.Originally produced by ITV Studios (now known as ITV America), the series will now be produced by Gordon's very own Studio Ramsay Global - and the more Gordon Ramsay, the better. With more insults, code violations and stomach-churning dishes, \"Kitchen Nightmares\" returns to Fox, Monday, Sept. 25. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I thought I read that she is related to someone famous. Is that true?A: It is, and on two counts, given who her parents were. Her mother, Phyllis George - a former Miss America - is widely remembered as a trailblazer among national television sportscasters, and she gave birth to Pamela in 1983 while serving as one of the regulars on the CBS pregame show \"The NFLToday.\"Brown's father, John Y. Brown Jr., was the governor of Kentucky from 1979 to 1983 and he also was a pro-basketball-team owner and an owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken who bought the latter company from Colonel Harland Sanders.Brown now has a weekday-afternoon program on CNN, \"The Bulletin With Pamela Brown,\" the latest step in her career with the cable news network where she began working in 2013. Before that, she had been an anchor-reporter at WJLA-TV in Washington, D.C.During her CNN tenure, Brown also has been a senior Washington correspondent and senior White House correspondent, plus a \"CNN Newsroom\" weekend anchor and a fill-in anchor on \"The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer\" and \"Erin Burnett OutFront\"; she has been Emmy-nominated on a number of occasions.Brown recently earned a Master of Studies in Law degree from George Washington University, and she and her husband have a son and a daughter. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He hooks many helium balloons onto his house, making it an airborne vehicle - with an extra passenger aboard, a youngster (voice of Jordan Nagai) trying to earn a scout badge for helping elderly people. Christopher Plummer also is heard.\"Serpico\" (MGM+, Friday, Sept. 29): Al Pacino is superb in director Sidney Lumet's 1973 drama, the true story of New York police detective Frank Serpico, who made himself a marked man with many in his department through his exposure of some other cops' corrupt practices. As is traditional with Lumet films set in the Big Apple, the atmosphere of the city itself is a star of the film, but nothing else here overshadows Pacino's Oscar-nominated performance. The cast also includes Tony Roberts, John Randolph and Cornelia Sharpe.\"A Christmas Story\" (Turner Classic Movies, Friday, Sept. 29): It's unusual to see this 1983 favorite of many viewers this far ahead of the yuletide, but it's part of a \"Remembering Childhood\" theme evening here. Of course, the principal child in question is Ralphie (Peter Billingsley), writer Jean Shepherd's surrogate who wants nothing more than to receive a Red Ryder air rifle as a holiday gift - which earns him the warning from almost everyone around him, \"You'll shoot your eye out!\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

To many people, it is working on a stock-exchange floor. A lot of North American bridge experts have made their living trading options.The Oxford American Dictionary gives four definitions. The illustrative phrases are \"None of the options is satisfactory,\" \"Had no option but to go,\" \"We have ten days' option on the house\" and \"Keep one's options open.\"At the bridge table, three of these may apply. You hope never to face only unsatisfactory options; sometimes you have no option but to adopt one line of play or defense; and ideally you can keep your options open while you learn more about the deal.How many options did East give himself in today's deal? Defending against four hearts, West led the spade 10: two, jack, five. East cashed the spade king: eight, seven, queen. East continued with the spade nine, but South claimed an overtrick. He ruffed in the dummy, drew trumps, cashed the diamond ace, overtook his diamond jack with dummy's queen and discarded his club losers on dummy's two diamond winners.Did East misguess or misdefend?East was a little unlucky that West couldn't overruff dummy's heart nine. Even so, East should have used his eggs to make two omelets, not one. At trick three, he should have cashed the club ace. If West had discouraged, East would have returned a spade. Here, though, West would have encouraged with the club seven, so East would have known to play a second club to defeat the contract.Keep as many defensive options open as possible.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Her first big credit was the 2002-05 NBC series \"American Dreams,\" inspired by the legendary music show \"American Bandstand\" and featuring Boston as Beth, who became the sister-in-law of \"Bandstand\" dancer Beth (Brittany Snow).Boston went on to do guest shots on many series including \"NCIS,\" \"Crossing Jordan,\" \"Las Vegas,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" \"ER\" and \"Castle.\" She landed continuing roles on \"In Plain Sight\" and \"Witches of East End,\" and in 2014, she began what has become her long association with the Hallmark brand, which started with the movie \"A Ring by Spring\" (still repeated fairly often).The Christmas season has yielded a particular amount of work for Boston, who has worked again for Hallmark in \"Ice Sculpture Christmas,\" \"Christmas in Angel Falls,\" \"Check Inn to Christmas,\" \"The Christmas Carousel\" and \"A Christmas Cookie Catastrophe.\" \"Stop the Wedding,\" \"The Last Bridesmaid\" and \"Dating the Delaneys\" have been among Boston's other Hallmark projects; she also has made films for Lifetime occasionally.Additionally, Boston has had a recurring role on \"SEAL Team\" that enabled her to keep working while she was in later stages of her pregnancy, since her character on the series - Hannah Oliver - also was expecting, with high-school friend and Bravo Team member Sonny Quinn (A.J.Buckley) the father of her child. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That's actually putting it mildly, but things eventually warm up between them after a long series of fits and starts.Dreyfuss won an Academy Award for his performance, capitalizing on the screen persona he had made known through his successes in \"American Graffiti\" and \"Jaws,\" and he has considerable fun spoofing the acting profession as his character appears in a show-within-the-show. Also a vital cast member is Quinn Cummings as Mason's wiser-thanher-years young daughter.

Though the festival usually will be only at night - stretching into early Thursday mornings - the opening day takes a page from TCM's annual \"Summer Under the Stars\" playbook by presenting a full 24 hours (technically, 25-1/2) of his features, moving back and forth between sections of his career.The first attraction is a later Heston project, a television version of \"Treasure Island\" (1990), adapted and directed by his son Fraser and casting the elder Heston as pirate Long John Silver. That's followed by two more classic stories, \"The Three Musketeers\" (1973) and \"The Four Musketeers\" (1975), with Heston as Cardinal Richelieu. After those comes \"Counterpoint\" (1967), with Heston as a World War II-era orchestra conductor who stages concerts for his Nazi captors.Then, several epics carry most of the rest of the Heston tribute's first day.\"The Big Country\" (1958) is a William Wyler-directed Western also starring Gregory Peck and (in an Oscar-winning performance) Burl Ives; Sam Peckinpah's \"Major Dundee\" (1965) casts Heston as a renegade Civil War officer; Wyler's legendary \"Ben-Hur\" (1959), which earned Heston one of its 11 Academy Awards, presents him in a famous chariot race; and \"Khartoum\" (1966) offers him as a military general sent to free soldiers and civilians in Sudan.\"The War Lord\" (1965) and \"55 Days at Peking\" (1963) wrap up the historical-drama theme of the Heston showcase's Day One, but there's much more of him to come in the subsequent weeks, some of it relatively contemporary.Examples include director and co-star Orson Welles' well-reputed 1958 melodrama \"Touch of Evil\" (Oct. 11); \"Soylent Green,\" (Oct. 25), the 1973 sci-fi drama with Heston as a policeman of the overpopulated then-future - 2022! - who learns a terrible secret; and the 1971 thriller \"The Omega Man\" (Oct. 25), with Heston as one of the last human survivors in a society ruled by virus-afflicted zombies. \n \n Caption: Charlton Heston in \"Ben Hur\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Missing no more: Procedural drama takes sinister turn in 'Found'\n\n September 28, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dana Simpson | Page: A9 | Section: News \n \n 462\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n According to NamUS's October 2022 report, in the United States, approximately 600,000 people are reported as missing annually - no doubt a much higher number than many of us might expect.As true crime aficionados and law enforcement can likely attest, only a fraction of these missing people are ever found, and with each passing hour, their cases become more and more dire. Thankfully, there are a handful of people in the world who are equipped with the skills and knowledge to help, and one such person - on screen, at least - is Gabi Mosely, the leading character in NBC's newest procedural drama \"Found,\" premiering Tuesday, Oct. 3, and streaming the following day on Peacock.Played by \"Shameless\" star Shanola Hampton, Gabi is a hard-working, determined public relations expert who specializes in finding Americans who have been reported as missing. As she leads a team of professionals in their shared noble work, Gabi does her best to parse her own past as a missing person. That said, Gabi's methods for dealing with her demons could arguably use a bit of work.As viewers quickly learn, Gabi has turned the proverbial tables on her former captor and has taken him hostage for a change - not exactly legal, but certainly satisfying. Now, despite her outwardly calm and put-together exterior, Gabi must hide the fact that she has a man, known only as \"Sir\" (played by \"Saved by the Bell's\" Mark-Paul Gosselaar), tied up in her very own basement while she seeks justice for the remainder of the missing Americans on the register.To make matters even more intriguing, Gabi has a plan for Sir.Convinced that, as a former abductor himself, Sir knows the ins and outs of the criminal psyche and its various resulting behaviors, Gabi enlists his help as a consultant. With each new case she brings home, Sir is forced to help her find the victims of these heinous abductions and turn the kidnappers over to the authorities for investigation, (hopefully) a guilty verdict and sentencing.While \"Found\" was originally scheduled for a Feb. 19 premiere this year, NBC announced the show's postponement in mid-January, believing it to be better suited to an autumn release.\"After watching the first few episodes of 'Found,' it quickly became clear that our love for this show has continued to grow and grow with each step of the process,\" Susan Rovner, chairman of entertainment content for NBC Universal television and streaming, said in a January news release.\"Our goal is always to find the absolute best home for all our series, and it's particularly the case with one as important as this,\" Rovner continued. \"By moving it to fall, we're able to better leverage our resources, including lead-in and marketing muscle, enabling us to launch 'Found' to the largest possible audience across all our platforms.\" \n \n Caption: Shanola Hampton in \"Found\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

South cashed his spade king before leading a low club, scooping up West's singleton king with dummy's ace. Now declarer exited from the dummy with the diamond ace and another diamond. After winning with his king, East continued with a diamond to his partner's queen. Endplayed, West exited with a spade. Declarer ruffed in the dummy, discarded his club loser and conceded three tricks: one heart and two diamonds.The errors? First, East should have played the diamond jack, not the king, at trick seven. Second, West should have dropped the diamond queen under his partner's king. East wouldn't have risen with the king unless holding the jack as well. In both cases, West could have received two club ruffs to defeat the contract.Last, South should have exited from the dummy with a low diamond, not with the ace and another. If East wins and gives his partner a club ruff, South wins West's diamond exit with dummy's ace, draws the last trump and concedes a second diamond trick. If instead the defenders persist with diamonds, declarer wins with dummy's ace and plays a third round, endplaying whoever wins the trick. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Its premiere there made it a rare series to run on three different broadcast networks, since the original show - hosted by Monty Hall, also (along with business partner Stefan Hatos) a creator and producer of it - ran on NBC from 1963 to 1966, then moved to ABC, where it continued until 1976.There also were other editions before the Brady-hosted revival premiered, with NBC attempting it again twice, in daytime with Bob Hilton and (very briefly) in prime time with Bush.Brady has earned two of his five Emmy Awards for his work on \"Let's Make a Deal,\" and by the time he started that job, the idea of comedians becoming gameshow hosts had been accepted. Among examples, Drew Carey assumed the hosting spot on \"The Price Is Right\" in 2007, and Louie Anderson had guided \"Family Feud\" from 1999 to 2002 (Steve Harvey started in the latter show in 2010).In interviews, Brady has maintained that he never wanted to be just one thing in the entertainment world not exclusively an actor nor a comic (a skill he has displayed plentifully on the improvisation-oriented \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\") nor a singer (he was nominated for a 2009 Grammy Award for his cover of Sam Cooke's \"A Change Is Gonna Come\"). He also has appeared on Broadway in \"Chicago,\" \"Freestyle Love Supreme\" and \"Kinky Boots.\" Along with \"The Price Is Right,\" extra episodes of \"Let's Make a Deal\" have been made expressly for CBS' prime time lineup. That will continue for both shows during the upcoming television season, when they are slated to be seen on Friday nights starting in November. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A brand-new season of \"Loki\" premieres Friday, Oct. 6, on Disney+. Tom Hiddleston (\"The Essex Serpent\") returns as the God of Mischief, everyone's favorite troublemaker, Loki, who has developed a mysterious problem this season.Owen Wilson (\"Haunted Mansion,\" 2023) is back as Mobius M. Mobius, the Time Variance Authority agent tasked with helping Loki right his wrongs across the multiverse. The first season of \"Loki\" saw the Norse God meet his match in an alternate version of himself. Sophia Di Martino (\"The Electrical Life of Louis Wain,\" 2021) is Sylvie, a variant of Loki who interrupts the Sacred Timeline. After coming together to set things right across space and time, Loki returned to what he thought would be the TVA headquarters he left before his mission, but something still wasn't right.In the official trailer for the upcoming season, Mobius brings Loki to a repair shop of sorts, manned by TVA repair guy OB, portrayed by Ke Huy Quan (\"American Born Chinese\"). Before the pair have time to explain what's brought them there, Loki suddenly, uncontrollably disappears in a timeslip, leaving Mobius looking to OB for an answer. \"It's impossible to timeslip in the TVA,\" is all he can say, though they just watched it happen.\"Loki\" executive producer Kevin Wright told Entertainment Weekly in September that \"[OB's] job is basically every piece of tech, every computer, every thing that is running at the TVA. [[---]] He either designed it or he fixes it and keeps it running.\" Having recently picked up an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2022's \"Everything Everywhere All At Once,\" Quan is well suited to help repair another multiverse.While Quan's character is the latest to join Loki's crew as he chases chaos across the multiverse, several cast members return for the new season, including Gugu Mbatha-Raw (\"Surface\") as Ravonna Renslayer, an ambitious judge in the TVA who oversees Loki's case. Literally backing up Loki at one point in the season's trailer alongside Mobius, Sylvie and OB is Wunmi Mosaku (\"We Own This City\") as Hunter B-15. Eugene Cordero (\"Star Trek: Lower Decks\") returns as Hunter K-5E, former TVA receptionist.The upcoming seasons also star Neil Ellice (\"Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn\") as Hunter D-90, Jonathan Majors (\"Creed III,\" 2023) as He Who Remains and Tara Strong (\"Teen Titans Go!\") as the voice of Miss Minutes. Rafael Casal (\"Blindspotting\"), Kate Dickie (\"Annika\") and Liz Carr (\"Silent Witness\") all join the cast this season in as-yet-unnamed roles. \n \n Caption: Owen Wilson and Tom Hiddleston in \"Loki\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Logically scheduled first is the character's initial film, \"The Ipcress File\" (1965), then the lineup skips the second picture in the series (1966's \"Funeral in Berlin\") to proceed directly to the third, \"Billion Dollar Brain\" (1967).Harry Saltzman, who was one of the original producers of the James Bond movies along with Albert R. Broccoli), bought the film rights to the Palmer books from Deighton during the latter's brief involvement with the Bond franchise. Interestingly, each of the '60s Palmer capers was released by a different studio: \"The Ipcress File\" by Universal, \"Funeral in Berlin\" by Paramount, and \"Billion Dollar Brain\" by United Artists.Such key players in the 007 series as composer John Barry, editor Peter R. Hunt and composer John Barry were brought over by Saltzman for \"The Ipcress File.\" The movie that made later two-time Oscar winner Caine a star, it finds ex-military man Palmer enlisted to find a kidnapped scientist.complications involving British Intelligence and the CIA arise as the case proceeds, with Palmer eventually captured and subjected to brainwashing in a classic sequence designed for maximum tension by Hunt and director Sidney J. Furie.While \"The Ipcress File\" is deliberately low in gadgetry, \"Billion Dollar Brain\" leans more into the technology that became such a part of the spy genre during that era. An early work by director Ken Russell, later of \"Women in Love\" and \"Tommy\" fame, it pits Palmer against a computer-obsessed tycoon (Ed Begley) who schemes to incite World War III by dispatching his own private army. Karl Malden, who would reunite with Caine in 1979's \"Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,\" plays a presumed friend of Palmer. \n \n Caption: Michael Caine and Nigel Green in \"The Ipcress File\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As an added treat, Smithsonian National Zoo members can enjoy early admission from 5 to 6 p.m. all three nights.Boo at the Zoo offers families a safe atmosphere to trick-or-treat while enjoying festive Halloween decorations in the wild and not-so-spooky setting of the zoo.Tickets include afterhours access to popular zoo exhibits, including the Small Mammal House, Elephant Community Center and Reptile Discovery Center.Guests can feast their eyes on spellbinding habitats decorated with jack-o'-lanterns, spooky enrichment and tasty treats for the animals.Each trick-or-treater will receive one recyclable bag to fill up with sweets, snacks and other fun surprises at around 30 booths stationed throughout the park. Fiendishly fun vignettes featuring frolicking skeletons and fantastical creatures will liven up the zoo's main pathway, Olmsted Walk.Tickets are on sale for $35 or for $25 for zoo members.Each attendee, including any children over the age of 2, will need a ticket.In addition to early access to the event, zoo member benefits include discounted parking, which is available for pre-purchase online at $20 per vehicle for zoo members and $30 per vehicle for non-members.Only guests with a parking pass will be permitted to enter the zoo's Connecticut Avenue entrance with their vehicle.Guests using ride share vehicles will be dropped off and picked up at the designated ride share zones near the Connecticut Avenue and Harvard Street entrances. Zoo staff will scan tickets at both the Connecticut Avenue entrance and lower entrance near the Kids' Farm. Metro Bus (L1 and L2) and Metro Rail (Woodley Park-Zoo and Cleveland Park) have stops within walking distance of the zoo's main pedestrian entrance on Connecticut Avenue.Guests of all ages are invited to dress up in creative costumes. Adult guests are not permitted to wear masks that fully cover the face or obstruct the wearer's vision.Additionally, costumes may not contain any props or accessories that resemble or could easily be mistaken for an actual weapon.Boo at the Zoo is an extremely popular event with Washington area families who celebrate Halloween.Due to limited capacity, tickets and parking passes tend to sell out quickly. Guests are encouraged to plan ahead and purchase both tickets and parking passes early. All proceeds from Boo at the Zoo support animal care and conservation science at the zoo.This event will be held rain or shine.

These bakers need to think big and bold, blowing up their designs to gigantic proportions and thinking outside the (bakery) box.\" As \"Big Bake\" competitions take place throughout the year, this iteration celebrates the spookiest and scariest season of them all, tasking bakers with eye-popping and downright dreary challenges that feature spooky Halloween treats, creepy clown cakes, fa-boolous shrieks, scares and costumes galore.So far this season, the teams have been asked to create cakes of the best \"boo-ticians\" in town, decorated with their creepy clientele, and then made their way to the carnival, where funhouse screams were on the menu as Smith asked the baking teams to create some spine-chilling desserts.But fear not. The scariest snacks are still to come.During this upcoming episode, Food Network promises that witches will be the \"talk of the town,\" as a description for the challenge shares that \"Brad Smith asks the baking teams to wave their magic whisks to create cakes featuring the queens of Halloween.\" In the following weeks, the competition continues, as bakers serve some \"big bog bakes\" with swamp-themed cakes and later tackle their fears by making creations that feature thrill-seeking monsters.As tension rises and suspense builds, bakers must do their best to impress this season's judges - pastry chef Ron Ben-Israel (\"Cake Wars\"), cornerback-turned-chef Eddie Jackson (\"Outchef 'd\") and internet personality/cookbook author Danni Rose (\"Danni's Juke Joint Comfort Food Cookbook: Modern-Day Recipes, Ole Skool Flavas,\" releasing in November 2023) - and avoid elimination, making it to the end of the competition, where the most ambitious (and terrifying) baker will go home with a $10,000 prize.Jam-packed with creepy confections, taunting treats and bizarre baked goods, new episodes of \"The Big Bake: Halloween\" air Mondays through October on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Ron Ben Israel, Danni Rose, Brad Smith and Eddie Jackson from \"The Big Bake\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

(He also has been an executive producer of the show from the beginning.)Piers Morgan, Brandy Norwood and David Hasselhoff made up the judging panel for the first season in 2006, with Regis Philbin as the host.At the time, Cowell was intending to make a similar contest for British television, but some complications ultimately held that up and he turned his attention to making a U.S. version. The result was a summer hit for NBC, and it also jump-started the originally planned British edition, which premiered in 2007 and also continues. From there, the concept expanded even more, with versions still being done in Canada, Cambodia, France, India and Spain (among other locations).A judge on the British version from the start, Cowell became an on-air \"America's Got Talent\" presence beginning with the 11th season - this year has marked its 18th round - but he wasn't present for the live episodes during Season 15, due to a back injury. Substitute judges were enlisted initially, but the number of judges then was reduced from four to three in Cowell's absence, with Howie Mandel (who has been with the show since Season 5), Heidi Klum and Sofia Vergara holding forth with those duties.Actually, Klum also missed some of Season 15 due to illness, with Vergara's fellow \"Modern Family\" alum Eric Stonestreet filling in for her. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So many episodes of the series are classics in their own right, if you asked five people which one was their favorite, you'd likely get five different answers.

The three best friends have a lot of inroads to make once they arrive in the big city, but their hopes of stardom for Santi keep them afloat.In a teaser trailer for \"Neon\" released by Netflix, the trio's temporary Miami lodgings are parked within view of the more comfortably cramped suites of a Sheraton hotel. Humble beginnings for sure, but the trailer also sees the dreamers working hard, making connections and taking to the stage, enjoying the nightlife they hope to become fixtures of soon.Though they're starting from the bottom and sleeping in their car to start, the \"Neon\" trailer teases some pretty glamorous upgrades afforded to the crew. Santi shoots a music video, lays down a track in the studio, embraces his friends backstage of a very important performance, gets invites to swanky house parties and tosses cash in the air. \"You are a star,\" Ness proclaims in the trailer before further declaring, \"We have to show them we're not loser wannabes.\" Whether Santi is on the rise or a wannabe, the music fanatics of Miami decide his fate - he'll either get set off to stardom or back to his hometown. \n \n Caption: Tyler Dean Flores in \"Neon\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tides of crime: Secrets and murder abound in Season 2 of 'Annika'\n\n October 12, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dana Simpson | Page: 9A | Section: News \n \n 421\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It's Scottish crime with a Scandinavian twist this autumn as Season 2 of the BBC series \"Annika\" premieres on PBS Masterpiece, Sunday, Oct. 15. An interesting clash of northern European cultures, the two worlds meet seamlessly due to the titular character's Norwegian roots and the often-folkloric nature of the crimes she encounters at work.The series' main character, DI Annika Strandhed, has been a hit with audiences across the pond since the original radio series premiered in early January 2017 on the U.K.'s BBC Radio 4. The radio series, titled \"Annika Stranded,\" wrapped Sept. 4, 2020, but for lovers of the series, the story continues on television, complete with Nicola Walker (\"MI-5\") in the role of Annika - no doubt a familiar voice for fans who jumped over from the radio play.Both series follow Strandhed, a former Oslo-based \"murder squad\" police officer, as she relocates to a remote region of Scotland to head up the country's first-ever Marine Homicide Unit. Given her dedication to the job and a lifelong love of fast-moving boats, Strandhed seems poised as the perfect fit to lead the new team. That said, her cohort DS Michael McAndrews (Jamie Sives, \"Guilt\") has other opinions.McAndrews attended police college with Strandhed, but the two detectives selected career paths that took them in opposite directions, causing them to drift apart. While McAndrews is clearly supportive of Strandhed and finds her to be a very intelligent leader, he still believes himself to have been a better candidate for her position as leader of the MHU. Nevertheless, the pair must find a way to work together - thankfully McAndrews' duties as head diver keep him busy and away from Strandhed much of the time.Working alongside the two team leads are DC Blair Ferguson (Katie Leung, \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\" 2005), who provides data analysis and tech support for the team; DS Tyrone Clarke (Ukweli Roach, \"Blindspot\"), a former drug unit investigator who prefers to work alone; and DCI Diane Oban (Kate Dickie, \"The Green Knight,\" 2021), who oversees all police proceedings within the precinct and often has the final say on how the MHU operates.Joining the MHU this season is DC Harper Weston (played by Varada Sethu, \"Jurassic World Dominion,\" 2022), a motorcycle-riding trainee who, given her youth, may act as a second person to provide Strandhed a bit of insight regarding her daughter, Morgan (Sylvie Furneaux, \"Red Rose\"). This guiding role has previously only been played by Ferguson, who is of a similar age to Weston and only a few years older than Morgan herself. \n \n Caption: Nicola Walker in \"Annika\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There was even rocking funk music from G Method to make spirits high.\"The Jellyfish Apocalypse is amazing. It is so flavorful. It still tastes like a beer, but with a yummy kick. We saw the name and said, 'Let's give it a go.' You have to be truly adventurous,'\" said Jackie Sadler, who is part of Three Roads Brewing Company in Virginia.\"To be a good beer taster you have to be open minded about trying different types of beer. So being open to trying the IPA or the blonde or the pilsner or the lager - I think that is what makes the best beer taster,\" said Emily Sadler, who is Jackie's daughter in law.Chris Hash, the treasurer of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, has been organizing the October beer festival for eight years.\"It's a huge fundraiser. We have over 1,000 in attendance. Its a big financial impact. General admission tickets are $45. VIPs are $75,\" he said.While the money is great, Hash said another part of the event is enlisting new firefighters.\"We have a recruitment and retention table over here. We guys talking about what we do and hopefully recruit some new younger members. Volunteering has become a bit of dying breed in the last few years,\" said Hash.\"Firefighting has a lot of excitement.There is a lot of training, but it is rewarding. You get to do something a normal person doesn't get to do. You are running into burning building when others are running out.\" He said all the food, like crab dip on top of fries, was cooked by firemen.You could also find brats, pulled pork and hot dogs.The festival featured 46 brewers, a couple of wineries and distilleries, and 120 different drink options.Tim Miller of Easton started making National Premium beer in 2012.\"We have some old fans and we hope to make some new ones, but this is kind of the rewards of the beer business. It is just a fun day for everybody. It is in our backyard and it is the best run beer festival I've done. And I have done a lot. I don't have to lug ice or equipment. I can just come and pour,\" said Miller.There was even some art to be found at the beer fest. One lady is the \"Queen of Bottlecaps.\" She color coordinates beer caps and puts them into designs on a wooden board.\"It takes several hours to make one. It is therapeutic. I have been here at least four times. More men are willing to make this purchase.The crab design is the most popular,\" said Hillary Wright of Salisbury. the event, which is sponsored by Easton Liquors and Discover Easton, helped lead to the pouring of ciders, seltzers, craft beers, wines and spirits all day long. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTim Miller, left, bought the National Premium beer franchise in 2012.

Bridge players are hooked on a 13-trick deal. However, both are aware that they might not last that long. Rodeo riders often fall off in under eight seconds. The bridge player might have lost too many tricks before the last one has been played. Still, both always set out with the best of intentions.In today's deal, South was on the three-no-trump bronco. Upon opening the gate, he saw that the lead was the diamond king. How should he have tried to ride to success?During the first buck, South noticed that he had seven top tricks: one spade, one heart, one diamond and four clubs.Looking at those lovely diamonds in the dummy, South won the first trick with his diamond ace and fired back the diamond three.However, West went in with the queen (East discarded the club three) and switched immediately to the heart two. South sailed off the bull and landed face first in the dirt. He couldn't avoid losing five tricks.However tempting those diamonds looked, there was a better source of tricks available: spades. South should win the first trick, play a club to dummy's queen and take a spade finesse by, say, running the queen. West wins with the king and switches to hearts, but South, after ducking one round, wins with his heart ace, plays a club to dummy's ace and runs the spade nine.When that finesse wins, he repeats it and cashes the spade ace and club king-jack for nine tricks: three spades, one heart, one diamond and four clubs.Did you tame the bucking broncoft ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's time to sharpen your knives and prepare your mise-en-scène, as \"Mary Makes it Easy\" airs an all-new episode, Sunday, Oct. 22, on Food Network.Hosted by Canadian television host, cookbook author and chef Mary Berg (winner of \"MasterChef Canada\" Season 3), this how-to series follows as Berg gives step-by-step instructions to follow recipes that are guaranteed to impress even the pickiest of eaters, as the chef hopes to teach culinary novices and cooks alike how to expand their recipe book without any of the stress.With multiple seasons now under her belt, Berg has focused episodes on a myriad of topics, including: how to make multiple recipes all utilizing the same base ingredients - like coleslaw used both in golden brown Japanese Okonomi-yaki-inspired pancakes and store-bought rotisserie chicken, turned into a nearly unrecognizable, quick and easy Coq au Vin; upgrading store-bought cookie doughs and pie crusts to make impressive desserts; using your kitchen tools - cast iron included - to their fullest potential; and even making the correct wine and alcohol pairings, in an episode in which Berg \"shakes things up with Wine Can Chicken that's cooked with a cocktail of dry white wine, lemon and herbs\" (Food Network).In episodes to come, Food Network shares that Berg shares her love for cooking outside, detailing recipes that \"take grill night to the next level.\"\"Brie and Pancetta Burgers are topped with chunky grilled red onion and gooey Brie cheese,\" they describe. \"For a vegetarian grill-friendly main, Mary's Grilled Soy Maple Mushrooms caramelize beautifully, and on the lighter side, Grilled Scallops with Minty Pea Salad are flavored with garlic, lemon and herbs on a peppery arugula base. Finally, Mary does some barbecue baking with decadent Cheese Stuffed Grilled Garlic Flatbreads.\"And - taking her creative approach, as always - Berg even shares her own, unique \"mash-up\" recipes throughout the series, melding common dishes like Caesar Salad and Roast Chicken, even crafting a Taco Meatball skillet.Delving into the best tips, tricks and tools necessary for any cook, Mary Berg impresses in every episode of \"Mary Makes it Easy,\" airing Sundays on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Mary Berg from \"Mary Makes it Easy\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In fact, last year's winner in Leonardtown, Dan Challet, recently finished ninth in the world title event in Ireland.\"The national oyster shucking championship brings people from all over the country to compete,\" said Tari Moore, chairperson for the 2023 U.S. Oyster Festival Committee. \"Not only does the winner get a chase prize, they get to compete in the International Championship next September. Best of all, after the competition the contestants give the shucked oysters to anyone nearby interested in eating them.\"On Saturday, the 44th annual National Oyster Cook-off will highlight the festivities as contestants will be competing for cash prizes in three divisions - Hors d'ouevres, Soups & Stews and Main Dishes. Grand prize for first place is $300, second place will take home $200 and third place will garner $150, although the winners will attain immeasurable bragging rights for the entire year.\"This festival was started to highlight the importance of the oyster harvest to the entire region and there are so many events surrounding it now that it is really a festive, two-day event,\" Moore said. \"Our oyster cook-off is amazing and we have three of the best judges anywhere judging the event. There are so many great recipes that people prepare and there is such a wide range of them that it really is hard to comprehend.\"Last year local residents more than held their own in the competitions as Deborah Reynolds ofWaldorf took first place the main dish category, while Ellynne Brice Davis of Leonardtown finished third in that category. Reynolds also took home first place in the Soups & Stews category. Ronna Farley of Montgomery County took first place in the best hors d'oeuvres division and grand prize in the U.S. Oyster Cook-Off competition.Those who attend the oyster cook-Offwill also have ample means of entertainment on each day.

He guest-starred on \"Friends\" for three episodes in 2000 as Paul, the disapproving father of Ross's (David Schwimmer) considerably younger girlfriend Elizabeth (Alexandra Holden), and the two men eventually came to a meeting of the minds thanks to certain information Ross had about Paul (which the latter man didn't want revealed).Willis earned a Primetime Emmy Award for the portrayal, marking the second one he won, his first having come for his work as wisecracking sleuth David Addison on \"Moonlighting.\" He also did guest shots on such shows as \"Ally McBeal\" and \"Mad About You,\" but movies had the bulk of his creative attention after he scored an enormous hit with the original \"Die Hard\" in 1988.That being said, the actor also hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" a couple of times, and he was the good-natured target of a \"Comedy Central Roast\" in 2018, with his ex-wife Demi Moore and \"Moonlighting\" leading lady Cybill Shepherd among those who took humorous shots at him. As is traditional for such events, though, Willis got to even the score with his own remarks at the end of that show. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who played Willis' younger self in the 2012 movie \"Looper,\" was the host of the \"Roast.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Kim Dickens (\"Friday Night Lights\") stars as Madison Clark, a high school guidance counsellor before the outbreak who now oversees the reconstruction of a survivors' island colony.\"Fear the Walking Dead\" closes out an impressive eight-season run with six episodes to go before the big, two-part series finale set to air Sunday, Nov. 19. The first of now six spinoffs of the original series, \"Fear the Walking Dead\" premiered in 2015 and followed an extended family as they tried to survive in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. The series detailed the survivors' journey as they travelled and settled in California, Mexico and now an island off the Georgia coast.The island, known as PADRE, was constructed after the walker outbreak as a military operation intended to distribute supplies to new communities of survivors. A tragic walker invasion decimated PADRE, and since then, desperate survivors have used the island's resources that once represented a more hopeful future.In the first half of the final season of \"Fear the Walking Dead,\" Madison landed on PADRE after a hard-fought journey to find the island with Morgan Jones (Lennie James, \"Save Me\"). The pair reunited Morgan with his daughter, Mo (Zoey Merchant, \"The Price of Fame\"), by force at PADRE before the show leaps seven years into the future. Madison is imprisoned on PADRE while Morgan spends most of the first six episodes of the season on his own mission, trying to save Grace Mukherjee (Karen David, \"Legacies\") from radiation sickness before sadly losing her and setting off to Alexandria.With the dangerous former co-leaders of PADRE no longer a problem, Madison attempts to reinvigorate the spirit of PADRE and the island with the remaining resources available to them. While the final episodes of \"Fear the Walking Dead\" could certainly detail the establishment of a post-apocalyptic paradise, this is the Walking Dead universe after all, so there will undoubtedly be danger lurking in the shadows of PADRE.This season also stars Rubén Blades (\"The Counselor,\" 2013) as resistance leader Daniel Salazar; Colman Domingo (\"Sing Sing,\" 2023) as antihero Victor Strand; Danay Garcia (\"Prison Break\") as survivor Luciana Galvez; Austin Amelio (\"Hit Man,\" 2023) as PADRE member Dwight; Christine Evangelista (\"Mrs. Fletcher\") as Dwight's wife, Sherry; Jenna Elfman (\"The Twilight Zone\") as nurse June Dorie, who is on the run from PADRE; and one former cast member whose appearance in a trailer for the upcoming return of the series may have come as a surprise to \"Fear the Walking Dead\" fans. \n \n Caption: Jenna Elfman in \"Fear the Walking Dead\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Played by Titus Welliver, Harry Bosch - a homicide detective turned private eye - has a deeply personal case to handle this time, since he searches for his kidnapped rookie-cop daughter Maddie (Madison Lintz). The drama is based largely on Connelly's book \"The Crossing,\" and Connelly and Welliver are both among its executive producers.Interestingly, \"The Crossing\" is the 18 th book in the Bosch franchise, while Season 1 of \"Bosch: Legacy\" was inspired by two of the novels that came later, \"The Wrong Side of Goodbye\" (the 19th book) and \"The Night Fire\" (the 22nd book). The first season ended with a cliffhanger that suggested the abduction of Maddie, who seemed likely to have to testify in a wrongful-death shooting case, for which her police body camera had captured evidence.Maddie works out of the same Los Angeles police station where her father was based during his days as a cop. His frequent employer, attorney Honey \"Money\" Chandler (Mimi Rogers), trades on her own contacts to try to help him find Maddie before time runs out. Bosch and Chandler have other problems as the saga unfolds, with federal agents taking an interest in them and definitely not for the purposes of professional camaraderie and cooperation.New cast members in the sophomore round of \"Bosch: Legacy\" include Anthony Michael Hall (\"The Breakfast Club\") as one of the FBI investigators, as well as Jessica Camacho (\"All Rise\"), Max Martini (\"The Unit\"), David Denman ('The Office\") and veteran actor Bruce Davison (\"Willard\"). Among other co-stars returning to the \"Bosch\" world are Jamie Hector, Gregory Scott Cummins, Troy Evans, Denise Sanchez, Stephen A. Chang, Jacqueline Obradors and David Marciano. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Since it's set in 2022, some viewers may get a rueful chuckle out of its portrait of a densely polluted, overpopulated New York but there's also something quite moving about its rumination of the world the way it used to be.Heston plays a policeman whose investigation of a tycoon's (Joseph Cotten) murder exposes him to the good life the slain man lived. That encompasses such then-novelties as fresh beef and strawberries, some of which the cop spirits away to share with his friend and assistant - or \"book,\" in the parlance of this tale. That role marks the final performance of Edward G. Robinson, who's thoroughly moving and simply wonderful here. Leigh Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors and Brock Peters are among other familiar faces on hand. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Occasionally, the bidding will tell you -- as here. North's double of three clubs was for penalty, not takeout, as it would be today.This old deal features a truly incredible defense -- one of the most imaginative ever. The deal was reported by Frenchman Jacques Blaizot, who was sitting West. He was in the Palace of Da Lat, partnering Bao Dai, then the Emperor of French Indochina. (Later, the palace was in South Vietnam.)Defending against three no-trump, West led the club ace. How do you think the defense went?West opened with a cautious three clubs. North doubled for penalties, but South, with his distributional hand, wisely didn't pass. (Three clubs was unbeatable.) Then, when North bid three hearts, South thought he was facing a heart-club two-suiter. So, rather than look for a nonexistent spade fit, he settled for three no-trump.This is how Blaizot reported the play: \"I led the club ace and under the eyes of the panic-stricken spectators, Bao Dai discarded the diamond ace! I continued with the club queen and he discarded the spade ace! Immediately, silence filled the room. Discreetly, the spectators, struck with fright, got up and whispered into each other's ears. Then, little by little, a disquieting rumor spread through the palace: 'The emperor has gone mad. He threw away all of his aces.' But no! Bao Dai wasn't playing to lose.\"If the emperor had kept either of his aces, South could have established that suit without letting West on play. Now, though, West had to win a spade or diamond trick and could cash enough club winners to defeat the contract.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Operatic opposition: HBO period drama lifts curtain on Season 2\n\n October 26, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dana Simpson; David Furr and Louisa Jacobson in \"The Gilded Age\" | Page: 29 | Section: News \n \n 475\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Whether first heard as a quippy one-liner from famous New York humorist Fran Leb-owitz (\"Pretend It's a City\") or read in Esther Crain's book \"The Gilded Age in New York, 1870-1910,\" there is little doubt you've heard about New York City's penchant for change. Per Crain's aforementioned book, released in 2016 and available through most major booksellers, \"the most common observation about New York is that it never stops evolving.\"This is especially true in the HBO series \"The Gilded Age,\" premiering Season 2 on its home network and the Max streaming service Sunday, Oct. 29. Starring Carrie Coon (\"Gone Girl,\" 2014), Cynthia Nixon (\"Sex and the City\") and Christine Baranski (\"Mamma Mia!,\" 2008) as some of New York's finest wealthy gossips, the series follows a group of business moguls and socialites as they work hard to make a name for themselves and build an empire in New York City during the turn of the 20th century.Coon stars as Bertha Russell, a \"new money heiress\" who caused some major waves in Season 1 alongside her husband, railroad tycoon George Russell (Morgan Spector, \"The Plot Against America\"), and her fellow socialite Mrs. Caroline Astor (Donna Murphy, \"The Nanny Diaries,\" 2007), the leader of aristocratic social society called The Four Hundred. With her own societal standing foremost in her sights, Bertha often stirs up more trouble than is necessary to get what she wants.Also to blame for her fair bit of trouble is Marian Brook (new talent Louisa Jacobson), who fell on hard times when her father died in the series premiere and began Season 1 by moving into her estranged aunts' house for a bit of a lifestyle makeover in the Big Apple. Marian's aunts, Ada Brook (Nixon) and Agnes Van Rhijn (Baranski), both belong to the old-money world and thus have very particular views on how things should be done among New York's finest. While Marian does her best to please her aunts, she has also learned that not everyone subscribes to her family's conservative school of thought.Returning alongside Coon, Murphy, Jacobson, Nixon and Baranski for Season 2 is Denee Benton (\"UnREAL\"), who plays highly motivated writer Peggy Scott, who moved from Pennsylvania to New York City with Marian. Despite holding down a job as Agnes' secretary, Peggy is of respectable societal standing herself and has come to enjoy the company of her old friend in a new city. She also enjoys testing the boundaries set in place by those in high-up positions, often complicating matters for herself and those closest to her.Headed into the show's second season, the Primetime Emmy-winning series follows more of the petticoat-clad drama that comes along with Gilded-era expansion. This time, according to the official HBO trailer, it seems that the bulk of the hullabaloo centers on the world of the operatic arts. More specifically, it likely revolves around the 1886 closing of the Metropolitan Opera House. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Her yen for trying different sorts of projects is clear again as she stars in the fact-inspired Lifetime movie \"Would You Kill for Me? The Mary Bailey Story,\" debuting Saturday, Oct. 28.As she has done on many of her projects, Hart also serves as an executive producer on the film, in which she plays the matriarch of a family whose women suffer the alcohol-fueled abuse of an outsider. Hart's character Ella sees her daughter Veronica (played by Olivia Scriven) marry Willard (Connor McMahon), whose behavior gets steadily worse - one major indication being his affair with Veronica's best friend, who becomes pregnant by him. Ella's young granddaughter Mary (Presley Allard) also is subjected to the turmoil, until one night that ends fatally.\"Would You Kill for Me? The Mary Bailey Story\" takes a \"Ra-shomon\"-like approach, showing the events from the perspective of each of the female relatives. As the story unfolds, the audience is invited to guess who committed the killing, with that person's identity revealed at the end of the movie.Obviously, this is heavy territory for Hart, but she's been tackling challenging material since the time she was particularly popular with young viewers for her weekly television work. During that period, she portrayed a young woman who manipulated her boyfriend against her parents in \"Twisted Desire\" (1996), one of several people left at the mercy of the sea by a yacht mishap in \"Two Came Back\" (1997), and a college journalist probing her best friend's assault in \"Silencing Mary\" (1998). \n \n Caption: Melissa Joan Hart and Presley Allard in \"Would You Kill for Me?

How long was she on that show?A: The late actress joined the NBC sitcom, set in the Boston bar \"where everybody knows your name,\" in 1992 at the start of the sixth of its 11 seasons. Her character, Rebecca Howe, became the site's manager and effectively assumed the former spot of Diane Chambers (played by Shelley Long) as a romantic interest and verbal sparring partner for bartender Sam Maloine (Ted Danson).Alley already had done a considerable amount of television work by the time she began her \"Cheers\" tenure, including her stints as a non-celebrity contestant on \"Match Game\" and \"Password Plus.\" Her first major acting role was TV-based, as Lt. Saavik in \"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\" (1982), though that was a theatrical film. She had a brief mid-1980s run in the ABC espionage series \"Masquerade,\" then gained attention in the ABC miniseries \"North and South\" and played iconic feminist Gloria Steinem in the ABC movie \"A Bunny's Tale.\"\"Cheers\" came next for Alley, and most of her extracurricular work during her run on that series leaned toward feature films. She used her hiatus periods from the show to make such movies as \"Shoot to Kill\" (1988), \"Loverboy\" (1989), \"Sibling Rivalry\" (1990) and the three \"Look Who's Talking\" comedies (1989, 1990, 1993). Alley would make several other series, including \"Veronica's Closet\" and \"Kirstie\" (though her character in the latter was named Maddie), later. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

AMC gives the scare show a real workout by showing it Sunday, Oct. 29, Monday, Oct. 30, and Tuesday, Oct. 31 - along with several of the sequels, which were guaranteed when the first movie became one of the most profitable independent films of all time.Recent Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis secured her \"scream queen\" label as Laurie Strode, the babysitter who ends up in a battle for survival against Michael Myers (played mainly by Nick Castle), a sanitarium escapee who targets various people in an Illinois town. Donald Pleasence also stars as the masked and highly lethal Michael's psychiatrist, who does what he can to recapture the killer. Carpenter also composed the memorably minimalist music score. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

All-new episodes of \"Hot Dish With Franco\" air Saturdays on Food Network.During this series, \"Franco shares personal heartfelt stories of his Peruvian and Italian roots as he prepares delicious dishes with his signature flare for flavor,\" Food Network describes. \"From quick and easy weeknight meals to brunch and classic Latin dishes with a twist, all of Franco's food is easy, accessible and brings people together.\"Even before the show's premiere, Noriega's enthusiasm for the program was evident. \"Delicious food has always been central in my life as some of my favorite memories have been in the kitchen eating and cooking with my family and traveling across the world enjoying fantastic meals. Now, I'm thrilled to share my favorite recipes and lifelong passion for cooking with Food Network viewers,\" he recently shared.Throughout the series' six half-hour episodes, Food Network promises that \"Franco takes viewers on a culinary journey, sprinkling in tidbits of his Latin American and Italian background along with cooking tips and tricks,\" exploring everything from cheese-covered Arepas with Chorizo and Vegetable Ceviche to Crispy Parmesan Lemon Asparagus, Deconstructed Tiramisu and ooey-gooey Lava Chocolate Chip Cookies in previously aired episodes.During the season's fifth episode, chef Franco invites viewers to taste a Peruvian-inspired feast - what he dubs the perfect comfort food. \"Crispy and fluffy Baby Are-pas with melted cheese and chorizo are the perfect appetizer,\" the episode description promises, \"and there's nothing more comforting than juicy Pollo a la Brasa with crispy skin, smothered in a spicy green sauce. Papas Huancaina with a Spicy Cheese Sauce makes for the perfect side, especially when paired with a Pisco Sour.\"Finally, during the series' upcoming Season 1 finale, Franco tackles brunch, sharing his recipe for piled-high Avocado Toast before crafting an elevated take on Tex-Mex Huevos Rancheros, complete with fried tortilla strips then covered in homemade salsa, refried beans, crema and fried eggs.Bursting with flavor and Franco's signature flair, the Season 1 finale for \"Hot Dish With Franco\" airs Saturday, Nov. 4, on Food Network. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He also wants to honor Christmas, but others don't know how to separate the spirit of that occasion from the Halloween events they're used to, to the degree that a plot to kidnap Santa Claus is hatched.

Jessie Royce Landis, who played Grant's mother in Hitchcock's \"North by Northwest\" several years later, co-stars.\"The Beverly Hillbillies\"(MeTV, Tuesday, Oct. 31): The nostalgic channel marks Halloween with relatively eerie episodes of some classic series, but there's still room for laughs here in the appropriately titled story \"Trick or Treat.\" Jed (Buddy Ebsen), Granny (Irene Ryan) and the other Clampetts decide it's time to meet their neighbors in Beverly Hills but they choose Halloween to do that, resulting in encounters that are interesting, to say the least. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Tickets are $20 to $60.The Cirque Italia's Paranormal Cirque III has seductive, hypnotic, sultry acts not associated with the family circus that many onlookers might recall from their childhood. Children under 13 are not allowed and kids 13 to 17 must be accompanied by an adult.Roxana Midi, a native of Romania who will perform as an aerialist in the upcoming shows, is eager to display her talents in an event that the producers readily boast will feature a wide range of performances that circus goers would clearly not view as normal, including acts featuring exotic witches, gruesome ghouls, sexy witches and zombies.\"For me, they main reward comes from the applause that I receive from the audience after a performance,\" Midi said. \"It's hearing the crowd clap and cheer during the show and at the end that really makes all the hard work worthwhile. Paranormal Cirque is not like anything else that is associated with Cirque Italia. It's very dark, it's sensual and it takes people into a dream world.\" Developed by entrepreneur Manuel Rebecchi, the Paranormal Cirque III features the usual array of spectacles associated with the premier circuses in the world, including breathtaking visuals, first-class artists and the latest technological advances in theatrical productions.But it also focuses on the sultry and the terrifying and will not be suitable to younger audiences.\"We're excited to bring this unique and thrilling show to Waldorf,\" said Luisa Nelson, Cirque Italia's marketing and public relations manager in an interview with the Southern Maryland News. \"We've assembled an incredible cast of performers, and we can't wait to showcase their talent to our audiences. This show is perfect for anyone looking for a night of entertainment and scares.\" Midi, who has been performing with the Cirque Italia for eight years after previously honing her talents as a ballroom dancer, likened much of the show to dancing in the air, something that she will do while performing as an aerialist as \"The Dark Angel,\" a character seeking love and compassion.\"We have a lot of good dancers and some of them will be dressed as vampires and others as zombies,\" Midi said. \"Anyone who sees this show will be impressed with the dancing and displays of talent. It's like a burlesque show for acrobats. It's scary and creepy, but at the same time it is also very sexy.\" For more information or to purchase tickets, which cost $20-$60, go to paranormalcirque.com. \n \n Caption: For more information on the Paranormal Cirque check out https://www.paranormalcirque.com/\n \nPHOTOS COURTESY CIRQUE ITALIA/BOO MEDIA\n \nParanormal Cirque III has upcoming shows at Arundel Mills mall and St. Charles Towne Center \n \n Memo: 'It's very dark, it's sensual and it takes people into a dream world.' \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As widower and dad Steve Douglas, the star filmed all of his scenes for a season over the course of two months giving him the rest of the year to do whatever he wanted. That's why he's often seen on the screen by himself here, since other cast members would film their portions later.\"Family Affair\" (Catchy Comedy, Monday, Nov. 5, through Friday, Nov. 9): Executive producer Don Fedderson also was behind \"My Three Sons,\" and he gave this show's Brian Keith the same work arrangement that Fred MacMurray had on the other series - with all of his scenes as orphan-guarding \"Uncle Bill\" Davis compacted into two 30-day blocks for a season. Kathy Garver, Anissa Jones and Johnny Whitaker play Davis' young wards, with Sebastian Cabot as manservant Mr. French.\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (Turner Classic Movies, Friday, Nov. 10): One of the most emotionally grueling house parties ever is the basis of then-debuting director Mike Nichols' 1966 film of the Edward Albee play. Legendary showbiz spouses Eiizabeth Taylor (who won an Oscar here) and Richard Burton get a chance to shatter their glamorous images as an argumentative married couple who put their guests (George Segal and Sandy Dennis, the latter also doing Academy Award-winning work) through quite a wringer during the night they spend together. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Martin\n\n November 2, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: 10A | Section: News \n \n 267\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Q: I'm glad to see Jesse L. Martin back as a series star in \"The Irrational.\" I know he also was in \"Law & Order\" and \"The Flash,\" but has he done any other shows?A: Yes. After appearing on the ABC daytime serial \"One Life to Live\" early in his career, Martin landed a starring role in the short-lived \"413 Hope St.,\" a seriocomic Fox show about a crisis center. He stayed with Fox for a recurring part on \"Ally McBeal\" during its first two seasons, then NBC's \"Law & Order\" came his way, and he appeared in just under 200 episodes over eight years as Detective Ed Green.Martin had another recurring role in the NBC musical-drama series \"Smash\" during its second and final season, then his next long television run - lasting the better part of a decade - with his portrayal of Joe West on The CW's \"The Flash.\" Martin was cast in the \"Irrational\" before his \"Flash\" engagement ended, and he went from regular to recurring status on the superhero show so that he could begin work on \"The Irrational,\" on which he's also a producer.The fact that Martin started work early on \"The Irrational\" is a big reason the show was able to premiere as it normally would have at the start of the fall season, when so many other series were unable to start at the usual time because of the actors' and writers' strikes that prevented production from taking place. Enough \"Irrational\" episodes had been banked by the time the strikes began to enable the program to have the September start that it always was planned for. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Which streamer premieres a brand-new comedy film starring Awkwafina (\"Renfield,\" 2023) and Sandra Oh (\"Grey's Anatomy\") on Friday, Nov. 3? The answer is Hulu, and the film in question is \"Quiz Lady,\" a buddy comedy about two sisters who come together to win a quiz show and save a dog.Awkwafina is Anna, the reliable, type-A sister who is called away from her work as an accountant when her mom's senior living facility reaches out to let Anna know that they had lost her mom - but not to the afterlife.The attendant corrects herself in the trailer, telling Anna, \"Sorry, that was terrible phrasing. I meant we don't know where she is.\" After making it to the facility, Anna is joined by her estranged and distraught sister Jenny, portrayed by Oh, whose purple highlights, oversized sunglasses and flamboyant personal style contrast with Anna's head-to-toe grey wardrobe. Anna is clued in to her mother's whereabouts when a bookie informs her that her beloved pet pug, Mr. Linguini, has been kidnapped and is being held hostage over her mother's massive gambling debts.With the debts creeping up her back and seniors home infractions stacking up, Anna and Jenny's mom flees to Macau, leaving them to sort out what she owes and be reunited with Mr. Linguini. Anna's salary isn't quite generous enough to settle their mother's $80,000 tab, and Jenny's constant search for her latest passion hasn't resulted in financial stability. Two weeks is all they're given to cough up the funds.The siblings are at a loss for ways to get rich quick until Jenny sees Anna participate in her favorite game show, \"Can't Stop the Quiz,\" from her sofa. The show is must-watch television for Anna, who tunes in daily, usually accompanied by her canine companion, and effortlessly answers every single question correctly. Seeing Anna in her element turns on a light bulb over Jenny's head.It's decided, then, that the pair will travel to Los Angeles, get Anna on \"Can't Stop the Quiz,\" and all their problems will be solved when she wins. Leaving the safety of her routine life in Philadelphia behind, Anna joins Jenny on a wild road trip across the United States and embraces her sister's chaotic, adventurous way of life. Neither of them is completely certain that Anna's trivia skills will transfer from the comfort of her couch to the pressure of the game show's set, but this is the best chance they've got to scrape together enough money to bring Mr. Linguini home unharmed.Having spent years apart, estranged over their differences, Anna and Jenny have a lot of ground to cover - geographically and emotionally - on their road trip. Anna's strictly balanced life greatly differs from her sister Jenny's listless pursuit of purpose. They have things to learn from each other, whether it's how to let loose and go on an adventure or focus enough to successfully achieve a goal.\"The element that really attracted me was the sister dynamic,\" director Jessica Yu told Deadline at the world premiere of \"Quiz Lady\" at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. She added, \"For one thing, I just haven't seen a lot of comedies about sisters, and the fact that at the center of this was two Asian-American sisters, made me think, 'Oh, this will be really fun to explore.'\" \n \n Caption: Sandra Oh and Awkwafina in \"Quiz Lady\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Family members also contribute comments, as do Stallone colleagues and friends Arnold Schwarzenegger and Henry Winkler, and filmmaker Quentin Tarantino.Born in New York's Hell's Kitchen in 1946, Stallone made one of his first notable appearances as a subway-train hoodlum in Woody Allen's \"Bananas\" (1971), and he gained some attention in \"The Lords of Flatbush\" (1974) opposite Winkler and in \"Death Race 2000\" (1975). His breakthrough clearly was the original \"Rocky\" (1976), which he wrote and insisted on starring in himself, with the huge success of the saga of a struggling Philadelphia boxer winning its year's Oscar for best picture. It also yielded five direct sequels and inspired the \"Creed\" series, with \"First Blood\" (1982) giving Stallone another continuing character in famously rugged Vietnam veteran John Rambo.Stallone remained a box-office king for years afterward, with \"Cobra\" (1986), \"Tango & Cash\" (1989), \"Cliffhanger\" (1993), \"Demolition Man\" (1993), \"The Specialist\" (1994) and \"The Expendables\" (2010) among the bigger hits that sustained his career when such efforts as \"Oscar\" (1991) and \"Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot\" (1992) didn't register strongly by comparison.The star picked up critical acclaim for pictures including \"Cop Land\" (1997), and he became an Oscar nominee for reprising (and aging) the Rocky role in the first \"Creed\" movie (2015). \n \n Caption: Sylvester Stallone stars in \"Sly\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In 2018 they released their first full-length album, \"A Heart Never Knows.\" They now perform at many venues and festivals across the United States as well as in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Canada.Other band members include Trevor Holder on banjo, bassist Bobby Osborne Jr. and guitarist Conner Vlietstra.The next concert in the series will feature an all-Christmas program on Dec. 10 with the Becky Buller Band featuring Ned Luberecki. Other performances planned for early 2024 will be by Lonesome River Band on Jan. 14, The Grascals on Feb. 11, High Fidelity on March 3, Russell Moore & IIIrd Tyme Out will perform March 24 and Dave Peterson & 1946 will close out the series April 28.Tickets for The Price Sisters are $23 per person, free for ages 12 and younger with a paid adult.Doors open at noon and food and beverages will be available for purchase.For more information, call 301-737-3004 or go to www.somdbluegrass.com. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED PHOTO\n \nKentucky-based The Price Sisters will kick off the Southern Maryland Bluegrass Series with a concert on Nov. 5 at the Calvert Elks Lodge. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If only the honor were a low card, the contract would present no difficulty.Today's deal is an example.After North, via a transfer bid, showed a balanced hand with five hearts, South selected four hearts. He knew of an eight-card fit and, more importantly, the potential blockage in the heart suit might prove to be lethal to three no-trump. Here, though, three no-trump was laydown, and four hearts needed careful handling. It is impossible to bid perfectly on every deal without seeing all of the cards.West, with an unappealing lead, selected a trump.Declarer won in hand, played a diamond to dummy's ace and finessed the club queen.West won with the king and played his second heart.Declarer continued with the diamond king and another diamond, but East won and led a third round of hearts.Now South had to go down one, losing one spade, two diamonds and one club.The club queen was a red herring. If declarer immediately plays the club ace and queen, he cannot go down. West wins and leads a trump, but declarer crosses to dummy with a diamond to the ace and ruffs the club seven in hand for his 10th trick.If a ruff can be taken in the short-trump hand, even if that is the declarer's, it is almost certain to be the right play. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Out of this world TV: Season 4 of 'For All Mankind' enters new millennium\n\n November 9, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dana Simpson | Page: A9 | Section: News \n \n 425\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Whether it takes \"one small step\" or \"one giant leap\" to get to your couch, do it \"For All Mankind.\" The hit Apple TV+ television series \"For All Mankind\" is back for a fourth season Friday, Nov. 10, after taking a yearand-a-half-long hiatus. With one Primetime Emmy win under its belt already, the sci-fidrama's newest season is comprised of another 10 episodes, thus bringing the total episode count for the series to a whopping 40.The series first made (gravitational?) waves when it premiered on its home streamer in 2019. Marketed as an alternate version of 1969, in which \"the Soviet Union beats the United States to the moon\" (per IMDb), the series reimagines history and speculates how this one change in events could have sparked a whole new world order. Largely focused on the political and scientific ramifications of the then-U.S.S.R. making history on the moon, \"For All Mankind\" Season 1 leaned into the idea of a space race that \"continues on for decades with still grander challenges and goals.\" With the premiere of Season 2 in February 2021, the astronauts faced an all-new set of challenges that took place more than a decade after the moon landing. Having confronted everything from lunar ice and trespassers to gender debates in Season 1, the next two seasons promised higher stakes and bigger problems. And on this promise it surely delivered.From natural disasters such as solar storms and generally harsh living conditions to personal qualms ranging from reckless and selfish behavior to ego-based contests and grand political motivations, there has never been a dull moment on the screen - or in the lives of \"For All Mankind's\" fictionalized astronauts and their families.One of these astronauts is Edward Baldwin, played by \"The Killing's\" Joel Kinnaman. The head of the Baldwin family, which has seen some serious struggles throughout the show's three seasons to date, Ed is one of NASA's best astronauts and is rumored to have been based upon real-life Apollo 10 commander Thomas P. Stafford.While Ed has been supported by several family members over the years, including Karen (Shantel VanSanten, \"Shooter\"), Kelly (Cynthy Wu, \"Holidate,\" 2020) and Shane (played by brothers Teddy and Tait Blum, \"Big Little Lies\" and \"Shooter,\" respectively), the only confirmed Baldwin returning (other than Ed) is Kelly.Joining Ed in space and on Earth are returning characters Ellen Wilson (Jodi Balfour, \"Quarry\"), Margo Madison (Wrenn Schmidt, \"Nope,\" 2022), Danielle Poole (Krys Marshall, \"Supergirl\"), Helios Aerospace founder Dev Ayesa (Edi Gathegi, \"The Blacklist\") and Aleida Rosales (Coral Peña, \"The Post,\" 2017). \n \n Caption: Wrenn Schmidt in \"For All Mankind\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This year, the U.S. is entering 24-year-old Noelia Voigt of Park City, Utah.The program features events that will eventually select a winner, a process including personal statements, interviews, evening gowns and swimwear.The winner takes office immediately after coronation, becoming an ambassador for a year, spreading the organization's positive message and humanitarian works, including fighting for women's ethnic minority rights, racial issues, public health issues and environmental issues.Winners also receive a cash allowance and other perks, such as scholarships, modeling opportunities, beauty products, clothes, styling, fitness services and more.The organization claims: \"Miss Universe Organization exists to advocate for a future forged by women - women with the courage to push the limits of what's possible, who are curious enough to make world-shaking discoveries and audacious enough to do this over and over. We believe that the future of humanity rests on reaching gender equity around the world.\" The \"72nd Miss Universe\" pageant airs live, Saturday, Nov. 18, on the Roku Channel. \n \n Caption: R'Bonney Gabriel, Miss Universe 71 \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Christopher Meloni's portrayal of relentless justice pursuer Elliot Stabler always has been distinctive, and the nine stories offered here reaffirm that fact.\"Walker, Texas Ranger\" (getTV, Sunday, Nov. 12): The adventure's eighth and next-to-last season ended with the two-part episode \"Wedding Bells\" (shown in its entirety here), which finally sends longtime flames Walker and Alex (Chuck Norris, Sheree J. Wilson) toward the altar. Expectedly, some enemies are determined not to let the couple live happily ever after. Notable among the guest stars are Tom Bosley (\"Happy Days\"), entrepreneur Mark Cuban and rock musician Joan Jett.\"A Few Good Men\" (AMC, Monday, Nov. 13): \"You can't handle the truth!\" Or maybe you can, especially if you're familiar with Aaron Sorkin's play or director Rob Reiner's 1992 movie version about two soldiers (Wolfgang Bodison, James Marshall) on trial for the alleged \"Code Red\" hazing of one of their peers - supposedly on the orders of their stern commander (a great Jack Nicholson).Tom Cruise, Demi Moore and Kevin Pollak play the defendants' military lawyers. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

What's his next project going to be?A: His next project is going to be taking it easy, and enjoying being a granddad.The legendary English actor told the BBC last month that, at 90 years old, he's now officially retired.He said so while doing press for what will now be his last movie, \"The Great Escaper,\" a biographical drama about a war veteran who escapes his retirement home to attend the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in France. It was released in early October.It's been well received so far, and Caine said he's unlikely to get another leading-man role again at his age. \"The only parts I'm likely to get now are old men, 90-year-old men, maybe 85. And I thought, 'Well, I might as well leave with all this - I've got wonderful reviews. What have I got to do to beat this?'\" It caps off an incredible career that launched with small parts in war movies in the mid-1950s. But he really got on the map in the mid-'60s with young, heartthrob roles in hits like \"The Ipcress File\" (1965) and \"Alfie\" (1966).He kept up an incredible work rate even into his 80s, appearing, for example, in three different films in 2020 alone (the fantasy drama \"Come Away,\" the kid-friendly comedy \"Four Kids and It\" and the smash-hit sci-fithriller \"Tenet\").But he told People magazine a little while ago that becoming a grandfather changed his view of life and ultimately overshadowed his career. \"I am completely besotted by my grandchildren. It's my best role, and I don't need any awards for it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

FX shows the film Saturday, Nov. 17, and even with editing done for basic cable, it remains one of the most tense and troubling sci-fimovies made to date. Its realistic, understated approach in the early going has the effect of softening up the audience for what's to come.Ripley is one member of a deep-space crew that investigates a distress signal and picks up a highly unwelcome visitor the title creature, which grows into something larger and increasingly lethal as it runs amok within the vessel named Nostromo after making quite an explosive entrance. (Anyone familiar with one co-star's big exit scene will know what we're talking about.)Tom Skerritt, Yaphet Kotto, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton and Veronica Cartwright comprise the rest of the cast. \n \n Caption: Sigourney Weaver in \"Alien\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He famously appeared with his former fellow stars in the 2021 streaming special \"Friends: The Reunion,\" which still can be found on Max, and it's quite touching to watch the embraces and memories shared by him and the other five actors with whom he shared so much time - and success - over the decade-long run of that much-repeated show (which was seen originally on NBC).LeBlanc also was part of a 2021 \"Top Gear\" special that paid tribute to the late race driver Sabine Schmitz, who appeared often on that BBC series. LeBlanc's presence on that special acknowledged his own presence on \"Top Gear\" as a presenter on episodes that were spread over four seasons, after his participation as a guest. He was required to be in England to make the show, and he ultimately decided to leave that job and remain largely in the U.S.It's not new for LeBlanc to take extended breaks from television work.He also did that after the NBC run of the \"Friends\" spinoff \"Joey,\" and what was planned as one year off became five, with the actor eventually returning (and playing a variation of himself) in the Showtime comedy series \"Episodes.\" He won a Golden Globe Award for that show, then he spent four seasons on \"Man With a Plan.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

From Amazon Studios and ITV America's ITV Entertainment comes a new dating reality series - a social experiment unlike any other, delving into the dating world of identicals. The Amazon Freevee series \"Twin Love\" premieres Friday, Nov. 17, on Prime Video.The series, hosted by professional wrestling duo Brie and Nikki Garcia (\"WWE Smackdown!\"), formerly the Bella Twins, welcomes a cast full of doubles. Amazon Prime describes: \"Ten sets of twins will be split up and placed into two houses of 'identical' casts, where they'll begin a unique and compelling search for love. With double the fun and drama, the series will discover if their inherent similarities extend to their romantic desires.\" \"When separated from their twin brothers and sisters - some for the first time ever - will they pursue the same identical partners?\" Amazon asks. \"Or will their choices be dramatically different?\" There's only one way to find out.During this inaugural season, twins include: Whittnay and Brittnay James, who have both been single for over four years; Sabella and Hanna Radostitz, with matching tattoos for former boyfriends they now regret; Cameron and Ceara McKegney, a pair of opposites who still share in their quick-witted and entertaining personalities; Zoie and Baelee Bogart, twin sisters who have never been apart for more than a day; Morgan and Madison Ramsey, two self-proclaimed tomboys who mind their manners; Seth and Luke Banks, the chatterbox brothers, both golfers from a big family; Jair and Micquel Bernier, two confident and popular, party-going jocks; Matthew and Andrew Beatty, who have lived all over the world, making friends globally with their outgoing personalities; Samir and Samer Akel, twins born in Syria who moved to the United States 10 years ago, now successful restaurateurs; and David and Aaron Cabello, both high school dropouts who started their own business that quickly spread across America.From executive producers Simon Thomas (\"Love Island\"), Bernie Schaeffer (\"Edge of Alaska\"), Kenny Rosen (\"Hell's Kitchen\") and Jessica Nahmias (\"The Marriage Pact\"), \"Twin Love\" premieres Friday, Nov. 17, on Prime Video. \n \n Caption: Brie and Nikki Garcia (middle) with the cast of \"Twin Love\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Packed with holiday cheer and tasty treats, an all-new season of \"Christmas Cookie Challenge\" is now airing on the network.Hosted by former NFLplayer, current \"Food Network Star\" (Season 11), food truck owner and private chef Eddie Jackson, alongside writer, photographer, cookie-making mom and experienced cooking show host, Ree Drummond (\"The Pioneer Woman\"), this series follows as \"confident and daring bakers compete to prove their holiday cookie-making skills,\" Food Network describes, promising that as four new bakers are introduced each episode, \"tough-love judges are on hand to crown the holiday cookie master, [each of whom] will go home with a $10,000 prize!\" From gingerbread to snickerdoodles to swirly-twirly gumdrops, the series whips up cheer and inspires bakers back at home. The competing cookie makers are tasked with fun challenges, like crafting usable gingerbread puppet theaters, decorating snickerdoodles and even paying homage to classic Christmas films such as \"Elf\" (2003), starring Will Ferrell.\"Four of the finest cookie makers around get inspired by 'the seven levels of the candy cane forest' and 'the sea of swirly-twirly gumdrops,'\" Food Network explains, \"[creating] cookies that show the parts of Buddy's journey not featured in the movie. When it's over, one 'cotton-headed ninny muggin' will be sent home for the holidays, while the one who decorates the most fantastical journey will win an advantage for the next round.\" \"Their magical displays will have to incorporate ingredients from Buddy the Elf's favorite meal: maple syrup, chocolate syrup, candy-coated chocolates, chocolate breakfast pastries or cooked spaghetti,\" they say, encouraging some interesting flavors.This current season will also feature an all-star episode, set to air Thursday, Nov. 16, on the network.During this \"Champions\" episode, Jackson and Drummond welcome eight former \"Christmas Cookie Challenge\" champions back to the kitchen, asking them to prove who is the best of the best.\"This time, the cookie makers are facing challenges so merrily massive that they'll be put into teams of two.First, the bakers must weave magic as they create Christmas cookie quilts.One team will have the rug pulled out from under them as they're eliminated.Then, the three remaining teams construct gigantic stadiums worthy of the finest North Pole games that also incorporate ingredients perfect for watching a snow bowl: eggnog, hot chocolate, apple cider or mulled wine\" (per Food Network).Keep the holidays extra sweet with \"Christmas Cookie Challenge,\" airing new episodes Thursdays on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Ree Drummond and Eddie Jackson from \"Christmas Cookie Challenge\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You might be surprised by some of the opening leads they find. For example, they would do a lot better if they always led fourth-highest from their longest and strongest against no-trump (not a minor-suit singleton, which I have seen a few times).In today's deal, though, the robot found a terrific opening lead. West dealt and passed. South opened one spade in fourth position, North responded one notrump, and South rebid two spades, ending the auction. What would you lead as West?South's rebid showed a minimum opening with at least six spades. No one else felt called on to compete. However, if East is psychic, he can make three no-trump! Against two spades, it looks obvious to lead the heart ace. That isn't fatal, but suppose West shifts to the diamond queen. Declarer wins with dummy's ace and plays its trump. Now at double dummy (you can see all of the cards), East must play his spade queen!At my table, though, West made life much easier for his side. The robot led the club six. East ruffed with the spade seven and returned a heart. West took that trick and delivered a second club ruff. West got back in with the heart ace and gave his partner a third club ruff.That was a quick five tricks for East-West, but where was the sixth defensive trick?Right -- West's spade 10, hiding behind the king-jack, was guaranteed to take the setting trick. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Even today she influences modern chefs to achieve greatness and push themselves to be their best,\" Food Network recently shared. \"In this competition, four Julia Child fans compete in a preliminary battle with baskets inspired by Julia's recipes.\" Keeping to the same format as usual \"Chopped\" seasons, this \"Child-ish\" competition features three rounds, in which four chefs must use random and often unusual \"mystery basket ingredients\" to complete a tasty dish. Each round, one chef is eliminated until only two remain, together facing the judges in the final dessert round, where one is finally crowned the winner.This - \"Chopped's\" 55th season - will feature a panel of rotating judges, said to include the likes of Scott Conant (chef, host of \"24 Hour Restaurant Battle\"), Susan Feniger (\"Too Hot Tamales\"), Amanda Freitag (\"Iron Chef America\"), Alex Guarnaschelli (\"Ciao House\"), Nilou Motamed (\"Top Chef\"), Michael Voltaggio (\"Bobby's Triple Threat\") and Isabella Rossellini (who stars in \"Julia,\" premiering its second season two days later on Max). Each episode will also see the arrival of four new chefs, with each winner moving on to the tournament's finale, where the final four will fight for a grand prize of $25,000 and a Julia Childthemed dream trip to France.Upcoming episodes of the series feature bright and bold flavors - some Julia herself would never approve of - as the series' second episode promises that \"citrus and a salad are part of the puzzle in the appetizer round, and the three chefs who make it to the entrée round must make use of some unusual powder and fancy mushrooms,\" while a description for the third episode shares that: \"The chefs get an unusual piece of chicken and a potato product that would have made Julia cringe.\" However, in a season featuring fish stew, veal, processed cheese and more, host Ted Allen learns that the stinkiest thing of all might just be his cohorts' Julia Child impressions.As the chefs continue their journeys to France - and practice their accents - \"Chopped: Julia Child's Kitchen\" premieres an allnew episode, Tuesday, Nov. 21, on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Ted Allen from \"Chopped: Julia Child's Kitchen\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Compounding that challenge is the strike that Archie's union calls, something he tries to keep from Edith (Jean Stapleton), unaware that she already knows about it.\"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\" (MeTV, Sunday, Nov. 19): The animated specials based on Charles M. Schulz's perpetually popular comic strip \"Peanuts\" proved so popular, their makers decided to go the big-screen route with them as well, making this the first of the franchise's several feature films. The 1969 release finds hapless Charlie Brown (voiced by Peter Robbins, reprising the job he'd had since \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\") a contestant in the National Spelling Bee.\"Runaway Train\" (MGM+ Hits, Wednesday, Nov. 22): Jon Voight gives an uncompromisingly gritty performance in director Andrei Konchalovsky's terrific 1985 thriller, which builds mightily upon the supposedly simple premise promised by the title. Voight and Eric Roberts (both Oscar-nominated here) play escaped convicts who hop aboard a locomotive, expecting a ride to freedom - but when circumstances send it out of control, they end up hurtling toward what could be their fate instead. Rebecca De Mornay also gets dirty, quite literally, as a railroad worker also trapped aboard the train. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Their discovery of an enormous family secret seems destined to unite all the parties or drive them farther apart but since this is Hallmark Channel, take a guess at which outcome prevails. The script is by \"Dateline NBC\" correspondent Andrea Canning, who has written a number of movies for both Hallmark Channel and Lifetime, and author Audrey Schulman (\"The Dolphin House\").Both Chabert and Wolf are familiar with the Hallmark brand of holiday tales, since both stars also have done them in the past. Wolf starred with Kristin Chenoweth in the 2019 film \"A Christmas Love Story,\" and Chabert is unquestionably one of the queens of such projects, having made at least one annually for a number of years.Among her seasonal Hallmark stories have been \"A Royal Christmas\" (2014), \"A Christmas Melody\" (2015), \"A Wish for Christmas\" (2016), \"The Sweetest Christmas\" (2017), \"Pride, Prejudice and Mistletoe\" (2018), \"Christmas in Rome\" (2019), \"Christmas Waltz\" (2020), \"Christmas at Castle Hart\" (2021) and \"Haul Out the Holly\" (2022).

Which were the first and last ones he madeftA: The first was \"Love Me Tender\" (1956), which actually was renamed from the original \"The Reno Brothers\" to coordinate with the title song, a giant hit for Presley that he performed in the film. He played one of the Reno siblings during the Civil War, youngest brother Clint, who tended to the homefront while his brothers fought in the battle. Top-billed Richard Egan portrayed the oldest brother, while the role of another Reno was filled by James Drury, later to become \"The Virginian\" on weekly TV.Presley's final film as an actor was \"Change of Habit\" (1969), casting him as an inner-city doctor who became enamored of a colleague - unaware that she was a nun working incognito.The picture's leading lady was Mary Tyler Moore, in the last movie she made under a contract with Universal Pictures.Interestingly, another co-star (as a cop) was Edward Asner, a year before he and Moore began their legendary TV work together on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" he also had worked earlier with Presley in \"Kid Galahad\" (1962).If it's Presley's last movie overall that you're looking for, though, that would be the concert attraction \"Elvis on Tour\" (1972) - which earned its year's Golden Globe Award for best documentary film.Hampton Roads and Richmond in Virginia were among the stops featured, as were Jacksonville, Fla., and San Antonio, Texas. After that, what turned out to be the superstar's career-concluding performances were in a couple of TV specials, \"Elvis: Aloha From Hawaii\" (1973) and \"Elvis in Concert\" (1977). \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And while the cast and crew of \"Fargo\" had long since finished filming by the time Calgary received its most recent unseasonable dumping of snow, TV audiences are just now about to witness the magic (and crime - lots of crime) for themselves. Season 5 of \"Fargo\" begins Tuesday, Nov. 21, with back-to-back episodes on FX. Episodes are available to stream the following day on Hulu.Despite filming in Canada, the current season of the series created by Noah Hawley (\"Legion\") is set primarily in North Dakota (as indicated by its title). Expected to run for 10 episodes, \"Fargo's\" fifth season is set in 2019, making it the series' most recent timeframe to date. (For those interested, seasons 1 through 4 take place in 2006, 1979, 2010 and 1950, respectively.)Those unfamiliar with \"Fargo\" may not know that the critically acclaimed series is based on the 1996 film of the same name by the Coen Brothers (\"Blood Simple,\" 1984), which starred William H. Macy (\"Shameless\") and Steve Buscemi (\"Boardwalk Empire\") alongside Frances McDormand (\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\" 2017) in her Academy Award-winning role as police officer Marge Gunderson. Like the film, FX's \"Fargo\" is a black comedy, but rather than follow the same storyline as the film, the series opted to present its content as an anthology, jumping through timelines and to various locations in order to tell a series of related tales, each as unsettling - yet somehow inviting - as the next.Season 5 stars Juno Temple (\"Ted Lasso\") as Dorothy (Dot) Lyon, a Minnesota-based housewife who appears to lead a normal, happy lifestyle. But, when Dot ends up getting into trouble with the local authorities, her past comes back to haunt her - a past that is much more sinister than anyone would have expected from this average midwestern woman. As she tries to sort out the best course of action, Dot is pursued by North Dakota Sheriff Roy Tillman (Jon Hamm, \"Mad Men\"), Deputy Witt Farr (Lamorne Morris, \"New Girl\") and a mysterious man named Ole Munch (Sam Spruell, \"The Martian,\" 2015).Jennifer Jason Leigh (\"The Woman in the Window,\" 2021) joins the main cast as Dot's well-off mother-in-law, while \"Stranger Things'\" Joe Keery and \"Never Have I Ever's\" Richa Moorjani step into the roles of the sheriff's son, Gator Tillman, and Deputy Indira Olmstead, respectively.Meanwhile, David Rysdahl (\"Oppenheimer,\" 2023), Jessica Pohly (\"Stalker\"), Nick Gomez (\"She-Hulk: Attorney at Law\"), Lukas Gage (\"The White Lotus\") and Dave Foley (\"The Kids in the Hall\") star in recurring roles throughout the newest season. \n \n Caption: Jennifer Jason Leigh in \"Fargo\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So, after winning the first trick with his spade king, South led a diamond and finessed dummy's 10.East won with the queen and returned a spade to South's ace. Declarer led a second diamond, capturing West's king with dummy's ace. A moment later South was claiming 10 tricks: two spades, one heart, four diamonds and three clubs.\"Why didn't you play the diamond king at trick two?\" asked East.\"Because my textbook says second hand low,\" replied West.\"Yes, that is right most of the time,\" observed East.\"However, here, with South trying to establish dummy's suit, you must disobey the rule.

When holding 10 or more points and good trump support, North would have responded with a conventional two notrump.South, with only six losers, took a shot at game.West led the heart king.When the dummy appeared, South saw that the layout was ideal for a crossruff. To lay the foundation, after winning with the heart ace, declarer immediately conceded a diamond trick.The defenders did the best they could, cashing two heart tricks before switching to a trump, but it was to no avail.South won in the dummy, ruffed a diamond in hand, cashed the club ace and crossruffed home.If the declarer is planning a crossruff, clearly the defenders should lead as many rounds of trumps as possible. Suppose West leads a trump at trick one here.Can the contract still be madeftNot against best defense.South wins the first trick in the dummy and calls for a low diamond, but East steps in with the king and leads a second trump.Although it didn't apply in this deal, watch out for one other technique when planning a crossruff. You should cash all of your sidesuit tricks first. If you don't, an opponent might ruff one of those winners late in the play. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But is it possible to send a boy to do a woman's job? Of course it is!The bidding in today's deal was impressive, if slightly complex. South's two hearts was a transfer bid. When South continued with three diamonds, his second suit, North bid three hearts to show length and strength in that suit. After South rebid his six-card suit, North control-bid the heart ace.Finally, when South showed his first-round club control, North used the Grand Slam Force, asking partner to bid seven diamonds with two of the top three trump honors.South ruffed the club-king lead and cashed the diamond ace, getting the bad news.Now it was a matter of establishing his spades, in case they were dividing 4-2, and without losing trump control. Declarer unblocked dummy's top spades, ruffed a club to get back to hand and led the spade six. When West discarded, South wondered if it was safe to ruff with the boy: dummy's diamond six. But if he had, he would have fallen to defeat. After cashing dummy's diamond queen, South would have had to ruff a club to return to hand, leaving himself with only one trump to East's two.Instead, South ruffed the third spade with dummy's diamond queen. Then he led a low trump to his nine, drew the remaining trumps and claimed.Not bad to bid and make a grand slam with only a combined 26 high-card points.

Where did she get her start?A: The British Columbia native started out studying dancing as her principal path in show business, but her main attention shifted to acting when she was accepted at Toronto's Randolph Academy. She began doing guest roles on such series as \"Murdoch Mysteries\" and \"Star Trek: Discovery,\" then continued with appearances on shows including \"When Calls the Heart\" and \"The Bold Type.\" Around the time of the later guest shots, Kohan also started getting prominent parts in cable movies on the order of \"The Black Widow Killer\" (2018) and \"Love on Harbor Island\" (2020). The fact that those have been repeated often didn't hurt her chances to land the lead in \"Sullivan's Crossing,\" Among other movies that have featured Kohan are \"A Romance Wedding\" (2021) and \"A Whirlwind Wedding\" (2021), and she also was seen on the shows \"Batwoman,\" \"Transplant\" and \"When Hope Calls.\" Inspired by novels by Robyn Carr, \"Sullivan's Crossing\" (which already has been renewed for a second season) originated on Canada's CTV network, and its inclusion of two veterans of The CW in its regular cast - Chad Michael Murray (\"One Tree Hill\") and Scott Patterson (\"Gilmore Girls\") - likely got the latter outlet interested in picking up the series for the American market, especially when production delays linked to the entertainment-industry strikes made finding product from other sources a necessity. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

First, the 91st \"Christmas in Rockefeller Center\" will maintain the yearly tradition of the lighting of the giant tree in midtown Manhattan, though that obviously wasn't broadcast in its early years (it started as a local offering for the New York market before the full NBC network began showing it). Then, the first \"Christmas at Graceland\" special will showcase the Memphis, Tenn., estate that famously was the home of entertainment legend Elvis Presley.Kelly Clarkson (who's now doing her syndicated weekday talk show from \"30 Rock\") will host and perform on \"Christmas in Rockefeller Center,\" and it's a given that Radio City Music Hall's famed Rockettes will show their high-kicking stuff, while various other music stars - including icons Cher and Barry Manilow - put their own spins on famed yuletide songs.Members of NBC's \"Today\" broadcast team typically are featured on the special, and Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb, Al Roker and Craig Melvin are expected to be on hand for the two-hour show's ultimate highlight: the flipping of the switch that illuminates the giant holiday tree (which comes from Vestal, N.Y., this time) that's a \"must\" destination for countless tourists during the season. After that, the tree will be lit daily until Jan. 13.Actress Riley Keough (\"The Girlfriend Experience\"), one of' Elvis' granddaughters and now the sole owner of Graceland - following the passing of her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, last January - is among the executive producers of \"Christmas at Graceland.\" Its lineup of performers also hadn't been confirmed at press time, but it's certain that the song list will include tunes associated with Elvis, \"Blue Christmas\" surely being among them. In fact, \"Elvis' Christmas Album\" and \"Elvis Sings The Wonderful World of Christmas\" were among his musical releases, so there are a good number of seasonal numbers that he lent his touch to.\"Christmas at Graceland\" is being staged with Elvis in mind, and don't be surprised if it integrates clips from a famous telecast that he did himself: his so-called 1968 \"Comeback Special,\" which aired in December of that year. That program had been intended as a Christmas attraction, but it ultimately was broadened out to cover the full scope of Presley's music career. However, it did include \"Blue Christmas,\" and that would seem like a prime clip to be excerpted by \"Christmas at Graceland.\" \n \n Caption: Kelly Clarkson is hosting NBC's annual \"Christmas in Rockefeller Center\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Originally televised in 1962, this variation of the tale casts the famously near-sighted Magoo (voiced by Jim Backus, of \"Gilligan's Island\" fame) as legendary miser Ebenezer Scrooge and to its credit, the script stays pretty faithful to the Dickens original while also allowing Scrooge to adopt Magoo's quirks.Morey Amsterdam and Jack Cassidy also are in the voice cast. and the original songs are by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill, whose Broadway credits included \"Funny Girl.\" Be forewarned that despite Magoo's amusing demeanor, some of the moments here give heartstrings a forceful yank; we point specifically to Tiny Tim (voice of Joan Gardner) singing \"Alone in the World,\" which it might help to make an advance buyout of a whole tissue factory for. \n \n Caption: A still from \"Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They are up from the depths of the pandemic and 26% from 2022.With about six weeks to go in the year, 2023 box offices and ticket sales are off 28% from pre-COVID business in 2019.Three women operating smaller movie theater businesses in Montana face very similar challenges and have very similar resilient love and passion for their tiny slice of \"show business.\"A LABOR OF LOVESue and Larry Schilling bought the Choteau Roxy Theatre in 1988.The theater is in Choteau, Montana, just under an hour's drive from the next closest cineplex in Great Falls, and 90 minutes from the Canadian border.The Roxy was built in 1945 and first opened in 1946 with its first show on July 4. The Schillings added a stage several years ago to host other performances.\"We've had several plays and several live performances,\" said Susan Schilling.She said that has included local musical performances and events for community groups and nonprofits.The husband and wife team added digital projection equipment and new surround sound systems in 2013 and 2014.FAMILY FRIENDLYSchilling said the theater shows top 10 movies on their first runs just like its larger cohorts. She said the theater operates in a small town activities and sports kind of dig into (movie) attendance,\" she said.CHANGING EXPECTATIONSSmaller theaters also have less space and ability to expand concessions, restrooms and other amenities seen at larger cineplexes in the suburbs and urban areas with as many 24 screens, multiple concession stands, party rooms and ample restrooms.The Roxy has a small lobby and \"only two bathrooms\", Schilling said. She said the movie going experience and moviegoers expectations have changed.\"It wasn't about the experience, about eating popcorn,\" she said.But now, theaters face competition from other entertainment options as well as watching movies at home on big screen televisions and on streaming services.There are significantly more sports, especially football, on multiple days, competing for eyeballs.\"It's got to be better than sitting in their living room,\" Schilling said.This summer's slate of movies led by \"Barbie\", \"Oppenheimer\" and the latest installment in Tom Cruise's \"Mission Impossible\" franchise helped propel a strong movie season.\"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" had worldwide box offices of $1.45 billion and $949 million, respectively, while \"The Super Mario Bros. Movies\" brought home $1.36 billion, according to IMDB, which tracks the movies industry.\"We built our own Barbie Box. We kind of hyped it up,\" Schilling said. \"People want a good experience.\" The \"Barbenheimer\" summer phenomena helped remind people of the joys of going to the movies after the shutdowns of the coronavirus pandemic and waves of superhero franchise movies turned off some moviegoers.\"They had a different attitude when they walked in the door. People are really happy to be here,\" Schilling said.Movie chains and smaller operators have also had to grapple with four-decade highs with inflation after all the monetary and fiscal infusions undertaken in the U.S. and worldwide during the COVID pandemic.Many U.S. households are still feeling the pinch of high grocery prices, housing costs, car payments and health care outlays along with higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve aimed at lowering inflation.In Choteau, the Roxy's ticket prices are $8 for adults, $6.50 for kids and seniors with $7 for large popcorn.\"We stay very economical,\" Schilling said.TIME TO SELLThe 35 years owning the Montana theater has been a labor love but the Schillings, who had full-time jobs while operating the Roxy.But now the couple wants to spend more time with their grandchildren who don't live close by.\"We have grandchildren we want to go spend time with,\" Schilling said.The couple has listed the 4,800-square-foot theater for sale with an asking price of $284,000.Phyllis Bechtold, a local realtor and owner of Buy N Sell Montana, said property, with its vintage look and signage, is also an important part of the small town community.Schilling agrees.\"People are very appreciative that we are still operational,\" she said.BY THE NUMBERSMovie theaters and cineplexes employ 155,000 workers nationally, according to a March 2023 report by the Cinema Foundation.There were 38,474 indoor movie screens operating in the U.S. at the end of 2022, according to the National Association of Theater Owners. That's 5% fewer than 2019 before COVID.More than 48% of those screens are operated by the three largest cineplex chains - Kansas-based AMC Entertainment Inc., Knoxville, Tennessee-based Regal Cinemas and Dallas-based Cinemark USA Inc., according to the theater owners' group.But there are also plenty of smaller and regional operators across the country.NEW REVENUE STREAMSBecky Dupuis is a principal with Polson Theatres - a smaller chain with screen and properties in Montana and Idaho.Dupuis and Candis Harrop, CFO of the regional operator, said they have started renting out theaters more for special events - including gaming, birthday parties, baby and wedding showers - to generate more revenue.Parties, showers and other private gatherings include a private showing of movies.\"We've seen a big increase in people interested in private showings,\" Dupuis said.She said private showing interest started during and right after the pandemic but has continued. \"It kind of surprised us,\" Dupuis said.\"We just had a 50th birthday party.\" They said they charge $200 for the first hour and $50 for each additional hour or a flat $150 to $250 rate depending on the time of the event. Harrop said the trend has made the Montana chain think about other revenue generating options and how some people forgot the enjoyment and American cultural experience of 'going to the movies.' \"It's been kind of eye opening for us,\" she said, of the private showings and special events. \"Those kinds of things have really helped.\" Other theaters across the country have also looked to private events - including ones hosted by businesses and nonprofits - and special showings of concerts, operas, old movies and pay-per-view MMA and other fights.But Dupuis and Harrop said theaters, especially smaller ones with limited screens, waivers from movie studios and distribution networks if they supplant films already running at their properties.That's why special showings or private events are often in the mornings before regular movie times.Polson Theatres has 22 screens in 8 locations in Montana and Idaho, including theaters that first opened in 1914 and 1911. They are located in small, rural towns such as Dillon, Havre, Wolf Point and Lewistown, Montana and Salmon, Idaho.They have populations ranging from 2,600 to 6,000 people.\"Most of our theaters are twins,\" Dupuis said of the scheduling challenges that can arise from trying to book events and still abiding by studios' contracts with cinemas.'BIG CONCERN'While the writers' and actors' strikes have been settled with studios, the work stoppages are poised to offer some short-term challenges to theaters next year.Some movies have had their release dates moved forward because of the labor disputes - including the next installments of \"Dune\" and \"Mission Impossible.\" \"It's a big concern,\" Harrop said.Theaters have already seen the exponential growth of streaming services such as Netflix, Disney/Hulu, Apple TV and Amazon take movie and other productions from traditional venues.Movie theater operators - especially in small towns - have also seen their lineup of films dominated by superhero franchises. Those might appeal to younger demographics and families but not necessarily older audiences.\"We have a very large older population,\" Dupuis said.Though the Montana movie theater operators see potential in Christian and other faith-based films pointing to the success of \"Sound of Freedom\" earlier this year.Other theaters in states with larger Indian and South Asian populations have also shown 'Bollywood' films' to attract other office segments.'THAT's NOT NICE'Like other theaters - large and small, the Polson chain has felt consumer pressure to offer more food and drink options.\"We've never done anything but candy and popcorn,\" Dupuis said.But now they are offering Italian sodas, nachos and pretzels. That's still a way from the bigger national chains who offer sandwiches, pizzas, burgers and alcoholic beverages.Movie tickets at the Polson theaters are $9.25 for regular showings, $6.25 for matinees and $5 on Tuesdays.Keeping prices down for consumers is key with inflation coming off 40-year highs and many Americans living 'paycheck-to-paycheck' with high costs for housing, health care and car payments.\"We don't want to raise our prices,\" Dupuis said.But she also said theaters are getting hit hard with higher costs - especially for repairs and replacing equipment as well as the costs of doing any kind of upgrades to their properties.\"It's killing us,\" she said, pointing to some technology-related repairs and upgrades that are 30% higher than pre-COVID inflation wave levels.\"That's not nice,\" Dupuis said.'HERE TO STAY'Despite all the changes, the three Montana women at the two movie theater operations are optimistic the American cultural experience of 'going to the movies' won't disappear even with younger demographics glued to their phones.\"The movie theater industry has gone through a lot of ups and downs - but it has never shut down,\" Harrop said. \"We made it through COVID. People love the movies and they can't replicate the popcorn. I think it's here to stay.\" \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED PHOTO\n \nThe Choteau Roxy Theatre is located in a small town in Montana.

How should South weather the storm brewing in four hearts against the lead of the spade queen?When the dummy appeared, South saw that he could afford two trump losers, but not three. After winning trick one in hand with the spade king and cashing the heart ace, he could continue with a low heart or with the heart jack (or 10).Either would work if the suit was dividing 3-3, but if the opposing hearts were 4-2, declarer realized that he had to find either East or West with honordoubleton.So, at trick three, declarer continued with a low heart. When West had to win with the king, declarer smiled inwardly to himself.South won West's spade continuation in the dummy, cashed the diamond ace, ruffed a diamond in hand and drove out East's heart queen. Declarer ruffed the next spade, drew East's last trump and forced out the club ace. He had one trump left with which to ruff the fourth round of spades - all he needed.When you can play high or low, consider both carefully. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Based on the Slough House book series by English novelist Mick Herron, \"Slow Horses\" begins its third season with two fresh episodes Friday, Dec. 1, on Apple TV+.The first season of the Gary Oldman (\"Darkest Hour,\" 2017)-led series kicked off on the streamer in April 2022 and made good use of Herron's first Slough House novel, \"Slow Horses,\" for which the show's is named. Season 2 continued the author's saga, taking its plot details from the literary series' second book, \"Dead Lions.\"Now, heading into its third season to be released within a year and a half, the newest instalment will follow the tradition of pulling content chronologically from the novels, this time focusing on Herron's \"Real Tigers,\" the third book in the series.On screen, the spy dramedy follows a group of aging and disgraced MI-5 agents, who all appear to have lived out their usefulness within the high-ranking British espionage organization. As such, the agents have been relegated to another department, \"known un-affectionately as Slough House,\" where a large part of their job involves sitting behind a desk and pushing papers; a lowstakes operation for agents who have made \"career-ending mistakes.\"Slough House is headed up by \"brilliant but misanthropic leader\" Jackson Lamb (Oldman), and also acts as a sort of workplace home to recovering alcoholic Catherine Standish (Saskia Reeves, \"Luther\"); former hactivist Roddy Ho (Christopher Chung, \"Waterloo Road\"); Louisa Guy (Rosalind Eleazar, \"Uncle Vanya,\" 2020), assigned to Slough House following a botched tailing job; and River Cartwright (Jack Lowden, \"Dunkirk,\" 2017), whose desire to redeem himself in the field set the tone for the premiere season.Other agents have come and gone over the seasons, including Jed Moody (Steven Waddington, \"Jamestown\"), Struan Loy (Paul Higgins, \"Apostle,\" 2018), Min Harper (Dustin Demri-Burns, \"Cardinal Burns\"), Shirley Dander (Aimee Ffon-Edwards, \"Peaky Bllnders\"), Marcus Longridge (Kadiff Kirwan, \"Ths Is Going to Hurt\") and Sidonie \"Sid\" Baker (Olivia Cooke, \"Bates Motel\"), the last of whom was a competent MI-5 agent assigned to Slough House for seemingly unknown reasons.Headed into Season 3, many Season 1 and/or 2 characters are expected to return, including Lamb; Cartwright; Ho; Guy and Standish; MI-5 director general and head of operations Diana Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas, \"Gosford Park,\" 2001); Cartright's grandfather, retired intelligence officer David Cartwright (Jonathan Pryce, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" 2003); and MI-5 agent James \"Spider\" Webb (Freddie Fox, \"Victor Frankenstein,\" 2015). Supporting characters Harper, Dander and Longridge are also scheduled for Season-3 return. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "TCM will Grant you this: A double feature of Hugh\n\n November 30, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: D12 | Section: News \n \n 346\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Had it not been for his taking a sharp turn into romantic comedy, Hugh Grant might have remained consigned to classics and period costumes for the bulk of his acting career.Instead, he's reached a point where the audience is expected to be perfectly comfortable seeing him play an Oompa-Loompa in \"Wonka,\" the latest incarnation of the saga of Willy Wonka - he of chocolate-factory fame, now portrayed by Timothee Chalamet - that's slated to open in theaters Dec. 15.In preparation for that, Turner Classic Movies salutes Grant with a double feature Sunday, Dec. 3, with each attraction showcasing one of his screen specialties.First up is the picture that changed Grant's professional trajectory, the 1994 international hit \"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\" He plays Charles, a self-deprecating Englishman who's hesitant to commit to a woman unless he sees lightning strike, quite literally. He finally knows what love is when he falls for Carrie (Andie MacDowell), a visiting American with quite a lengthy history of romances and even when it looks like he's lost her to another man, he can't get over her nor the hope that things still might eventually work out for him with her.Another great aspect of \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" is the group of close acquaintances that director Mike Newell and writer Richard Curtis surround Charles with. Kristin Scott Thomas, Simon Callow, John Hannah, James Fleet, David Bower and the late Charlotte Coleman portray that bunch, and their easy camaraderie is one of the movie's foremost enduring joys.The second attraction on TCM's Grant double bill is director Ang Lee's 1995 version of \"Sense and Sensibility,\" for which star Emma Thompson adapted the script from Jane Austen's novel (and won an Oscar for doing so).Grant's role is what his norm was before the success of \"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\" as a houseguest who becomes involved with one of three sisters (the Thompson character) who have been left just about destitute after their father's death. Kate Winslet, Hugh Laurie and \"Four Weddings\" co-star Fleet also have prominent roles. \n \n Caption: Andie MacDowell and Hugh Grant in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The movie also earned Academy Awards for best picture, director (Delbert Mann) and Chayefsky's adapted screenplay.Marty generally hangs out with his pals after work, but a visit to a dance hall introduces him to shy teacher Clara (Betsy Blair), and they take a real shine to each other but the critical comments of Marty's buddies make him doubt pursuing a relationship with her. The picture is alternately amusing and heartbreaking, but always affecting. Notable supporting players include Frank Sutton, who would become Sgt. Carter to TV's \"Gomer Pyle, USMC,\" and Jerry Paris - later one of TVs top sitcom directors (\"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" \"Happy Days\"). \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Away from it all: Luxury getaway goes south in 'Leave the World Behind'\n\n December 7, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Sarah Passingham | Page: D9 | Section: News \n \n 636\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A family's stay at a luxurious vacation home is unexpectedly extended due to a mysterious apocalypse in the new thriller \"Leave the World Behind,\" premiering Friday, Dec. 8, on Netflix.Based on the bestselling 2020 novel of the same name by author Rumaan Alam, the adaptation stars Julia Roberts (\"Ticket to Paradise,\" 2022) and Ethan Hawke (\"Moon Knight\") as married couple Amanda and Clay Sandford, whose family getaway to Long Island is steered far from the rest and relaxation they expected.After putting off a much-needed break from their busy day-to-day city life, Amanda tells Clay in the official trailer for the film, \"I figured if I made the reservation and packed our bags, it would eliminate most of the reasons to say no.\"Off they go to a sprawling home near the beach with their two children, teenager Archie (Charlie Evans, \"Everything's Gonna Be Okay\") and their youngest, Rose (Farrah Mackenzie, \"United States of Al\").While Amanda and Clay watch on as their children enjoy the pool and they all begin to settle into their temporary home, the peace and quiet begins feeling eerie. The cable and internet are mysteriously out, but the Sandfords try to make the most of it by pulling out games to pass the time. A knock at the door in the dark of night puts them face to face with two strangers in formal wear.Mahershala Ali (\"Swan Song,\" 2021) is G.H.Scott, the owner of the home, he explains to the bewildered couple blocking his doorway. This fateful introduction deepens the uneasiness that's beginning to build, when Amanda says to G.H. like an accusation, \"This is your house?\" G.H., joined by his daughter Ruth (Myha'la, \"Industry\"), face down their guests until they are eventually let into their home.Widespread blackouts led the Scotts to flee New York City for their Long Island residence, wanting to wait out the outage away from the panic of the city. Relegated to the basement in-law suite by a forcefully skeptical Amanda, the divide between the two families intensifies.If Amanda is determined not to make any friends in the apocalypse, her efforts are matched only by gruff contractor Danny, portrayed by Kevin Bacon (\"City On a Hill\"). Holding his shotgun as a warning in the trailer, Danny sternly tells G.H., \"I would do anything to protect my family.What you do is your business.\" A woman desperately clings to the passenger side door as Clay accelerates away, lost in this unfamiliar beach town, leaving the Sandford and Scott families no choice but to rely on each other for the time being.All they know for certain is that a countrywide cyberattack has caused sweeping power outages along the East Coast. Confirmed with an unsettling \"unrecognized emergency warning\" blasting bright blue light from the beach home's flat-screen TV, G.H.'s hunch that the seemingly unrelated disasters are connected grows.\"Leave the World Behind\" is written and directed by \"Mr. Robot\" creator Sam Esmail, who spoke with The Hollywood Reporter in October about adapting the novel shortly after it was published during the COVID-19 pandemic. Esmail shared, \"It was a crazy time, those early days [of the pandemic], and when I read the book what really resonated for me was this idea that in a moment of crisis, just how easily we could forget our common humanity.\"Alam executive produced the film with Tonia Davis (\"Rustin,\" 2023), Daniel M. Stillman (\"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,\" 2020), Nick Krishnamurthy and Barack and Michelle Obama (\"We the People\"). Esmail also shared what it's like to collaborate with the former president and first lady, saying, \"They gave notes on everything from the disaster elements to the characters.\" The director added, \"It's a highlight of my career that I got to work with the Obamas. They're some of the most brilliant minds on the planet and I'm really grateful for their involvement.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tony Shalhoub returns as \"Monk\" in new Peacock movie\n\n December 7, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: D12 | Section: News \n \n 502\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n With the way that popular series of the past have been recycled - even in the streaming era that has added so much content - the second coming of \"Monk\" may not be that huge a surprise.As it happens, streaming is the avenue by which Tony Shalhoub is reprising his multiple-Primetime Emmy-winning portrayal of obsessive-compulsive detective Adrian Monk. Peacock premieres \"Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie\" on Friday, Dec. 8, with the hugely phobic title character on a very personal mission to help his journalist step-daughter Molly (\"Home Economics\" alum Caitlin McGee) when tragedy strikes as her wedding nears. The film might claim that this is Monk's final investigation, but of course, a ratings triumph for the picture can change that notion easily. (Consider that there have been three movie sequels to another former USA Network series, \"Psych,\" and a fourth has been under discussion.) Also an executive producer of the new film, Shalhoub isn't the only \"Monk' veteran returning for it. Series creator Andy Breckman (\"The Good Cop\") wrote the script and returns as an executive producer as well (with \"Hit & Run's\" David Hobernan also reprising the latter job), and Randy Zisk (\"Midnight Caller\") - who directed many of the original show's episodes, including the finale - calls the shots again on the movie.Other familiar faces from the \"Monk\" cast also are back. Traylor Howard (\"Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place\") again plays Natalie Teeger, who was Monk's second assistant on the show; Ted Levine (\"The Silence of the Lambs,\" 1991) and Jason Gray-Stanford (\"A Beautiful Mind,\" 2001) return as the police-connected Leland Stottlemeyer and Randy Disher; Hector Elizondo (\"Last Man Standing\") resurfaces as psychiatrist Neven Bell; and Melora Hardin (\"The Office\") resurfaces as Monk's late wife Trudy.\"Monk\" premiered on USA Network in 2002 and enjoyed an eight-season run, with Shalhoub earning three Primetime Emmy Awards for it along the way. John Turturro (\"Barton Fink,\" 1991) and Stanley Tucci (\"Big Night,\" 1996) each picked up an Emmy for guest stints on the show, and Randy Newman (\"Toy Story,\" 1995) won two of the honors for his musical contributions to it. Shalhoub also won a Golden Globe and two Screen Actors Guild Awards for the program.The series brought stardom to Shalhoub after his tenure as a respected supporting actor on stage and screen. When \"Monk\" began, he was known to viewers largely as Antonio on the sitcom \"Wings,\" and he also had gained notice for roles in such movies as \"Big Night\" (1996, with the aforementioned Tucci) and \"The Siege\" (1998). He also had earned the first of what would be his four Tony Award nominations to date, for \"Conversations With My Father\" (1992); his others have been for \"Golden Boy\" (2013), \"Act One\" (2014) and \"The Band's Visit\" (2017), and he won the honor for the latter play.For now, though, it's back to \"Monk\" territory for Shalhoub's - and though \"Last\" is in the movie's name, don't necessarily bank on that being the fact. \n \n Caption: Tony Shalhoub in \"Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A world-renowned chef himself, Gordon Ramsay's daughter, Tilly, was previously a contestant on \"Celebrity Master-Chef Australia,\" proving that talent in the kitchen might just be genetic. The second-generation Ramsay is also set to join the cast as a judge of \"MasterChef Junior's\" upcoming ninth season, acting as a reminder of what young chefs can accomplish once they really get cooking.Bubbling over with family fun and holiday cheer, this seasonal special is sure to give fans a taste of what's to come in \"Master-Chef Junior\" Season 9. \"Master-Chef Junior: Home for the Holidays\" airs as a two-night event, Dec. 10 and 11, on Fox. \n \n Caption: Gordon Ramsay, Tilly Ramsay, Daphne Oz and Aarón Sánchez from \"MasterChef Junior: Home for the Holidays\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

How long was he on \"The X-Files\"?A: The actor's run as FBI Agent Fox Mulder began in 1993, and he has said that he didn't expect the Fox series (now repeating on Comet) to last as long as it did, nor to be as popular as it became. His regular weekly run on the show went through the seventh season, when headlines were made by a lawsuit Duchovny filed against 20th Century Fox Television, alleging that it sold rights to repeats of the show to Fox-affiliated stations for less than they were worth thus costing him some profits.The suit was settled, but Duchovny's contract for the show was up, so he left as a full-time cast member (with Robert Patrick assuming the role of a Mulder surrogate, John Doggett). However, Duchovny returned for part of the eighth season, with the explanation that Mulder had been abducted by aliens.He also came back for the presumed series finale in Season 9, but as it turned out, he wasn't done with the show yet.Fox gave \"The X-Files\" revivals as a limited-run program in 2016 and 2018, which were deemed to be the 10th and 11th seasons of the show. Series creator-producer Chris Carter has inferred that there are more stories in that universe to be told, but any discussions of a continuation of the franchise haven't come to fruition. The show also yielded two theatrical films in which Duchovny played Mulder (opposite Gillian Anderson's Agent Dana Scully), \"The X-Files: Fight the Future\" (1998) and \"The X-Files: I Want to Believe\" (2008). \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When the game was first invented, many claimed it would be a quickly passing fancy. Nowadays, with fewer young players coming into the game, some are saying that bridge will die with the elderly in 20 years or so. Still, somehow I have a feeling it will be going as strongly as ever come 2043.We have heard about passing in the auction. But what about passing in the play? If you thought that was impossible, look at today's deal.The contract was four spades. West led the heart jack: three, ace, queen.Back came the heart six to declarer's king. Declarer cashed his top spades, receiving a shock when West discarded a low diamond on the second round. Suddenly South was faced with four losers: two spades, one heart and one diamond. However, he didn't throw in the towel.He realized he might win 10 tricks after all.Declarer played a club to dummy's king and ruffed a heart in hand. Then he played a club to dummy's ace and ruffed a club in hand.Next he cashed the diamond ace before playing a diamond to dummy's king. That gave declarer nine tricks. He could lead either dummy's last heart or club and leave East with no answer. If he didn't ruff in, South would trump for his 10th trick, whereas if East did ruff in, South would discard his diamond loser and be assured of one more trump trick with his remaining 5-4 doubleton.This play, which generated an extra trump trick, is called a coup en passant.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Cedric the Entertainer and Wilmer Valderrama presided over the announcements from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where the show will also take place on Jan. 7.Films nominated for best motion picture drama included \"Oppenheimer,\" Martin Scorsese's \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" Bradley Cooper's \"Maestro,\" Celine Song's \"Past Lives,\" Justine Triet's \"Anatomy of a Fall\" and Jonathan Glazer's \"The Zone of Interest.\" In the best motion picture musical or comedy category, \"Barbie\" was joined by \"Air,\" \"American Fiction\" \"The Holdovers,\" \"May December\" and \"Poor Things.\" Yorgos Lanthimos' \"Poor Things\" and Scorsese's \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" both received seven nominations each. \"Poor Things\" saw nominations for Lanthimos, its actors Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe, and Tony McNamara for screenplay. \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" got nods for Scorsese, for direction and co-writing the screenplay with Eric Roth, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro.Stone, who was also nominated for the Showtime series \"The Curse,\" said in a statement that she was \"Feeling extremely bewildered and thankful for it all.\" She also said her \"Poor Things\" character Bella Baxter is her favorite.DiCaprio praised Gladstone in his statement: \"She is the soul of our film and helped to bring this sinister and painful part of our nation's history to life,\" he wrote. The film is about the murders of wealthy Osage individuals in Oklahoma in the early 20th century.\"Barbie\" tied for second-most nominations in Globes history with \"Cabaret,\" from 1972. Robert Altman's \"Nashville\" remains the record-holder with 11 nominations.It went into the morning as a favorite and got a big boost from its three original song nominations, including \"I'm Just Ken,\" and one of the year's new categories, recognizing cinematic and box office achievement. One person who was not nominated was America Ferrera, who delivered the movie's most memorable monologue.\"Succession\" was the top-nominated television program, with nine nods including for series stars Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin, followed by Hulu's \"The Bear.\" As always there were some big surprises, like Jennifer Lawrence getting nominated for her bawdy R-rated comedy \"No Hard Feelings\" for best performance by a female actor in a musical or comedy. She was nominated alongside Robbie, Stone and Fantasia Barrino (\"The Color Purple\"), Natalie Portman (\"May December\") and Alma Pöysti (\"Fallen Leaves\").Barrino heard the news from her husband who she immediately called back to make sure she wasn't dreaming.\"My voice is shot because I've been screaming, crying and just telling God, 'Thank you.' I almost allowed fear to hinder me from this role, to keep me from this role,\" she told the AP through tears.She's been on the road for work and said she's excited to go home and experience it with her children. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

What a wonderful event. Truly magical,\" said Trish Murchake of Church Hill, as she watched her granddaughter Leah Thomas, 7, skate on one of two iceless skating rinks set up near the town hall. It was Leah's first time on skates, she said.\nSaturday was their first time attending the winter festival, and they were having a lot of fun, Murchake said, adding, \"It's the perfect night for it.\"\nWhile all the attractions were free, there were more than 70 vendors and food trucks for visitors' shopping pleasure.\nThe Boggs family of Ridgely were enjoying the displays and activities in Railroad Memorial Park. They thought last year's festival was great but said this year managed to top it - more lights, more attractions, more everything.\nSteve and Kristel Vacek of Ruthsburg brought their children, Ellie, 8, Jackson, 11, and Mason, 13.\n\"We missed it last year. There's really a lot to see and do,\" Steve Vacek said. \"This is really cool.\"\nJenn Lowe and her daughter Ensle Joseph, 5, traveled an hour and a half from Salisbury to enjoy the festivities. Lowe said they were meeting a friend from Goldsboro. They had started on Central Avenue and were working their way through the attractions in the park on their way to the inflatables. Along the way, they got their picture taken in a lighted sleigh and visited Buddy the Elf, who was greeting fans inside a life-size gingerbread house.\nChildren and families got pictures with Santa inside the train station and told him their Christmas wishes.\nRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Yukon Cornelius and Abominable Snow Monster greeted visitors next to \"The Island of Misfit Toys\" display. Frosty the Snowman and Snoopy were also in attendance.\nReggie Cody of Hurlock brought his two kids, ages 4 and 6, to the festival.\n\"It was great,\" he said, adding that his children's favorite thing was the bounce house section.\n\"And the selection of food was good,\" Cody said. There was something for everyone. Drink choices included hot apple cider, hot chocolate, sodas and bottled water. Food choices ran the gamut from hotdogs and pizza to pulled pork and surf and turf. Cody ate from the Jimmy's Fat Rolls food truck, while the kids had nuggets and fries.\nSaturday marked their first visit to the festival, but it won't be their last.\n\"It's going to be a yearly event for us,\" Cody said. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY ANGELA PRICE\n\n Ensle Joseph, 5, of Salisbury visits with Buddy the Elf and his pet raccoon during Chrismtas in Ridgely on Saturday, Dec. 9.\n\n PHOTO BY ANGELA PRICE\n\n From left, Addison Boggs, 7, and her brother Grant, 11, of Ridgely, visit with Elsa from Disney's \"Frozen\" Saturday, Dec. 9 during Christmas in Ridgely.\n\n PHOTO BY ANGELA PRICE\n\n Foreground, from left, Troy Chester, 8, of Linkwood, Kennedi Johnson, 8, of Easton, and Serenity Chester, 10, try skating for the first time during Christmas in Ridgely on Saturday night, Dec. 9.\n\n PHOTO BY ANGELA PRICE\n\n Hungry visitors line up at food trucks at Christmas in Ridgely.\n\n PHOTO BY ANGELA PRICE\n\n From left, Parker Dietrich, 14, of Easton, Mady Shortall, 13, of Easton, and Cloee Welsel, 14, of Preston transform into elves during Christmas in Ridgely on Saturday, Dec. 9. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Everyone loves baked goods no matter who they may be. So many of us just love watching the faces of the recipients also.\nThe first step and the most important is to have a list of the cookies, candies and cakes you want to make. The second step is to make a list of the ingredients you will need and the third is to get the correct amount of supplies.\nStorage containers for the finished products are important. I save cookie tins throughout the year and purchase other types of paper or cardboard containers whenever they are on sale.\nFinally, choose the day or two where you can bake all day undisturbed. Carry out pizza that evening for the family. Maybe you want to reserve a day or afternoon for the children or grandchildren to help.\nMISS MARY'S CHOCOLATE FUDGE Mix together one bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips, one small can of sweetened condensed milk and 1 tsp vanilla.

After seven weeks of cooking alongside some of the best in the game, celebrity chef Bobby Flay (\"Bobby's Triple Threat\") has one last chance to prove himself a festive-feast champion as \"Beat Bobby Flay: Holiday Throwdown\" airs its final episode Tuesday, Dec. 19, on Food Network.\"Food Network's favorites come together for holiday-themed culinary competitions and the chance to beat Bobby Flay,\" a series description given by the network explains. \"In each supersized episode, three chefs must bring their A-game and battle it out over two festive rounds to get to Bobby.\"\nIn true \"BBF\" fashion, the chefs must first compete against each other, creating spectacular dishes that feature secret ingredients of Bobby's choice. Whoever does it best moves on to the final round, then forcing Flay to cook their own surprise signature dish, with Flay testing his culinary prowess against the chef who knows it best. If Bobby can't cut it, the guest chef takes home the greatest prize of all: the pride of knowing they beat one of Food Network's best.\nSo far, this holiday special edition has seen Sunny Anderson (\"The Kitchen\"), Darnell Ferguson (\"Worst Cooks in America\"), Duff Goldman (\"Ace of Cakes\"), Chris Scott (\"The Great Soul Food Cook Off \"), Alex Guarnaschelli (\"Alex Vs America\"), Eddie Jackson (\"Outchef 'd\"), Michael Symon (\"Symon's Dinners Cooking Out\"), Antonia Lofaso (\"Cutthroat Kitchen\"), Damaris Phillips (\"Southern at Heart\") and more face off against Flay, with guest judges Tiffani Faison (\"Duck It!\"), Katie Lee Biegel (\"The Kitchen\"), Carson Kressley (\"BBQ Brawl\") and Bobby's own daughter, Sophie Flay (\"Bobby and Sophie on the Coast\"), all stopping in to give their say.\nDuring this upcoming season finale, however, the pressure (cooker) is on, as chef Jeff Mauro (\"Sandwich King\") taps in as judge and Flay faces his toughest competition yet: Andrew Zimmern (\"Family Dinner\"), Brooke Williamson (\"Top Chef \") and Jet Tila (\"Ready Jet Cook\").\nWith a slate of restaurants and businesses to his name, Bobby Flay is hard to beat. But if anyone can manage it, it's one of his Food Network colleagues. As this Christmas-party-turned-food-fight reaches its end, Tila, Zimmern and Williamson hope to take down their very own culinary Goliath.\n\"Beat Bobby Flay: Holiday Throwdown\" airs its final episode Tuesday, Dec. 19, on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Sophie and Bobby Flay from \"Beat Bobby Flay: Holiday Throwdown\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Opera star Rise Stevens appears as an opera star, a woman from Father Chuck's pre-clergy past. Crosby proved so popular in his role, McCarey crafted another film for him in the part: the following year's \"The Bells of St. Mary's,\" which TCM appropriately will show right after \"Going My Way.\" \n \n Caption: Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald in \"Going My Way\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Here are memories of some of them.Matthew Perry: It's almost impossible to grasp any of the six \"Friends\" being absent now, but that happened with the passing of the actor who fit the part of witty, acerbic Chandler Bing like a glove.\nNorman Lear: A much-celebrated master of socially relevant comedy, his work will live on in classic series from \"All in the Family\" to \"One Day at a Time.\"\nSuzanne Somers: Thanks to this actress, the lovably daft Chrissy Snow became one of the most popular female characters in sitcom history on \"Three's Company.\"\nCindy Williams: Thanks to the half of the team she upheld, \"Laverne & Shirley\" boasted one of TV comedy's all-time-top duos.\nDavid McCallum: Years after he was a pop-culture sensation as spy Illya Kuryakin on \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,\" McCallum gained another audience as Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard on the globally popular \"NCIS.\"\nRichard Belzer: This actor and comic's portrayal of Detective John Munch on \"Homicide: Life on the Street\" proved impactful enough to be transferred into \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.\"\nBob Barker: Though Bill Cullen hosted the original \"The Price Is Right,\" the personable Barker made the game show his own - and for many years - when he began hosting a revival in 1972.\nLen Goodman: The lovably fussy judge always enlivened \"Dancing With the Stars.\"\nPaul Reubens: In his distinctive persona as Pee-wee Herman, this comedic actor made a major contribution to the field of family programming with \"Pee-wee's Playhouse.\"\nTony Bennett: One of popular music's most enduring talents made regular TV appearances, up to his specials with Lady Gaga in the twilight of his career.\nHarry Belafonte: Among the many pursuits by this icon of entertainment and civil rights were acclaimed TV specials, some done in tandem with such other stars as Julie Andrews and Lena Horne.\nRichard Moll: The tall actor who embodied the role of bailiff Bull was one of the reasons for the success of the original \"Night Court.\"\nRon Cephas Jones: This excellent actor's moving portrayal of Randall's (Sterling K. Brown) father William on \"This Is Us\" earned him two Primetime Emmy Awards.\nTreat Williams: This prolific actor had notable series runs on \"Everwood\" and \"Chesapeake Shores,\" and recurring stints on such hits as \"Chicago Fire\" and \"Blue Bloods.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It certainly pays to search through a contract with doubting eyes, looking for the best line of play. In today's deal, how should South plan the play in three no-trump? West leads the diamond queen.\nThe original declarer won the first trick with dummy's diamond king. (He might have ducked in both hands, but that would have risked a dangerous shift to hearts.) After a club to South's king won, declarer continued with the club queen. However, East won with the ace and returned his second diamond.\nNow South couldn't get nine tricks before the defenders took five.\n\"Why didn't you lead back a low club the second time?\" asked North, as irritating partners are wont to do.\n\"Because I haven't got X-ray vision,\" replied South curtly.\nWith six tricks on the side, South needs only three club tricks, and his A-10 of diamonds is safe from attack if West is on lead. So the best play at trick two is a club to South's nine.\nWest wins with the 10 and switches to the heart queen.\nDeclarer wins with dummy's ace, plays a spade to his ace and leads the club king.\nUnless clubs are 5-1, the defenders can never get more than four tricks: two hearts and two clubs. Here, South wins an overtrick.\n©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That also owes to Ives' performances of such songs as \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\" and \"Silver and Gold\" on the soundtrack, where the image certainly relates to the musical success Ives already had had by the time the special first aired in 1964.\nSimilarly, the mailman who tells the story in the 1970 show \"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\" (an annual ABC attraction lately) is meant to resemble iconic actor-singer-dancer Astaire, right down to his wiry physical build. Though Mickey Rooney voiced Santa in that program, Father Christmas has such a traditional look, the resulting image was sort of a hybrid of that and Rooney's own appearance.\nOther examples of veteran talents whose likenesses were used for their animated counterparts in Rankin/Bass shows included Jimmy Durante in \"Frosty the Snowman,\" Shirley Booth in \"The Year Without a Santa Claus,\" Angela Lansbury in \"The First Christmas: The Story of the First Christmas Snow,\" Ethel Merman in \"Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July\" and Danny Kaye in the Easter-themed \"Here Comes Peter Cottontail.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As the title suggests, the film has very little dialogue.\nThis article was produced and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n \n Caption: AP PHOTO/INVISION/EVAN AGOSTINI\n\n Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges stars in the Christmas movie \"Dashing Through the Snow.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One might think he'd jump at the opportunity, but he bides his time in responding, which is both surprising and troubling to Richie (Ron Howard).\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" (MGM+ Drive-In, Tuesday, Dec. 19): The success of \"Star Wars\" prompted the powers that be at Paramount Pictures to give big-screen treatment to creator-producer Gene Roddenberry's legendary 1960s sci-fi series. William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy lead the original cast again as Kirk and Spock, as the retrofitted starship Enterprise heads deep into the galaxy to confront an artificial intelligence that has been destroying other vessels. Robert Wise directed the 1979 film; several of the movie sequels follow.\n\"The 25th Annual A Home for the Holidays\" (CBS, Friday, Dec. 22): Though this is a new special, it's also classic in a way, since it's the latest edition of a seasonal franchise that has advocated for adoption and moved audiences for a quarter-century. Celebrities - including Katharine McPhee (this year's host), Pentatonix, CeCe Winans and Gavin DeGraw - perform and offer true stories of youngsters who have found homes with loving families who have brought them in, and a box of tissues is a virtual requirement for watching the traditionally heartwarming program. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So if you wanted to go to a family-friendly happy, fun celebration out in your community, that's what this is.\" This year, even the buttons for participants are free. Kilmon said that while the collectable buttons have been something for purchase in the past, they are free of charge this year.\n\"A lot of people collect them, and this is the 30th-year button,\" Kilmon said.\nThe buttons are available at the Easton Visitor Center on Harrison Street. They can be picked up the day of the event or anytime before that. The center is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturdays.\nThis year will be Improv Easton's first time performing at First Night Talbot.\nKilmon said that aside from the crab drop, Improv Easton is a can't miss experience.\n\"They have been practicing and practicing and practicing for months,\" Kilmon said. \"I think that's going to be a great show.\" Kilmon said there will also be more arts and crafts activities for children at the Waterfowl Building this year.\nAnd although this is not Mike Elzey's first rodeo at First Night Talbot, this will be his first year at the Town Hall venue.\n\"It's kind of like a private concert venue versus being out in the open,\" Kilmon said of the change.\nFrom 6 p.m. to 8:45 p.m. at Town Hall, there will be a student showcase from Mike Elzey's Guitar Studio students. From 9:15 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., Elzey will host an air guitar competition with prizes.\nAlong with the Waterfowl Building and Town Hall, there will also be performances at the Avalon Theater throughout the night.\nBut the main event of the night is the crab drop - an 8-foot-wide Maryland blue crab sculpture created by Rich and Suzanne Hood 19 years ago - that will drop at 9 p.m. and at midnight.\nFirst Night Talbot Program Chair Carolyn Jaffe said that when the crab reaches the bottom of the rig, it lights up the numbers for the new year.\n\"It's just the greatest,\" Jaffe said. \"Everybody loves it - to take pictures of each other in front of the crab drop when it's lit up like that.\" This year, USA Today ranked First Night Talbot's crab drop the 6th best New Year's Eve drop in the nation.\n\"They actually had the New York City drop included in that,\" Jaffe said. \"But they weren't in the top 10.\" At an Easton Town Council meeting Monday, Jaffe was honored for her many years of contributions to First Night Talbot.\nKilmon said making the entire First Night Talbot event free gives everyone the opportunity to enjoy the event.\n\"All the stuff that's happening is going to be no charge to the families,\" she said. \"We certainly just want them to come out and enjoy their community.\" More information on First Night Talbot can be found on Facebook@FirstNightTalbot Inc. on on Discover Easton's website.\nQuestions can also be directed to the Easton EDC at 410-690-7348 or welcome@discovereaston.com. \n \n Memo: FIRST NIGHT TALBOT SCHEDULE\n\n Waterfowl building, 40 S.

(Has your partner ever taken ages over a play and then made the wrong one?)Today's deal highlights a common unthinking error.\nAfter a lengthy auction to six diamonds, West led the ace and another heart.\nSouth won in hand with his king, played a diamond to dummy's jack, ruffed a low club in hand and cashed all of his trumps. He crossed to dummy's heart queen, discarded spades on the two top clubs and took the unavoidable spade finesse: down one.\nThe declarer grumbled about his bad luck, unaware that he had made a mistake.\nThere were two main chances for the contract: clubs 4-4 or the spade finesse working. As the latter could wait, South should have thought more about a possible even club break. To benefit from that, South had to ruff two low clubs in his hand and still have a dummy entry left.\nBy now, you will have seen the right play. At trick one, South must unblock his heart king under West's ace. He wins the heart continuation in the dummy, ruffs a low club, plays a diamond to dummy's jack, ruffs another low club and draws trumps. Dummy is entered with a heart and the top clubs cashed. When they break, South claims.\nHowever, if the clubs are not 4-4, the spade finesse is taken.\nWatch those entries. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The final season of \"La Brea,\" the sci-fidrama that explores a world full of time-bending portals and sinkholes, premieres the first of its last six episodes on NBC Tuesday, Jan. 9.Natalie Zea (\"Justified\"), Eoin Macken (\"I Used to Be Famous,\" 2022), Zyra Gorecki (\"Chicago Fire\") and Jack Martin (\"All Rise\") all return as the Harris family, who have been searching for each other, along with some answers about the La Brea tar pit sinkhole that opened up and separated them, for two seasons.\n\"La Brea\" will wrap up its story this season with six action-packed episodes tying together the threads between its several timelines. It all began in present-day Los Angeles, when a massive sinkhole opened up in the middle of the city, sending everything and everyone deep into the past. Sinkhole survivors land in what they learn is the place from which they fell, but all the way back in the year 10,000 BCE.\nTwo members of the Harris family were sent through the sinkhole time portal: mother and office manager Eve (Zea) and her teenage son, Josh (Martin). Now separated physically from her estranged husband, former Air Force pilot Gavin (Macken), and her daughter, Izzy (Gorecki), Eve struggles to understand the new world she was dropped into and tries to find her way back to solid ground in present-day L.A.\nChiké Okonkwo (\"Being Mary Jane\") is Dr. Ty Coleman, a therapist who befriends Eve and Sam in 10,000 BCE. Ty is living with a terminal brain tumor when he is sent through the sinkhole, an unimaginable event that changes his perspective on life. His adventure into the past includes falling for Paara (Tonantzin Carmelo, \"The English\"), a Tongva woman who connects with him over complicated past relationships. Though their relationship had its struggles - they come from two completely different centuries, after all - the pair married in a rare moment of celebration among the survivors.\nEve and Ty emerge as leaders among the new sinkhole society early on, joined by former Marine and surgeon Sam Velez (Jon Seda \"Chicago P.D.\"), who entered 10,000 BCE with his daughter, college student Riley (Veronica St. Clair, \"Unbelievable\"). Rohan Mirchandaney (\"The Newsreader\") is Australian stoner Scott Israni, whose knowledge as an anthropology graduate student becomes a commodity after he winds up falling through the sinkhole. Scott becomes close with Josh and Riley, but often gets himself into dangerous situations with others - like when he was almost killed by The Exiles before Gavin stepped in last season.\nA well-armed group of warriors who, like the \"Sky People\" who fell from L.A. into the distant past, The Exiles seem to have arrived from another time. Led by Taamet (Martin Sensmeier, \"Alaska Daily\"), who happens to be Paara's ex-husband, The Exiles use steel weaponry, something that is not historically consistent with 10,000 BCE. The Exiles are foes, not friends, to anyone new they encounter, taking Eve hostage in the second season, along with Veronica (Lily Santiago, \"Vineyards,\" 2023) and former Air Force pilot and longtime friend of the Harris family, Levi Delgado (Nicholas Gonzalez, \"The Good Doctor\"). \n \n Caption: Jon Seda and Eoin Macken \"La Brea\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Darnell invites two pairings of chefs who have some kind of food feud to bring their knives and bury the hatchet once and for all. In the end, the two Grudge Match victors walk out with a $10,000 cash prize, a prized knife from the losing chef's knife roll and bragging rights for life!\" Throughout this second season, Ferguson has invited some highly talented Food Network alumni to take part in his challenge, with upcoming episodes seeing the likes of Jay Ducote (\"Food Network Star\"), Joe Sasto (\"The Great Food Truck Race\") and many others enter into the ring. More exciting names are still to come, however, with new episodes rolling out weekly and Food Network promising appearances from chefs Aarti Sequeira (\"Aarti Party\"), Brian Malarkey (\"Beachside Brawl\") and Antonia Lofaso (\"Top Chef \"), along with food critic Troy Johnson (\"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\").\nDuring this season's finale episode, for example: \"longtime rivals compete in two epic all-star battles for the favor of judges Eric Adjepong [\"The Great Soul Food Cook-Off \"] and Stephanie Izard [\"Top Chef \"],\" Food Network shares.\n\"In the first match, chef Nate Appleman [\"The Next Iron Chef \"] takes on chef Amanda Freitag [\"Chopped\"] to show the world that he's ready to join the elite corps of chefs who compete on 'Tournament of Champions'. In the second match, there's old beef to settle when chef Jonathon Sawyer [\"Beat Bobby Flay\"] challenges chef Chris Cosentino [\"Food Interrupted\"] for the title of America's Meat Master.\" Packed with talent and good taste, new episodes of \"Superchef Grudge Match\" air Tuesday, Jan. 9, on Food Network. \n \n Caption: Chef Darnell Ferguson hosts \"Superchef Grudge Match\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Taylor Swift Tops List of Spotify Earners in 2023\n\n January 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 8A | Section: News \n \n 868\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After being named Time Magazine's Person of the Year, pop star Taylor Swift has another achievement to cap off 2023: she's the first artist to earn more than $100 million from Spotify, according to Billboard Magazine.Spotify listeners played her music more than any other artist this year. The streaming giant released its Wrapped analysis on Nov. 29, showing Swift's songs were streamed more than 26 billion times since Jan. 1, 2023.\nThrough Spotify, those streams rack up $97 million in royalties, with the busy singer on track to earn $100 million by the end of December.\nIf you include publishing revenue, the ubiquitous \"Lavender Haze\" artist is estimated to receive about $131 million in royalties from Spotify this year. However, this is from one streaming platform alone.\nBillboard estimates that her total earnings this year will approach $200 million if recording and publishing royalties from other streaming services like Amazon Music, Apple Music, and YouTube Music are also included.\nThanks to Swift re-recording her \"Taylor's Version\" of four albums, Fearless, Red, Speak Now, and 1989, she has the master rights to all her music. That means most of that $200 million will go into her bank account, which is in good shape already, thanks to the $1 billion grossed by her Eras tour.\nScooter Braun, Scott Borchetta, and Taylor Swift: What Happened?\nSwift signed with Big Machine Music and its founder Scott Borchetta when she was 15. She tried to earn back the rights to her master recordings for years.\nThen, in 2019, Ithaca Holdings, which record executive Scooter Braun owns, acquired Big Machine.\nTo put it lightly, she was not pleased to have her masters in the hands of Braun, whom she called an, \"incessant, manipulative bully\" in her Tumblr post.\nSo, because her master recordings - that is, the original recording from which all copies are made - were now owned by someone she didn't like, she set out to re-record and re-release all her albums as new recordings.\nBy doing so, she now wholly owns all the new masters and completely controls her songs. So far, she has created her own \"Taylor's Version\" of four of her six albums. The albums Taylor Swift and Reputation are still in the works.\nSwift has changed some lyrics and the sound of several songs on her re-recorded albums. She also released several songs not released on the original albums, including the tearjerker \"We Were Happy.\" Perhaps the step that generated the most attention was releasing a 10-minute version of one of her saddest songs, \"All Too Well,\" which also included a short film music video starring actors Dylan O'Brien and Sadie Sink.\nFans have responded positively to the renewed albums.\n1989 (Taylor's Version) actually performed better than the original release, according to Vulture.\nTaylor Swift + Spotify Hasn't Always Been a \"Love Story\" Although she's now earning millions from her devoted fans' streams on Spotify and other music streaming platforms, Swift's relationship with the platform hasn't always been cordial.\nIn fact, in 2014, her then-label Big Machine Music removed all of her music from the platform entirely. At the time, music labels were pivoting from selling music downloads to charging for access to streaming music. Many took issue with the fact that Spotify users could listen to the music they owned free of charge through the app.\nAccording to Rolling Stone, Spotify told artists and labels at the time that the royalties would get better once more people started paying for the app's premium version. The platform said it paid out $500 million in royalties in 2013, compared to $ 5 billion in 2020 and $7 billion in 2021. That said, artists continue to say their pay from the major streaming services is inadequate.\nFor the record, Spotify doesn't pay out directly to artists. The platform pays the artists' distributors, labels, etc., who then pay the artists.\nThe outcry has led to efforts to introduce a fairer system.\nIn 2022, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., introduced House Concurrent Resolution 102, recognizing the need for fairer compensation for artists' labor. The resolution notes that it requires 800,000 streams for an artist to make the equivalent of $15 an hour.\nIn November, Spotify announced it is updating its royalties system \"to better support those most dependent on streaming revenues as part of their livelihood.\" The changes target artificial streams and noise tracks aiming to game the system and redistribute small payments that aren't reaching artists.\nBy making these changes, Spotify says it will be able to drive an additional $1 billion toward emerging artists and smaller artists in the next five years.\nEras Tour Traditions Swift may be famous for her lyrics that draw from her love life, but her Eras Tour has sparked a friendship-based activity for attendees: creating and trading handmade friendship bracelets.\nFans showed off their arms stacked with bracelets before Swift's concerts on the 52-show tour of the United States. The craze may have drawn inspiration from an Instagram post Swift shared in 2019, or perhaps from the lyrics of the song \"You're On Your Own, Kid,\" encouraging the listener to make friendship bracelets.\nThis article was produced by Orchestra Central and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n \n Caption: AP HPOTO/NATACHA PISARENKO\n\n Taylor Swift performs at the Monumental stadium during her Eras Tour concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Thursday, Nov. 9, 2023. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The first film released under the Touchstone banner, it makes good use of Hanks' ordinary-guy persona as his character falls in love with a woman who turns out to be a mermaid (Daryl Hannah). John Candy earns big laughs as Hanks' brother and business partner, with Eugene Levy as a determined scientist who could be a spoiler.\"The Gene Autry Show\" (get TV, Sunday, Jan. 7, and Saturday, Jan. 13): The legendary \"singing cowboy\" - whose signature tune was \"Back in the Saddle Again\" - moved from radio and movies to television with this 1950s series, which now has a regular weekend-morning berth and features the star aboard his famous horse Champion. His steadiest sidekick was played by Pat Buttram, later known as Mr. Haney on \"Green Acres.\" \"Citizen Kane\" (Turner Classic Movies, Thursday, Jan. 11): If you're serious about loving movies, you likely know a lot about Orson Welles' 1941 masterpiece already. Regarded by some as the best film ever made, the drama stars producer, director and co-writer Welles as a media titan partially based on William Randolph Hearst who was furious about being a model for such a depiction, Stylistically innovative in many ways, the picture was edited by Robert Wise, later a director of note himself. The cast of supporting players from the Welles-co-founded Mercury Theatre includes Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ray Collins and Everett Sloane. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Is that true?A: Yes two of them, in fact. Her earliest professional credit is \"The Edge of Night,\" on which she appeared for several episodes in 1984. Soon afterward, she joined \"As the World Turns,\" playing the dual roles of Frannie Hughes and her look-alike relative Sabrina. She earned a Daytime Emmy Award for her work on that show, which she did continuously from 1985 to 1988; she then made a return appearance in 2010.\nMoore began doing primetime TV parts during her \"As the World Turns\" run, notably opposite Valerie Bertinelli in the 1987 miniseries \"I'll Take Manhattan,\" then she was hired for TV-movies including \"Money, Power, Murder\" and \"The Last to Go.\" Around the same time, she also moved into theatrical films with \"Tales From the Darkside: The Movie\" and \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,\" and that became her principal venue from the early 1990s forward, with her eventual win of an Academy Award for best actress for \"Still Alice\" (2014).\nAfter doing guest stints along the way on \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"Sesame Street,\" Moore made a particularly significant return to TV by playing former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2012 HBO project \"Game Change.\" She won a Primetime Emmy Award for the dramatization of the 2008 election season, with Ed Harris playing Sen.

    "content": "Heroic moves: Marvel's 'Echo' premieres deaf Indigenous superhero in style\n\n January 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dana Simpson | Page: 9A | Section: News \n \n 681\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In recent years, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become a massive blockbuster sensation. Fans of the superhero genre have long been divided into camps - DC versus Marvel, for instance - but those seeking any form of visual entertainment, from art to books to film and television, would be hardpressed to find a medium that did not cater in some way to caped crusaders or leotard-clad superhumans.That said, ever since The Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel Entertainment in 2009 (for a whopping $4 billion), the company's streamer, Disney+, has been one of the greatest proponents of the \"super\" genre. Newest to join the ranks is \"Echo,\" the \"Hawkeye\" spinoff series premiering Wednesday, Jan. 10, on the platform.\nWhile hardly new to the Marvel Universe, Echo is best known to current Marvel fans in the form of budding actress Alaqua Cox, who was born and raised in the Menominee Indian Reservation in Keshena, Wisconsin, and is of the Menominee and Mohican nation. Starring alongside Jeremy Renner (\"The Hurt Locker,\" 2008) and Hailee Steinfeld (\"Dickinson\") in the 2021 miniseries \"Hawkeye,\" Echo was introduced in a supporting role and garnered plenty of attention for her two-fold inclusivity and incredible fighting abilities. As is the case with nearly all superheroes and villains in the MCU, Echo's backstory is somewhat complicated and varies significantly between sources, but at least three things remain consistent: her name, her background and her deafness.\nBorn Maya Lopez, Echo is the highly gifted daughter of secret mob enforcer William Lopez (Zahn McClarnon, \"Dark Winds\") - sometimes referred to as William Lincoln in other related source material - a proud Native American man of the Cheyenne Nation, and a Latina mother, known vaguely as \"Ms.\nLopez,\" who abandoned the family when Maya was young. Upon his untimely death related to criminal activities, William urges hulking mobster Kingpin, a.k.a.\nWilson Fisk (played in \"Echo\" by Vincent D'Onofrio of 1987's \"Full Metal Jacket\"), to look after his young daughter at all costs. Nothing if not a man of his word, Fisk agrees - and so begins Lopez's journey as Echo.\nPer the Marvel website, the Disney+ series is Echo's origin story and \"revisits Maya Lopez, whose ruthless behavior in New York City catches up with her in her hometown. She must face her past, reconnect with her Native American roots and embrace the meaning of family and community if she ever hopes to move forward.\" By reconnecting with her hometown, her roots and her own morals and desires, Maya tries to let go of what no longer serves her and embrace the feelings that have been driving her down the same dangerous path as Kingpin and the father she lost during her childhood. Along the way, however, there is plenty of violence, bloodshed and \"real consequences\" (per Freeland) - hence the series' TV-MA rating.\nBehind the scenes, Navajo filmmaker Sydney Freeland (\"Reservation Dogs\") and Australian/Gunaikurnai creative Catriona McKenzie (\"Satellite Boy,\" 2012) direct the series. Naturally, Freeland and McKenzie were excited to begin work on a project focused on the only deaf Indigenous superhero in entertainment media. Beyond that, the official trailer for \"Echo\" also prominently features the hero's prosthetic leg, an addition to the original source material to provide added inclusivity and incorporate Alaqua's own, real-life prosthetic into the storyline.\n\"Representation was extremely important to myself and to everyone on the crew,\" Freeland stated at an October 2023 news conference.\nBut neither Alaqua's amputee status nor the character's deafness was front and center while plotting the show's details. Sure, the creators gave thought to her disabilities and incorporated them into the storyline, but her so-called \"disabilities\" - as \"Hawkeye\" fans have clearly already noticed - are hardly disabling. Instead, creators laid much of the focus on the toll anger, resentment and physical trauma can take on a human being as they interact with the oft-cruel world around them.\nAt the end of the day, Freeland noted, \"Echo\" is \"an exploration of trauma - how we deal with it, how we cope with it, how it affects us, how we affect it, how it affects those around us.\" \n \n Caption: Alaqua Cox stars in \"Echo\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But on Saturday, Jan. 13, from noon to 8 p.m., the festival will give residents and visitors the chance to check out and take pictures of intricate ice sculptures, eat oysters from different vendors and listen to live music.\nThe event is being co-hosted by the Dorchester Chamber of Commerce and Ice Lab, an ice sculpting company.\nDorchester Chamber of Commerce President Bill Christopher said there will be nearly 50 ice sculptures at the festival this year.\nTwo new and exciting frozen works of art include a 20-foot slide and a Jimmy Buffett Tribute Ice Bar. The Buffett Tribute Ice Bar will have palm trees, parrots and the bartenders will be serving up margaritas while Jimmy Buffett plays, Christopher said.\nAlthough some of the sculptures are pre-carved, others are carved in place. Christopher said Ice Lab has been working on the pre-carved sculptures since early December.\n\"Ice Lab does an awesome job, in terms of what they do, in terms of building these sculptures,\" he said. \"I absolutely encourage people to come out and watch them and see what they do.\"\nFor the \"oyster\" part of the festival, more than five oyster vendors will be at the event. Those who aren't big oyster fans are encouraged to try out downtown Cambridge's local restaurants, Christopher said.\nThere will be two different stages with live music playing throughout the festival.\nFor children (and those who are young at heart) there will be a variety of games including cornhole and an ice hockey table. The Rescue Fire Company's annual Train Garden will be open to visitors at 307 Gay Street. Free hot chocolate and s'mores will also be available to festival-goers while supplies last.\nChristopher said the festival is great for everyone — young and old.\n\"Everybody's there to have a good time and have fun,\" he said. \"Whether you have kids or don't, it's a good place to come hang out.\"\nMore information about the festival, including a parking map and site map, can be found online at iceoysterfest.com/. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As usual, sequels and prequels dominate the 2024 release calendar. However, if Top Gun: Maverick and Avatar: The Way of Water proved anything, it's that truly well-made sequels are worth seeing.\nFor the first time in a long while, superhero movies won't dominate the 2024 roster due to the back-to-back misfires in 2023. That means other genres are set to succeed at the box office, giving audiences plenty to choose from. There are some highly anticipated Hollywood titles hitting theaters in 2024.\nDune Part 2\nU.S. release date: March 1, 2024\nThe sequel to 2021's Dune Part 1 was set to be released in November 2023, but it was delayed due to the prolonged SAG-AFTRA strike. Part 2 continues the journey of Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) in seeking revenge for House Atreides' downfall in the hands of the evil Emperor (Christopher Walken) and his right hand, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). To do that, Paul must mobilize the Fremen, the native Arrakis tribe, who see him as their prophesied savior.\nKung Fu Panda 4\nU.S. release date: March 8, 2024\nAfter a long wait, the food-and-martial-arts-loving panda is back in action.

Once again directed by Godzilla vs Kong 's director Adam Wingard, this film promises the same epic battle scenes in various landscapes worldwide.\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\nU.S. release date: May 24, 2024\nA prequel to the Academy Award-winning Mad Max: Fury Road, the action-adventure film will chart the origin story of fan-favorite Furiosa, played by The Queen's Gambit actress Anya Taylor-Joy. Stolen from her birthplace, a young Furiosa gets caught in a feud between two warlords. Also directed by George Miller, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga promises to deliver plenty of high-octane vehicular thrills.\nInside Out 2\nU.S. release date: June 14, 2024\nGet ready to feel the feels once more as Joy, Sadness, and the rest of the gang are back for another Pixar adventure. Riley is now a teenager experiencing turbulent emotions, as teenagers do. That means Joy's control room will be welcoming a host of new feelings like Anxiety, Envy, and Embarrassment. Amy Poehler returns to voice Joy, while Stranger Things ' Maya Hawke comes on board as Anxiety.\nDespicable Me 4\nU.S. release date: July 3, 2024\nThe Illumination franchise chugs on with a fourth installment of the flagship film series following 2022's Minions: The Rise of Gru.

MCU could use some help after their disastrous 2023, and who better to assist than Deadpool, whose last two films grossed over $1.5 billion combined? For his latest romp, Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) receives the helping claws of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), whose return from death will be one of the most intriguing aspects of the film.\nJoker: Folie à Deux\nU.S. release date: October 4, 2024\n2019's Joker was a surprise hit in many ways. Not only did it gross over $1 billion against a $70 million budget, but it was also nominated for 11 Oscars — a record for a comic book movie.\nFive years later, Joaquin Phoenix returns to reprise his Oscar-winning role as Joker, the actor's first sequel ever. He will be joined by pop superstar Lady Gaga, playing the DC rogue's girlfriend, Harley Quinn. Not much is known about the film other than it will be a musical.\nWicked, Part I\nU.S. release date: November 27, 2024\nThe adaptation of the record-breaking Broadway musical has had an arduous road to the big screen.

    "content": "MPT series Chesapeake Collectibles back for 11th season\n\n January 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 800\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OWINGS MILLS — Following a three-year pause, Maryland Public Television's original series \"Chesapeake Collectibles,\" returns for its 11th season with a treasure trove of captivating finds.A producer of the program, Patrick Keegan, noted that ever since the hiatus, partly due to Covid-19 restrictions, there's a need to see the show's reemergence.\n\"The public is hungry for it,\" Keegan said. \"We're always willing to give the public what they want.\"\nFor those unfamiliar with the program, he described it as a regional version of \"Antiques Roadshow.\" Guests bring in their items to be assessed by expert appraisers who reveal fascinating facts about the items' history, provenance and value.\nIn this season, folks from Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and even West Virginia filled MPT's new studio for their June taping.\n\"It's interesting; it's a great community event and also a television show,\" Keegan added.\nWhile guests had paintings, old writings, custom tools, vintage toys, or anything else evaluated, producers scrambled to find the most interesting pieces to put on the show.\n1,000 people came and brought 3,000 items they were curious about.\nWith only 80 slots this season, a small percentage of the 1,000 people were put on-air.\nThose who did, fell into one of three parameters, Keegan said.\nThe producers ask, is the item interesting in itself?\nFor example, one gentleman brought in Titanic memorabilia. He had medals from soldiers aboard the ship on that fateful day in 1912.\nDoes the item tell a good story?\nKeegan pointed out it's not as compelling a tale if a wealthy person purchased a painting from an auction and had it appraised.\nBut, if someone inherited the painting, or if someone found something invaluable at a junk shop, it plays better with the audience.\nAnd since this is \"Chesapeake Collectibles,\" how does the item relate to the region?\nOn the program, there are portraits from artists living around the Chesapeake Bay, tools used in ship construction from the 1800's and memorabilia from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad company, to name a few.\nSome items are interesting without much context.\nOne of the most amazing finds in episode 1 was an Apple 1 computer, hand-built by Steve Jobs in 1976.\nOne woman brought in the first ever Barbie doll from 1959. She had no idea of the valuable item in her possession.\nImagine her surprise when she found out.\n\"That's what we producers live for; that reaction shot,\" Keegan said.\nIn many cases, the possessor of the item is just as interesting as the item.\nFor instance, on the show was one of the teachers who trained for the Space Shuttle Challenger. She had reached the final testing period before she was taken off the project, fortunate because the shuttle broke apart in flight, killing the seven crew members aboard in 1986.\nShe had a fascinating story, and was on \"Chesapeake Collectibles,\" displaying her NASA memorabilia from that training time.\nThere were some intriguing guests on the show from Talbot County, John Bosman Kerr and his wife Lucy Hamilton Stevens Kerr. Residents in Central Maryland brought in portraits of their descendants.\nKerr was appointed as the chargé d'affaires, (a diplomatic official) to Nicaragua by President Millard Fillmore.\nKerr had passed down his family Bible, printed in 1599. In the back of it was a narration of Kerr's entire family history.\nSeeing stories unfold like that is rewarding for Keegan, who said he's never felt closer to the audience in his television career.\nHe spent many years working with the \"BBC, Animal Planet and Discovery.\" He aided in programs like \"Whale Wars, River Monsters and Pitbulls and Parolees,\" where he saw many exotic locations and events.\nHe appreciates those programs, but he sees working at MPT as leaving a legacy, producing shows in Maryland; his home of 20 years now.\n\"MPT's mission is to give back to the community, and we hear from our viewers all the time. That's what I'm proud of,\" he said.\nOn that note, Keegan would like to hear from the public. Taping for season 12 is June 22 or 23. He encouraged them to go to mpt.org to sign up or reach out to them by phone.\n\"You have plenty of time,\" he said, referring to the cut-off in early June.\nIn the meantime, check out \"Chesapeake Collectibles,\" and look for your Maryland neighbors and their shocked reactions when something in their attic is worth $10,000.\nAs a bonus award for longtime viewers of the program, one of the most beloved and popular hosts, Rhea Feikin, the \"First Lady of MPT,\" returned for episode 1, this time as a guest.\nIt's just another example of MPT listening to their public. They're thankful for their faithful viewers in a TV climate where everything is on-demand or on thirty-second TikTok clips.\nWhile you're tuned in to MPT, check out Keegan's other programs like \"Destination Maryland,\" and \"Made in Maryland,\" for more content that speaks to a local audience, educating and enlightening them.\nSeason 11 airs on Mondays at 7:30 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Instruments styled after those of the '60s were used, and there was lively banter among the performers as well as with the audience.\nThe hairstyles were modeled after the Beatles' moptops, and after tunes such as \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"Can't Buy Me Love,\" the audience seemed to transfix on the stand-ins of John, Paul, George and Ringo.\n\"It's great to be back here in the colonies,\" joked John as he played the harmonica as accompaniment.\n\"We were very impressed with their body language and facial expressions, as well as their vocal impersonations. It felt like we were actually at a Beatles show,\" said Dr. Jean Carlson of Easton, who attended the show. She mentioned that she had seen the real Paul McCartney five times in the U.S.\nAs one hit after another rocked the Avalon, a feeling of reminiscence and delight poured over the packed house.\nInstead of the swoons of the '60s, there were smiles and deep satisfaction, singing along with the words so remembered as to be never forgotten and recalling thoughts of a simpler time.\nThe group performs 70 or so shows per year, but this year it has planned at least 80 shows due to an increased demand during the 60th anniversary of the Beatles coming to America.\nThe Avalon, located at 40 East Dover Street, is a historic theater located in downtown Easton, originally built as a cinema in 1921. The Avalon was billed as the \"showplace of the Eastern Shore.\" Today it serves as the prime venue of the Mid-Shore for the performing arts nationally and locally. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

James Taylor told Rolling Stone, \"Tom was not only one of my early heroes, but also one of my main influences.\" Country music star Garth Brooks has credited Rush with being one of his top five musical influences.\"\nhttps://www.tomrush.com/\nThe Last Revel\nFriday, March 22\nDoors: 7:30 p.m. / Show: 8 p.m.\nStoltz Listening Room\n\"The Last Revel is an acclaimed three-piece folk group from Minneapolis, Minnesota. Utilizing their multi-instrumental abilities, members Lee Henke, Ryan Acker, and Vincenzio Donatelle, bring a full spectrum of modern Americana to life with lush arrangements of three-part vocal harmonies, acoustic guitar, upright bass, fiddle, and 5-string banjo to consistently support impassioned performances of their honest and heartfelt songwriting.\nDrawing influence from their salt of the earth Midwest ethos the band's songs so naturally blend the genres of Folk, Old Time String-Band and Indie Rock to create a sound that echoes the current heartbeat of America. Their latest release, Dovetail, highlights each members strength as songwriters and collaborators, and further solidifies their musical foundation.\"\nTHE MET: LIVE IN HD ROMÉO ET JULIETTE\nSaturday, March 23\nDoors: 12:30pm / Show: 1:00pm\nAvalon Theatre\n\"On March 23, two singers at the height of their powers—radiant soprano Nadine Sierra and tenor sensation Benjamin Bernheim—come together as the star-crossed lovers in Gounod's sumptuous Shakespeare adaptation, with Met Music Director Yannick Nézet-Séguin on the podium to conduct one of the repertoire's most romantic scores. Bartlett Sher's towering staging also features baritone Will Liverman and tenor Frederick Ballentine as the archrivals Mercutio and Tybalt, mezzo-soprano Samantha Hankey as the mischievous pageboy Stéphano, and bass-baritone Alfred Walker as Frère Laurent.\nThis live cinema transmission is part of the Met's award-winning Live in HD series, bringing opera to movie theaters across the globe.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland author pens 'Betrayal on Beltane'\n\n January 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 933\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Maryland author Carol Amorosi recently self-published her novel \"Betrayal on Beltane.\"The book, which was released Feb. 1, is the inaugural novel in the Dun Cael Mysteries series.\nAmorosi, who is from Bryans Road, has also published a three–book series titled \"The McKay Mysteries.\"\nShe and her husband Dan, who recently moved to Bryans Road, has two cats and a Border Collie/Corgi mix Widgit, the History Hound, who Amorosi said \"joins us on our adventures.\"\nTo order the book, go to www.amazon.com/Betrayal-Beltane-Cael-Mysteries-Book-ebook/dp/B0CRF5FHD7 or go to https://carolamorosi.com/.\nHow long have you been writing, and how did you get started?\nWriting is something I always wanted to do someday. There just never seemed to be time. Then, in 2020, COVID hit, and the lockdowns where we lived in Germany were tight. When my son challenged me to join a writing course he was doing, I thought it would be a lark, something to fill the time. But I loved it, and I've never looked back.\nWhat inspires you to write?\nHistory. I've always had a fascination with history, especially the everyday lives of people. I want to share that passion with others. My books are written for entertainment but also to let people know that history can be fun.\nDo you consider writing to be a career?\nAs I start the new series, yes, I do. I currently have a three-book series based in Colonial America and have started a new one set in the time of the ancient Celts in Europe.\nWhat kind of writing process do you use?\nMost writers are somewhere along the scale between pantsers (who write by the seat of their pants) and plotters (who have every detail worked out before they start). I definitely fall closer to the pantser end of that scale. That is the main reason I write mysteries. There is an underlying story to be resolved, which prevents me from including every cool historical tidbit I learn and keeps me moving.\nWho are some of your favorite authors and why?\nI love the classic mystery authors such as Agatha Christie, P. D. James, Dorothy L. Sayers, and Ruth Rendell, to name a few. I enjoy their characters, and it's fun to solve the murder along with the protagonist. And I have to admit Ellis Peters' Cadfael series and M. C. Beaton's Hamish Macbeth, with their depictions of a community, heavily influenced my first series, \"The MacKay Mysteries.\"\nWhat are you working on now?\nMy current work-in-progress is a new series set in a time when ancient Celts dominated mainland Europe. Recent archaeological finds paint a different picture of these people than was previously known from the writings of the Romans and Greeks. While we lived in Bavaria (ancient Bohemia), I became fascinated by the art and culture of this early civilization.\nWhat do you want readers to know about you?\nI already mentioned I love history. My second passion is travel. I love to explore new places. Being married to a retired Naval aviator who still works for the Navy means we've moved a lot. And I've enjoyed every moment of it, especially the years we spent in Italy, Greece, and Germany. I have a daughter in North Carolina and a son in England, so I hope to continue traveling.\nPlease include a brief description of your book\nBorn into the warrior elite, Jannon showed great promise as a fighter. But that life was not for him. Despite his father's intentions, he fostered with the Master Bronzesmith to learn his trade.\nBut when a dead man is found in the smithy, his father demands he return home. In desperation, Jannon and his friend, Leuca, embark on a perilous journey to uncover the truth behind the stranger's death. Amidst a web of motives and treachery, they unearth a series of events leading to a shocking betrayal that threatens the very heart of their tribe.\nWill their quest for justice expose the culprit in time, or is the village's fate sealed?\nPlease include an excerpt from the book\nIn the early morning hours, Jannon returns to the smithy after a night at his family home.\nAs Jannon opened the door, he heard a rustle in the dim interior. Someone moved inside. He froze in the doorway. \"Who's there?\"\n\"It's me,\" Garos answered. Jannon could barely make out the figure of the young lad sitting on his sleeping bench. \"When did you get up?\"\n\"Get up? What do you mean?\" Jannon asked.\n\"From the workbench.\" Even in the dim light, Jannon saw Garos' eyes grow wide as he stared at the table.\nJannon's eyes followed the boy's gaze. The light was beginning to filter through the window cover, revealing a dark shape on the workbench. Someone was sleeping on the top. Chills ran down his spine. \"Who is that?\"\n\"I t-t-thought it was you.\" Garos stuttered, pulling the fur tighter around him.\nAs Jannon crossed the room, a beam of light broke through the mist and shone through a slit in the hide covering. Jannon stiffened momentarily, stopping in his tracks. Then he slowly approached the other side of the workbench, not quite believing what he saw.\n\"Light a torch,\" he told Garos.\nThe young lad's face was pale as he crawled from under the pelts. But he quickly rushed to the shelf to grab a pine stick coated in pitch. He plunged it into the banked embers of the hearth. Flickering light illuminated the space immediately surrounding him. When Garos joined Jannon on the other side of the table, he sharply sucked in a breath.\nIn the light, it was clear — a man sprawled face-down on Jannon's workbench. A dagger stuck out of his back. Once again, red blotches splattered across the surface — but this time, it was blood. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The quintet includes pianist Sahun Sam Hong, violinists, Abi Fayette and Stephanie Zyzak, violist, Luther Warren, and cellist, Zachary Mowitz. Chesapeake Chamber Music patrons will remember Sahun Sam Hong and Zachary Mowitz as members of the Trio St. Bernard, the 2018 Lerman Gold Prize winner of the Chesapeake Chamber Music Competition\" the Easton-based music nonprofit said in a press release promoting the performance.\n\"I'm particularly excited for ensemble/132 to bring this delightfully eclectic program to Chesapeake Music. It shows so much of what chamber music can be. Every piece has something entirely unique to offer, whether it's Haydn's exquisitely and cleverly crafted trio, a dramatic cast of characters such as those in Schumann's Carnaval, Perkinson's thrilling blend of a jazz idiom with a classical approach to counterpoint and form, or Petrouchka with its timeless story, its folk dances, and its symphonic scope. It doesn't hurt that Sam's arrangements — Carnaval and Petrouchka — capture the essence of these wonderful pieces while bringing a new palette of colors that we all get to explore together,\" Cellist Zachary Mowitz said.\nEnsemble/132 is comprised of eleven chamber musicians. Marcy Rosen, Artistic Director of Chesapeake Music, is the artistic advisor to ensemble/132.\nFor more information and to purchase tickets, please visit the Chesapeake Music website at https://chesapeakemusic.org.

Advice to both teams — as the kids in the '70s and '80s used to say, \"give it your best shot.\" Our column this week will be recipes from the cities of former Super Bowl winners. Starting off will be two recipes from the cities of the two teams playing this weekend.\nSAN FRANCISCO SOURDOUGH BREAD\n4 ¾ cups bread flour (or more as needed), 3 tbsps white sugar, 2 ½ tsps salt, 1 package active dry yeast, 1 cup warm milk, 2 tbsps margarine (softened), 1 ½ cups sourdough starter, 1 extra large egg, 1 tbsp water, ¼ cup chopped onion. Combine 1 cup flour, sugar, salt and yeast in a large bowl. Add warm milk and margarine. Add in the starter mix. Mix in the remaining 3 3/4 cups of flour gradually; you may need to add more flour depending on the climate. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 8 to 10 minutes. Place dough into a greased bowl, turn once to the oil surface, and cover. Allow to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.\nPunch down dough; cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Divide dough in half and shape into two loaves. Place loaves on a greased baking pan. Allow to rise until doubled in volume, about one hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Stir together egg and water in a small bowl until well combined. Brush over the tops of loaves, then sprinkle with onion. Bake in the preheated oven until the loaves are golden brown and cooked through, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a loaf should read 190 degrees.\nKANSAS CITY BRISKET BURNT ENDS\n1 Chuck Roast (about 3-4 lbs), 2 tbsp favorite BBQ seasoning, 1 tbsp canola oil. SAUCE: ¾ cup ketchup, ½ cup apple cider vinegar, 1.5 tbsp hot sauce, 1 tbsp brown sugar, ½ tbsp garlic paste, ½ tbsp Worcestershire sauce, salt to taste. Cube your chuck roast into 1\" size cubes and place in a bowl. Lather with canola oil and then season with BBQ seasoning. Place the cubes onto a baking tray with about ½ inch separation between each cube. Place in the fridge for 1 hour to set, then let come to room temperature 15 minutes before cooking. Preheat a grill or smoker using a two-zone fire with Charcoal to 275 degrees. Add some hickory chunks or chips for added smoke flavor.\nPlace the beef onto the smoker to cook for about 1.5 hours until they begin to soften. As the beef smokes, heat up a medium high fire for the BBQ sauce. Add a skillet with the ingredients for the BBQ sauce and let simmer until thickened. Once warm and well incorporated, pull the BBQ sauce off the heat to cool. After 1.5 hours on the smoker, pull the beef off and place into a medium size foil bin. Top the burnt ends with the BBQ sauce and mix around. Cover the bin with aluminum foil and place back on the smoker to cook for another 2.5 hours. Add more BBQ sauce if needed so that there is a decent amount of liquid in order to break down the burnt ends. Once the burnt ends are tender and can easily break apart, pull them off and let cool for 10 minutes. Toss the cooled burnt ends in some of the foil bins sauce, season with a little more BBQ seasoning. To make the most authentic burnt ends at home, you will need a smoker, but you can make them on a gas or charcoal grill.\nNEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER\n4 slices bacon, 1 large onion (chopped), 2 celery ribs (chopped), 1 clove garlic (minced), 1/4 tsp dried thyme or 1 tsp fresh, 3 small potatoes (peeled and cubed), 1 cup water, 1 (8 ounce) bottle clam juice, 1 tbsp chicken base, 2 cups half and half (divided), 1/3 cup all-purpose flour, 2 (6 ½ ounce) cans chopped clams undrained, salt and freshly ground black pepper. In a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat, add bacon and cook until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove bacon from the pot, drain on paper towels, and crumble. Set aside. To the bacon fat, add onion and celery and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and thyme until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\nStir in potatoes, water, clam juice and chicken base. Bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered until potatoes are tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 cup half-and-half and flour until smooth. Gradually stir into soup, return to a simmer, and cook until thickened, about 1 to 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with salt and pepper (I like 1 tsp salt and ½ tsp pepper). Add clams and their juice and remaining 1 cup half-and-half and stir until heated through, about 1 minute. Garnish each serving with bacon and oyster crackers.\nMARYLAND CRAB SOUP\n2 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes, 3 cups water, 2 cups beef broth, 1 cup fresh lima beans, 1 cup frozen corn kernels, 1 cup sliced carrots, 2 tbsps chopped onion, 2 tbsps Old Bay Seasoning (or if you are like this girl you'll need more), 1 gallon water, 10 blue crab claws (steamed), 1 pound blue crabmeat. Place stewed tomatoes, 3 cups water, beef broth, lima beans, corn, sliced carrots, chopped onion and Old Bay seasoning in a 4-quart pot. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; cover and cook for 5 minutes. Bring 1 gallon water to a boil in a large pot. Add crab claws and boil for 6 minutes; drain. Stir crabmeat and boiled crab claws into tomato and vegetable mixture. Cover and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Serve hot. Adding a little Worcestershire sauce also gives this an extra kick.\nPHILLY CHEESECAKE\n1 ½ cups Honey Maid graham cracker crumbs, ⅓ cup butter or margarine (melted), 3 tbsps sugar, 4 (8 ounce) packages Philadelphia cream cheese (softened), 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 4 eggs. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Mix crumbs, butter and 3 tbsps sugar until combined; press firmly onto the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Beat cream cheese, 1 cup sugar and vanilla in a mixing bowl until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed until just blended. Pour over the crust. Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, about 55 minutes. Loosen cake from the pan rim; cool before removing rim. Refrigerate for 4 hours before serving.\nCAJUN SEAFOOD BOIL\n3 quarts water, 1 (12-ounce) can of beer (optional but highly recommended and can be non alcoholic), 3 tbsps Cajun seasoning, 1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning, hot sauce to taste, 1 medium yellow onion (roughly sliced into half-moons), 1 large lemon (cut into wedges) plus more for serving, 12 ounces andouille sausage (sliced into rounds), 1 lb baby potatoes (red, gold or a mix of both), 1 lb pre-cooked snow crab leg clusters (fresh or frozen), 1 — 1 ½ lbs jumbo shrimp, (deveined, shell-on or peeled), 4–6 ears sweet corn on the cob. In an extra large stockpot or dutch oven (about 10 quarts or larger) over medium-high heat, combine the water and beer (if using). Bring the liquid to a boil. Then season the boil with the Cajun seasoning, Old Bay seasoning, and a few dashes of hot sauce. Add the sliced onion and lemon wedges into the pot. Stir all the ingredients well to thoroughly combine. Let the mixture boil for 15 minutes. Carefully add the andouille sausage rounds and baby potatoes into the pot, stirring well to fully combine with the boil. Let the andouille and potatoes cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are just about fork-tender. Gently nestle the snow crab clusters into the pot along with the shrimp and corn on the cob. Be sure that everything is fully submerged under the boil and carefully stir to ensure all ingredients are well combined. Continue boiling for another 5 to 7 minutes, cooking until the shrimp is pink.\nMay the best team win! \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Included among the group named in honor of King's College in Cambridge, England, where the original group was formed are two baritones, two countertenors, one bass and one tenor.\n\"This is the group's first time in St. Mary's City in recent history,\" Johnathan Howard, who sings bass for the group, said. \"And I know that the group is very excited to perform here as the first stop on this month's tour of the United States of America. The group has an extraordinary history of performing in Maryland, and it always feels like a homecoming when we land in the state for the first time after an extended absence.\"\nHaving earned the reputation of having established the veritable gold standard among a cappella singing group's on the world's greatest stages for over 50 years, The King's Singers will only make a brief stop at the St. Mary's College of Maryland for one concert. Their travels resume almost immediately with concerts slated every two days through the remainder of the month before making the long trek for a performance in Nanjing, China on March 9.\n\"This concert is a deliberate mix of music from lots of favorite recent projects,\" Howard added. \"Including music from our 'Finding Harmony' album that celebrates songs from brought people together throughout history, our 'Tom & Will' album [which includes music by two of England's greatest renaissance composers] and 'When You Wish Upon a Star.' The concert is designed to feel quite a wild ride, and we're really excited to take the audience on the journey with us.\"\nRenowned largely for their unrivaled technique, musicianship and versatility, which stem from both the group's rich heritage and its drive to bring an extraordinary range of new and unique works, collaborations and recordings to life, The King's Singers extensive discography has led to numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, an Emmy Award and a place in \"Gramophone\" magazine's inaugural Hall of Fame. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "\"The subtle beauty of sitting still': Glen Phillips, Shawn Mullins at Rams Head on Stage\n\n February 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 489\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Glen Phillips — who was the lead singer and main songwriter for Toad the Wet Sprocket — and Shawn Mullins will perform at Rams Head on Stage on Thursday, Feb. 22.The show starts at 8 p.m with doors opening at 7 p.m.. Tickets are $39.50.\n\"During his years as lead singer and main songwriter of Toad the Wet Sprocket, Glen Phillips helped to create the band's elegant folk/pop sound with honest, introspective lyrics that forged a close bond with their fans. When Toad went on hiatus, he launched a solo career with Abulum, and stayed busy collaborating with other artists on various projects including Mutual Admiration Society, with members of Nickel Creek and Remote Tree Children, an experimental outing with John Morgan Askew,\" Rams Head said in a write up on the upcoming concert.\n\"Until recently, I've seldom allowed myself to stay in one place for very long,\" Phillips said in the Rams Head announcement, explaining the genesis of his new album, There is So Much Here. \"I was lucky during the COVID lockdown to move in with my girlfriend, now fiancée, and to stay home for the longest stretch I've had since the birth of my daughter, 20 years ago. I began noticing the little things. After a life of travel and seeking out peak experiences, I began to appreciate the subtle beauty of sitting still.\"\nPhillips continues:\n\"I've been playing a songwriting game with Texas folksinger Matt The Electrician, for about ten years. Every Friday, he sends out a title. We have a week to write a song that includes it. The process allows me to write songs I wouldn't write on my own. When my friend John [Morgan Askew] asked me to come up to his studio and make music, I said, 'Yes!' I collected a bunch of the new songs and headed up to Bocce Studios, in Vancouver, Washington. John invited drummer Ji Tanzer and bass player — / — multi-instrumentalist Dave Depper along. When we started playing, I wasn't sure we were making an album, but as the process unfolded, the songs began to make sense to me,\" he said, according to Rams Head.\n\"After a series of indie releases and growing buzz in the Atlanta music scene, Shaw Mullins' critical and commercial breakthrough came when 1998 Soul's Core shot him to fame on the strength of Grammy-nominated No. 1 hit, \"Lullaby\" followed by AAA/Americana No. 1 hit \"Beautiful Wreck\" from 2006's 9th Ward Pickin' Parlor,\" the concert announcement reads. \"Shawn revisited the music of Soul's Core by recording two new versions of the album. He calls this Soul's Core Revival. This is not a remix or a remaster of the original, but rather brand new recordings with new arrangements of the songs — one album is stripped down solo performances, some on guitar, some on piano and maybe one a cappella and the second is a new studio recording with his full band, Soul Carnival.\"\nFor more: https://www.ramsheadonstage.com/ \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "The most American pop culture phenomenon of them all\n\n February 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Katherine Meizel The Conversation | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1152\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n \"American Idol\" was \"born\" exactly nine months after 9/11. The timing was significant, because since its premiere on June 11, 2002, the show has become an integral part of the country's coping strategy — a kind of guidebook for our difficult entry into the 21st century.By carefully curating a distinctly American mix tape of music, personal narratives and cultural doctrine, \"American Idol\" has painted a portrait of who we think we are, especially in the aftermath of tragedy, war and economic turmoil.\nAs the show concludes after 15 seasons, it's worth looking at how the past and present collided to create a cultural phenomenon — and how we're seeing shades of the show's influence in today's chaotic presidential race.\nAll our myths bundled into one\nThe premise of \"American Idol\" — the idea that an ordinary person might be recognized as extraordinary — is firmly rooted in a national myth of meritocracy.\nThis national narrative includes the dime-novel, rags-to-riches fairy tales of Horatio Alger, which were intended to uplift Americans struggling to get by after the Civil War. Then there was the American Dream catchphrase — first coined in 1931 by James Truslow Adams in his book \"The Epic of America\" — that promoted an ideal of economic mobility during the hopeless years of the Depression.\nIndeed, decades before host Ryan Seacrest handed out his first golden ticket to the first golden-throated farm girl waiting tables while waiting to be \"discovered,\" we'd been going to Hollywood in our dreams and on screen.\nThe show has shown us archetypes of immigrant narratives, like when Season Three contestant Leah Labelle spoke of her Bulgarian family's defection to North America during Communist rule. It has demonstrated how to rely on faith in the face of hardship, exemplified by Fantasia Barrino's victory song, \"I Believe,\" performed with a gospel choir. Meanwhile, it served as a stage for patriotic passion, broadcasting two performances of Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the U.S.A.\" when the United States entered Iraq in 2003. Meanwhile, the many \"Idol Gives Back\" specials remind us of American philanthropic values.\nThe show has celebrated failure as both a necessary stumbling block and a launchpad to fame. Many singers needed to audition year after year before they earned their chance to compete. For others, such as William Hung, their televised rejection brought fame and opportunity anyway.\n\"American Idol\" has also served as a course in American music history, featuring discrete genres like Southern soul and Southern rock, together with newer, blurrier categories like pop-country and pop-punk.\nMaking the old new again\nIn one sense, \"American Idol\"'s format was nothing new. In fact, British entertainment executives Simon Fuller and Simon Cowell — who shepherded in a 21st-century version of the \"British Invasion\" — fashioned their juggernaut show as a new take on old business models.\nThere is something distinctly American about contestants standing in a Ford-sponsored spotlight, judges sipping from Coca-Cola glasses, and viewers sitting in front of television screens texting their votes on AT&T phones. The show's conspicuous commercialization recalls the earliest days of television, when programs were owned and produced by advertisers. And \"Idol,\" like that early programming, was intended to be \"appointment television,\" bringing families together at the same time every week.\n\"Idol\"'s production model is also a throwback. It's structured like Berry Gordy's Motown — a one-stop fame factory that offers stars a package of coaching, polishing, a band, album production and promotion.\nThe format also draws from amateur regional and national radio competitions of the early 20th century. (Frank Sinatra got his start winning one on \"Major Bowe's Amateur Hour\" in 1935, with the Hoboken Four.) Another influence is the half-ridiculous and totally political \"Eurovision Song Contest,\" the hugely popular and mercilessly mocked annual televised event that pits nation against nation in (almost) friendly singing competition.\nA vote that counts?\n\"Eurovision,\" which originated in 1955 as a test of transnational network capabilities and postwar international relations, introduced telephone voting a few years before \"Idol\" premiered.\nAnd like Eurovision, the impact of \"American Idol\" extends far beyond our annual crowning of a new pop star. The show's rise has taken place at a time when the boundaries between entertainment, politics and business have become increasingly blurred.\nSeason after season, \"American Idol\" fans have placed votes for their favorite contestants — options which, somewhat like our presidential candidates, have been carefully cultivated by a panel of industry experts looking for a sure bet.\nThe initial success of \"Idol\" heralded not only an era of similar television programming, but also a new era in which we're given the opportunity to \"vote,\" whether it's for dum-dum pop flavors or the world's most influential people.\nConsidering these trends, it's not so farfetched to suggest that the wild popularity of shows like \"American Idol\" played some role in setting the blinding chrome stage and slightly \"pitchy\" tone for this year's election.\nIt isn't just that Donald Trump presided over \"The Apprentice,\" a reality competition that rode in on \"American Idol\"'s coattails.\nHis persona also seems to meet the same sadistic public need satisfied by original \"Idol\" judge Simon Cowell: the executive heir, the imperious arbiter of taste who owes his fortune at least as much to his superiority complex as to any financial acumen. At the same time, personas like Cowell and Trump deign to give an ordinary, hardworking American a chance.\nThat conceit, though, is mitigated cleverly by both moguls: they capitalize on what Cowell has identified as a universal desire to feel important.\nThe crux of their personal appeal is that they understand that everyone wants to matter, and we are willing — as TV viewers or as citizens — to risk an awful lot just to feel like we do. We each want to imagine our own sky-high potential, and laugh in relief when we see others who will never get off the ground. We want to be judge and jury, but also be judged and juried.\n\"Idol\" gives Americans permission to judge each other, to feel like our opinion makes a difference. Trump's unfiltered rhetoric has done something similar, giving his supporters implicit and sometimes explicit permission to mock, dismiss, exclude and even attack others based on racial and ethnic identity, religion or ability.\nAnd so now, as \"Idol\" makes its final journey from Studio 36 to the Dolby Theatre, we deliberate over whose victory will herald the last \"Seacrest — out.\"\nWhatever happens, and whichever way our presidential election goes, the U.S. is on the brink of something new, a major cultural shift. Wherever we're going, \"Idol\" has served its purpose, and we don't need it in the same desperate way anymore.\nI think, though, that we'll always be searching for the next big thing. And we'll always be glad we had a moment like this.\nKatherine Meizel is an associate professor of ethnomusicology at Bowling Green State University.\n(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

There is a contested will at stake that is worth millions, but with every passing moment, there are more people claiming the dough.This launches the hijinks for \"Fond Farewell,\" a murder mystery dinner theater that played to a packed house at the Caroline Country Club on Friday and Saturday nights. According to Debby Bennett, chair of the murder mystery committee, \"people kept calling asking to purchase tickets after our deadline. We sadly had to say no to them.\"\nThere was a bombshell vamp and a scheming personal assistant, and there was a cowgirl cop trying to figure it all out.\nAnd the audience was laughing while trying to figure out who is the rightful heir to Ben Fullman's fortune. This is all complicated when a surprise guest shows up on death's door with a knife sticking out of his bloodied gut. It was all in good fun, and the crowd was fully invested in the broad humor.\nIt was an audience participation show. Black \"funeral\" bands were given out to audience members at the door, and those who wore them opted to be included as part of the play. The actors were in character before the play started and even stayed in character during the dinner that followed their performance.\nKendall Teague, a planning committee member for the event, called the fundraiser \"an exceptional success.\"\n\"The unexpected plot twists, hilarious dialogue and high-level audience participation brought on roars of laughter that filled the room all evening,\" Teague said. \"In fact, several attendees shared with us that they hadn't laughed that hard in a very long time.\"\nThis was a successful fundraiser for the Caroline County Arts Council, which was a co-presenter with the Caroline County Public Library. There were several sponsors, including Simpkins Roofing and Siding, Foam Works, Big Bass USA, the Foundry, Shore United Bank, Hillside Coffee Roasters and On Your Mark.\nAll the actors volunteered their time, as did Director Keith L. Shaffer.\n\"I thought both nights were fabulous. It was so fun,\" Bennett said. \"The food was great. The Culinary Center always does such a terrific job.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Bridgerton Season 3: Teasers, Trailers, and the Tale So Far\n\n March 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Ananyaa Bhowmik Wealth of Geeks | Section: Entertainment \n \n 713\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Netflix has announced that season three of Bridgerton was coming. It also revealed a twist — the season will be a two-parter, unlike any of the ones before.The first episode of Bridgerton season three is all set to release this May, way sooner than its gentle fans could have hoped. Based on the Bridgerton books, the series has given us a fake dating arc and an enemies-to-lovers saga. Now, it seems it is the season of #Polin, i.e., Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton, as they go from friends to lovers, from bashful novices to experts in the game of love.\nWhat We Know So Far\nSince the announcement of the imminent arrival of season three of the Regency romance series, updates have been pouring in. In the announcement, Lady Whistledown revealed the most dramatic secret — the third season's release date. The first installment of new season drops on May 16. The first part will consist of episodes one to four, while episodes five to eight, arrives just one month later, on June 13.\nProduction of the new season began in the summer of 2022. The official Instagram account posted a reel of the cast all set and ready to step back into the Regency era. In the reel, Jonathan Bailey, who plays the rakish Anthony Bridgerton, makes a hand gesture that the other cast members soon copy. At the end of the reel, Nicola Coughlan and Luke Newton — who play Penelope Weatherington and Colin Bridgerton, respectively — jump onto a carriage together, foreshadowing the era of #Polin.\nBut that's not the only update. On Feb. 1, an official teaser offered a sneak peek into the lives of the characters, namely that of Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton. Together, they seem to be engaged in a sort of play-flirtation, with the lady revealing what she would say to woo him if he were a suitor. Another update soon followed, and on Feb. 14, the first official clip debuted, presumably of the first few minutes of the new season.\nIn it, Penelope confronts Colin when the latter says that he misses the former. She blames him for being cruel, claiming he would never consider courting her in front of the ton. As it dawns on Colin that she knows about him humiliating her, for whatever reason, Penelope walks resolutely away, apparently leaving all of it — including Colin — behind. But the story, gentle reader, may not be over just yet.\nA Season of #Polin and #Peloise\nIf the exclusive photos Netflix released are any indication, a roller-coaster ride awaits. Anthony Bridgerton and Kate Sharma — the star couple from last season — still seem very much in love. But the younger male Bridgerton seems to be struggling with his feelings.\nSo far, it seems, Penelope was just his sister's best friend and a close confidant who just happened to be female. But these dynamics are all set to change this season.\nEloise Bridgerton — now aware that Penelope Weathering is none other than Lady Whistledown herself — cannot forgive the latter for tainting her reputation and pretending to be her friend still. Conversely, Colin realizes Penelope is not just his sister's best friend but something else entirely. She is someone he holds dear, but whether those feelings are romantic is something he must understand before it's too late.\nChances are that Colin will learn Penelope's entire Lady Whistledown-sized secret soon. It would be interesting to see how this discovery affects their relationship, especially once he realizes she had a major role in Marina Thompson's downfall. This threw a wrench into Colin's plans of marrying her.\nOn the other hand, Penelope must realize that she has put Colin on a pedestal. She had always seen him as this perfect prince who could do no wrong. But his supposed cruelty at the party — when he disses Penelope in front of a gaggle of partygoers — shatters her illusion. It will be interesting to see where she goes from that point onward. For now, it seems what Penelope needs is not a handsome beau; Penelope must value herself and see beyond the opinions of the town and even those of the best friend she has been in love with since the start.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The average consumer will shell out in excess of $192, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF).\nThe top planned expenses included food, clothing, gifts, candy, and flowers, totaling a staggering $24 billion in collective spending.\n\"Easter endures as an important holiday for many Americans, signifying new beginnings and a time of celebration with friends and family,\" NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay says.\nAs Easter approaches, the financial strain for the hosts of family gatherings tempers the excitement of reuniting with loved ones. Here are four practical strategies to help you stretch your dollar further.\nPlan Your Menu in Advance\nBy planning, you can create an abundant spread without spending a fortune.\nShop early to take advantage of sales and coupons that may come up between now and the day.\nSpeaking to Bustle, culinary influencer Stephanie Nass said, \"Plan the menu as soon as you decide you're hosting. If you need specialty ingredients, source them early on. Dry goods and alcohol can be purchased as far out as you want. Produce can be purchased three to four days before the event. Meats, fish, and flowers should be purchased the day of or the day before. Bread must be fresh-fresh.\"\nA 2024 study by Numerator determined only 14% of Easter celebrators intend to buy alcohol. Fewer partiers planned to purchase alcohol for Easter out of nearly all annual holidays, with consumer estimates comparable only to Mother's Day. Hosts shouldn't feel obligated to provide an extensive drink selection.\n\"Having a bar adds an unnecessary level of complication,\" Nass told Bustle. Instead, she advises picking a signature cocktail or beverage for the event to minimize costs and fuss. Include reference to planned drink offerings when inviting guests. Advance notice will allow them to bring drinks if they prefer something else.\nAnother cost-effective alternative is hosting a potluck-style gathering where guests bring dishes to share. Hosts can elevate these by making them a themed degustation — a sampling or tasting — and assigning each guest an appetizer, side dish, or dessert. Have fun introducing the dishes each guest brings and exploring new flavor combinations.\nAnother way to keep costs low is hosting a brunch instead of dinner. Brunch foods are more affordable and easier to prepare in advance, allowing hosts to spend less time in the kitchen and more time enjoying guests' company. Consider a mix of sweet and savory dishes — quiches, tofu scrambles, fruit salads, vegan yogurt, banana bread, and pastries — to satisfy various tastes and dietary preferences.\nBe Selective About Candy\nWhen it comes to candy, remember that less is often more. Less than one quarter of shoppers plan to purchase less candy, and 20% will switch from real eggs to plastic.\nUsing a mix of chocolate and reusable plastic eggs in an egg hunt is a cost-effective way to keep costs down without sacrificing the thrill of the hunt. Consider buying more affordable chocolate eggs or looking for discounts and coupons before the holiday to get a bulk deal.\nOf course, you can still indulge without completely cutting back. Reallocate some of the cost savings by investing in one high-quality chocolate bunny or large egg for each child or guest as a special treat.\nDIY Decorations\nFlowers are collectively the fifth highest expenditure at $1.8 billion. While it's tempting to go all out with decorations and spring flowers, setting a budget and prioritizing essential items is essential to avoid overspending.\nFocus on key decorative elements like tablecloths and candles, or repurpose items you own, such as vases, jars, and decorative accents, to save money and minimize waste.\nDIY decorations can also be a fantastic activity for the group on the day, as most people like to play an active role at a party. Boston event planner Bryan Rafanelli told Oprah.com, \"I like to put a group of my friends together; I call them my hospitality team … The bigger the party, the bigger the hospitality team.\"\nUse this logic to encourage your guests to create fun, homemade decorations. Think paper chains, painted eggs, origami decorations, or flower arrangements. Not only does this take the pressure off you to decorate, but it also keeps your guests engaged — a fun activity for kids and adults alike.\nTrim Your Guest List\nWhen hosting a budget-friendly Easter celebration, one effective strategy is to keep your guest list selective. According to FinanceBuzz, 14% of people plan to have fewer guests for dinner.\nThe upside: fewer people means your budget can go a lot farther. \"When your party is smaller, you can really splurge on the little details,\" Nass points out. Rather than inviting acquaintances or distant relatives, prioritize inviting close friends and family members who will truly appreciate and enjoy the festivities.\nKeeping the guest list small and intimate allows you to create meaningful connections and shared experiences without breaking the bank.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But what do you do when dietary restrictions complicate travel? For gluten-free people, the world of travel may not be as complicated as they think.\nWith the constant rise in gluten intolerance, more people are demanding gluten-free options when they travel abroad, creating an entirely new sector of business for countries that may not have even considered it in decades past.\nAccording to Global Market Insights, the gluten-free market brought in 12.3 billion dollars in 2023 and is projected to increase an average of 10.1% per year through 2032. Europe has a 6.9 billion dollar gluten-free industry, also growing each year. But gluten-free foods aren't mainstream enough for people to eat with confidence anywhere they go. At least not yet.\nNavigating the Airport\nTSA allows flyers to bring dry food and snacks through the airport in their carry-on. Rather than risk the possible difficulty of finding gluten-free foods in an airport, consider bringing homemade gluten-free snacks. Grab some gluten-free crackers, fresh fruit, or gluten-free granola bars and toss them in your bag.\nWhile people should still research gluten-free restaurants in each airport, having something on hand will save a bad situation in a pinch.\nEating out With Celiac or Gluten Sensitivity\nWhen dining out, question servers about ingredients used to ensure they are gluten-free. Some surprising foods contain gluten, so asking the waitstaff before ordering is critical. In some cases, it can be appropriate to ask to speak to the chef.\nEmese Maczko of Eco Lodges Anywhere says, \"I think it is easier to eat gluten-free than it was 10-20 years ago. But you still need to plan ahead. You cannot just wing it. I never go to a place without having a list of places I can eat with locations saved on my phone. Cities are easier since there are more choices.\n\" Road trips and the countryside are harder. Despite Italy being famous for its pizza and pasta, I was surprised by the number and quality of gluten-free foods I found in restaurants. But I searched them online in advance. I would not have found them by just walking around.\"\nWhen possible, book a room or place to stay with a kitchen. Even a small kitchen can help when gluten-free foods are hard to find. A quick trip to a local market offers an abundance of gluten-free, fresh foods you can cook where you are staying.\nGluten-Free Friendly Destinations\nOrganizations have popped up worldwide to offer help to those traveling with celiac disease. Explorers can reach out to them directly for assistance in navigating their country with Celiac disease or gluten sensitivities.\nItaly for the Win\nRome, Italy, was named the number one choice for gluten-free eating by Your Celiac Guide.\nItaly, as a whole, is making strides in providing gluten-free options thanks to its Associazione Italiana Celiachia APS organization, known in English as the Italian Celiac Association. An organization that trains restaurants countrywide to cater safely to celiac needs. They provide training and workshops to chefs on cooking techniques, cross-contamination, and more.\nMore Gluten-Free Friendly Destinations\nLondon, England, with its fifteen dedicated gluten-free restaurants and bakeries, is another excellent choice for those with gluten issues. Their celiac organization, called Coeliac UK, does the same as its Italian counterpart, though without being government-backed.\nDublin, Ireland, and Edinburgh, Scotland, in addition to Hungary and Australia, deserve recognition.\nBella Bucchiotti, a travel writer at xoxoBella, says, \"As an avid traveler and someone with celiac disease, I found that Greece, French Polynesia, and Germany were great for finding gluten-free options. When you're traveling abroad, it's smart to do some research on the local food and traditional gluten-free dishes beforehand.\n\"While I've usually been able to find gluten-free food in most countries, I did face some difficulties in rural parts of Thailand and Peru due primarily to language barriers. To deal with those situations, I always bring gluten-free snacks and cards explaining my dietary needs in the local language, which helps me communicate in restaurants.\"\nDon't Stay Home\nGluten issues should never prevent people from enjoying global travel. Though gluten intolerance can add an extra step to excursions, those with food sensitivities shouldn't stay at home. With some forethought, planning, and research, travelers with dietary restrictions can find safe, gluten-free meals anywhere their heart might take them.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Did you fall for these well-known April Fools' Day jokes?\n\n March 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Dan Morris Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1139\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n April Fools' Day has become a global playground for brands and media alike. Each year brings a new batch of ingenious hoaxes that catch the unwary off guard and offer a moment of levity in our sometimes all-too-serious world.It's a day where the rulebook is thrown out the window, and the absurd becomes momentarily plausible, inviting everyone to share a laugh at marvelously executed jokes. This tradition of trickery has given rise to some of the most memorable pranks, from fake announcements that baffled the masses to products so bizarre they could only be a joke.\nThe following tales of tomfoolery not only highlight the fun that can be had but also illustrate the sheer creativity that April Fools' Day can inspire. Did they fool you?\nBBC's spaghetti trees\nThe BBC's Spaghetti Tree hoax is a timeless April Fools' Day prank that tricked a nation. It aired on April 1, 1957, on the BBC's \"Panorama\" program.\nNarrated by the respected Richard Dimbleby, the segment showed a Swiss family harvesting spaghetti from trees, credibly explaining that a mild winter and the eradication of the spaghetti weevil had led to an exceptional spaghetti crop. The footage of women delicately plucking strands of spaghetti from branches and then laying them out to dry captivated viewers, many of whom were unfamiliar with how spaghetti was made or where it came from, given its rarity in the UK's diet at the time.\nThe prank's success was monumental, prompting hundreds of viewers to inquire about growing their own spaghetti trees. The BBC's reputation for serious journalism lent the story an air of credibility, making the reveal that it was a hoax all the more delightful and embarrassing for those duped.\nTaco Liberty Bell\nThe Taco Liberty Bell prank is one of the most memorable April Fools' Day jokes in American history, carried out by Taco Bell on April 1, 1996.\nIn a bold move, the fast-food chain announced in major newspapers across the country that it had purchased the Liberty Bell, a cherished symbol of American independence located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The company claimed it was renaming the historic icon the \"Taco Liberty Bell\" as part of a strategy to help the national debt. This audacious announcement stirred a mix of disbelief, outrage and confusion among the public, many of whom failed to recognize the date and took the news at face value.\nThe prank quickly became a national sensation, leading to scores of calls to Taco Bell and the National Park Service from concerned citizens and history buffs alike. The uproar lasted until Taco Bell disclosed later that day that it was just an April Fools' prank, reassuring the public that the Liberty Bell had not been sold and remained in its rightful place.\nSTIHL Bonsai Chainsaw\nStihl's Bonsai Pruning Chainsaw prank is another clever entry in the annals of April Fools' Day lore. On April 1, 2017, the chainsaw manufacturer announced the launch of a revolutionary new product: a tiny chainsaw designed specifically for the intricate task of bonsai tree pruning.\nThis so-called bonsai chainsaw was said to combine Stihl's cutting-edge technology with the delicate art of bonsai maintenance, supposedly offering precision cutting capabilities that could navigate the nuanced curves and tight spaces of miniature trees with ease.\nThe announcement was accompanied by convincing product specifications and promotional materials, showing an arborist in full protective equipment using a ridiculously small chainsaw to prune a bonsai tree.\nDuolingo's emoji course\nDuolingo's emoji course prank, launched on April 1, 2017, successfully tapped into the digital zeitgeist, fooling users and emoji enthusiasts with the promise of mastering the \"language\" of emojis.\nThe language-learning platform announced it was introducing a comprehensive course designed to help users become fluent in emoji, presenting it as the newest and most contemporary language offering. The announcement was detailed with course outlines, lesson plans and testimonials from supposed beta testers who praised the course's effectiveness in helping them communicate solely through emojis.\nThe prank's believability was bolstered by Duolingo's reputation for offering courses in a wide variety of languages, some of which are endangered or constructed, adding a layer of credibility to the announcement. Many users and tech enthusiasts were momentarily tricked into believing they could actually enroll in a course to achieve proficiency in emojis.\nIKEA's highchair for dogs\nOn April Fools' Day 2011, IKEA announced the HUNDSTOL Highchair for dogs, an easy-to-believe prank that captured the imagination of pet owners worldwide.\nThe fictional highchair was made to integrate dogs into the family dining experience, featuring a unique design tailored to canine needs. It boasted custom features such as holes for the dog's tail to ensure a comfortable seating position, an integrated bowl for food or water at the table level, and a stylish aesthetic consistent with IKEA's minimalist design philosophy. The prank was detailed with mock-up images and specifications that lent it a veneer of authenticity, suggesting that IKEA had genuinely considered the dining needs of pet family members.\nThe public's response to the HUNDSTOL Highchair prank was a mix of amusement and disappointment, as many people were initially fooled into believing the product was real due to the convincing presentation and IKEA's reputation for innovative product design. Social media platforms buzzed with excitement from dog owners who expressed eagerness to purchase the highchair, sharing the announcement and tagging friends.\nUpon realizing it was a prank, reactions ranged from laughter and admiration for IKEA's creativity to expressions of genuine disappointment from those who had hoped to integrate their pets more fully into family meal times.\nApril Fools' Day pranks\nApril Fools' Day serves as a yearly reminder not to take everything at face value, inviting people from all walks of life to partake in a global tradition of laughter and light-hearted deception.\nGabriela Covay, Founder and Managing Director at Bright Valley Marketing shared, \"These April Fools' pranks really show us the magic of PR campaigns that grab your attention and don't let go. Many of these pranks were so surprising, so out-there, that you just had to share them with someone else. It's a smart move for brands to jump on days like April Fools' to get their name out there.\"\nThese examples not only showcase the boundless creativity and sense of humor of brands and organizations but also highlight the public's willingness to believe the unbelievable, if only for a moment.\nThese pranks, ranging from the blatantly absurd to the cleverly convincing, underscore the day's spirit: A pause in the everyday where the fantastic becomes momentarily feasible, and the world unites in the universal language of laughter. As we reflect on these tales of tomfoolery, we're reminded of the importance of humor in creating shared moments of joy and the enduring charm of a well-crafted April Fools' joke.\nDaniel Morris is the founder ofFire and Saw, a blog that focuses on chainsaws, wood stoves, fireplaces, axes and related topics.

    "title": "Pack a basket of flavor for National Picnic Day",
    "date": "2024-03-29",
    "author": "Cindy Rainey Food Drink Life",
    "content": "Pack a basket of flavor for National Picnic Day\n\n March 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Cindy Rainey Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1113\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n With the winter quickly passing by and springtime approaching, there's no better way to welcome the season than with National Picnic Day on April 23. This cherished tradition invites you to savor the warmer weather by breathing in the fresh air and enjoying a delicious meal in nature.Whether lounging at a local park, basking on a sandy beach or reveling in the peace of your own backyard, a picnic is the perfect way to enjoy alfresco dining. Read on to find out how you can make this your best picnic yet.\nThe allure of al fresco dining\nPicnics are a break from the hustle of your everyday, offering a moment to relax and connect with the natural world. Their informality and simplicity make them accessible to everyone regardless of age or background. Moreover, the benefits of dining outdoors are numerous and enriching.\nSpeaking to the history of picnics, this is a tradition woven through times and cultures. Since the medieval hunting feast, picnics have been a canvas for social expression, adapting to the changing tides of culture. As explained by Saltwater Picnic Co, it was in the 19th century that picnics became a symbol of communal unity as people began gathering in public parks to share meals. This egalitarian spirit continues to inspire the cherished gatherings we still relish.\nAlong with their social benefit, the act of dining outdoors is a holistic experience that nourishes the body, mind and soul. According to the Smithsonian Magazine, proximity to nature and exposure to sunlight has been shown to elevate moods and reduce stress. The open air also encourages physical activity, turning a meal into an opportunity for bonding and rejuvenation.\nPicnic preparation\nPacking for the perfect picnic is both an art and a science. Consider carefully the unique demands of outdoor eating and the practicality of food transport.\nWhen choosing your menu, aim for dishes that hold well in containers without spillage and don't get soggy. Sturdy veggie and grain salads, wraps and pastries are excellent choices as they maintain their texture and flavor on the go. Items that can be served comfortably at any temperature, like pasta salads, cold cuts and cheese platters are a great option for excellent taste without the need for reheating.\nAs well, keep in mind the logistics of outdoor eating and select foods that aren't messy or don't require too much hardware to eat. Finger foods like sandwiches, skewers and hand pies are perfect for a utensil-free picnic experience. Likely, this food will also be out of refrigeration for a while, so choose safe dishes, avoiding things like mayonnaise and raw fish. Instead, choose vinegar-based dressings and vegetarian options to ensure food safety.\nMost importantly, make sure to include a variety of sweet and savory crowd pleasers to be enjoyed by a variety of tastes and dietary preferences. Gluten-free or vegan dessert options can be a great way to cater to all your guests needs.\nFood safety during outdoor eating\nFood safety is paramount when dining outdoors to ensure that this experience is enjoyable and safe. The challenges of maintaining food at safe temperatures and preventing contamination can be managed with careful planning and the right tools.\nKeep food chilled\nInvesting in a high-quality, insulated cooler to keep perishable items like meats and dairy chilled can safely increase the variety of your picnic grub. Using frozen water bottles as ice packs in your cooler has the dual purpose of keeping your food cold and providing a refreshing drink as they thaw.\nPrevent contamination\nSegregating cooked and raw foods using individual containers prevents cross-contamination. In particular, using airtight containers ensures that your food is safe from outside contamination and also avoids spills and leaks. Most importantly, using sanitizers to keep your hands and surfaces clean helps to reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses.\nPacking and serving smart\nWhen using a cooler, place items you will eat last at the bottom of the cooler to minimize the time they are exposed to warm temperatures. Similarly, use insulated thermos for hot foods and promptly dispose of dishes that have been left out for more than a couple hours.\nMaking the most of National Picnic Day\nTo make the most of this day is more than just enjoying delicious food; it's about creating an experience that will be remembered fondly. Selecting the perfect location and adding an element of fun is key to creating long-lasting memories and starting traditions with your family.\nChoosing the perfect location\nThe ideal picnic spot is one that seamlessly blends natural beauty with convenience. The obvious and popular choice is local parks, which often offer amenities like tables and restrooms with picnicking in mind. As well, the open green spaces and equal access to shade offer a safe way to enjoy the outdoors.\nOutside of public parks, beaches provide a scenic backdrop with the additional benefit of a refreshing swim. Community gardens can offer a unique, serene and lesser-used setting for picnics surrounded by lush plant life. Least considered, but arguably the most convenient, is your own backyard which can easily and harmoniously be transformed into a personal and welcoming picnic haven.\nIncorporating fun and games\nAdding games to your picnic can help to turn a simple meal into an engaging and memorable outdoor event. Classic outdoor games like Frisbee or disc golf require minimal equipment and can be enjoyed by all ages. Similarly, sack races and tug-of-war can be played with household items and foster team spirit.\nInteractive games like picnic blanket bingo, where guests mark off items they see around them, or a scavenger hunt that encourages exploration of the area, add an element of adventure. For those who prefer seated activities, bringing along a deck of cards or portable board games can provide entertainment without the need for physical exertion.\nEnjoying the springtime\nNational Picnic Day is more than just an excuse to enjoy a meal outdoors; it's a celebration of the simple pleasures in life. As the spring sun beckons, pack your basket with a feast of flavors, find your perfect spot and create lasting memories on this delightful day.\nTake advantage of the spring weather with a picnic, where the joys of combining good food, good company and the beauty of nature come together. Whether it's on April 23 or any other splendid spring day, let the spirit of National Picnic Day inspire you to savor the great outdoors in the most delicious way possible.\nCindy Rainey, an expert home cook with more than 40 years of general cooking experience and 10 years as a plant-based eater, is the creative force behindVeggie Fun Kitchen, a vegan recipe blog.

    "content": "Fair Hill family and its 'star' pet dog featured on television show\n\n April 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1116\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n All five members of the Sottnick family in Fair Hill, Maryland made their television debut this week. But the star of the show was the family's beloved pet Corgi — Ollie.Wizard of Paws, an animal-niche program that airs on BYUtv, Hulu and Disney+, featured the Sottnicks and 3-year-old Ollie on a 27-minute Season 6 segment that premiered on Sunday (April 14).\nDerrick Campana, who owns and operates Bionic Pets in Sterling, Virginia., is the Wizard of Paws host. Campana specializes in crafting custom-made prosthetics for animals with missing limbs.\nCampana has successfully created prosthetic limbs for an array of deformed animals, including foxes, goats, rabbits, ducks and all sorts of other birds and even an elephant in Thailand.\nThe gist of Wizard of Paws: On each episode, Campana and his film crew travel to the home of a selected family that owns a pet with a missing or deformed limb and then he builds a prosthetic designed exclusively for that animal.\nThrough on-camera interviews, owners of the handicapped pets tell their stories. The show's nail-biting climax always hinges on this: Will the pet accept or reject its new prosthetic and will it help the animal walk and run better?\nThe Sottnicks were selected for the show because Ollie was born with a deformed front limb because of condition known as ectrodactyly, a term used mostly by veterinarians. Laypeople commonly refer to it as \"split-foot\" or \"lobster claw.\"\n\"Ollie is basically a tripod,\" Kara Sottnick said, explaining that standing and walking was difficult for Ollie because both rely heavily on balance. \"He could actually run better than he could walk.\"\nThe Sottnicks also were picked because of the upbeat vibe that the family projected during a couple of Zoom interviews with Wizard of Paws producers, after Kara had emailed information about her family and Ollie as the first step in the process for show consideration.\n\"They are just as interested in the family's story as they are their pet's story,\" Kara said.\nIn addition to Kara, the Sottnick family includes her husband, Kris, who is an aviation inspector, and their three children — Gavin, 21, who works at Williams Chevrolet in Elkton; Abrey, 20, who works at Elkton-based Terumo Cardiovascular; and Kody, 17, who is a junior at Tri-State Christian Academy, also in Elkton.\n(In addition to Ollie, the non-human side of the Sottnick family includes two other pet dogs — 7-year-old Toby and 3-year-old Huxley, both of which are Cavalier King Charles Spaniels; and an outdoor cat named Little Pea.)\nBEHIND THE SCENES\nSo Campana and a seven-person film crew came to Fair Hill in October and spent five days at the Sottnick's home. Campana brought his mobile lab, so he could create the special prosthetic limb for Ollie on location while filming the Wizard of Paws segment that is cleverly and appropriately titled, \"Ollie, Ollie, Running Free.\"\nThe crew members filmed for four days, between eight to 10 hours each day before heading back to their hotel after every session. Filming also involved cameramen getting B-Roll away from the Sottnicks' property. The crew, for example, went to a historically-significant spot known as The Beehive on Telegraph Road (Route 273) in Fair Hill and filmed the annual Apple Butter Festival held by the Elk Creek Land Preservation Society.\n\"We absolutely fell in love with the film crew and Derrick (Campana). We became friends with them,\" Kara said. \"The sound guy is in a band out in L.A. On breaks, he and Gavin would go into our basement and jam together on the guitars and drums.\"\nKara made friends with the producer who hails from Australia and they still keep in touch through email and social media. Abrey and a personal assistant on the crew also hit it off, piquing her interest in that profession.\nThe crew brought breakfast for the Sottnicks every morning when they arrived and also treated them to lunch, with all that food coming from Cecil County restaurants. Crew members also provided cupcakes and sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Gavin when he turned 17 during the filming week.\nAfter the last day of filming, the Sottnicks, in turn, treated the crew to dinner at Schaefer's Canal House in Chesapeake City to show their appreciation. Earlier in that week, the Sottnicks also treated the crew members to cider doughnuts from Milburn Orchards near Elkton, providing another opportunity for them to sample local food favorites. \"They loved the cider doughnuts,\" Kara said.\nCampana was affable and accommodating, too. \"He cared for us and for Ollie's needs above the filming. He made sure there were plenty of breaks,\" Kara summarized.\nAs for the \"Ollie, Ollie Running Free\" segment's moment-of-truth ending (SPOILER ALERT, if the title didn't already give it away), Kara commented, \"He loved it, and took to it right away. There was a 50/50 chance that the prosthetic would work.\"\nIn addition to the free prosthetic limb for Ollie, the Wizard of Paws representatives gifted the Sottnicks with six free hydrotherapy sessions for Ollie at BluePearl Pet Hospital's rehabilitation center in Newark, Delaware.\nPATH TO 'PAWS'\nInterestingly enough, Kara's goal wasn't for her family and Ollie to be featured on Wizard of Paws. In fact, she didn't know that the TV show even existed when she embarked on her original quest — getting a prosthetic limb for Ollie.\nThe Sottnicks are dog lovers. They strive to always have two dogs in their home for the sake of pet companionship. After Rigley died from cancer in 2020, the remaining pet dog, Toby, was alone. So the family started searching for another pet dog — specifically a Corgi.\nIn a way, the Sottnicks picked the runt of the litter after meeting with the breeders, who, as it turns out, did not even advertise Ollie, most likely because of his deformed front limb.\n\"I think they saw him as problematic. It was almost like they discarded him,\" Kara said, before remarking, \"But we thought he was absolutely adorable. He was so cute and we were up for taking on the challenge. We sort of rescued him.\"\nAfter consulting with the veterinarian, Kara started exploring the possibility of getting a prosthetic limb for Ollie and, during her research, she learned about Campana's business, Bionic Pets. When she visited its website, Kara learned that Campana was a TV star.\n\"That's when I learned about the show,\" Kara explained.\nHaving worked as a hairdresser until 2020, Kara now devotes her time to \"building Ollie's social media account.\" OllieTheTripodCorgi can be found on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, she noted.\nReflecting on the week-long Wizard of Paws filming in October and this week's premiere of the segment featuring her family, Kara marveled, \"I would have never guessed in a million years that they'd pick us to be on the show. The filming of it was the highlight of 2023 for us.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Unlock the secret to a perfect, stress-free Mother's Day\n\n April 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Samantha Erb Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 951\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Samantha ErbFood Drink Life\nDon't spend Mother's Day faking a smile. From self-care rituals to low-stress family activities, here's how to actually enjoy your day.\nThis Mother's Day, you can have everything you want and need to make your day special. You just have to ask for it.\nIf you're a mom, you've probably experienced the unpleasant feeling of Mother's Day plans gone wrong. Perhaps you were surprised with a pancake breakfast — and the bonus gift of having to clean it all up afterward. Or maybe you were hoping for some quality family time, but no one made time for you.\nThis year, you deserve a Mother's Day that doesn't involve faking happiness when you're actually feeling disappointed. So why not ask for it? And if you don't know where to start, keep reading for a list of effortless options that can restore the joy, relaxation, and family bonding that Mother's Day should be all about. After all, it's your day.\nA peaceful, grounded start to your dayWhoever came up with the idea of a loud, messy and chaotic breakfast in bed to kick off Mother's Day definitely wasn't a mom. In the immortal words of Chief Hopper, \"Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.\" So if you're not into getting toast crumbs all over your sheets, why not start a new tradition?\nThink about what you'd actually like to get out of your morning, and then tell your family so that it actually happens. Maybe your perfect morning involves reading a book or taking a solo walk to a coffee shop. If possible, ask your partner to step in so that you aren't dealing with childcare during what ought to be a restful morning.\nEasy activities and recipes to enjoy as a familyIf quality time with your children is an important part of your Mother's Day, choose manageable activities that won't get out of control. Playing a board game or doing a puzzle together is a great way to bond as a family without the mess of elaborate craft projects or baking endeavors.\nGetting in the kitchen is another easy way to spend time together with a fail-proof recipe like three-ingredient peanut butter balls. With minimal cleanup — that will ideally be taken care of by someone else — and no baking involved, these treats will still allow your family to feel like they're spoiling you on your special day.\nOn Mother's Day, take time for yourselfMother's Day can be complicated. Having a difficult relationship with your own mom or dealing with grief are just a few of the factors that can make Mother's Day an emotionally charged time.\nIf you would benefit from having time to yourself on Mother's Day, ask for it. Working on your favorite hobbies, trying an art or fitness class, getting your nails done or just lounging around on the sofa are all excellent ways to take care of yourself on your special day.\nWhatever you do, just don't feel any pressure to cook, clean, run errands or otherwise be helpful. Enjoy your relaxation time, because you've more than earned it.\nLow-stress family outingsDoes your ideal Mother's Day involve a family outing? A simple picnic in your local park can be a stress-free way to enjoy the outdoors together. Gather some sandwiches, water bottles and healthy-ish snacks like fresh fruit and fruit dip. Better yet, let someone else pack the picnic basket and you're ready for a fun-filled afternoon in the sun.\nLet your family treat you to Mother's Day dinnerDepending on how old your kids are, you can wrap up your Mother's Day by preparing a favorite meal together. Cooking together in the kitchen, especially if someone else washes the dishes, can be just as meaningful as enjoying the meal itself. End your night sweetly with an easy dessert like canned peach pie, which only requires ten minutes of prep time.\nIf you don't even want to think about the kitchen during Mother's Day, why not order your favorite takeout food for dinner? This easy option gives your family plenty of time to decompress, especially if you've had a day packed full of activities.\nEnd the day with a cozy family movieCan anyone say no to a family movie night? Cuddling up together and watching a movie before bed is a great way to conclude Mother's Day. Laughing over a favorite film or discovering a new one together is the perfect way to wind down the day. Alternatively, let the kids have a movie night while you and your partner enjoy some alone time.\nPracticing gratitude as a familyTowards the end of the day — perhaps over dessert, or just before bed — take a moment to reflect upon what everyone was grateful for during Mother's Day. It might sound cheesy, but acknowledging the love and effort that your family members put in can start a beautiful new tradition that will ultimately bring the family closer.\nA Mother's Day tradition worth startingInitially, asking for what you want on Mother's Day might feel overly demanding. It's ironic that even on a day that's supposedly for them, moms are expected to put their families first.\nA self-planned Mother's Day doesn't have to add a ton of items to your to-do list, either. A simple conversation with your family before the big day, or even on the morning of, will keep your Mother's Day from falling flat. Sometimes, dropping a hint just isn't enough.\nIf all else fails, just send your loved ones a link to this article. Then, get ready to enjoy a day that is truly focused on you. You — and all moms everywhere — deserve it.\nSamantha Erb is the owner of Everyday Family Cooking, a recipe website focused on providing simple meals with few ingredients that still pack on the flavor. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The music and performing arts venue is located at 40 E. Dover Street in Easton. Here's a rundown of upcoming shows with performance descriptions from the Avalon.For ticket prices and more show and venue information at the Avalon and its Stoltz Listening Room online check out avalonfoundation.org.\nThe Met: Live in HD Madama Butterfly\nSaturday, May 11th\nDoors: 12:30pm / Show: 1:00pm\nAvalon Theatre\nExtraordinary soprano Asmik Grigorian tackles the demanding role of Cio-Cio-San, the loyal geisha at the heart of Puccini's devastating tragedy. Tenor Jonathan Tetelman stars as the callous American naval officer Pinkerton, whose betrayal destroys her. Mezzo-soprano Elizabeth DeShong reprises the role of the steadfast maid Suzuki, and baritone Lucas Meachem is the American consul Sharpless. Acclaimed maestro Xian Zhang takes the podium on May 11 to conduct Anthony Minghella's vivid production. This live cinema transmission is part of the Met's award-winning Live in HD series, bringing opera to movie theaters across the globe.\nDar Williams with Guest Heather Maloney\nSaturday, May 11\nDoors: 7:30 a.m.; Show: 8 p.m.\nAvalon Theatre\nDar Williams' lyrics contain bouquets of optimism, delivered on melodies alternating between beguiling lightness and understated gravity.\nAlways in the right place at the right time for the success she's had over a 25+year career, Dar rose out of the vibrant mid-90's Boston scene, inspired by the eclectic influences of alt-rockers, Berklee jazz musicians, slam poets, and folk artists like Patty Griffith, Melissa Ferrick, the Throwing Muses, Vance Gilbert, and Jonatha Brooke.\nThrough all the ups and downs, however, it's always been about staying true to herself. \"Good and bad things happen, and it's not necessarily a reward or indictment. I've just got to meet it,\" she observes. \"Like, I'm bringing my whole life to this moment; it will surprise me, challenge me, show me where I was wrong, even make a fool out of me, but my job is to show up and not take adversity personally. Real happiness doesn't have to feel like Snoopy dancing with Woodstock; it can just be knowing you have the resilience to meet whatever comes to you. I will call that a good life.\"\nDar will be joined by special guest Heather Maloney, a Massachusetts-based singer songwriter whose voice is her \"not-so-secret weapon\" (Boston Globe) and whose \"lyrics cut to the chase\" (Huffington Post).\nMinor Gold\nWednesday, May 15\nDoors: 6:30 p.m.; Doors: 7 p.m.\nStoltz Listening Room\nMinor Gold are ARIA-nominated artists Tracy McNeil and Dan Parsons. Canadian and Australian, respectively, this Trans-Pacific duo echo '70s cosmic Americana with an easy charm and potent honesty.\nThe strength of the songwriting and the indeterminate perfection of how these two artists' voices lock in together hit right where the emotions live inside us. With dynamics ranging from the intense restraint of campfire intimacy through to open-throttle abandon, Minor Gold delight and enthrall as they weave masterful harmonies and deft guitar playing around unforgettable, stripped-back performances.\nSince releasing their critically acclaimed self-titled debut album in August 2023, the duo have been on the road—recently returning from a 30-date North American album tour with supports for The Teskey Brothers and an official showcase at AmericanaFEST in Nashville, as well as the 2024 Folk Alliance International in Kansas City. https://www.minorgoldmusic.com/\nJulian Brezon\nFriday, May 17, 2024\nDoors: 6:30 p.m.; Show: 7 p.m.\nStoltz Listening Room\nNew York-based Easton native Julian Brezon returns to the Stoltz with a stellar quartet presenting jazz standards and original compositions. As a saxophonist, composer, and educator, Julian brings a fresh ear to the world of modern creative music. His compositions strike a delicate balance of harmonic adventurousness and familiar listenability while his takes on standards blend a love of tradition with an ear for experimentation.\nJulian recently earned his Master of Music degree in jazz performance at the City College of New York in Harlem. He has studied with jazz greats Gary Thomas, Steve Wilson, Jason Rigby, and Vincent Herring. https://www.julianbrezon.com/\nBoy Band Review\nSaturday, May 25\nDoors: 6:30 p.m.; Show: 7 p.m.\nAvalon Theatre, 40 E.

Dover Street, Easton, MD\nSouthside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes emerged from the New Jersey shore scene in 1974, and though they carried over a significant influence (and some key personnel) from Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, the Jukes evolved as more of an R&B horn band in the Memphis Stax Records tradition.\nOrganized by singer John Lyon, guitarist/songwriter Steve Van Zandt (who decamped for the E Street Band in 1975, but continued to produce, manage, and write songs for the Jukes) and Richie Rosenberg, the band is well known for high-energy shows and no-holds-barred songs, including \"I Don't Wanna Go Home,\" \"Havin' a Party,\" \"The Fever,\" \"Talk to Me,\" \"Trapped Again,\" and \"This Time It's For Real.\"\nStill tinged with the exuberant rhythm and blues feel that is the Jukes' trademark, and loaded with the driving sound of the legendary Jukes horn section, Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes continue to expound their signature Jersey Shore sound – all for the sheer joy of it. https://www.southsidejohnny.com/\nThe Brothers Comatose\nThursday, June 20\nDoors: 7:30 p.m.; Show: 8 p.m.\nAvalon Theatre\nWhether traveling to gigs on horseback or by tour bus, Americana mavens The Brothers Comatose forge their own path with raucous West Coast renderings of traditional bluegrass, country and rock 'n' roll music. The five-piece string band is anything but a traditional acoustic outfit with their fierce musicianship and rowdy, rock concert-like shows.\nThe Brothers Comatose is comprised of brothers Ben Morrison (guitar, vocals) and Alex Morrison (banjo, vocals), Steve Height (bass), Philip Brezina (violin), and Greg Fleischut (mandolin, vocals). When they're not headlining The Fillmore for a sold-out show or appearing at Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, the band is out on the road performing across America, Canada, Australia, and hosting their very own music festival, Comatopia, in the Sierra foothills. https://www.thebrotherscomatose.com/\nThe Wailers 2024 Legend Anniversary Tour\nWednesday, July 3\nDoors: 7:30 p.m.; Show: 8 p.m.\nAvalon Theatre\nThe Wailers are a rare breed of musicians who have earned their place in the annals of music history. Their culture-defining music, embodying the spirit of the '70s reggae movement, has left an indelible mark on the industry.\nExperience the magic of their timeless classics and incredible cuts from Bob Marley's vast repertoire in a set that is truly unforgettable.

I was 'Captain Space' because I played progressive rock.\"\nWhile they talked, food vendors served and in between the rainfall people jetted out to grab a carbonated beverage and some food then hurried back for the live music.\n\"It wouldn't be a radio celebration without music, right. So we've assembled a great variety,\" Singleton told the crowd.\nLOCAL TALENT\nSombarkin' played blues and some toe-tapping gospel. Justin Singleton and the Shorebillies performed soulful country-style songs with original lyrics. Philip Dutton and the Alligators rocked out Louisiana-style, and the Blake Thompson Band performed later that day with some classic rock/blues/folk music.\nOn the smaller stage, Maryland Delegate Jay Jacobs presented Singleton a citation of recognition.\nThe station also received a certificate of recognition in March from the Kent County Commissioners.\nWhile the crowd mingled, Singleton's junior students, the class of 2025, took the sound coming from the stage and broadcasted it out for those who couldn't make it that day.\nThe \"on-air\" on the barn wall above the bands wasn't just for decoration.\nSingleton was appreciative of the community support.\n\"It's pretty amazing. Everybody coming together from all walks of life today, celebrating for a common cause. We're the only high school radio station in Maryland and still going strong.\"\nYou can discover Singleton and his crew's work on the radio dial at 90.5. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Simplify your Baking: Quick bread basics for beginners\n\n May 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maike Corbett Wealth of Geeks | Section: Entertainment \n \n 766\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Making bread at home intimidates many home bakers who don't have tons of experience making yeast bread. Several steps are involved, and there's no guarantee of an edible end result. Plus, making bread is time-consuming. That's probably part of the reason why the global bakery market is expected to reach $9.62 billion by 2030, according to 360iResearch.It's convenient for shoppers with busy schedules to grab a loaf of bread or another pre-packaged bakery item. They're available in every grocery store, reasonably inexpensive, and the quality is consistent. However, home cooks who like to know what's in their food may still want to try their hand creating their own baked goods. Quick bread is an excellent solution to that dilemma.\nWhat Is Quick Bread?\nQuick bread is a type of bread that does not use yeast or another biological agent for leavening. These goods include pancakes, waffles, zucchini bread, banana bread, American biscuits, Southern cornbread, and more. This category also includes flatbreads like naan or tortillas.\nAccording to the Wheat Foods Council, quick breads became more popular during the mid-19th century, when baking soda and baking powder came on the market. After the Civil War started, home cooks needed bread recipes that didn't require several hours to let yeast doughs rise. The result was what we now know as quick bread.\nAmerican biscuits are one of the earliest types of quick breads, although making them before the Civil War wasn't quick. Since yeast was hard to find and expensive, bakers kneaded the dough to incorporate enough air into it so it would rise when baked. Baking powder makes the process much easier.\nWhy Quick Bread?\nQuick breads don't have to rise, and the dough doesn't always need to be kneaded. Quick bread recipes are usually easy. Since they don't require specialized techniques, they're great for beginners, including kids. Most quick bread recipes are \"dump and stir.\"\nMaking a quick bread is a good way to learn several basic cooking techniques, including correctly measuring and sifting flour. The loaves don't have to be shaped, either. The cook only needs to pour the batter into a greased baking pan.\nQuick breads yield consistent results. If the person follows the recipe, the results should come out well. It's hard to mess up quick bread. Another reason these are great starter recipes.\nQuick breads are also versatile. The recipes are forgiving; cooks can add different ingredients to suit their family's preferences. For example, if no one likes walnuts, the cook can add pecans to banana bread or omit the nuts entirely. They can also add chocolate chips or even dried blueberries or cranberries for a different take on the bread.\nAnna Chesley, with Salt in My Coffee, says, \"I make a lot of quick breads, and our favorites vary with the seasons. In spring, we love rhubarb quick bread, topped with a maple streusel crumble. In the summer months, we go through a lot of zucchini bread, and by late fall, we're so ready for cranberry orange bread — our favorite through the cold weather months.\"\nThose with a bumper crop of zucchini in their gardens often make zucchini bread in the summer. They may also try pumpkin bread if they have a pumpkin in the garden. It's a good way to use surplus vegetables so they don't go to waste.\nHealthier Choices\nIf people are concerned about gluten in their food, eat a plant-based menu, or have other dietary concerns, quick breads are a viable option. You may think quick breads are sugary and carb-heavy, but that's not always true. The best part of making a quick bread is that the cook controls the ingredients. There are low-sugar recipes and low-carb options that incorporate almond flour or another lower-carb flour to lower the carbohydrate count.\n\"We make whole food plant based oil free banana bread with dairy free chocolate chips,\" says Jacqueline Sanchez of My Plant Based Plan. \"It's a great breakfast with a side of fruit and coffee or an afternoon snack after school for the kids.\"\nQuick breads aren't necessarily loaves, either. Flatbreads are quick and a popular alternative to the standard white sandwich bread. Tiffany McCauley with The Gracious Pantry says, \"My favorite is Socca, a chickpea flatbread. It's super quick and easy to make and is totally gluten-free. It tastes great and even works as a pizza crust. I use it that way often and love it.\"\nFor those who don't have time to work with yeast bread, making quick bread is a good way to have savory or sweet baked goods that can be served for any meal.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It just really speaks to me. And I love all the dresses, too, so that's a lot of fun.\"\nShe will compete in honor of her grandfather, Bob Richardson, who was a prominent figure in St. Mary's County Babe Ruth Little League and the county's recreation and parks department who died earlier this year.\nBecause of the various clubs and activities she is involved in, McDowell is no stranger to being on stage. As a 5-year-old she won a cute baby contest at the St. Mary's County Fair.\nFor the upcoming state competition, she's planning on wearing a dark green formal gown that is \"prominent and catches the eye.\" She also will wear a fitness outfit, business suit and a traditional pink cocktail dress to match her fellow competitors.\n\"I feel I interact well with adults, and I feel I can talk to the judges well,\" said McDowell, who added she hopes her genuine personality and her \"contagious smile\" will help her stand out with the judges.\nShe has been practicing answering sample questions with her mother.\n\"The big thing is just be yourself and showcase your personality,\" she said.\nThe 17-year-old has been her class president for the past three years, a treasurer with the National Honors Society, secretary of the Key Club, a member of the SGA and a member of the Potomac Voices, Leonardtown High's chamber choir. She plays forward for the varsity field hockey team.\n\"All the more power to her,\" said Leonardtown High School media specialist Brenda Hager, who also teaches McDowell journalism. \"She is a bright beaming light to every room she enters. She is a refreshing, positive energy to our student body. The best word to describe Lily Belle is her kindness; it just overflows. She's something special.\"\nIn 2023 she was awarded the Relentless for a Cure award by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society Fly4ACure for her fundraising efforts, and this year as a team leader, she helped raise $88,000, good for first runner-up in the state.\n\"I'm really excited to go there for the experience, to meet new people and to learn from them as well,\" she said. \"I honestly would love to win the whole thing. I feel like that would be amazing, and I'd enjoy that.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This day honors the men and women who died while serving in the United States Military.\nOriginally known as Decoration Day, it originated in the years following the Civil War and became an official federal holiday in 1971.\nMy fellow Americans, I fly the United States flag each day to honor all who died in the line of duty — military, law enforcement, first responders, and anyone who lost their life while helping their fellow people. Stand proud of these people as they gave all for you and me and the USA. Fly those flags with great pride as we all know someone who answered \"the call.\"\nThis year's celebrations may be different since gasoline and supplies are so expensive. Remember the \"carpooling\" days a few years ago?\nPlan a day at home to barbecue, play outside games, safely have a few fireworks, make homemade ice cream, watch home movies or catch up with family. These will be some of your most cherished memories in the years to come.\nSit under the shade tree or on the front porch with the older folks and listen to their \"recollections\" of years gone by.\nWhen the crowd gathers for food, the host may ask for each family to bring a dish, so today I will give you some recipes that can be easily prepared.\nUsually the host prepares the meat, so side dishes are appreciated. Let us begin with a favorite.\nGERMAN POTATO SALAD\nCook 5 large potatoes (peeled and sliced) until tender, drain and set aside. Saute one bunch of sliced green onions and 1 small, diced onion in 6 tbsps butter until tender. Add 1/3 cup vinegar, 1/3 cup sugar, 2 tbsps mustard, 1/2 tsp thyme, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the potatoes and toss. Cook over low heat for 15 minutes to blend flavors. Do not refrigerate.\nCUCUMBER SALAD\nMix 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1 tbsp sugar, 2 tbsps vinegar, 2 tbsps milk, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well and pour over three peeled and thinly sliced cucumbers. Let stand for at least an hour before serving.\nSTRAWBERRY ICEBOX CAKE\n8 oz. cream cheese at room temperature, 1 cup powdered sugar, 3 cups heavy cream (divided), 1 tbsp vanilla bean paste or extract, 1 tbsp lemon zest, 40 graham cracker squares, 2 pounds strawberries (sliced about 1/4-inch thick), 3/4 cup sliced almonds (optional).\nBeat cream cheese in a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer until smooth. Add powdered sugar; beat until smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add 1 cup of the heavy cream and beat at low speed until smooth. Add the remaining 2 cups of cream; beat at medium to medium-high speed until soft peaks form, increasing speed as the mixture begins to thicken. Fold in the vanilla and lemon zest. Spoon 1/4 cup of the cream mixture into the bottom of a 9-by-9-inch pan or baking dish; spread into a thin, even layer. Top with graham crackers in a single, even layer, breaking them as needed to fit. Spread about 1 1/2 cups of the cream mixture over the graham crackers, smoothing into an even layer using a spoon or offset spatula. Top the cream mixture with an even layer of berries (about 1 1/2 cups). Sprinkle evenly with 1/4 cup almonds, if using. Repeat two more times with the remaining graham crackers, cream mixture, berries, and almonds. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least four hours and up to overnight.\nMARINATED PEAS\nMix together in a bowl: two one-pound cans sweet peas, drained, with one chopped onion, one chopped green pepper, 2 stalks chopped celery, 1/4 cup oil, 1/2 cup vinegar and 3/4 cup sugar. Cover and let marinate for 6 hours before serving.\nArrange a tray of sliced pickles, a variety of cheeses, onions, olives and other fresh veggies. Deviled eggs and plain hard-boiled eggs are great for any gathering and don't forget the chips. Enjoy your day together. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Two members from Philadelphia also joined the Kent Island team.\nWhen the sun peeked out, pastor of New Hope, David Schofield blessed the maiden voyage of Kent Island's newest canoe.\nPresident of the Kent Island team, Michelle Reid said, \"This is a great opportunity for the two clubs to come together, kick off our season, have some fun and experience the nice exercise here, and just get out there and do some paddling.\"\nAll of the canoes are named a Hawaiian name, and carrying on that tradition, all affiliates formed a big circle around the new canoe and prayed over it, blessing its first time going out.\n\"The idea here is love and light. We can all agree that's a good thing,\" Schofield said.\nThe name they gave it was Hula Papa'i, meaning Dancing Crab.\nOnce the Dancing Crab was christened, all canoes were in the water.\nThey traveled six miles along the Sassafras River Trail to Lloyd's Creek and back as part of their Hawaiian voyage paddle.\nMember of the Kent Island Outrigger Canoe Club Doug Klepfer found it peaceful, enjoying nature, \"spotting beautiful eagles and blue herons along the way.\"\nThe water was calm, he said, and after the rain, they had the whole river to themselves, no boat traffic.\nThe first journey of the Hula Papa'i (Dancing Crab) sliced through the water with great stability, quietness and speed, he said.\nThey returned to Betterton around 1:30 p.m., enjoying their team building exercise.\nThis is one of many events planned, Klepfer said. \"We look forward to the Chesapeake Bay Paddle race around Kent Island on Saturday, July 20, offering a 35, 10, and three-mile paddle with a post paddle festival to help protect the bay.\"\nThw event takes place at the Kent Island Yacht Club and everyone at all levels are welcome to register, Klepfer said.

    "content": "Bookplate to welcome Sue Ellen Thompson May 29\n\n May 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 411\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Bookplate in Chestertown is continuing its 2024 season of author lectures on May 29 with poet Sue Ellen Thompson for a 6 p.m. event at The Kitchen and Pub at The Imperial Hotel.As the title poem reminds us, \"For each of us/ there is a place,/ a period of time,// a lover's face/ that we must veer away from…\".\nSea Nettles is a book of poems about what we are often reluctant to confront: the memories that still trouble us and the losses we would just as soon forget.\nFormer friends, old lovers, and mortality make frequent appearances, along with migrating birds and rising waters. Behind these poems lurks the knowledge that none of us can know what fate has in store for us.\nAs the opening poem warns, \"For you, the Universe has something else in mind.\"\n\"I love how this collection gives us decades of insight into a family, offers epiphanies that are only available after many years have gone by.\nThese are personal poems with a wide perspective, intimate poems that take the long view. Each poem is like a stepping stone that bridges the present and the past. It feels appropriate, then, that this collection features poems from two previous collections, providing a richer understanding of the relationships we've explored in the first half of the book.\nThese are efficient, muscular poems with sensual, unusual language. This collection provides, as the poet writes, \"a sudden intrusion of daylight\" in which I found myself drawn in by love, disappointment, and the truth of just how much we need each other to meet ourselves.\" wrote Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer, author of Hush.\nThompson is the author of six books of poetry and the editor of The Autumn House Anthology of Contemporary American Poetry. Her work has been included in the Best American Poetry series, read on National Public Radio more than a dozen times by Garrison Keillor, and has been nominated twice for the Pulitzer Prize.\nShe teaches workshops at The Writer's Center in Bethesda and was the recipient of the 2010 Maryland Author Prize from the Maryland Library Association.\nThe Bookplate will continue its event series with a reservation only author lecture at The Lawrence Wetlands Preserve on June 12 as author Christopher Tilghman will be discussing his new book On The Tobacco Coast.\nThese events are free and open to the public. For more event details contact The Bookplate at 410-778-4167 or contact@thebookplate.net. The Kitchen at The Imperial is located at 208 High street in Chestertown. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The audience of all ages was rapt.\nThere was a palpable sense of joy as the ringmaster announced each act in a booming voice.\nChildren had their faces painted like butterflies and queued to hold a real albino snake. One happy grandmother from Trappe, waving at her grandson, said, \"I am already in for $100, but it is OK.\"\nIn the darkened tent, the spectacle glowed on the children's faces.\nThe balancing act was like a surfer on a board. He placed seven cylinders beneath his board and stood 30 feet above the ground wobbling. The crowd was in awe of this seemingly dangerous act. He dismounted with his arms up in victory.\nThere was a 20-foot inflatable koala bear teetering around the ring and providing photo ops for children.\nThere were two clowns that were supported by timely sound effects. The whole tent was laughing with them and at them.\nHorses pranced and jumped and put their forward hoof on stands in unison. Mini donkeys performed the same tricks.\nMost of the performers are from Mexico but are based in Florida, according to employees of the circus, and tour the East Coast.\nThey travel from Rock Hall to Collcoon to Woodstown, performing two or three shows in each spot, and then roll it up and head to the next town. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But there will also be live music provided by a pair of local bands — \"Totally Stoked\" and \"Reagan Years\" — food vendors and, fittingly, a crab-picking contest that will serve a duel purpose of providing competitive entertainment and crab meat for those who indulge.\nGeorge Kirby has been associated with the Leonardtown Lions Club for the past decade and now he is among the committee members who are seeking to make the annual crab festival even more festive each year. In recent years, Kirby noted several new items have been added to the entertainment venue and each of them has been received in appreciable fashion.\n\"One thing that we added a few years ago, and it has become really popular, is the crab-picking contest,\" Kirby said. \"We started a new tradition last year. Instead of just giving away a trophy to the winner, we have a big trophy with the name of each annual winner engraved on it. It started last year and we'll keep adding a name to it each year.\"\nIn addition to the crab-picking contest, the St. Mary's County Crab Festival also features a classic car show, homemade craft exhibits, a petting zoo, a face painter and free hearing and vision screenings, all of which debuted a year ago and are free to the public.\n\"I think we're expecting about 30 to 40 cars for the show,\" Kirby said. \"There are a lot more car shows around now, so that number could be a little lower. But we're still going to have a contest with judges and trophies to the winners. ... Our health screenings are free and they're important.\"\nWhile there are a bevy of eating and entertainment options for patrons throughout the eight-hour outing, the crab-picking contest has evolved into a must-see event. Hardly a subjective viewing event, the champion of the crab-picking contest is the individual who picks the most crab meat during a brief, contentious, four-minute window, and then is immortalized on a trophy that could someday emulate the Stanley Cup.\n\"I hope in my heart that people come out because the Leonardtown Lions Club is a good community service group and we'll use all the money we get to give back to the community,\" Kirby said. \"And a good humanitarian fundraiser is for some people worth coming to just to sit around and say 'I helped.' We do really good things and part of that depends on people coming. We just want people to have a good time.\"\nIf you go\nThe 38th annual St. Mary's County Crab Festival will take place this Saturday, June 8, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the St. Mary's County Fairgrounds, located at 42455 Fairgrounds Road in Leonardtown.\nThis event will feature hot crabs, an animal zoo, jump houses, crafts, car shows, a crab-picking contest, free vision and hearing screenings and performances from local bands Totally Stoked (noon-3 p.m.) and Reagan Years (4-7 p.m.).\nTickets for the event are $10, while children under 12 get in free.

    "date": "2024-06-03",

    "content": "Fun on a bun: hamburgers for summer days\n\n June 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1337\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last week we explored hotdogs, so I decided we could not leave out burgers since both are extremely popular year-round but even more so in the summer.There is just no better smell going through the neighborhood than the smells of burgers on a grill.\nMr. Fletcher Davis of Athens, Texas made some of the first burgers in his small cafe, and the customers went wild over this great sandwich. It was in the 1880s, and the popularity of the burger grew so much that Davis carried the \"burger\" to share with the world at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri.\nThere is nothing else to say except get out your grill or your iron fry pan or whatever you use to cook burgers and try some of today's recipes.\nWhenever I hear the word burgers, I immediately start dicing onions, slicing tomatoes, washing lettuce, making sure I have cheese and fresh mustard, ketchup and relish — don't forget the soft buns. Enjoy.\nCLASSIC CHEESEBURGER1 pound ground chuck (80% lean), 1 pound ground sirloin, sea salt, freshly cracked black pepper, 4 or 8 brioche burger buns, 1/3 cup yellow mustard, 1 tbsp butter, 8 slices American cheese, 4 to 8 (1/4-inch-thick) tomato slices, 4 to 8 (1/4-inch-thick) red onion slices, 8 pickle slices, 8 burger-size lettuce leaves.\nIn a large bowl, combine the ground chuck and sirloin and mix gently but thoroughly. Divide into eight equal portions and shape them into burger patties. Season both sides with salt and pepper and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Split and toast the buns in the pan until toasty and golden brown. Set aside. Remove the burgers from the fridge and place a thumbprint in the center of each patty.\nSmear 1 tsp of the mustard on both sides of each patty. Melt the butter in the preheated pan and, working in batches, fry the burgers for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until a dark brown crust begins to form. The result: perfectly juicy medium-cooked burgers. For folks who prefer their burgers a little more well done, fry for 5 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer the patties to a baking sheet as they're done. Top each with cheese and place in the oven to melt, 2 to 3 minutes. Build the burgers on the toasted buns with 1 or 2 burger patties, a slice of tomato, pickles, a slice of red onion and lettuce. Top each with ketchup or mayo. Serve immediately.\nCHEDDAR AND ONION SMASH BURGER16 thin bread-and-butter or dill pickle slices (patted dry), four 4-inch potato buns (buttered and toasted), 1 1/4 pounds ground beef chuck, salt and freshly ground pepper, 2 small onions (sliced paper thin), 4 ounces sharp cheddar cheese (sliced).\nHeat a cast-iron griddle until very hot. Layer the pickle slices on the bottom buns. Without overworking the meat, loosely form it into four balls and place them on the griddle. Cook the meatballs over moderately high heat for 30 seconds. Using a sturdy large spatula, flatten each ball into a 5-inch round patty. Season the patties with salt and pepper and cook for 2 minutes, until well seared. Press a handful of sliced onions onto each patty. Using the spatula, carefully flip each burger so the onions are on the bottom. Top with the cheese and cook for 2 minutes. Cover with a roasting pan and cook just until the cheese is melted, 1 minute more. Transfer the burgers with the onions to the buns and add any additional toppings you like.\nTEXAS BURGERSColeslaw: 3/4 cup mayonnaise, 1/2 small onion (finely shredded), 3 tbsps cider vinegar, 2 tbsps sugar, 2 tsps celery seeds, 8 cups shredded green cabbage ,1 large carrot (finely shredded), salt and freshly ground pepper. Burgers: 2 pounds ground beef chuck, vegetable oil for rubbing, salt and freshly ground pepper, 3/4 cup barbecue sauce, 4 hamburger buns (split), sliced pickles.\nIn a large bowl, whisk the mayonnaise with the onion, vinegar, sugar and celery seeds. Add the shredded cabbage and carrot, season with salt and pepper and toss well. Let stand until slightly softened, about 25 minutes. Light a grill. Form the beef into four patties; rub with oil and season with salt and pepper. Sear over high heat, turning once, for 5 minutes for medium-rare. Brush with 1/2 cup of the barbecue sauce and grill until glazed, about 1 minute per side. Grill the buns and brush them with the remaining barbecue sauce. Top with the burgers, pickles and coleslaw and serve.\nBLACK BEAN BURGERS1/4 cup dried bread crumbs, 1/4 tsp ground cumin, 1/4 tsp ground coriander, 3 cups cooked black beans, 1/4 cup light mayonnaise, salt, pepper, 2 large stalks celery, 1 chipotle chile in adobo, 4 green-leaf lettuce leaves, 4 whole wheat hamburger buns, 4 slices of a ripe tomato.\nIn a food processor with a knife blade attached, pulse bread crumbs, cumin, coriander, two-thirds of beans, 2 tbsps mayonnaise, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper until well blended. Transfer to a large bowl. Stir in celery and remaining whole beans until well combined. Divide into 4 portions and shape into patties. Lightly coat a 12-inch nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Heat on medium 1 minute, then add patties. Cook 10 to 12 minutes or until browned on both sides, carefully turning once. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine chipotle chile and remaining 2 tbsps mayonnaise until well mixed. Place 1 lettuce leaf on bottom of each bun; top with patty, then tomato slice. Divide chipotle mayonnaise among burgers and replace tops of buns to serve.\nBACON AND CHEESE FILLED BURGER3 tbsps dark brown sugar, 1 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1/4 tsp chipotle powder, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp fresh-ground pepper, 1 pound ground beef, 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese, 6 slices bacon (cooked and crumbled), 4 rolls.\nHeat grill to medium. Combine the sugar, spices, salt and pepper in a small bowl and set aside. Form the beef into 8 equal patties. Toss the cheese and crumbled bacon together and place an equal amount on four of the patties. Place the remaining patties over the cheese and bacon and pinch the edges to seal. Generously pat each burger with the reserved spice mixture. Grill to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium.\nSHANNON'S JALAPENO BURGERSThis last burger recipe is my daughter in law Shannon's creations. Shannon assured me the secret here is that you grill this on charcoal, not gas. The smoke helps bring out the flavor in this next burger.\n3 pounds grass-fed ground beef (preferably 80/20 or 85/15), 4 jalapeno peppers (diced), 4 garlic cloves (minced), 1 onion (diced), 8 slices of pepper jack or ghost pepper cheese, a pack of buns of your choice.\nPrepare the grill for cooking on high heat. I let the coals get gray and orange from the heat. Mix jalapeno pepper, garlic, onion and ground beef in a bowl. Separate beef mixture into about seven equal bundles. Place a thick slice of pepper jack cheese into the center of each beef bundle (about the size of a thick butter pat). Form bundles into patties. Brush grill grate with oil. Grill hamburger patties 5 minutes per side.\nWhen you place the patties on the grill, the juices will cause the fire to flame up, try to watch it so they don't burn. Move the patties around for direct and indirect heat patterns if you must. I like mine medium rare so around 5 minutes is perfect. At this point, you can add the cheese to the burgers while they are still grilling, but you must really watch to make sure the burgers don't burn or remove burgers from the grill and top with pepper jack cheese. You can take your buns, split them, and smear butter olive oil on each side. Place them face down on another part of the grill for maybe 30 seconds to get a food toasting. Serve with condiments of your choice. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Accomplished musician Gabe Stillman is the festival headliner and will also feature performances from Walking Eagle, Everyday Everybody and Shamans of Sound with Carly Harvey, a 2007 St. Mary's College alumna, serving as mistress of ceremonies.\n\"At St. Mary's College, we value our liberal arts foundation — the diversity of thought and expression, creativity and respect for self and others,\" Jordan said. \"We teach students how to express themselves in order to add color and life to our world in a way that only each unique individual can. In this spirit of creativity, I initiated the Mulberry Music Festival in order to bring people together around the universal language that is music.\"\nHeadlining the Mulberry Music Festival is Stillman, a graduate of Boston's Berkley College of Music whose honors include an invitation to support ZZ Top, Eric Gales, Blues Traveler, George Thorogood and several others. Stillman was a Blues Music Award nominee in the Best New Emerging Artist album category, and the Gabe Stillman Band was selected as the Best Blues Band by the third annual Central PA Music Awards.\nAnother prominent performer on Friday evening is Walking Eagle, an artist from Northern Virginia whose debut album \"As Is\" was released in the spring of 2023, and his version of \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was released last October. Walking Eagles was a season 24 contestant on NBC's \"The Voice\" and currently has two new singles that will be released this year. He believes that music is fun, life-giving and spiritual and a gift that he is eager to share with everyone.\nJoining the entertainment is Shamans of Sound, a reggae group that seeks to unite listeners through peace, love and social consciousness. Comprised of nearly a dozen members from the Washington, D.C. area, Shamans of Sound has earned its reputation as one of the city's finest reggae performing acts, seeking to rebuild the vibe and help heal the nation together from its brand of musical performances.\nAlso performing on Friday is Everyday Everybody, a nine-member group that has been performing together since 2012 and often produces an upbeat, retro groove sound influenced by Funk and Soul, Jazz, Afro-funk and Motown-era pop. The combination of their sound and energetic live performances have earned them numerous awards, including Best Local Original Band and Best Funk group by the Washington Area Music Association.\nSpectators are encouraged to bring lawn chairs, blankets and food, although there will be food vendors on hand, although guests are reminded that pets are strictly prohibited from attending this event.\nIf you go\nThe Mulberry Music Festival will be held on the Townhouse Green on the campus of the St. Mary's College of Maryland located at 47645 College Drive, St. Mary's City, on Friday, June 14, from 6 to 9 p.m.\nThis event is free to the public and will feature performances from Gabe Stillman, Walking Eagle, Everyday Everybody and Shamans of Sound with Carly Harvey serving as mistress of ceremonies.

Rising senior at Kent Island High School Madison Mitchell is the answer.At 17 years old, Mitchell is already an active member of her community.\nShe is a junior member of the American Legion Auxiliary, where she organizes and carries out events like the Mother's and Father's Day brunches. She is also a founding member of the KI Scouts of America chapter, where she has earned over 60 merit badges.\nHer Eagle Scout project provided six pressure-treated benches to the Blue Heron Nature Preserve. In addition, Mitchell also loves fishing and is a part of the KI Fisherman's Club, where she helps with events like the Fishing Flea Market for about 2,800 people.\nExcitement came in the mail when Mitchell received an invitation for an open call for the National American Miss Contest.\n\"I'm trying to get more out of my comfort zone. When I got the open call, I wanted to try,\" she said.\nTwo days after her open call, Mitchell found out she was a state finalist for the National American Miss Pageant for 16 to 18 year-olds.\nWhile many beauty pageants focus on judging outward physical appearances, the National American Miss Pageant organization focuses on \"creating future leaders and equipping them with real-world skills to make their dreams a reality. The program is based on inner beauty, as well as poise and presentation, and offers an 'All-America' spirit of fun for family and friends.\"\nMike Mitchell, Madison's father, describes his daughter as \"a good kid who is shy and close with her family. She has been a leader in her Eagle Scouting and is well-organized with structuring events, programs, and event coordinating. She has great follow-through.\"\nMitchell shines through her community service as she received many awards to date including a Governor's Citation for \"outstanding services for the citizens of (Maryland),\" a Congressional award for service, as well as many Eagle Scout awards.\nNow, Mitchell prepares for the pageant on Aug. 17 to 19, in Reston, Virginia. Events will include a formal wear competition, an interview, a personal introduction and optional pay-to-participate events that include Top Model Search, Runway Model, Casual Wear and more.\nAs one of the only Queen Anne's County finalists, she hopes that this experience will not only take her \"out of her comfort zone but will also boost her confidence and public speaking.\"\nIn the near future, Mitchell aspires to encourage \"youth empowerment and support those in need.\" If she wins, she said she would, \"visit school field days to volunteer, read books to local schools, and donate (her) time to community events.\"\nTo support Mitchell's fundraising efforts, visit https://iam.buzz/5vrz5m or email mmitchell@lrwillsonandsons.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tapping away: Author pens children's book using 'early 100-year old Royal typewriter'\n\n July 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 693\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Author David Wright recently published his first book, \"Marty McSwirl,\" through Dorrance Publishing.Wright grew up in Sudbury, Mass., graduated from the Air Force Academy in 2000 and have been serving since. He has flown the F-15, F-22 and A-10 and is currently the deputy commander of the 175th Wing, Maryland Air National Guard.\nHe and his family live in North Beach.\nThe 30-page book retails for $39 — the eBook is $34 — and is available at https://bookstore.dorrancepublishing.com/.\nHow long have you been writing, and how did you get started?It was [Sudbury, Mass.- based Josiah Haynes Elementary School teacher Lee] Jones, my fourth grade and to this day, favorite teacher, who inspired me to be a writer. Despite my rambunctious nature which was not ideally suited to being a student, he managed to tease out a bit of creativity. I must have a penchant for alliterative titles because my favorite project that year was story about a Viking named Pudgy Pinkinson. Yet I think my path was set when Mr. Jones assigned us to create an auto-biography, the last chapter being a prediction of what we would be in the future. In that last chapter I said I would go to the Air Force Academy, become a fighter pilot, and finally become an author. Thus far the first two have come true and I suppose that \"Marty McSwirl\" is the first step towards making the latter come to fruition.\nWhat inspires you to write?My children John, Anna and Andrew and a lone, tired-looking squirrel inspired me to write \"Marty McSwirl.\" Years ago, I had just finished raking leaves and the kiddos immediately began rollicking in the pile, exactly the way kids should. Despite the chaos, a squirrel joined the fray, apparently looking for acorns. I thought to myself, \"He must be a tired dad squirrel gathering food for a big family,\" and thus was born \"Marty McSwirl\".\nDo you consider writing to be a career?Not yet, but like my fourth grade autobiography predicted, I hope it will be one day.\nWhat kind of writing process do you use?I sit down at my grandmother's old roll-top desk, slide a piece of paper into my nearly 100-year old Royal typewriter, and tap away. I started using a typewriter years ago after reading an opinion in the newspaper lamenting the lost art of letter-writing. Sharing an admiration for things that have stood the test of time, I determined to resurrect that lost art, yet my handwriting is terrible. So I bought an old typewriter and now, when I sit down in front of the Royal, I drift away to wherever my imagination leads me.\nHow did you publish your book?\nAfter writing \"Marty McSwirl,\" it lay dormant for years, gathering dust among the pile of unpublished works in a desk drawer. Eventually, I applied for a copyright through the Library of Congress and once granted, a number of publishing companies contacted me asking if I would like to publish. I ended up choosing Dorrance Publishing, who walked me through the project.\nWho are some of your favorite authors and why?Julia Donaldson is the first author who comes to mind. I've been reading to the kids every night since birth and they always responded best to books that told a good story in the form of a poem. When I began writing \"Marty McSwirl\" it was with my kids in mind, hoping to create a book that I could one day read to them before bed.\nWhat are you working on now?I have a few unpublished works ready for an eager illustrator and book agent.\nPlease include a brief description of your bookMarty McSwirl is the tale of a squirrel who invents an acorn harvester with the help of some friends. Their efforts meet with success and Marty decides to share the fruits of his labor with family, friends and neighbors. In essence, the story is a woodland creature Thanksgiving origin story.\nPlease include an excerpt from the book\"When Marty came back with his acorn sack at the end of each long day,\nMrs. McSwirl was there with a hug,\nHis children snuggled upon the rug,\nBut despite all his care, the cupboard lay bare, he must find an easier way.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Over the past year, owners Ric Cunningham and Katie Salsbury have welcomed over 500 musicians and guests to the venue while seeing audiences grow as more bands come to play.Cunningham and Salsbury moved here eight years ago from Washington D.C., and fell in love with Elkton's small town vibes. After getting exhausted from traveling miles to see live music, the couple decided to launch their dream business right here in Elkton and bring the music to the people.\n\"I think the biggest accomplishments are seeing people having a good time and getting to meet so many people here locally and people that are traveling in and just love music and get what we're trying to do here. At the end of the day, it's a lot of hard work, but seeing the people smiling and singing along, dancing like that is the single most greatest compliment, you know, seeing it working,\" said Cunningham.\nElkton Music Hall has a 300 person capacity, and has had three sold out shows, including their fourth show ever last summer when Sungold performed.\nFor the first time in his career, booking agent Ron Ozer is working with over 500 agents worldwide to cull musicians to Elkton Music Hall. His goal is to keep booking shows, because the more people that come through the venue the more visibility they have. They've received great feedback from the bands. Since opening, folk legend Tom Paxton performed and told the crowd to look at their website and get tickets to a show by someone they've never heard of, because that is how he got famous, according to Ozer who was working that night.\n\"They take care of the artists, they respect the artists. Which you don't get too often. So the hospitality of everyone in town is wonderful, it's just got that really good little small town feel. I like playing gigs in small towns where you get to talk to almost every single person there,\" said lead singer of Cosmic Guilt, James Everhart.\nElkton Music Hall brings the town to life as the bands draw in a big crowd that fills the restaurants and bars with business around showtime.\nEverhart feels honored to have been the first band to open for EMH and was excited to play their anniversary show.\n\"It's always an honor when I get asked to do something like that because that's that community's baby. Everyone there in that town, they were all so proud of it and still are. And it was very flattering to be asked to step out on their first night and receive their trust,\" said Everhart when reflecting on their opening show last summer.\nLead vocalist in one of the opening bands, Kid Davis and the Bullets, Michael Davis is a long time favorite musician of Everhart and even played at his wedding. Everheart plans on helping produce the Bullets next album. Being some of each other's favorite musicians, they love working together and had a blast performing on Saturday at Elkton Music Hall.\n\"There's no reason to do it if you're not having fun,\" said Davis.\nThere is more music overflowing from downtown Elkton, to catch the next show visit their website. Maybe you'll find your new favorite artist. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It was a packed house of over 100 attendees.\nHeld on the corner of Main Street and Sharp Street in Rock Hall, this event paid tribute to the icons of Laurel Canyon, inviting guests to a time when California was the epicenter of rock and roll.\nAccording to the host of the event, WCTR's Sunday morning on-air personality Ya Buddy Emerson, \"everyone in attendance had a great time. There were smiles all over the building. Not a single person left without getting their money's worth.\"\nEmerson added people were already asking when the next tribute show would be.\nFollowing a few announcements from the man who was instrumental in organizing the event, guitarist and vocalist Mark Einstein, Emerson kicked off the show with an introduction.\nFollowing the intro, the concert opened up with, \"Mr. Tambourine Man,\" originally performed by The Byrds.\nThe format of the first set saw various combinations of The Mainstay Players performing songs such as \"Love the One You're With\" by Stephen Stills, \"Crazy Love\" by POCO and \"Suite: Judy Blues Eyes\" by Crosby, Stills and Nash.\nThroughout the night, the host would jump onstage with a joke, funny story or game.\nDuring intermission, t-shirts were sold and guests were allowed to partake in some free oysters. There were also beverages and desserts available.\nAfter intermission, Emerson opened the second half of show with a little bit of history that vividly described Laurel Canyon, before Stu Gray and Meghan First performed a beautiful rendition of Crosby, Stills and Nash's \"Guinevere.\"\nThe second half of the show featured songs like, \"Big Yellow Taxi\" by Joni Mitchell; \"Teach Your Children\" by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young; and \"These Day\" by Jackson Browne. The finale of the show had the Mainstay Players came together, and with some prompting, everyone in attendance stood and sang \"California Dreamin'\" by The Mamas and The Papas.\nThe hard work put in by everyone, including a month's worth of rehearsals, paid off. Mainstay community members are already cooking up the next tribute show. A few ideas being thrown about are a Bob Dylan tribute or even a tribute to Motown.\nOne thing that's for sure is that if the next event is anything like this one, a good time will be had by all.\nTo find more information about the Mainstay, as well a video of this event and other events, visit mainstayrockhall.org \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Two in five respondents (41%) spend their free time in the kitchen.\nTiffany McCauley of The Gracious Pantry explains why she loves cooking so much. \"Cooking is therapeutic for me,\" she says. \"To be able to tune out the world and all its problems, turn on some music, and just let myself have 30-60 minutes of creativity with my food simply soothes my soul.\"\nMcCauley adds that sampling her creations is an added bonus. \"Ending up with a dish that tastes amazing is a whole new level of comfort on top of the stress relief. The entire process is basically an escape with a delicious finale.\"\nReading\nAmericans love relaxing with a good book — 37% of respondents report reading as a pastime. Good reads come in many forms and can transport audiences to new worlds, educate, motivate, enlighten, and excite.\nReading has immeasurable benefits: it enhances creativity, reduces stress, and provides much-needed stimulation as we age. Additionally, increased internet and library access means reading comes at little to no cost to many.\nPets\nAmericans rank spending time with pets among their favorite hobbies. Around 35% spend free time caring for furry friends. These figures are unsurprising as 95% of pet owners consider their pets family.\nInteracting with animals isn't just a fun hobby; moving and exercising with a pet positively benefits animal and human health and wellness. Animals provide companionship, reduce stress, keep humans active, and stimulate the production of feel-good chemicals like oxytocin.\nVideo Games\nAbout one-third of all Americans unwind with their favorite video games.\nGaming provides a fantastic escape from real life. Players can be the hero one day and an evil villain the next. Some games build critical life skills, like team building, problem-solving, and enhanced focus.\nOutdoor Activities\nMore than 30% of survey respondents said they engage in outdoor activities. In 2019, the National Recreation and Parks Association surveyed people to learn what \"outdoor activities\" they prefer.\nThe survey found that most (58%) consider outdoor gatherings with family and friends — playing games, barbecuing, or having a picnic — their favorite outdoor activity. Nearly half (48%) said they enjoy going to the pool, while 45% reported hiking as their favorite outdoor activity.\nShopping\nNearly one-third of Americans spend their free time shopping.\nCritics may say shopping isn't a hobby, but for many, activities performed to relax count as hobbies, which means shopping fits the bill.\nUnfortunately, unmanaged retail therapy can lead to overspending.\nTraveling\nAround 29% cite travel as their preferred hobby, though this and other more expensive interests would likely attract more people if they weren't as cost-prohibitive. A 2023 travel study says more than 50% of non-travelers report they can't afford to travel or can't take time off work.\nTraveling is a fantastic hobby because it allows us to visit bucket list destinations, learn about different cultures, and experience the world from a fresh perspective.\nArts/Crafts/DIY\nAround 25% of respondents report enjoying arts, crafts, and DIY activities in their free time, such as sewing, woodworking, drawing, painting, and other hands-on tasks.\nPhotography and writing scored high enough to merit their own categories, with 19% of respondents saying they spent time on each activity.\nArts and crafts are ideal hobbies for those with little time, money, or space. Anyone can start drawing with just a pencil and paper, crochet with a needle and yarn, or make paper mâché crafts with old paper and flour.\nSocializing\nFriendships are crucial to health and happiness. Studies show that people with thriving social lives are happier, healthier, and live longer than those who spend time in solitude.\nDespite its importance, only 26% of respondents reported socializing as a hobby.\nBoard Games\nAbout 26% of respondents enjoy playing board games during downtime. Tabletop games span several genres, including traditional offerings like Monopoly, solo games like puzzles, trading card games like Magic: The Gathering, and roleplaying games like Dungeons & Dragons.\nPlaying board games has many benefits, including education, cognitive improvement in older adults, and improvement of ADHD symptoms in children.\nMore Favorite Pastimes\nAmericans enjoy a wide variety of activities. Approximately one-fifth of survey respondents participate in hobbies like gardening, meditation, working on old cars, fitness, photography, and writing.\nHealth Benefits of Hobbies\nEngaging in fulfilling hobbies is crucial to health, happiness, and overall life satisfaction. Many of America's most popular hobbies have well-documented impacts on health and wellness. Hobbies, in general, tend to reduce stress, decrease loneliness, and promote overall well-being.\nThere's no greater time than the present to start a new hobby and inject more happiness into your life.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Young filmmakers find inspiration on the Shore\n\n August 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LISA J. GOTTO Special to the Kent County News | Section: Entertainment \n \n 964\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The picturesque scenic byways, rural farmland, and winding pathways of Kent County have proven to be an advantageous creative backdrop for a pair of young filmmakers who have their sights set on making their mark in the ever-changing landscape of independent filmmaking.Recently, the pair compiled the portfolio of short film projects that they already have under their belts, cut trailers, and built an online home for their production company, Moosehead Pictures, a venture that was two-and-a-half years in the making.\nTheir personal narrative about how they got here, however, winds half-way around the world and back, and may have never turned out to be a story worth telling if not for the pandemic, as Will Freda of Chestertown and Vanessa Grapes, a native of Sterling, Virginia tell it. The couple met while teaching abroad in Thailand on a one-year Fulbright Scholarships prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nNow both in their late 20s, the couple clicked easily over their love of cinema and enjoyed taking in many films together during their time in Thailand. They bonded over their struggle to learn the language and they developed friendships with locals there that they are certain will endure despite the distance.\nDistance would also play a starring role in the relationship at this point, as once their Fulbright year was over, the couple would need to go where their careers were taking them. Will's would take him to China and Vanessa was hired to teach English at the high school level back in Virginia. They committed to making a go of a long-distance relationship, seeing each other whenever their schedules could align.\nWhile Freda was teaching middle school history in China, he learned his twin brother, James, coincidently, was also in China at that time studying for his master's degree. And it would be while the three of them were vacationing in Slovenia that the pandemic broke out and the travel restrictions kicked in. The brothers, unable to get back to Shanghai, returned to the States, and to Maine where James was currently living, and where they both grew up.\nLike many people enduring COVID at the time, it provided them the opportunity to re-examine their lives and re-connect as brothers over aspects of their shared childhoods. Part of that time as teenagers, Will said, was spent spitballing ideas for movie scripts.\n\"I just think it's interesting that COVID is what forced them to be living together and really explore what they wanted out of life,\" Vanessa said.\nThe brothers were all-in and made a commitment to pursue filmmaking, and they founded their company, Moosehead Pictures while riding out the Pandemic in Moosehead Lake, Maine.\nFrom there it has been a whirlwind of learning the industry from square one. Challenges came fast and furiously in the form of learning which cameras worked best for them, the dynamics of shooting in different locations and under varying conditions related to light and surroundings, and the aspects of casting and securing locations for shooting.\nAnd like most independent filmmakers, this team started out on a shoestring using mostly their own money to produce their first short, Jess at Christmastime, which was shot on location in Brooklyn, N.Y. They found that attending independent film festivals was a great way to meet like minds and learn how films were financed. They were also able to tap into some independent filmmaker resources, like the New England Film Industry, to get their first project produced.\nFor that first film, Vanessa said, she played the role of observer and basically helped out with whatever she could on set to support Will in his cinematic efforts. Going forward, she is flexing her artistic and creative muscles for their current project by designing a series of dramatic masks to be worn by some of the lead actors for their first feature film, Sol Sillion, for which they have already shot their \"proof of concept\" scenes.\nWhile they described their first two films as \"a slice of life\" narratives, they are now leaning in and creating what they described as \"elevated\" or \"intellectual\" horror films. The change in direction to the horror genre was a pragmatic one, they said.\n\"There's more money for low-budget horror films than there are for other genres… for whatever reason, horror films get bought a lot for distribution because there's a big audience for them,\" explains Will, who described the feature, Sol Sillion, as a take on Alice in Wonderland.\n\"If Alice walked into a pagan horror film,\" he added.\nThe team hopes to shoot the rest of this project at the end of the year in and around Kent County once they have raised the necessary capital to produce it. They are hopeful their growing body of work will resonate with potential investors in the arts who appreciate the passion and dedication it takes to create these works.\nIn addition to financing, the couple said they are always on the look-out for others who share their passion for film and wish to become part of something unique. Whether they would like to become extras, set-builders, artists, painters, or even dancers, the team is hoping interested local parties will reach out to them via their website.\nMeanwhile, the couple has some short- and long-term goals. This January they will return to the film festival circuit to show the full version of their film short, Rachel in Vacationland. (All of their trailers, including Bug Brain, their first horror film shot on location in Kent County, are available for viewing on moosedeadpictures.com.)\nAnd 'big picture', the couple hopes to one-day return to where it all began, Thailand.\n\"We have a script for a movie that we would like to make in Thailand,\" said Vanessa. \"So, we would like to live in Thailand for a few years filming that, and then settle down somewhere and have kids. So, we have a whole dream.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

In all, six fireworks shows will be offered with three different local bands providing the musical entertainment on stage from 3 to 8:30 p.m., with the fireworks show lasting from 8:45 to 10:30 p.m. Advertised as a \"rain or shine\" event, severe weather could potentially postpone the event until Sunday evening at 8 p.m.\nBilled as a total adventure for all of your senses, the PyroJam will offer a fireworks competition that is a much more difficult chore than the average Independence Day fireworks show that onlookers are accustomed to witnessing at ball parks and other outdoor venues. PyroJam organizer Tim Jameson noted the response from the two previous shows at Jefferson Patterson Park was so overwhelming that tickets for this year's event have been selling rapidly.\n\"The first two years went very well and this one is on pace to be even more popular than they were,\" Jameson said. \"The competition is going to be tremendous. We have over 120 specialists from nearly 30 countries competing for spots in the final. There are three shows that make up the competition then the judges will determine the top three finalists for the grand finale, which promises to be even bigger than any July Fourth show anyone has seen.\"\nGates open at 2:30 p.m. and three musical groups will take the stage for performances beginning at 3. Loose Change will perform first, followed by Blair's West at 4:45 p.m. then First To Eleven at 7 p.m. The National Anthem will be performed at 8:30 p.m., followed by an appetizing opening fireworks display at 8:45 p.m. that will give onlookers a mild glimpse of what to expect in the main event.\nIn essence, the fireworks show is divided into three competitions for spots in the grand finale, with the first show getting under way at 9 p.m., followed by the second show at 9:20 p.m. and the third at 9:40 p.m. A panel of judges will select the top three performers based on various criteria and the finale at 10 p.m. is provide to take onlookers on an emotional roller coaster courtesy of the musical accompaniment to the numerous fireworks on display.\nGeneral admission parking is free, but there is a preferred parking option of $30 for those want to park close and be among the first to leave the venue. Organizers have noted on their website that all parking areas are within 2-6 minutes of the event.\nIf you go\nThe PyroJam musical and fireworks show is set for this Saturday, Aug. 24, from 3 to 10:30 pm. at Jefferson Patterson Park and Museum, located at 10515 Mackall Road in St. Leonard.

A bona fide traveling entertainer, Trae has been touring North America in a minivan since high school, learning to put on the show nobody knew they needed. He pulls inspiration from legendary storytellers such as Bob Dylan, the Eagles, and Randy Newman to form his unique songwriting palette and deliver a sound that can only come from the deep roots of an old West Virginia soul.

It could swing with the best of them, and no other band could come close to Dorsey's when it came to playing ballads. Considered \"The Sentimental Gentleman of Swing\", Dorsey was a master at creating warm, sentimental, and always musical moods — at superb dancing and listening tempos. He sustained these moods through the arrangements of the likes of Paul Weston, Axel Stordahl and Sy Oliver, and he showcased singers like Frank Sinatra who could project them brilliantly. Dorsey's legacy continues today under Jeff Bush's leadership as the orchestra's Music Director. Jeff joined the band in 2000 when trombone legend Buddy Murrow was conductor, often playing many of the great Tommy Dorsey solos and fronting the band on occasion in Buddy's absence. After taking a break to begin graduate work at The Manhattan School of Music, Jeff has returned to lead one of the greatest big bands of all-time. https://www.tommydorseyorchestra.net\nTrio Music: Apart and Together with Quinn Parsley, Nevin Dawson, and Ashley Watkins\nAugust 30\nDoors: 6:30 p.m.; Show: 7 p.m.\nStoltz Listening Room\nDon't miss this eclectic summer's evening of music in the Stoltz highlighting three of the best musicians on the Eastern Shore today!

He has captivated audiences around the world with his unique and dynamic style.

Starting with a simple philosophy that assumes from dust to dust, we are all the same, Bennett sees his music acting as a thread that helps to hold us together and remind us of that crucial point in a world that seems to have forgotten it.\nCaleb Stine\nSeptember 12\nDoors: 6:30 p.m.; Show: 7 p.m.\nStoltz Listening Room\nCaleb Stine is a singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and visual artist. Though he makes his living as a folk musician, Stine wouldn't call what he does a job; he considers it a calling. His work is part-mystic poet, part-traveling preacher. As Americana UK observed, \"Stine's upfront personality [is] seeking to make a personal connection with everyone in the venue.\" The albums and shows are the tip of the iceberg; to get to where he is today, Stine has put in decades of daily practice, day jobs, and deep commitment to the craft of music. \"There's an element of endurance to almost everything I do,\" says Stine, who plays 100+ shows a year, has released 14 albums of original music, and shares a series of viral Instagram videos called \"Caleb Stine Says Keep Going,\" encouraging followers to dig deep into a creative practice of their own.

McMurtry's mother, an English professor, taught him how to play it. \"My mother taught me three chords,\" he recalls, \"and the rest I just stole as I went along. I learned everything by ear or by watching people.\" After 20 years in rock, folk, and Americana, McMurtry's most recent effort, \"The Horses and the Hounds\" (2021), backs personal narratives with effortless elegance and endless energy. The collection, which McMurtry says has \"the ghost of Warren Zevon stomping around among the guitar tracks,\" spotlights a seasoned tunesmith in peak form as he turns toward reflection and revelation. He will be joined on the Avalon stage by Betty Soo, a world-class vocalist who \"may well have the most gorgeous voice in Texas …if not in all contemporary folk — its purity and strength can be downright devastating.\" (Acoustic Guitar) https://www.jamesmcmurtry.com/ https://bettysoo.com/\nComedy @ the Stoltz with Jared Stern\nSeptember 14\nTwo Shows — Doors: 6:30 p.m.; Show: 7 p.m. Doors: 9 p.m.; Show: 9:30 p.m.\nStoltz Listening Room\nHeadliner Jared Stern has been making complete strangers laugh at him for twenty years and counting.

    "content": "'They Live': A cult favorite alien invasion movie unlike any other\n\n August 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Richard Chachowsk Wealth of Geeks | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1592\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n John Carpenter is a man of many creative talents. A prolific filmmaker, a proficient composer, and an occasional actor, Carpenter has earned avid acclaim as one of the most lauded directors of the 1980s. Graduating from an indie background with projects like Dark Star and Assault on Precinct 13, Carpenter gained a newfound level of attention with his revolutionary 1978 slasher film, Halloween.From there, the cult filmmaker only enjoyed increased popularity throughout the remainder of the decade, culminating in fan-favorite movies like The Thing, Escape from New York, Big Trouble in Little China, and The Fog, among many others.\nNestled somewhere in the middle of Carpenter's sprawling filmography is a 1988 oddity by the name of They Live. A rip-roaring sci-fi comedy with an endearing message behind it, They Live might not be the first movie people think of when they hear Carpenter's name, but rest assured, it's assuredly among his finest films.\nOverarchingly comical yet also surprisingly thought-provoking in its thematic subjects, T hey Live is a masterclass in science fiction subtly wrapped around an over-the-top '80s movie. Without it, who knows what the current state of sci-fi might even be, with They Live helping to lay the groundwork for such later classics as The Matrix years down the line.\nWhat Is 'They Live' About?Set against the hustle and bustle of downtown Los Angeles, They Live tells the story of the ambiguously-named Nada (Roddy Piper), an unemployed drifter struggling to find work in La La Land. As he wanders in search of employment, Nada soon comes across a mysterious pair of sunglasses that allow him to see an alternative version of his surroundings. Presented through crisp black-and-white visuals, this alternative reality offers a glimpse into the world as it truly is: a hellish dystopia where alien invaders have successfully conquered humanity.\nDisguising themselves as average people living amongst us, these sinister alien overlords have managed to avoid detection by carefully constructing a reality for their hapless human adversaries. Distracting humankind long enough to transform Earth into the suitable living environment, these aliens hide behind their meticulous-curated reality when it comes to battling humans, using mass deception as their primary means of conquest.\nA film that in many ways could have only been made in the '80s, They Live was very much a product of its time. Designed as a satirical treatment of '80s-era classism and socioeconomic policies, Carpenter provided a damning portrait of social phenomena that was only just starting to gain traction in American culture, including mass consumerism, corporate greed, and Americans' growing obsession with material goods. Of course, Carpenter never tips his hand too much when it comes to his thematic subjects, balancing out his topical motifs with cliched action, kitschy humor, and enough '80s one-liners to fill the script for an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.\nBetween the witty one-liners and extensive action, Carpenter might have assumed he had a hit on his hands when the movie hit theaters in the fall of 1988. Unfortunately, most critics and casual viewers lambasted They Live for its attempts at social commentary, along with its tough-talking dialogue and equally ham-fisted acting.\nA critical failure that quickly faded into the pop culture zeitgeist, They Live 's esteem would only grow more favorable over time, contributing to its continued cult status today.\nAt the time, it's fair to say that most people simply didn't know what to make of a film as delightfully strange as They Live. After all, how many movies have a powerful critique of '80s capitalism and a comically drawn-out brawl that lasts a whopping six and a half minutes?\nIt's more than likely that the movie's satirical elements were simply too ahead of its day and age. In the decades since, contemporary viewers have hailed the film as a brilliant takedown of '80s consumer culture, as well as the ever-widening disparity between the wealthy elite and the lower-income working class. Yet, for all its social critiques, it's hard to take any movie seriously that includes Roddy Piper saying, \"Mama don't like tattletales\" with a straight face.\nHow 'They Live' Subverts the Standard Alien Invasion PremiseIn more recent decades, more appreciative viewers continue to praise They Live for its effective satirical undertones. Perhaps most famously, the film has directly influenced the widely known Andre the Giant Has a Posse campaign — a street art movement that uses the movie's line \"Obey\" as its foremost rallying crew. Shepard Fairey, the creator of the campaign, has even gone on record to say of They Live, \"The movie has a very strong message about the power of commercialism and the way that people are manipulated by advertising.\"\nAs profound They Live 's attack on the capitalist system is, it's also worth mentioning the movie's radical take on the stereotypical alien invasion vehicle. In the decades prior, most sci-fi films featured a more outright depiction of alien attacks, with our extraterrestrial nemeses using technologically advanced weaponry and military superiority to bend humanity to its will. In They Live, Carpenter trades in unique gadgetry for a far more insidious contraption: mass manipulation.\nRather than relying on ray guns and deadly lasers to subdue humankind, They Live 's alien adversaries employ mass media, advertisements, and material possessions to lull humans into a more docile state. Controlling us through subliminal messages that encourage everyone to \"consume,\" \"conform,\" \"reproduce,\" and — most importantly — \"obey,\" these aliens have learned that it's far easier to trick humans than it is to face them in a physical conflict.\nAs a result, Carpenter paints these alien overlords as the secret society controlling our every thought, turning the greatest aspects of our society (wealth, entertainment, and fulfilling careers) against us.\nHow 'They Live' Forever Changed Science FictionThrough this new, subtler depiction of an alien invasion, Carpenter managed to add a fresh new spin on age-old story concept in science fiction. Sure, movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers had pioneered the idea of disguised aliens living among us, but Carpenter took that idea one step further. Rather than aliens replacing us outright, Carpenter wondered aloud whether those same aliens could manipulate us into becoming our own worst enemies.\nLulled into a false sense of security through careful manipulation and rampant consumerism, They Live 's alien invasion succeeds because humanity wants to be tricked. So long as we're free to acquire wealth, power, and the pursuit of individual happiness, why should we care about aliens exploiting us for their own gain? I mean, let's be honest, doesn't that essentially describe the average American workplace?\nIt was a bold concept that proved somewhat too sardonic and cynical for the happy-go-lucky days of Ronald Reagan's America. Yet it's for this very reason that They Live remains every bit as enjoyable now as it did three decades ago.\nMixing humor and action together with some ever-present topical discussions, Carpenter offered a far different kind of alien invasion than audiences had ever seen before. While viewers at the time might not have appreciated it, the themes examined in the film ended up resonating with viewers in each subsequent decade, stylistically informing later films like 1999's The Matrix.\nOn the surface, it's hard to see any similarity at all between the Wachowskis' original Matrix film and Carpenter's work on They Live. In the case of the former, the Wachowskis dovetailed classic kung fu action with a rogue A.I. unit as sinister and omnipresent as Terminator 's Skynet. With the latter, Carpenter used tongue-in-cheek comedy and outlandish action to lampoon the traditional alien invasion film. Only when you examine each movie more closely do the resemblances start to emerge (not unlike Nada's first glimpse at the monochrome world beyond our own).\nThe Matrix tells the story of Keanu Reeve's Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer by day and hacker extraordinaire by night. Using the criminal alias \"Neo,\" Anderson uncovers the dark secret surrounding the seemingly ordinary world around him: that it is, in fact, a hyper realistic construct created by machines to keep humans at bay. Awakening from this artificial reality, Neo joins a group of resistance fighters attempting to destroy their robotic counterparts, freeing humanity from the yoke of their oppressors.\nAgain, it's difficult to see the similarities between The Matrix and They Live, but they are indeed present. Like the alien antagonists in They Live, The Matrix 's machines rely on a carefully-curated depiction of reality to subdue humankind, distracting us with our seemingly mundane surroundings as they use us as a literal power source.\nUsing deception and manipulation in lieu of outright violence, The Matrix 's antagonists need humanity to believe in the Matrix to ensure their survival — an attribute shared by the conniving aliens in They Live. In the case of each film, The Matrix and They Live even recruit human collaborators to their cause, promising them a chance for a heightened version of their artificial reality. (In the case of The Matrix, said collaborator takes the form of Cyrus, while in They Live, it's Holly.)\nWhile it's highly unlikely the Wachowskis looked to They Live as its primary source of inspiration, the influences are certainly ingrained in the film, nestled alongside the repeated references to Ghost in the Shell, Akira, and the filmography of Bruce Lee.\nThey Live might veer towards political satire and The Matrix might opt for more an existential approach, but the core ideas are the same in each film. For this reason alone, They Live would be worth remembering. On the other hand, admiring its narrative influence on The Matrix is just one more reason to love this under-appreciated 1988 action comedy, along with its effective humor, satisfying performances, and Carpenter's characteristically vibrant imagination. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Production of Shakespeare's Hamlet features1920s styles\n\n September 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Ted Black tblack@somdnews.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 667\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Those who enjoy plays by legendary playwright William Shakespeare will argue about which one of the Bard's works is truly best, and one of those plays typically in the discussion will be featured this month as the Twin Beach Players present \"Hamlet\" for eight shows beginning Friday, Sept. 20 in North Beach.Directed by Harvey Williams and Rachel Clites Cruz, who also plays the title character, the Twin Beach Players production of \"Hamlet\" will feature the numerous memorable characters and lines made famous by the Bard centuries ago although in costumes more reminiscent of the 1920s. In one scene, however, known as the play within the play, the characters don costumes more conducive to far more basic productions.\nIts numerous characters and plot twists are accompanied by memorable lines such as \"To thine own self be true\" and \"There are far more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy,\" and of course the engrossing soliloquy in which the title character initially asks, \"To be or not to be, that is the question\" as his madness approaches.\nWilliams, however, insisted that a hint of comedic tones were introduced to this version of the play.\n\"I've always loved Shakespeare,\" said Williams, who also plays King Claudius in addition to directing the play. \"I've read 'Hamlet,' I've seen the play and the movies and I've always wanted to direct it. But for our version I wanted to have a 1920s theme, complete with the costumes and a lot of the characteristics of the era.\"\nCruz, who also admits a passion for performing in Shakespeare plays dating back to her youth, yields most of the directing chores to Williams for this version while also playing the title character.\nHer willingness to assume the lead role came with the knowledge and understanding that Hamlet represents the ultimate challenge for any performer.\n\"Playing Hamlet is so challenging because his character is the epitome of all Shakespeare characters. He not only has the most lines and the most scenes, but he has seven soliloquies,\" she said. \"But I've always wanted to play Hamlet and be a part of this production. This is only my second time actually being up on stage with Twin Beach Players, but we have an amazing cast and crew here.\"\nMany of the Twin Beach Players regular performers each have key roles in \"Hamlet,\" including Cruz as the title character and Williams as King Claudius and Alexys Adams as Ophelia, Aaliyah Roach as Laertes, Terri McKinstry as Polonius and V. Stardust as Horatio, although audience members will notice that, by design, three characters typically deemed male are played by actresses and intentionally dubbed as female.\nCruz and Williams both noted that the strength of the Twin Beach Players over the years has been its willingness to attract and develop younger performers, with Addie Quinn, still one year removed from her freshman year at Huntingtown High School, playing dual roles as Rosencrantz and Marcellus.\n\"I got into the theater mainly because my older brother was an actor,\" Quinn said. \"I love working with the actors and directors here at Twin Beach Players. I usually have done other comedies, but I like being in something serious.\"\nIf you goThe Twin Beach Players production of Hamlet will run for eight shows at the North Beach Boys & Girls Club, located at 9021 Dayton Avenue in North Beach, from Sept. 20 to Oct. 5. Friday and Saturday shows will begin at 8 p.m. while the two Sunday shows on Sep. 22 and 29 will commence at 3 p.m.\nBased on the timeless classic by William Shakespeare and directed by Harvey Williams and Rachel Clites Cruz, the TBP production of Hamlet will include the characters made famous by Shakespeare and will offer the same intensity and drama that onlookers have always expected from the show, but with 1920s attire and occasionally some comedic overtones.\nDue to its adult content, dialogue and some scenes, however, this play is not recommended for children under 12 years of age.\nFor more information, go to twinbeachplayers.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Castro during his Avalon show.\nAccording to an announcement from the Avalon promoting the show, \"Cannon's love of music began at the age of nine, when he started playing the clarinet. Years later, holding a saxophone and breathing life into its soothing sounds, he discovered the soulful spark that ignites the palpable passion flowing from his horn each time he plays:\nThe Avalon said Castro is \"renowned for his creativity in neo-soul, jazz, fusion and hip-hop.\"\n\"J Castro's music speaks of love and life's struggles. His improvisational chops to contemporary jazz elevates the mind of his listeners with a sound that pleases their ears and sets their toes tapping,\" the venue said.\nSinger-songwriter Peter Bradley Adams will perform Saturday, Oct. 5 at the Avalon.

His brand of Americana nestles his often delicate, always heartfelt voice in the warm embrace of gentle guitar, tasteful dobro, subtle banjo, supportive bass, and unhurried percussion,\" the venue's announcement continued.\nFor more: https://www.peterbradleyadams.com/, https://avalonfoundation.org/, https://anthonycannon.com/ \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is the festival's 17th year, and the Friday evening VIP reception was sold out.The premier film, shown at noon Friday, was \"Call Me Dancer,\" which is directed by Leslie Shampaine and Pip Gilmour.\nShampaine won a Fulbright Scholarship for her work on this film. The film was about a young man from the streets of Mumbai facing challenges to achieve his passion for ballet.\n\"The film was finished before I received the Fulbright,\" Shampaine said. \"... My Fulbright was based on community impact in India for the film.\"\nShe said she is using the film to do a lot of outreach to underprivileged youth in India.\n\"One theme is everyone has a passion and the journey and obstacles that one goes through. Everyone has obstacles in their life. And the perseverance, hard work and hope that you need to keep going,\" Shampaine said.\nJohn King, executive producer of the film, said it took over five years to complete.\n\"The biggest challenge was that this was an international production. The fact that it went from India, to the U.S., to Israel, to London and back to the U.S. And for independent documentaries raising the money is a challenge,\" King said.\nCid Collins Walker, executive director of the film festival, gave opening welcomes and introductions. This is her eighth year with the festival.\nBy the time the festival ends Sunday, 17 short and feature length films will have been screened in Easton. Filmmakers are coming from a variety of locales, from Chile, to Romania, to Los Angeles.\n\"As a producer of an event like this, you are always looking for a film that will grab the public's attention. A good opening film is really important. It is the first thing that people see,\" Collins Walker said.\nCurating a film festival is an art in itself.\n\"I have learned over time that this is what the audience loves. The public loves to hear these stories right from the director or producer's mouth,\" Collins Walker said.\nShe said there is a driving purpose to her work.\n\"The arts are a great connecting force. It connects us all, and I believe we live in a fractured society, sadly. I like to produce these events to bring people together,\" Collins Walker said.\n\"The festival is good for the region. It is good for Talbot County. It is good for Chestertown. It is a hidden gem among our many arts celebrations. I would encourage people to check it out. I really love the way they highlight the unexpected,\" said Cassandra Vanhooser, director of the Talbot County Department of Economic Development and Tourism.\nThe festival has more screenings and events planned for Saturday and Sunday.

Through their various genres, they are expressing themselves through music that needs to be heard on a massive scale. The program also serves to connect these musicians with each other and to their local guitar dealers, increasing opportunities for development through community.\"\nAccording to the Maryland company, the PRS Pulse Artist program helps guitar players form stronger relationships with their go-to retail store and each other. Through the program, artists are granted exclusive discounts on guitars, amps, and accessories through their local Authorized PRS Dealer.\n\"Becoming a PRS Pulse Artist opened so many doors to me, industry wise and for my mentality as a full-time musician and songwriter,\" said Leoni Jane Kennedy. \"Having industry giants such as PRS supporting my creativity has not only been a dream come true, but has shown me what a team should really be. Now that I've graduated into the Official Artist roster, I feel I've achieved something so foundational to my career and I couldn't have asked for a better brand to represent and work with to show the world what I'm really made of.

With shows at 6:30 p.m. each night and additional 9:30 p.m. performances on Thursday through Sunday, this locally written and directed show promises a macabre experience that blurs the lines between reality and delusion.The production is recommended for ages 16 and up; guests under 16 must be accompanied by a responsible guardian. Tickets are available through the Avalon Foundation website at avalonfoundation.org/event/stage-fright-curtain-call.\nSet in 1997, \"Stage Fright: Curtain Call\" invites audiences into the dark, twisted world of Lou Baker, a 95-year-old former showman tormented by a violent past and spectral figures. Facing release from a psychiatric institution after over three decades, Lou's story unfolds through a captivating, immersive theater experience filled with unresolved mysteries, dark humor, and a chilling confrontation between past and present.\nInspired by real ghost stories, the experience features sound and lighting effects, unique smells, special themed drinks and specially crafted Lyon Rum cocktails, making it an evening attendees won't soon forget. Mature themes and extensive walking are part of this production.\n\"Stage Fright: Curtain Call\" is the thrilling final act of a trilogy, with each installment having been set in a different era — 1927, 1964 and now, at the turn of the century in 1997. The production explores the final days of Lou Baker, who is \"95 and can barely get out of bed on his own.\" When presented with one last chance to release the spirit of Marguerite, his long, lost love and the ghost of the Avalon Theatre, he is met with a harrowing twist in his spiraling and tortured tale.\nAttendees are encouraged to dress up in their favorite '90s attire or Halloween costume. The play draws heavy inspiration from '90s MTV, and The Factory invites guests to arrive as their best Britney Spears, Madonna, Notorious B.I.G., Spice Girls, and other '90s celebrities.\nCecile Strom directs the production, with Talley Wilford as assistant director and Casey Rauch as writer and co-collaborator.\n\"A key element of The Factory's immersive productions is the integration of film,\" Director Cecile Storm said. \"It adds depth, context, and atmosphere to the live experience. This production takes this idea to new heights. I don't want to give too much away, but expect the boundary between stage and screen to blur in exciting and unexpected ways.\"\nKatie Cox stars in the leading role, supported by the Beauty Shop Quartet: Jennifer Madino as Marguerite Gardot, Grace Vorosmarti as Shirley Boudreaux, Maddie Megahan as Vivian Baker and Jeri Alexander as Minnie Valentine. Art and production are managed by Maggii Sarfaty, and Ray Nissen leads the music direction.\n\"The acting is captivating and intense. The music is well done and is such a nice touch to this already so creatively awesome haunted house-like experience,\" shared an audience member from a past production. Another remarked, \"It was great to see how the connection is made and everything is so eerily familiar, seeing as it's about the ghost that has haunted the Avalon for many years right here in Easton.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's a magical destination where readers go on rollercoasters, enjoy slides, and ride the teacups, as any great amusement park should offer.But you need a mode of transportation usually involving wheels to get to Six Flags America.\nBut to get to Rollercoaster Land, you just need imagination and Glenn's storytelling.\n\"Mommy's Adventures,\" is her first book, self-published, inspired by life with her seven-year-old son, Wyatt.\n\"It starts out with the mother trying to get her son, Wyatt, to bed. Naturally, he doesn't want to go. So mom pulls out her magical handbag,\" Glenn explains.\nInside the bag are traveling goodies like sunscreen and a map. Mom utters a special rhyme, and like \"The Wizard of Oz,\" they are whisked away, Rollercoaster Land being the first of what may be many magical locales.\nThe 30-page book is for ages 3-8, with colorful illustrations from Pakistani artist Ayshea Zaki.\nLike the mom in her story, 31-year-old Glenn is being whisked away too. At the beginning of the month she had the joy of reading her book to kindergarteners in H.H. Garnet Elementary School.\nAnd as a cafeteria worker at Rock Hall Elementary School, she has a captive audience, who, at times, are probably more insistent than traditional publishers.\n\"They're coming up to ask me, 'when's the next book coming out?',\" Glenn laughed.\nThis one took her about six months to write and she's planning on having a table at the next Rock Hall Fall Fest, an event that features various vendors.\nFor the magic seekers interested in her book, they can find it at Amazon.com under \"Mommy's Adventures.\"\nAnd where are mommy and Wyatt off to for their next mystical journey?\n\"Maybe space,\" Glenn said with a smile. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'The stars aligned for us': Tall Ships festival delights\n\n November 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LISA J. GOTTO Special to the Kent County News | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1419\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For anyone who has ever fantasized about having a sailing adventure aboard a schooner or skipjack on the high seas, the Sultana Downrigging Festival in Chestertown is the place to be. For that matter, it's also a great place to be if you're a fan of unique small craft adventures, model ship building, maritime and Kent County history, bluegrass music, and a variety of Chesapeake-themed foods—because this three-day event has it all and then some!Over the last several years, all these interests have culminated into one of the most popular waterfront festivals in the mid-Atlantic.\nA brisk, sunny morning ushered in the day's plethora of activities, which for many, began with the African American History walking tour. Chestertown's old Customs House, now known as Washington College's Starr Center, was the tour's jumping off point which then continued along the waterfront and into notable parts of Chestertown.\nThe waterfront, said community historian and tour leader, Airlee Ringgold Johnson, has changed quite a bit over the last two centuries, despite its nostalgic appearance with this past weekend's docking of tall ships in the marina.\n\"Our harbor is remarkably different from the harbor of 19th century Chestertown. There was once a seafood factory, a tomato factory, a basket factory, and a fertilizer factory,\" she said. \"And there was always traffic going up and down the river.\"\nPainting a picture of the challenges of the day, Ringgold Johnson and Paula Reeder, a volunteer for the Chestertown Heartland Group, pointed out some of the town's unique homes and architecture as the group headed to the intersection of Water and Cannon Streets.\nBy 1871, they explained, Chestertown was home to many freed slaves, or slaves who were able to purchase their freedom from their owners. There were also many rules to be followed, which included not owning a gun, a dog, or a knife, and following strict curfews imposed upon African American residents at that time. It was also well known that this particular part of Water Street was home to the wealthiest residents of Chestertown; but as you head south on Water Street where it meets Cannon Street there was a virtual dividing line between the wealthy homeowners and many of the community's African American population who worked for them and resided in the blocks just beyond Cannon and into the community known as Scott's Point.\nWhile history and education are certainly a big part of what the downrigging weekend is all about, it comes in many forms, including the activities found a few blocks closer to the center of town where the Sultana Education Foundation is located. The Holt Center was home on Saturday to a merry band of live animals at the Echoes of Nature Exhibit, which included various turtle species, a black snake, a broad-chested, red-tailed hawk, and even a cute, cuddly chinchilla. The kids also enjoyed live music and the creative adventure of making their own sailor hats.\nHolt Center also buzzed with the enthusiasm of model boat and ship builders and their admirers and like-minded enthusiasts.\nFurther down Cross Street, impressions of the sea-faring life were on exhibit at the Massoni Art Gallery where artist, Marc Castelli, was in house to talk to art lovers about the stories behind his paintings as depicted in his \"Merrier\" series of watercolors. Castelli, who also lives what he paints, is well-known for his genuine and realistic depictions of the men and women who take to their local waterways to make a living.\nCastelli's book, \"Illustrating the New Treasure Island\" was also part of a series of book talks featured over the weekend and organized by the Bookplate, which included Edward O. Murdy's, \"Field Guide to Fishes of the Chesapeake Bay.\"\nBack down at the marina, by mid-morning the sounds of the bluegrass band, Serene Green, were providing a melodic backdrop for the scores of Downrigging revelers out to tour the impressive collection of tall ships, small crafts, and collector's boats that were on display by private owners and organizations alike.\nThere were a total of nine amazing tall ships on display. Joining Chestertown's own Schooner Sultana, were several ships out of Baltimore including The Pride of Baltimore II, Lady Maryland, and the Sigsbee, and ships that came from as far away as Nantucket's Lynx and Key West's Bloodhound, a replica of one of the very first racing yachts of its era. Many of the ships took part in group sails down the Chester River that carried some 3,500 passengers over the course of the weekend.\nThe Bleinberger family of Kent Island, who said this was their second trip to Chestertown's Sultana Festival, enjoyed an on-deck tour of the vessel, Maryland Dove.\n\"You can't beat the weather, and you can't beat the beauty of the tall ships,\" said Morgan Bleinberger. The family, who are avid boaters and self-proclaimed fisherfolk, are also fans of live music, so the event seemed like the perfect afternoon out with the family.\n\"We love bluegrass, too,\" said Hans Bleinberger of the music at the event. \"The weather was perfect, so the stars aligned for us.\"\nKent County resident, Pat Jewell, who was also attending the festival on Saturday with her son, Zach, said she wanted to bring Zach's daughter, Georgia, out to see the big boats. Having roots on the Eastern Shore, Jewell said she has been to the festival many times.\n\"I grew up in Calvert County, right on the water… and I sail.\" Relaying that love of the water and these beautiful vessels is something she said she hopes to instill in her granddaughter.\nWhile Downrigging is truly a festival for kids of all ages, it also serves as a celebratory reminder of the mission the Sultana Educational Foundation (SEF) takes on every year to ensure that all of the area's public school children have the opportunity to explore and learn what an awesome and diverse resource we have in the Chesapeake Bay.\nOver the course of the weekend, Drew McMullen, president and founder of the SEF, can be found down on docks amongst the ships and many other members of the organization that help educate and instruct upwards of 12,000 public school kids per year that come in from Kent County and various parts of the Eastern Shore.\n\"Our core mission—and we're coming up on our 30th anniversary—from the beginning, we have been laser focused on environmental literacy for kids. Getting kids out on the Chesapeake Bay; that's why we build the Sultana,\" said McMullen.\nThe schooner Sultana is a historically accurate replica of a Boston-built merchant vessel that served for four years as the smallest schooner ever commissioned in the British Royal Navy. This vessel now serves as a floating classroom that conveys not just a history, but experiences in team building, and a perspective on our regional waterways that they might not otherwise have.\nThe Foundation's mission, said McMullen, is reinforced in the sense that a child will experience an average of 35 days of environmental instruction as they progress from kindergarten through eighth grade. In addition to experiencing being aboard the Sultana, the organization provides all manner of programs and field trips that immerse kids in the ecosystem of the Chesapeake Bay and its inhabitants.\n\"And while their teachers are the real heroes, our job is to do all sorts of things that teachers can't do in the classroom.\"\nThis also could not be done, he said, without the help of an extensive network of volunteers; 137 in all, (85 who participate in the festival weekend alone) and the support of a wonderfully receptive and engaged community.\n\"A lot of this works because the whole community helps out, either by donation, or by donating a good or a service,\" he said. \"For a small town like this to support an organization like ours, is not an easy thing.\"\nBeyond the educational aspects, McMullen said, Downrigging is an event unlike any other, as it is the largest annual gathering of tall ships in the nation, and it helps bring together a specific group of enthusiasts who share a passion for the beauty and prestige of tall ships and the historical maritime aesthetic that embodies them.\n\"Some participants fly in from hundreds and hundreds of miles away just to be here every year.\"\nBesides that, he added, the festival is a fitting way to close out the instructional year for them.\n\"This is a way to celebrate … we are almost to the end of the year. This is the Sultana's last sail of the year, and it's sort of a way for us to say, 'Yes, we took a lot of kids out, now let's celebrate and have some fun!'\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Subscription-based streaming services have changed audiences' consumption of content by \"over producing\" content and making it difficult to gauge what people actually want to see, he said.\nMoore said he wants to take a step back and go back to his roots to better understand how to give audiences quality content. And for him there's no better sounding board than the people of the Eastern Shore.\nFor Moore, the event on Thursday will be interactive, funny and most importantly informative of what he believes best represents American culture and audiences.\n\"I don't want people to think this is like going to a college lecture,\" Moore said. \"We're going to have some fun and talk about movies and talk about entertainment, talk about fun stuff and in a way that people laugh and can engage and it can be a lively night.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hollywood producer hears from local moviegoers\n\n November 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 684\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — A wave of laughter erupted at the Oxford Community Center on Thursday evening as a crowd watched video clips of a young Ben Affleck imitating an Eastern Shore accent in an effort to act as Chris Moore, a Hollywood film producer and Talbot County native.That evening, Moore led a discussion of the challenges faced by the movie industry, particularly the shift to streaming services and the decline of traditional theater attendance. Throughout the speech, he sought audience engagement and gathered information to better understand American audiences.\nIn an interview earlier in the week, Moore called the people of Talbot County \"a real slice of America\" whose input he valued greatly in examining the state of his industry.\n\"I'm going to talk about the movie business, but what I really want to talk about is how it's falling apart at the moment, and I'm trying to learn a little bit more,\" Moore said Thursday.\nMoore spoke on the concerns he has with the quality of produced films. He asked the audience what they would like to see in newly released films and what it would take to get them to watch a film in person.\nAn array of answers came from several people, but the message remained consistent: people want quality films with quality stories.\nCid Collins Walker, executive director for the Chesapeake Film Festival, said she looks at hundreds of films every year and she relies on her knowledge to pick out films that stand out against the rest.\n\"I think you have to continue to take risks and find the best writers,\" Walk said. \"I get all tons of scripts now. They're very exciting to read. Some of them, once again, are still works in progress, but I think you just need to encourage the process.\"\nAt some point in the event, Moore presented a Netflix home page filled with recommendations and shared research on why audiences get frustrated when they are offered too many choices. When audiences are presented with more than 5-6 options, consumers start to feel uncomfortable and have difficulty deciding.\n\"I think that the other problem is somehow the algorithm the menu uses is actually creating more frustration,\" Moore said. \"So most likely, you're going to watch something that was on here that you've already seen or you're going to wait for the person that is sitting next to you, who's going to say, 'I want to watch this.' You're going to decide how much you hate it.\"\nArt Murr, an attendee of the event, said he and his wife love movies and said he figured that Hollywood was confused about the vapid changes going through the industry.\n\"He's confirming (Hollywood) is confused,\" Murr said. \"They should be confused, but we're not helping. And I do totally agree that there's way too many choices that if you're given like, four things, you choose one of the four things. If you're given 65 things … you have no idea, and you walk away, and you don't watch anything.\"\nLiza Ledford, executive director of the Oxford Community Center and sister to Moore, said she worked in the film industry and with new technology it has drastically changed the communication between audiences and filmmakers.\n\"We lost a lot of our tools to vote,\" Ledford said. \"What things we like, what things we don't like, and with the new restructuring of Hollywood, it's hard not to be able to trust Sony Classics or Fox Searchlights. The branding of different things has all become mesh together. So it's harder to know where to find certain types of things.\"\nToward the end of the event, Moore took the time to thank attendees for their participation and said that though movies are not essential for living they are important and their feedback helps the way the industry moves forward.\n\"I know the choices you make for what you watch,\" Moore said. \"…But I know Hollywood and movies are less (important) than how you pay bills, your health, your kids (and) mental health. …but I do think it is nice to be surprised and happy and sort of snuck up on by a story that you're surprised by.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The festival was sponsored by Main Street Chestertown, Rosin Creek Collaborative, 114 High and Molly's Place to name a few.\nDuring the two-day event, couches were placed on High Street facing the music stage, in a homey atmosphere where one could meet friends and visitors of Chestertown, warming up by the fire barrels just a brisk walk away.\nThe event began Dec. 6 with the opening ceremony courtesy of Jimmy Kinstle portraying Dickens.\nKinstle introduced Queen Victoria who read off every child's name from Santa's nice list, courtesy of Santa's House next to Fountain Park.\nFollowing, the audience was entertained by the Kent County High School Jazz Band, Garnet Elementary Chorus, River Voices and finally, The Devil's Brigade, formerly known as The American Rouges ending the night in a rowdy fashion.\nBonfires were lit, oysters and beer were served and food vendors were on hand. The new executive director for Main Street Chestertown, Sonny Huntzinger described the night as magical.\nOn Dec.7, 113 racers, contested the morning chill in the 5-K, Run/Walk and Kids' Fun Run, \"Run like the Dickens\" commentated by Kinstle, never breaking character.\nRace coordinator Renee Bench and vice chair of the Board for Mainstreet Chestertown, pointed out there were not as many people as last year due to the weather, but was pleased to see the turnout all the same.\nFinishing first for men's was Joshua Dorsey, winner for female's was Jamie Hicks, and Ethan McIntire, age 15, and C. Mann, age 8 finished first in their age range.\nOver the day, the sun warmed the street and alcohol and food vendors opened up at noon. Music was performed throughout the day, traditional Irish songs to classic rock, and folk.\nFor kids, a petting zoo was situated over by Fountain Park as well as a puppet show performed by, Horns Punch and Judy Show.\nFor shoppers, the farmer's market was open, and further down was Heritage Village in the Bank, featuring a native flower farm, River Arts, WAC Women's League, Museum of Kent and Tarot readings.\nFor history buffs, the Holiday House tour afforded ticket buyers a journey to \"festively decorated homes on Queen, Maple, High, Cannon and Water Street,\" as stated on the Chestertown website.\nPeople could navigate the busy streets, seeing the homes in any order they wished.\nChestertown Police Chief Dixon, his crew in bobby hats, said over the two days there was an estimated 1,500-2,000 attendees and reported there were no incidents.\nHuntzinger was thrilled by the efficiency in the planning process, having 25 years of experience in community development and other related fields. She noted that Main Street Chestertown Assistant Director Kelly Reed and a few volunteers planned the entire thing, while partnering with the Town of Chestertown.\nShe appreciated the hard work of them all, especially the Town's Streets and Public Works Department for setting up the stage among the many other tasks.\nHuntzinger said all revenue, goes toward advancing Main Street's mission to promote and support a diverse range of educational, cultural entertainment and recreational activities.\nPlanning is a long process for such an event like this, Huntzinger acknowledged, and as much as they are looking forward to the next Dickens festival, she said they need more volunteers to sit in on committees and get involved.\nIf you have an interest in volunteering, contact the offices at 410-778-2991. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Uncork the perfect holiday feast with these wine-pairing secrets\n\n December 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Anne Jolly Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1030\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The holiday season is here, bringing festive gatherings and delicious meals. As you plan your celebrations, choosing the perfect wines to accompany your dishes can enhance the entire experience. Whether you're a wine novice or a seasoned enthusiast, these holiday wine pairing tips will make your celebrations unforgettable.With a few simple tips and secrets, you'll confidently pick winners every time. From classic turkey to creative desserts, there's a match for every course.\nTips for perfect holiday wine pairings\nHere are the top tips for choosing wines to complement your holiday dishes and delight your guests. Understanding basic pairing principles will help you confidently navigate the world of holiday wines.\nCreate balance\nOne of the most important concepts in wine pairing is to create balance in flavor and intensity. Pair delicate foods with light and subtle wines, and rich and hearty dishes with robust, full-bodied wines.\nSweetness is another area where balance is an important consideration.To avoid flavor clashes, choose a wine that's as sweet or slightly sweeter than your dish.\nAcidity is another important factor.Many holiday foods, like buttery mashed potatoes or juicy prime rib, are rich and fatty. High-acid wines can cut through these dishes, so you can taste each bite of food as if it were your first.\nFinally, select wines that go with the herbs and spices in your dish rather than overpower them. When selecting a wine, focus on your dish's most prominent spices or herbs.\nAdd variety to your holiday wines\nDon't forget sparkling wines - they're not just for toasts. They're versatile and can pair well with everything from appetizers to main courses to desserts.\nUsing regional wines is another way to add variety. Wines often pair well with foods from the same region. For example, serve Italian wines with Italian dishes.\nWhen it comes to holiday wine pairing, there are tried and true favorites that you can count on. If you are in doubt, choose crowd-pleasing wines like pinot noir or sauvignon blanc. These classic wines pair well with a variety of holiday dishes.\nMake sure you offer various non-alcoholic alternatives for your guests.Provide high-quality grape juices or non-alcoholic wines for those who don't drink alcohol.\nServing and enjoying holiday wine\nMake sure you serve your wines at the right temperature. Serve white wines chilled and serve red wines slightly below room temperature. The correct temperature can significantly affect the taste and enjoyment of your wine.\nLastly, trust yourself and don't worry too much about the rules. If you enjoy a particular wine with a certain dish, then that's the perfect pairing for you.\nPerfect wines for your holiday feast\nNow that we've covered the essential tips for holiday wine pairing, let's review some specific recommendations for your holiday table. Whether you're serving a traditional roast turkey, a succulent ham or vegetarian options, there is a wine that will make your meal even better.\nThese are suggestions meant to inspire you, not strict rules. Experiment and choose the wine pairing that seems right for you and your guests.\nTurkey or chicken\nWhen serving roast turkey, choose a versatile chardonnay. Oaked, full-bodied chardonnays offer a richness that pairs well with white meat and many side dishes.\nIf you prefer red wine, a medium-bodied pinot noir goes well with the delicate poultry flavors. The wine's light to medium body and bright acidity pair well with both white and dark meat.\nHam\nHoliday ham 's saltiness and subtle sweetness make for interesting wine pairings. A slightly sweet riesling is a fabulous choice. The wine's natural sweetness balances the ham's saltiness, while its crisp acidity cuts through the richness of the meat.\nFor red wine enthusiasts, a fruity zinfandel is a perfect match. Its bold berry flavors and hints of spice stand up well to the strong flavors of ham, especially if it's glazed or honey baked.\nBeef\nBold red wines truly shine when it comes to beef. A full-bodied cabernet sauvignon is a classic choice for a beef roast like prime rib. The tannins in the wine help cut through the beef's richness.\nAnother outstanding option is a rich malbec. Malbec has a smooth texture that goes well with a tender, well-prepared roast. The wine's moderate acidity helps balance the richness of the meat.\nLamb\nLamb's rich, slightly gamey flavors are best paired with robust wines. Medium or full-bodied reds are ideal companions for this flavorful meat. A syrah's dark fruit and smoky character pair beautifully with grilled or roasted lamb.\nBordeaux blends, typically consisting of cabernet sauvignon, merlot and cabernet franc, are another fantastic choice. These wines provide a complex flavor and go especially well with lamb cooked with herbs like rosemary or thyme.\nPork\nPork's versatility allows for a range of wine pairings. Choose a medium-bodied red like merlot, which offers plum flavors that complement pork's lean meat.\nAlternatively, a fuller-bodied white like viognier is the perfect choice for enhancing pork's subtle flavors. For pork dishes with fruity sauces or glazes, a pinot gris is an excellent choice, as its crisp acidity balances the sauce's sweetness.\nVegetarian dishes\nFocus on the meal's dominant flavors, textures and cooking methods rather than defaulting to white wines. Mushrooms, with their earthy, umami flavors, pair well with light to medium-bodied red wines like pinot noir.\nCrisp white wines work well with green vegetables and salads. A sauvignon blanc beautifully enhances the flavors of asparagus, bell peppers or zucchini dishes. Try a fuller-bodied white like a viognier or an unoaked chardonnay for roasted root vegetables.\nDessert\nPairing wines with desserts can be a delightful way to end a meal. The wine should be as sweet or sweeter as the dessert so it doesn't taste bitter or sour in comparison. Sauternes, a sweet white wine from Bordeaux, France, goes well with fruit-based desserts.\nRuby port is a classic choice for chocolate desserts. The wine's sweetness and body stand up to dark chocolate's intensity. Moscato d'Asti, a light, sweet and slightly sparkling wine, is perfect for lighter desserts. It pairs wonderfully with fresh fruit, light pastries or sorbet.\nToast to perfect pairings\nWine pairing is both an art and a science. These tips provide a foundation but trust your palate and experiment. After all, the most important part of any holiday gathering is the joy of sharing good food and drink with loved ones.\nAnne Jolly is the creator of the food blog Upstate Ramblings.

    "title": "How long is too long for Christmas decorations",
    "date": "2024-12-19",

    "content": "How long is too long for Christmas decorations\n\n December 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michele Brosius Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 869\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The holiday season sparks lively discussions about traditions and preferences — from pumpkin spice to candy corn and the timing of Christmas decorations. Once the tree is up and the halls are decked, the question becomes how long holiday decorations should stay — is there a perfect timeline, or is it all about personal choice and sentimental value?For some, clearing the decorations right after New Year's symbolizes a fresh start. Others follow tradition and keep the festive spirit alive until the Twelfth Night on Jan. 5. Then, some stretch the season further — leaving lights aglow months after the holiday ends — prompting the age-old question: When to take down Christmas decorations?\nChristmas decor through the ages\nOnce central to winter solstice celebrations, evergreen trees symbolized life during the darkest days. By the 16th century, candles were added to represent Christ's light, and the tradition spread through Europe and America, evolving with tinsel, glass ornaments and electric lights.\nToday, Christmas decor reflects diverse styles, from traditional red and green to minimalist or trendy themes like pink Christmas. Whether rustic, glamorous or nature inspired, modern decorations allow for a personalized festive atmosphere.\nHoliday decor: Tradition vs. personal preference\nIn some families, tradition dictates that all decorations come down on Epiphany, Jan. 6, marking the Twelfth Night when the Wise Men visited baby Jesus. Others prefer not to wait that long, taking down the tree the morning after Christmas and cleaning the house in time for New Year's Eve festivities.\nYou might be one of those people who would appreciate a year-round tree if you love Christmas, the holiday candies that come with it and the warm and cozy feeling of having a glowing tree in the corner of your room. The internet is full of year-round Christmas tree decor ideas like a sparkly heart-themed Valentine's Day tree or a pretty pastel tree to welcome spring.\nAccording to a 2023 poll on Bob Vila, 16% of respondents said they take their Christmas decor down immediately following the holiday. Just over 60% of respondents said they typically leave decorations up until the conclusion of Epiphany — and the remainder — 21% of poll participants — indicated that they enjoy keeping their decorations in place at least until the end of January.\nMultiple factors at play\nFor many, deciding when to take holiday decor down results from several factors. These include whether or not they need to get their closets or garage storage space back in order, the types of decor and if it's fragile or a family heirloom that requires greater care.\nThe availability of community recycling and environmental waste disposal can also be a factor for those opting for a real tree over an artificial one. The National Fire Protection Association reports that most Christmas tree fires occur in January, often due to dried-out trees that pose a heightened fire risk. Safety is key if you plan to keep your real tree up for an extended period.\nChristmas tree safety\nProper care and precautions can help ensure Christmas tree safety throughout the holiday season. Water your tree daily to keep it from drying out and becoming a fire hazard. Position the tree away from heat sources like radiators or fireplaces, which can accelerate drying and increase risk. Check that all lights are in good condition, avoid any frayed cords or broken bulbs and always turn off the lights before leaving the house or going to bed.\nEnergy efficiency\nAnother important consideration is the higher energy bills in keeping Christmas tree lights and outdoor holiday lighting running throughout the day. While there are energy-efficient LED lights on the market, given the additional expenses acquired during the holiday season, keeping electricity bills down during this time can be a priority for some.\nCaring for your Christmas decorations\nWhen you finally put your decorations away, making them last will require proper care and storage. Wrap fragile decorations individually in tissue paper or bubble wrap, and store them in sturdy, divided containers to prevent breakage. Wrap string lights around cardboard or a spool to avoid tangling, and check for any damaged bulbs before storage.\nArtificial trees should be disassembled and stored in their original box or a tree bag to protect against dust and moisture. Keep all decorations in a cool, dry space, away from extreme temperatures or humidity. Proper storage ensures your decorations stay in great condition for many holiday seasons to come.\nWhen to take Christmas decorations down\nDeciding when to take down Christmas decorations is a personal choice shaped by tradition, practicality and lifestyle. Whether you follow a historical timeline like Epiphany, embrace a New Year's refresh or extend the festive spirit, the key is finding what suits your home and schedule.\nYour lifestyle and preferences will dictate the best answer to how long Christmas decorations should stay up, and when it comes down to it, if someone isn't contributing to the household or paying your energy bill, then their opinion on the topic shouldn't matter. Do what makes you and your family happy and let the grinches of the world scowl from afar.\nMichele Brosius is the creator of Midlife Healthy Living where she expertly combines her love for cooking with budget-conscious nutrition strategies.

    "content": "'Ziggy's World': Rock Hall artist keeps wheels turning on train display\n\n January 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BOB FORD Special to the Kent County News | Section: Entertainment \n \n 712\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When Ziggy Carter immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1960 at the age of 14, he carried with him two suitcases.\"In one suitcase were my clothes,\" Carter says. \"In the other, smaller but somewhat heavier, were my electric trains.\"\nA fascination with model trains has, obviously, been a lifelong obsession for Carter, and, until recently, finding a place to create a holiday display for his treasures was stretching into what seemed like a lifelong quest as well.\n\"For the last five years, I was always looking for a store window to use, but everyone was worried about liability or insurance,\" Carter says. \"Then I asked Fresh Start and they said I could have their whole greenhouse. It's wonderful.\"\nCarter, a multi-talented artist and builder, who has become a quaint, if quirky symbol of a town sometimes described the same way, finally found a place to unpack.\n\"He came to us in October with the train show idea and it was great timing,\" said Nina Flynn, the manager of Fresh Start, a produce-centric grocery near the central crossroads of Main and Sharp Streets. \"Rich (owner Rich Seewald) and I did a little train set thing last year around the holidays and we underestimated how difficult it was. Ziggy said he could definitely do a better train show.\"\nWell, yes. Carter's huge collection of trains and assorted paraphernalia now fill the 30-foot by 40-foot greenhouse at the rear of Fresh Start, a space that was available at this time of year. As many as eight trains whir around the intricate series of tracks; over bridges, around bends, and through Henry's Mountain, a large plaster eminence built at the request of local photographer JP Henry.\n\"He said he would like to see a mountain, so I had to build a mountain,\" Carter says.\nThe trains, which began operating the weekend after Thanksgiving, ran from noon to 4 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays, through Sunday, Jan. 5. The expansive display itself can be seen during all regular store hours. More than 100 local businesses and individuals contributed funds to help Carter build the incredible show. He also invested more than $1,000 of his own money.\n\"Saturdays are a big day. We get a lot of kids and a lot of older people reminiscing about the old days and the trains they had around the Christmas tree,\" Carter says. \"The kids like to chase the trains around the table, following them as they go.\"\nCarter is best-known around Rock Hall for his artistic installations. He built the six-foot blue heron metal sculpture displayed outside Harbor Shack, and executed the whimsical storefront sign above the That Place On Main restaurant, and created the more-than-life-size depictions of Snoopy and Woodstock at the American Rock Hall Garage. Carter was also the featured artist for the 2024 Rock Hall FallFest promotional poster that was on display all over Kent County.\nRock Hall was not necessarily a destination for Carter when his sailboat broke down here 25 years ago, but he eventually made it his home.\n\"I was shipwrecked,\" he says. \"I was only planning to stay for one night. I was sailing south from Maine on a 40-foot Hinckley, having come down through the canal, and was having engine problems, and some other problems as well.\"\nAfter sorting those out, he decided to stay, and somehow the trains got here, too. Carter, who turned 78 last month, has been battling health problems as he worked to pull together the holiday display. He receives a chemotherapy treatment every two weeks, a course that will last through most of February. It is the main reason for the limited hours he is able to run the trains.\n\"It really knocks you, and I've lost 60 pounds,\" Carter says. \"The doctors just say, 'We'll see how it goes.' What can you do? I'm enjoying what I'm doing here, and I've had a wonderful life with great adventures. No regrets at all.\"\nThe only regret might have been if his holiday train display, something he imagined in his fertile mind's eye for so long, had not become a reality. But here it is, chugging along literally the same way Carter is chugging along metaphorically. The layout is loud, and colorful, and full of action, surprises, and the delights for the season. Pretty much the same as him. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It will run April 17 to 27 at the Oxford Community Center.\nAuditions will be held at the Avalon Theatre in Easton at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 14, and Wednesday, Jan. 15.\nPlay summary:After history professor John Oldman unexpectedly resigns from the University, his startled colleagues impulsively invite themselves to his home, pressing him for an explanation. But they're shocked to hear his reason for premature retirement: John claims he must move on because he is immortal, and cannot stay in one place for more than ten years without his secret being discovered. Tempers rise and emotions flow as John's fellow professors attempt to poke holes in his story, but it soon becomes clear that his tale is as impossible to disprove as it is to verify. What starts out as a friendly gathering soon builds to an unexpected and shattering climax. Acclaimed science fiction writer Jerome Bixby, writer of the original 'Star Trek' and 'The Twilight Zone', originally conceived this story back in the early 1960's. It would become his last great work.\n\"TAP will be casting 10 roles. All ages, genders, ethnicities, body types, abilities, and skill levels are welcome to audition and will be considered for roles,\" the drama group said in a press release.\nHere are the roles:John: A history professor who resigns from his job to move to a new home. He claims to be immortal and must move every ten years to avoid being discovered.\nHarry: A biology professor.\nEdith: An art history professor.\nDan: An anthropologist.\nSandy: A historian who is in love with John.\nArt: An archaeology professor.\nLinda: A young student.\nWill: A psychiatrist and physician.\nTwo Movers that will double as our orchestra.\nReadings will be selected scenes from the script provided during the audition. You can reach director Cecile Storm by emailing hello@cecilestorm.com for any special accommodations.\nProduction crewTAP also needs a production crew for sets, lights, sound, costumes well as a stage crew. If you are interested, come to any audition to find out more information or send an email to hello@cecilestorm.com.\nThe nonprofit Tred Avon Players were founded in 1982.

    "date": "2025-01-24",

    "content": "Maryland stories: Filmmaker's new movie aims to scare\n\n January 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Ted Black tblack@somdnews.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 555\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the two decades since she graduated from Patuxent High School in southern Maryland, local actress, producer and writer Victoria (Fratz) Fradkin has developed a reputation among those familiar with horror films, and recently the newly christened mother unveiled her second such film in that genre.Fradkin, 37, a Maryland native who attended The Calverton School in Huntingtown as an eighth and ninth grader before transferring to Patuxent High, vaulted onto the scene nearly 10 years ago when her debut film, \"Electric Love\" (2018) won for best world premiere at the San Diego International Film Festival, followed three years later by her first horror film \"Val\" in 2021.\nLast November, Fradkin and her husband, Aaron Fradkin, a Los Angeles-based writer and director originally from Massachusetts, collaborated on yet another foray into the horror genre with \"Beezel,\" which was released last fall. Months later, only a week before Christmas, they welcomed their first child, a daughter, and the tandem has remained busy.\nHer newest film was released on streaming services nationwide last fall.\n\"When we first started to make 'Beezel' I wanted to be able to tell the story in three parts and then weave it together through one thread,\" Fradkin, who now lives on the West Coast in California, said. \"Of course, even after it's finished you never know how it's going to be received by the audience until you see it during the premiere. What I found most enjoyable was seeing and hearing the audience react in different scenes. It was pretty much the reactions that we were hoping for.\"\n\"Beezel\" covers six tumultuous decades as three unwitting guests of a cursed New England home stumble upon a sinister secret dwelling beneath its floors — an eternal witch with an insatiable thirst for the souls of the living. In actuality, the film was set inside the crawl space of the very home in which Aaron Fradkin was raised and his parents made no changes to the eery setting.\nAlthough she is trying to carve her own niche in the industry, especially among horror film makers, Fradkin admits there have been several influences along the way, including independent director Damien McCarthy known for \"Oddity\" and actress Naomi Watts, who has emerged as one of the leading ladies in the fright film set.\n\"I've tried my hand in acting, but I really feel more at home writing and producing,\" Fradkin said. \"A lot of the success from horror movies stems from the setting. We filmed much of 'Beezel' in my husband's parents' old house in the crawl space. It was really creepy, but it wasn't a set, it was just that way. His parents have since sold that house, but the new owners kept the crawl space the same way. They always wanted to live in a haunted house.\"\n\"Beezel\" follows on the heels of \"Val,\" co-written by Fradkin and her husband, produced by Victoria Fradkin, who also played the role of \"Jenny\" while Misha Reeves played the title character. Zachary Mooren, Erik Griffin, Sufe Bradshaw and Kyle Howard also play primary roles in the Patuxent graduate's first foray into the horror genre.\n\"I want people to know that movie was an escape to go back into the movies of the 2000s,\" Fradkin said. \"It doesn't take itself too seriously. We pretty much wrote the entire script with all of these actors in mind.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Local author asks, does a kitten belong in school?\n\n January 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 477\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Growing up in Massachusetts, in the mid-80's, second-grader Nancy Mugele, now Head of Kent School, a private day school in Chestertown, had an adorable and stubborn gray kitten that followed her to class.The affectionate feline was called Jingles. Her unique personality left a big impression because years later, the kitten would be the subject of Mugele's first children's book, \"Jingles Goes to School.\"\nLate October, Bumble Bee Books, the children's publishing department of Olympia Publishers, put out the book and can now be purchased at Bumblebee Books website, on Amazon, and locally here at the Book Plate, in downtown Chestertown.\nMugele based her book off her childhood, even mentioning her home, the house with the red shutters at 19 Bonney Lane. That was where Jingles escaped from back then, braving the New England winters to follow Mugele to school. Mugele's mother had to place her infant son in a stroller to come pick up Jingles.\n\"That's not normal behavior for a cat,\" Mugele said laughing.\nThis amusing anecdote is the plot of the book.\nIn between the colorful illustrated pages, Jingles displays to Nancy's teacher, Miss Bevivino, her class, and the principal, Mr. Willett, her love of learning. At one point, Jingles even plays the piano, \"learning to trill in all the right places,\" at the school concert.\nWill Jingles earn the affection of some of her harshest critics, like the principal?\nOne thing is for sure, Jingles loves school, and so does her creator, the Head of Kent School of nine years with a career in education over 20 years.\n\"It's really remarkable, the transformative power of books,\" Mugele expressed.\nShe witnesses this on a weekly basis, reading Jingles' adventures to her pre-k, kindergarten, and first graders, seeing their reactions.\n\"They absolutely love it. They ask a lot of questions. It's such a thrill when I show them actual pictures of Jingles, and see how their imaginations expand.\"\nFrom her enjoyment of reading aloud to her students, she pitched her story to eight publishers, and heard back from three of them — no small feat for a new author.\nOlympia Publishers appreciated that Mugele drew from her own experiences. They took care of the artwork and distribution, leaving Mugele to dream up future stories for Jingles.\nIn the meantime, \"Jingles Goes to School,\" will be coming out in hardback Jan. 30, and in the near future the author plans to do local book tours. She will also be doing one for a friend at Farley's Bookshop in Pennsylvania.\nHer passion however is to visit schools, reading to the kids.\n\"It is one of my most important meetings throughout the week,\" Mugele said.\nShe hones her writing skills on her blog site nancymugele.com, while envisioning new adventures to pen.\nAnd as she looks for more inspiration from her life, nobody is safe, especially her lovable black lab, \"River.\"\n\"He won't mind one bit if I make him the star,\" Mugele said with a smile. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Since 2022, the games are played on the second Sunday in February. The Super Bowl is the final game of every NFL Season since 1966. The Super Bowl was supposedly named after a children's toy.\nThere are many gatherings and parties held on Super Bowl Sunday, and everyone has a favorite food they serve — from finger foods to snacks, pizzas, chili, soups, sandwiches and subs to wings.\nNo matter whether you prepare them at home, pick up a carry out or order home delivery, enjoy the gathering. May the best team win.\nThe Kansas City Chiefs\nKANSAS CITY BRISKET BURNT ENDS\nBEEF: 3-4 lb Chuck Roast, 2 tbsp favorite barbecue seasoning, 1 tbsp canola oil.\nSAUCE: ¾ cup ketchup, ½ cup apple cider vinegar, 1.5 tbsp hot sauce, 1 tbsp brown sugar, ½ tbsp garlic paste, ½ tbsp Worcestershire sauce, salt to taste.\nCube your chuck roast into 1-inch cubes and place in a bowl. Lather with canola oil and then season with barbecue seasoning. Place the cubes onto a baking tray with about half an inch separation between each cube. Place in the fridge for 1 hour to set, then let come to room temperature 15 minutes before cooking. Preheat a grill or smoker using a two zone fire with Charcoal to 275 degrees. Two-zone fire: Coals spread along either side of the grill, with an empty space down the center, ideal for smoking and low-temperature cooking. Add some hickory chunks or chips for added smoke flavor. Place the beef onto the smoker to cook for about 1.5 hours until they begin to soften. As the beef smokes, heat up a medium high fire for the barbecue sauce. Add a skillet with the ingredients for the barbecue sauce and let simmer until thickened. Once warm and well incorporated, pull the barbecue sauce off the heat to cool. After 1.5 hours on the smoker, pull the beef off and place into a medium size foil bin. Top the burnt ends with the barbecue sauce and mix around. Cover the bin with aluminum foil and place back on the smoker to cook for another 2.5 hours. Add more barbecue sauce if needed so that there is a decent amount of liquid in order to break down the burnt ends. Once the burnt ends are tender and can easily break apart, pull them off and let cool for 10 minutes. Toss the cooled burnt ends in some of the foil bins sauce, season with a little more barbecue seasoning. To make the most authentic burnt ends at home, you will need a smoker but you can make them on a gas or charcoal grill.\nThe Philadelphia Eagles\nPHILLY CHEESECAKE\n1 1/2 cups Honey Maid graham cracker crumbs, ⅓ cup butter or margarine (melted), 4 (8-oz) packages Philadelphia cream cheese (softened), 1 cup and 3 tbsps sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 4 eggs.\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees. Mix crumbs, butter and 3 tbsps sugar until combined; press firmly onto the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Beat cream cheese, 1 cup sugar, and vanilla in a mixing bowl until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed until just blended. Pour over the crust. Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, about 55 minutes. Loosen cake from the pan rim; cool before removing rim. Refrigerate for 4 hours before serving.\nNew Orleans\nFor the next two recipes, we are going to have a game of our own, Gumbo vs. Jambalaya.\nJambalaya is primarily a rice dish, while gumbo is more of a stew. Both are made with chicken, sausage and/or seafood.\nGUMBO\nROUX: 1 cup all-purpose flour, 2/3 cup oil (vegetable or canola oil).\nGUMBO: 1 bunch celery (diced, leaves and all), 1 green bell pepper (diced), 1 large yellow onion (diced), 1 bunch green onions (finely chopped), 1 bunch fresh chopped parsley, 2-3 cloves garlic, 1-2 tbsps Cajun seasoning, 6-8 cups chicken broth, 12 ounce package andouille sausages (sliced into coins), meat from 1 rotisserie chicken, 2 cups shrimp (pre-cooked), hot cooked rice for serving.\nIn a large, heavy bottom stock pot combine flour and oil. Cook on medium-low heat, stirring constantly for 30-45 minutes. This part takes patience — when it's finished it should be as dark as chocolate and have a soft, \"cookie dough\" consistency. Be careful not to let it burn. Feel free to add a little more flour or oil as needed to reach this consistency.In a separate skillet on medium-high heat, place the sausage slices in one layer in the pan. Brown them well on one side (2-3 minutes) and then use a fork to flip each over onto the other side to brown. Remove to a plate. Add ½ cup of the chicken broth to the hot skillet that had the sausage to deglaze the pan. Pour the broth and drippings into your large soup pot. Add remaining 5 ½ cups of chicken broth. Add veggies, parsley, garlic and roux to the pot and stir well. Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil for 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are slightly tender. Stir in Cajun seasoning to taste. Add chicken, sausage and shrimp. Taste and serve. At this point taste it and add more seasonings to your liking —salt, pepper, chicken bouillon paste, garlic, more Joe's stuff or more chicken broth — until you reach the perfect flavor. Serve warm over rice. (Tastes even better the next day).\nJAMBALAYA\n1 tbsp oil (vegetable or canola oil), 1 lb andouille sausage (cut into ¼ inch thick slices), 1 1/2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts (cut into bite-size pieces), 2 tbsps all-purpose flour, 2 tbsps butter, 1 yellow or white onion (chopped), 4 green onions (chopped), 4 cloves garlic (finely minced), 3 ribs celery (chopped), 1 green bell pepper (chopped), 1 1/2 tsps dried basil, 1 1/2 tsps Cajun seasoning, 1 tsp kosher salt, ½ tsp fresh ground black pepper, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional add more for spice), 14.5-oz can diced tomatoes, 2 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth, 1 1/4 cup long-grain white rice.\nIn a large skillet with a fitted lid, add the oil over medium high heat. Once hot, add the chicken and cook, flipping once or twice to brown on all sides (don't cook chicken through). Remove to a bowl. Add sausage and cook until browned on both sides. Add to the bowl with the chicken. Reduce heat to medium and add butter and flour to the pan and stir well, scraping up any leftover browned bits from the pan. Add onion, garlic, celery, and bell peppers and sauté for 3 minutes. Add basil, cajun seasoning, diced tomatoes, salt and pepper and stir well to combine.

    "content": "'Make Muskrat Great Again': Maggie’s Coleman Tavern in Rock Hall hosts annual cook-off\n\n February 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 539\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Earlier this month, Maggie's Coleman Tavern on Sharp Street in Rock Hall was once again celebrated the mighty muskrat, that is — by way of savory muskrat meat served in all kinds of unique ways. Maggie's threw their annual Muskrat Cook-Off, in its 10th year, where savory recipes featuring the web-footed critter were sampled and voted on.Around the table, muskrat meat was served alongside oysters by a man affectionately nicknamed as Capt. Jack Sparrow, next to him, Phat Daddy's served up barbecue for anyone not digging muskrat.\nIn the competition, muskrat meat, supplied by trapper Robert Smith, was sampled in quesadillas, mixed into stew, added to jalapeño and cheese, fried up on the grill with onions, or placed inside an egg roll.\n\"The meat's a little bit of an acquired taste, like beef, only if cows ate from the swamp,\" said one jovial man, sampling each station.\nOwner of Maggie's Carolyn Jones presented first place to the all-female team declaring \"Make muskrat great again!\" with their swamp rat slider. Jones provided the red-capped team with a trophy created by Greg Jetton from Dirty Cat Garage.\nVisiting friends with a bubbly, energetic spirit, Heather VanDerbeek, from Westchester, Pennsylvania, commended the women's set-up. \"This is awesome! I tried all the samples, and this is the best. The food, the presentation and the energy is all there,\" she said.\nAlso receiving awards from Dirty Cat and coming in second were George Parker and Alex Cooper, with their muskrat cheesesteak egg rolls. In third, with their Hawaiian slider, was the team of Ben Hicks, Darrold Smith and Chuck Woodfield.\nAlthough the weather was windy, with a chill in the air, camaraderie among competitors and tasters alike was warmly felt.\nFriends, family, neighbors and quite a few tourists, sampled muskrat, listened to live music courtesy of The Everafter, and thrilled to watch their neighbors and friends receive awards.\n\"We work hard to play hard,\" Rock Hall Mayor James Cook said, counting around 150 to 200 people in attendance.\nJones was pleased with the turnout, noting this year they had a few less contestants than last, but enthusiasm for the event remained.\nThe festival, Jones said, came out of a bored day with the idea this would be a fun, creative way to escape the cabin fever of winter months.\nBut why muskrat? Why not oysters, crabs, or even white tailed deer?\nBecause muskrat, spotted along Maryland's lakes, ponds, swamps, marshes rivers and streams, was once a thriving industry on the Eastern Shore. During the Great Depression era, muskrat pelts were the mainstay of the winter economy after blue crab season ended, as stated in an article in Smithsonian Magazine titled \"Muskrat Love.\"\nSmith, known as \"Trapper Bob\" follows that time-honored tradition. In winter, when he cannot work his concrete business, he enjoys the extremely challenging work of trapping muskrat, coyote, fox, otter, possum, and other animals.\nAlthough his muskrat meat has been sampled in the past cook-offs, this was his first year attending in person and he brought with him those pelts, drawing in many admirers. In only about two hours, he sold half of them, he said.\nAnd will there be an 11th muskrat cook-off?\n\"As long as we can trap 'em,\" a resident holding a beer in one hand and a muskrat quesadilla in the other remarked. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She and her husband stay active in the community by supporting the local St. Leonard Volunteer Fire Department, of which her husband Richard is the company's training officer.\nWhen she's not writing, she's reading, designing her book covers, and occasionally editing fundraising letters or offering advice and encouragement to other independent authors. She is currently working on the third book in the series, which as of now is untitled.\nThe books are available at www.amazon.com/author/judyhannigan.\nHow long have you been writing, and how did you get started?\nAlways a voracious reader, I drafted the first chapter of \"Lost in Prosperity\" while in high school, but I didn't finish the story until recently. I penned the second novel, \"Everything in Prosperity,\" last year.\nWhat inspires you to write?\nI write historical westerns because in that era you could reinvent yourself. My characters do what's right instead of what's told, exemplifying justice can triumph. I believe honor, courage, and loyalty are the principles by which to live.\nDo you consider writing to be a career?\nWriting is my third career. I started as a high school and college teacher before becoming a technical editor. Now I write full-time, and every day is an adventure.\nWhat kind of writing process do you use?\nI center my stories around a major event before I begin layering in backstories and challenges. I see scenes as if watching through a camera lens, so when the unexpected happens or characters pop up I investigate the possibilities, which means I rarely stick to an outline.\nWho are some of your favorite authors?\n\"Lonesome Dove\" author, Larry McMurtry wrote one of the most beloved westerns. I want readers of his novels and fans of television shows like \"Yellowstone,\" \"The Virginian,\" and \"The Rifleman\" to experience an era in which perseverance, loyalty, forgiveness, and the enduring power of love could redeem a wounded soul. Rosanne Bittner's \"Savage Destiny\" and \"Outlaw Hearts\" series feature flawed but courageous characters that fulfill their potential when forced into the gray zone wedged between black and white.\nPlease include a brief description of the book\nSet in the 1870s, \"Lost in Prosperity\" opens the series by blending adventure, romance, and suspenseful mystery to tell the story of Sam Hilliard Stone, a rich and beautiful heiress with a temper as fast as her quick draw, and Providence \"Jackson\" Knight, the handsome, rugged rancher determined to protect the woman he loves, as they struggle to build a dynasty in the wild, Wyoming Territory.

The Vietri family's homemade pottery lines the wooden tables, each one unique in its own right.\n\"I'm looking at it like a painting...I'll open when I'm ready to walk away,\" Vietri said, adding that she plans to open in mid to late May, with potential pop ups beforehand.\nVietri initially planned to open her restaurant and market this past December, but is not rushing the process because she wants to make sure her first restaurant is everything she dreamed it to be and more.\n\"I could not imagine opening back then. Because the real, true vision, it has changed,\" Vietri said. She is now hiring an upholsterer for finely designed seating, hanging chandeliers and always adding more detail to bring her vision fully to life. \"Rome wasn't built in a day, isn't that what they say?\"\nSince the fall, Vietri has also been busy as a celebrity chef both on air and filming at Bohemia Manor Winery, all while being a mom to her nearly two-year-old son.\nVietri just finished filming as a celebrity chef on Living Abundantly with Sarah Vie, a talk show by best-selling author and expert lifestyle coach, Sarah van der Steur.\nThey even filmed one segment with Golden Bachelor contestant, Susan Knowles.\n\"She cooked with me and we had a blast,\" Vietri said.\nBut it doesn't stop there, Vietri is working with producers to get her own cooking show in the future, something to look forward to.\nBut for now, her focus is the restaurant and market.\nAs both the chef and owner, Vietri aims to offer guests a one-on-one experience with her constantly changing menu, including her chef's tasting menu offered in the Tuscany Room, which seats 11 people.\nHer menus will adapt with each region of Italy, offering endless varieties of flavors and dishes for everyone to enjoy. She will also have a beautiful gelato machine from Europe to spin up the best of the best Italian desserts. Everything in the restaurant and market will be locally sourced and made fresh daily.\nIn the back of her restaurant she will offer an authentic Italian market as well as an open space for bridal showers, weddings, and other events. In addition to various tasty treats, \"boat boxes\" — coolers with sandwiches, drinks, and snacks — will be available at the market just in time for summer boating season. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gretchen's table: Miso-mustard salmon and asparagus is elegant and easy\n\n March 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Gretchen McKay Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | Section: Entertainment \n \n 593\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Salmon is famously heart-healthy, which makes it a popular choice for a seafood meal. The average American consumes more than three pounds a year of the fatty fish, according to the National Fisheries Institute.Who can blame us? Not only is salmon a source of complete protein, but it's also chock full of omega-3 fatty acids — \"healthy\" fats that have been shown to do the body good by reducing inflammation and lowering blood pressure.\nThe firm-fleshed fish is also pretty easy to find in most grocery stores (both fresh and flash-frozen), and can be cooked in so many different and exciting ways — you can pan-fry, roast, grill or poach the rosy-hued fillets, and also turn them into fish cakes — that it never gets boring for the adventurous cook.\nIn this recipe, we build a meal around chopped dates, the classic, ancient superfood featured in \"Hot Date! Sweet & Savory Recipes Celebrating the Date\" by Rawaan Alkhatib ( Chronicle Books, $35).\nDates — a tropical stone fruit from date palms — are known for their versatility and flavor and are naturally sweet and high in fiber and antioxidants. Here, they provide the base for a tangy-sweet marinade that offers a lovely depth of flavor.\nGarlic and Dijon mustard play supporting roles, along with white miso, a paste made from soybeans that have been fermented with a large portion of rice that adds a savory umami.\nBetween marinating and cooking time, the dish takes only about a half-hour from start to finish, and the accompanying asparagus is roasted alongside the fish on a parchment-covered baking sheet. That means dinner is both quick and relatively mess-free.\nIf you don't care for asparagus, simply substitute another vegetable, such as eggplant or zucchini. You also can swap out the fish — another sweet swimmer like trout works well with the marinade, and so would cod fillets. I didn't have any malt vinegar, so substituted apple cider vinegar.\nWhen choosing salmon, look for fillets that appear moist, with shiny skin. If you can, opt for wild-caught salmon, especially from Alaska. Atlantic salmon is typically available year-round, and has a melt-in-your-mouth texture and a mild flavor.\nMiso-Mustard Salmon and Asparagus\n4 skin-on salmon fillets, about 6 ounces eachKosher saltFreshly ground black pepper3 pitted dates, roughly chopped and soaked in 2 tablespoons warm water1 fat garlic clove, minced2 tablespoons olive oil2 tablespoons Dijon mustard1 tablespoon white miso1 tablespoon malt vinegar1 pound fresh asparagus, woody ends trimmed\nGenerously sprinkle salmon fillets all over with salt and pepper.\nIn small bowl, combine mushy dates and their soaking water with garlic, olive oil, mustard, miso and vinegar, stirring until blended.\nPour about half of this marinade on top of the salmon fillets and gently smoosh the fish around until evenly coated.\nLet fish marinate in the fridge for 15-30 minutes.\nToss the asparagus spears in the remaining marinade and set aside until ready to cook.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.\nPlace salmon fillets, skin-side down, on the prepared baking sheet and surround with the asparagus spread out in a single layer.\nBake until the salmon is just opaque and gently flakes when pressed with a fork, about 15-20 minutes. If the fish or asparagus is looking a little pale and lackluster at this point, turn the broiler on high (stay close, the marinade burns easily) until everything becomes a little more golden.\nServe with grains or greens or both to round out the meal.\nServes 4.\n— \"Hot Date! Sweet & Savory Recipes Celebrating the Date, from Party Food to Everyday Feasts\" by Rawaan Alkhatib\nGretchen McKay is food editor with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She confirmed that she would, then added that the pub is not for the public, but students are allowed two guests.\n\"They assured me they would be checking IDs and doing wristbands or stamps they can use a scanner with to make sure everyone is of the proper age,\" Pearsall said, after discussing it in a meeting with college officials.\nCommissioner John Price said Washington College currently has a license for special events and catering and can open up different areas on the campus. With that, they made a motion to approve the addition of a pub area to the existing liquor license subject to specified restrictions for students under 21.\nIt was unanimously approved.\nFithian said now the liquor license has been approved, they will keep a close eye on the establishment. But as long as the campus abides by the law, he said, it is the school's choice.\nWhen reaching out for additional information about The Golden Goose such as how long has this project been discussed and what governing bodies decided on it, a Washington College spokesperson said, \"The campus pub is NOT open to the public and is considered a student/campus life function. Chestertown residents and the members of the public will not be permitted to enter.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Virtual horse races took place at Betterton Volunteer Fire house Saturday, March 8, sponsored by Still Pond/Betterton Lion's Club.According to Betterton/Still Pond Lions member Debi Cornelius, almost 200 Kent County residents and neighbors showed up, betting on the horse races at their 47th Virtual Race Night.\nAll proceeds went to the program, Leader Dogs for the Blind. Founded in 1949, this program has stood by their motto, \"We serve,\" complements the Leader Dog mission of empowering people who are blind or visually impaired with lifelong skills for safe and independent daily travel. Millington Lions member Shelley Holland spoke in detail about the program and how people can contribute.\nFor those who have not had the joy and privilege of getting out to one of these races, put on twice a year, on a large screen, participants watches a DVD from the \"Night at the Races,\" a gaming company that records real horse races. Most races are close, with photo finishes, and the joy of the winners watching is contagious. There are 12 races, sponsored by local companies or individuals.\nDuring the action, patrons placed their bets, chatting with neighbors while they waited in line.

This time, little Wyatt struggles to fall asleep, and his mother, armed with her enchanted handbag, pulls out a surprise. With a dazzling burst of rainbow energy, the duo is transported beyond Earth's atmosphere, clad in space suits and ready to explore the cosmos.\nGlenn, who is expanding \"Mommy's Adventures\" into a series, describes the 31-page book for ages 3-8 as both fun and educational. Along the way, Mommy introduces Wyatt to the mysteries of the solar system, from the red sands of Mars to the brilliance of distant stars. They even wave to a friendly alien, igniting Wyatt's curiosity about space and science.\nAs NASA and SpaceX talk about space exploration —launching missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond — \"Mommy's Adventures to Space\" invites young readers to imagine themselves as future astronauts. The story fosters an early appreciation for science, astronomy and adventure.\nThe book's main characters are drawn from Glenn's own life. Mommy is based on the author, and fictional Wyatt is inspired by her 7-year-old son.\n\"He loves the books, though he's a little embarrassed he's in them,\" Glenn said with a smile. \"And he'll tell you that too.\"\nThe book, which took about four months to write, was published Jan. 1 and features vibrant, playful illustrations by Ayesha Zaki, the artist behind \"Mommy's Adventures\". Glenn credits Zaki's artwork with bringing her stories to life while maintaining a consistent visual theme across the series.\nAs a cafeteria worker at Rock Hall Elementary School, Glenn has a growing fan base among young readers. She hopes to introduce her books to more students across Kent County Public Schools, though she has faced some challenges in gaining traction.\nWith spring approaching, Glenn is actively seeking opportunities to promote \"Mommy's Adventures to Space\" while planning Mommy and Wyatt's next adventure. Their first journey took them to a land of roller coasters, and now they've explored the stars. Next, they'll embark on a prehistoric romp with dinosaurs.\nBoth \"Mommy's Adventures\" books are available on Amazon by searching Glenn's name — appearing as magically as when Mommy opens her handbag.\nFor school reading events, contact Glenn at eglenn_23@yahoo.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland man's 1963 Chevy II 400 convertible wins national competition\n\n March 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 916\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Fran Bailey pays meticulous attention to detail when working on his antique cars, making sure that every part that he installs is historically accurate, that it is the correct shape and that it is exactly the right color.Bailey, 82, also puts in hard work to present a pristine-looking automobile when competing in car shows across the United States, something the Fair Hill, Maryland man has successfully done for several years.\nSo it's not surprising that Bailey's 1963 Chevrolet Chevy II 400 convertible recently received the top honor — the Louis Chevrolet Memorial Award — in a nationwide competition that started with a field of 2,400 automobiles that were exhibited in numerous car shows across the United States.\nThen, a group of highly discerning superior judges narrowed that field to 59 hopefuls, before selecting the automobiles they believed deserved national awards in various classifications. In addition to the trophy, photos of Bailey and his Chevy II 400 appear in the Antique Automobile Club of America (AACA) magazine, along with a blurb about his special antique vehicle.\nBailey bought the Chevy II 400 about two years ago, after learning about it while attending the AACA Grand Nationals in Bettendorf, Iowa in 2022 and then arranging to take a look at it.\nHe acknowledged that a great deal of work already had been done on the car but, after he got the Chevy II 400 back to his private shop on the residential property he shares with longtime friend, Nancy Simpers, 81, the perfectionist immersed himself in the tasks of making the antique automobile historically accurate and making it gleam.\nAccording to the magazine blurb, \"Francis used a lot of elbow grease, along with replacing many parts and pieces that weren't correct. Amenities on the car include power steering, full wheel covers, white sidewall tires and rear radio antenna. Under the hood is the 194 cid/120 hp six-cylinder engine mated to an automatic transmission.\"\nAACA judges are sticklers for historical accuracy, stressed Simpers, who regularly travels with Bailey when he is pulling his trailered automobiles to car shows in Iowa, South Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, New York, West Virginia, North Carolina and few other states.\n\"These are not local car shows. Don't get me wrong, the local car shows are fun, but they are just that — shows, not competitions,\" Simpers said, before further explaining, \"These are competitions, and the judges pay a lot of attention to detail. Period correctness is the big thing. Everything on the car has to be accurate.\"\nTo make her point, Simpers recalled a Kentucky car show a few years ago and how Bailey's other antique automobile — a 1967 Chevy II sports coupe — earned 1st Place. After winning the competition, Bailey offered the guy who garnered 2nd Place some advice.\n\"Fran told him, 'You have a round antennae and it is supposed to be oval',\" Simpers remembered, emphasizing, \"The car has to look good, but it also has to be period correct.\"\nBailey, who has been retired for 34 years after his career as an E.I. DuPont lab technician, has loved cars since childhood.\n\"I grew up in New Castle (Del.), and I've been interested in cars ever since I was a kid. I hung around gas stations, and I went to drag races at the Cecil County Dragway (north of North East),\" Bailey outlined.\nHe bought his first car, a 1953 Dodge, in 1959 when he turned 16. \"It was my granddad's, and I bought it from him after I got my driver's license. I had a job and I made payments,\" Bailey said.\nThen in 1961, after he turned 18, Bailey started racing regularly at the Cecil County Dragway for the next 17 years and, competing with various vehicles he acquired along the way, he won quite often. Bailey recalls competing with a 1962 Chevrolet Impala that he also used as his everyday car.\n\"My best car was a '69 Chevelle,\" Bailey said, referring to his favorite drag-strip vehicle, which is a National Hot Rod Association record holder.\nOver the decades, Bailey also dabbled in purchasing and restoring classic vehicles, showcasing them in car shows, often winning trophies, plaques and other prizes.\nBailey bought his 1967 Chevy II sports coupe in 1996, approximately 16 years before he purchased his 1963 Chevrolet Chevy II 400 convertible. Reflecting the detail-oriented restoration work that Bailey invested in those antique automobiles, the '67 Chevy II is insured for $52,000 and the 63 Chevy II 400 convertible is valued at about $30,000.\nSimpers, a former teacher who still works as a real estate agent, shares Bailey's interest in antique automobiles. When she was a girl and then a young lady, she competed in thoroughbred racing, Simpers noted.\n\"I gave up horses for horsepower,\" she commented, chuckling.\nSimpers is the proud owner of a sharp-looking, black 1937 LaSalle, the earliest form of the Cadillac, and it, too, has won local car-show competitions. Her grandfather purchased that LaSalle when it was new, some 88 years ago, and then Simpers bought it at his estate sale in 1967.\nAs for another one of her classic vehicles, a restored 1938 Chevrolet Street Rod, she gifted that one.\n\"I gave it to my godson for his 16th birthday. He always loved that car. I told him, 'When you are old enough to drive it, it's yours',\" Simpers said.\nIt's perfect that Simpers and Bailey are antique car enthusiasts and, despite being in their early 80s, the couple is always rolling to pursue their hobby. This year, as in years past, they will travel to car shows in more than a dozen states. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There were mostly cover songs but also quite a few originals.\nFor instance, local singer-songwriter Nicholas Ray from Chestertown, who has toured several states, performed his original song, \"Ain't Today,\" and dedicated it to his friend battling cancer.\nLewisson and Clarke performed as a brother-sister duo, presenting their original song, \"Jungle Sounds,\" using looping equipment and adding comedy and crowd work.\nGrace Walton, performing under the stage name Jenna L, made one judge virtually clutch her pearls as she delivered her original scary-tale songs. All music and lyrics were written by her and can be found on iTunes and Spotify under Jenna L.\nJudges Melissa McGlynn, Terwana Brown and Chris Nieman had a tough job weighing in because there were no bad performances from the group.\nBut somebody had to win, and judges could pick their winners while audiences chose theirs throughout the night.\nJudges' choice for youth was Mourlas, who stunned the audience with her powerful Broadway vocals in Barbra Streisand's \"Don't Rain on My Parade.\"\n\"No one is ever going to rain on your parade. You connected with the audience and you are a rockstar,\" Judge Brown told her.\nJudges' choice for adult was Voss, who captured the emotion behind \"She Used to Be Mine,\" originally performed by Sara Bareilles in the musical \"Waitress.\" Judge McGlynn said from experience that Voss's song choice was very challenging and that she performed it beautifully.\nPeople's choice winner for youth was Bagshaw, who opened the night with a classic Janis Joplin song, \"Me and Bobby McGee,\" setting the bar high for later performers. Judge Nieman was impressed, saying she built the performance as she went until her voice exploded with confidence.\nPeople's choice for adults was Yerkes, who, despite having technical issues with his guitar at first, won the crowd over with his skilled performance of \"In a Dream,\" dedicated to his wife, Lisa.\nThe prize winners received a trophy, $100 in Chestertown cash and, of course, important bragging rights.\nNot only was it a chance for the audience to hear some remarkable local performers, but it also offered gourmet food prepared by an award-winning chef from the Food Network, Robbie Jester, owner of In Jest Events and Galena native. Local oysters, beef and bread were on the menu, followed by dessert—including ice cream courtesy of Jacqueline Lockwood of Lockbriar Farms.\nAt the end of the night, the United Way of Kent County raised more than $35,000, according to executive director Amy Meade.\n\"The money will go to nonprofits in Kent County that focus on education, health and financial stability,\" she said, thanking all volunteers, sponsors and participants.\n\"I think there was magic in the air at the Garfield on Saturday night. Not only was the crowd excited to see and hear the variety and excellence of Kent County talent, but the judges and emcee did an amazing job of highlighting the contestants' special talents—and we can't forget the incredible food sourced locally and prepared to perfection by our own celebrity chef,\" Meade added.\n\"I have to say I am humbled that all this was to raise money for the United Way of Kent County and our mission to serve those households in need. Thank you to everyone who made Kent's Got Talent so special!\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The event is free and open to the public.The Big Little Boat Festival, which has run every year in various forms since 1999, celebrates small wooden boats. The event also features amateurs and professionals who have built boats from Chesapeake Light Craft's celebrated boat kits and plans.\nThere are hands-on boatbuilding seminars, on-the-water demonstrations, the chance to try out dozens of boats from the Chesapeake Light Craft fleet on the water, cardboard boatbuilding and racing for youngsters, and the popular \"Best in Show\" judging of home-built wooden boats brought by festival-goers.\nThe roster of boatbuilding and watercraft experts scheduled to lead seminars and demonstrations includes Chesapeake's owner and CEO John C. Harris, boatbuilder/instructors Andrew Schroeher and Jay Hockenberry, and paddling and rowing coach Nicky Stimpson.\nExamples from Chesapeake's fleet of watercraft will be on display including kayaks, rowing and sailing craft, paddleboards, and small powerboats. Festival attendees will bring their own creations to launch and display. Chesapeake Light Craft's awards for amateur-built boats, some of which took hundreds of hours to build and look like exotic furniture, have been a key part of the annual small boat festivals for years. Participants have come from the UK, Florida, the West Coast, and Japan.\nConquest Beach is situated on the 758-acre Conquest Preserve between the Corsica and Chester Rivers.\nFestival hours are 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Saturday, May 17. Lunch is available from a food truck on site. Overnight camping for festival participants (tents and small campers only) is available by prior arrangement both Friday and Saturday nights, May 16 and 17. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Nicholas Ray aint country? Could have fooled us!\n\n May 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 872\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BETTERTON — On a 12-day music tour, local musician/songwriter Nicholas Ray's plans to reach California were thrown off by a snowstorm. Alone, two hours from the Grand Canyon, the snow fell so heavy it froze his headlights. Driving in the dark, fighting to keep visibility, unbeknownst to him, the nearest civilization was two hours away.Ray explained it was a Sioux Indian reservation, where they told him it had not snowed there yet until that very day. \"Lucky me,\" Ray said, laughing, as he talked to the Kent County News inside his garage/band practice room.\nHe had slept in his car in the parking lot of their gas station and was awoken to coyotes rooting in the trashcans and a mountain of snow on his car. He swept it off with a broom, gave those who let him stay, a copy of his album and moved on, heading southward following the Gulf Coast to warmer weather.\nRay returned home to the farm in Still Pond, to his wife and family with even greater resolve to follow his dreams.\nOn his visit to major cities from Ohio, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, South and North Carolina, he collected 220 new subscribers to his Spotify and Apple Music accounts, while greeting friends on his journey.\nBusking, (playing in the streets for money) was a great experience for him he said, and although he was nervous to start performing original songs in a strange city, everybody was supportive of his dreams of earning a living performing on stage.\nThese dreams began when he was a soldier in the Maryland National Guard deployed to Kosovo as a mechanic on Black Hawk helicopters. Hard work but during down time, he played the guitar until his hands bled, writing and singing songs.\nNow he is ready for the next adventure. In October, Ray and his wife, Brandy Dorey, his biggest cheerleader and hype person, are Nashville-bound — moving on from the county to pursue his music goals.\n\"If you don't take chances, you never know,\" Ray said.\nKent County will certainly miss him, but live music lovers have an entire summer to hear him and band members, drummer Steve Toth, Rob McFarlane on bass, and Ray on guitar singing his original southern country style songs.\nThe 26-year-old Ray has been everywhere. He is a regular performer at Open Mic night at the Betterton Legion, the Back 50 Tavern, The Double Tap Tavern, Ram's Head Tavern, the Chancery in Wilmington Delaware, and the Kent County Fair to name a few.\nHe will be performing at Riley's Mill Ale Works May 17, and the next day at The Shanty Beach Bar, singing songs about battling depression, transcending love, venting frustrations, talking to God and drinking whiskey with friends.\nInspired by outlaw country greats, Waylon Jennings, Merle Haggard and the like and modern country star Luke Coombs, Ray described his music.\n\"It's nothing superficial. It's just the three chords of truth.\"\nHis album \"Built for Leaving,\" certainly showcases his ability to capture his vision. He writes for those who appreciate lyrics but also provides a catchy tune for audiences to have fun with.\nThe crowd favorite, \"Marlboro Man,\" is about a guy who relies on cigarettes and booze to mask his sadness. What is a somber theme becomes an excellent crowd sing-a-long with the chorus: \"Light em up boys! Smoke em if you got em! I won't stop till I reach the bottom.\"\n\"Built for Leaving,\" laments a woman who left him. The singer is calling her back to remember who she once was. \"Hold On\" is a tune encouraging the subject to maintain hope through the storms of life, when there seems to be no answer. \"Way Too Young\" increases the tempo and calls for an escape from a mundane life.\nThe transforming power of love is a residing theme in Ray's album as well.\nHe likens his wife's love to a \"Knotted Oak\" a poetic song that describes her love as tough, resilient, able to bear the wind and waves. Ray expresses his gratitude for that love when he sings, \"he is grateful,\" for her, and she is \"an angel.\"\n\"Antiquity\" is also a song dedicated to his love. Accompanied by clear and powerful chords, Ray sings about how she completes him, giving her a supernatural quality. \"You are my antiquity, the past and the present — the air I breathe.\"\nThe album ends in an ironic, comic country song in the style of Hank Williams Jr. or David Allen Coe, in \"I Ain't Country.\" With a growl to his voice, Ray sings, country isn't a location; it is a lifestyle. Ray, who when he is not performing, is hunting turkey, sport shooting, fishing, playing pool, drinking whiskey and riding horses, gives a brash answer to detractors who may think country music only resides in the typical southern states.\nAnybody visiting Kent County for a few seconds can see it's as country as they are and Ray notes that.\nIn addition to his album, Ray released two singles and June 5 is releasing \"That Ain't Today,\" a song he performed in Kent Got's Talent. That night, he dedicated it to a close friend suffering with cancer.\nRay has got big dreams, and is leaving Maryland to pursue them, but \"that ain't today\" so see him while you got a chance. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The schedule will be more crowded, there will be more activity on the water with less space between the heats so with the extra boats, we have to jam the heats all together and not have anything between them so it will be almost non-stop activity. This is going to be a banner year.\"\nBerry also announced that 11 inboards — all of which are from out of state — will run exhibitions \"to expand our spectator base.\"\n\"We don't want to be stagnant. We want to grow and since there's only so many outboards out there available,\" Berry said of the boats, which must be lifted in and out of the water with cranes, \"we decided to add a different class of boats.\nBerry said the inboards are modified with motors such as those used in NASCAR or on drag strips.\n\"It's definitely going to be more exciting,\" Berry said, \"because there will be more water spray in the air.\"\nThe 67-year-old Lawrence said the inboard exhibitions will be \"loud and proud.\"\nLawrence grew up in Colton's Point and took in events almost weekly with his father at places like Capt. Sam's and the Leonardtown Wharf.\n\"I grew up in the heyday of the 60s and 70s when boat racing was all around Southern Maryland and dad was an avid boat race fan, so we attended pretty much every race that was within driving distance. We were hooked,\" Lawrence, who now lives in Virginia, said.\nBut as he got older, boat racing started to fade away until the club was resurrected in 2015. His brothers jumped into exhibitions right away and Lawrence volunteered as a patrol boat driver, but his brothers kept telling him he needed a boat.\nHe finally relented and purchased a derelict 1959 Glasspar G3 and rebuilt it with a 70 horsepower Evinrude and has raced the past 4 years.\n\"I was more excited than anything else, not nervous at all,\" the 6-foot, 235-pounder said of his first exhibition. \"I'm a big guy, so a big guy in a little boat I'm not as fast as everyone else. I just enjoy it. I'm just out there running.\"\nBerry said the club hosts two events a year at separate locations for a reason.\n\"We're trying to carry on history,\" he said, referring to the eight to 10 events per year when competitions were held in the 1960s. \"There are also different viewing areas, different regulations and we can also draw boaters from different areas. We're trying to be more responsive to keeping things fresher instead of the same old, same old.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Scalzo is in hospice care and a tearful playing of \"Shall We Gather\" ended Wednesday night's program reflecting on his many contributions.\nOwner of MusicLife Bill Drazga played the piano and delivered the heartfelt vocals portraying a distant land beyond pain, suffering and death.\n\"Yes, we'll gather at the river,\" he sang. \"The beautiful, the beautiful river. Gather with the saints at the river, that flows by the throne of God.\"\nThe recital reflected Scalzo's passion for music by showcasing musicians of all ages and styles singing and performing numbers in rock, classical and everything in between.\nTo some students such as Auden Unsworth this was their first recital, encouraged by the teachers, performing in a creative and fun environment while proud instructors looked on.\nScalzo too, would have been pleased.\nBetter known as \"Sam, the Italian Music Man\" in Rock Hall, he spent his entire life in music, beginning at a young age and learning from the First Clarinet Player at the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra. When he was not performing, he was fostering young musicians in Kent County High School Jazz Band, tutoring elementary students, practicing weekly with general band students or cheering on the marching band.\nDrazga said in the 25 years of knowing Scalzo, \"I think he is the only person on earth that loves music more than I do.\"\nDrazga came up with the idea of the scholarship to honor the many contributions Scalzo has made to music education in Kent and Queen Anne's counties over the years.\n\"Mr. Scalzo has shown his dedication to cultivating young people's musical education through his countless years of work in Kent County schools and beyond.\"\nThe scholarship was established in 2019 by MusicLife, in partnership with family and friends and awarded annually to a local graduating high school senior.\nPast recipients are Sarah Parker (2019), Jane Godfrey (2020), Claire O'Brien and Isabella Williams (2021), Corrina Boyd (2022), Jade Lee (2023) and Aaron Saunders (2024).\nAnyone wishing to make a donation to future scholarship awards can find more information at musiclifedelmarva.com or by calling at 410-778-7010. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Academy invited several artists, from painters to pastel artists, to set up their canvases and let the music guide them to their creative destination.\nJones said he did something similar with the art museum for his first album, \"Bohemian Beatbox.\" However, that session was not in collaboration with other artists.\n\"For this one, I was like, 'man, we should add a component where there are actual people, where there are actual artists there creating too,'\" Jones said. \"Artists inspire other artists.\"\nJones took inspiration from Richard Estes' exhibit \"Urban Landscapes,\" which is featured in the museum until Aug. 3. A photorealist painter, Estes' work showcases the reflective surfaces of the city. The exhibit's focus on reflections serves as a reminder that artists are reflections of their lived experiences and of each other, according to Jones.\nEllie Christiansen, of St. Michaels, was one of the painters at the recording session. She decided not to arrive with an idea of what she wanted to paint. Rather, she took a walk around the gallery and viewed other pieces of art to get color inspiration. Upon returning to the room, she said she let the music inform her painting decisions.\n\"I think that it's a beautiful, inspiring event that can bring together community members and artists who can be inspired by the music,\" Christiansen said. \"I don't think you get a chance to do that very often.\"\nPainting during a live music recording session was not an opportunity she's had before, she said, but she enjoyed it.\n\"If I could do this every Saturday, I think I would because it's always nice to be around fellow artists, especially listening to amazing, inspirational music,\" Christiansen said.\nThe quiet, dimly lit room created a relaxing environment. Guests could walk around freely and engage with the performers and artists.\n\"Good scenery, good visuals and good sounds,\" said Kentavius's mother, Lois McCoy, describing the ambiance of the event. McCoy said she was excited to experience her son's recording process, something she's only heard about.\nThroughout the session, Kentavius and the band switched between improvising and recording, allowing audience members to experience the raw recording process.\n\"The musicians, they were somewhat familiar with some of the songs, but some of the songs they never heard before,\" Jones said. \"I wanted people to see it unfold live.\"\nJones said the experience felt organic for him, and he was grateful for the opportunity to make his art even more collaborative. He often took breaks from performing to engage with audience members. At one point, he individually greeted and introduced himself to each person in attendance.\n\"To have folks there a part of the recording process, it just further builds that relationship, that connection between me as the creator and folks as the audience,\" Jones said. \"It was magical for me.\"\nSome of the music recorded at this session will be performed at Jones' public outdoor concert at the Academy Art Museum on Aug. 2. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They got to record in a professional studio, a privilege and honor many musicians do not get the chance to have.The 28-year-old singer/songwriter, teacher and owner of Mooday's Music LLC, teacher said it was beneficial for her students to see the hard work behind the making of music while developing pride in their accomplishments.\nMooday explained that Ken Schweitzer, associate chair of the Department of Music at Washington College, had received a grant to record small independent artists at their studio. Schweitzer, knowing about Mooday's music, asked her to record something. Mooday was honored but did not have any new songs at the time.\nHowever, she did have students which the grant also allows for, Schweitzer pointed out.\nAfter learning three favorite and popular songs: Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\", \"OK Not To Be OK\" by Marshmello and Demi Lovato and \"Best Day of My Life\" by American Authors, students of Mooday's week-long class decided to go with the latter to record.\nOn 9 a.m. that Friday, students Mason Poulson, Abbie Donophan, Emma Christophel, Whitley Sparks, Micah Christophel, Hannah Sadler, Quinn Greenwell, Asher Sadler, Adah Sadler and Jezzy Greenwell stepped into the studio prepared.\nWashington College audio engineer students Stevie Lyles and Mariana Kilman got the equipment set up to record the students choice \"Best Day of my Life.\" Mooday, with assistance from guitar teacher Matt Wirtz and drum set instructor Emily Holden, said the tune was fun for the kids to learn. \"It's just catchy with two chords and a simple, fun drum pattern,\" she said.\nThe class recorded in parts. Micah Christophel posted up behind the drum set establishing the beat first. Next, Wirtz guided students on guitars and helped lay out the licks (musical phrases). Mooday assisted her kids on the ukuleles as well as vocals. All the while, she insisted they participate as much as possible which they were eager to do.\n\"All the kids played played a part in the process which was really cool. Every student sang when it came to lay down the vocals track as well.\"\nMooday said it was also important for them to see the hardworking people in the background behind some of their favorite songs. They were eyewitness to the engineers mixing the track, adding some reverb to their vocals and were amazed at the finished product.\nMooday took joy seeing the kids' confidence grow in the studio.\nThe entire recording, mixing and production process was efficient. They were in and out in two hours, Mooday said. The engineer students delivered the finished track to her in time to develop a slideshow to be presented to parents and students later that day for a final performance.\nThat same afternoon at Mooday's Music, the kids performed two songs, the one they had recorded and also \"OK Not To Be OK,\" receiving applause for their hard work and dedication.\nMooday was elated, appreciating the timing of Schweitzer's offer coordinating with her class schedule. \"It worked out so nicely,\" Mooday said. \"They are so young and for them to have this opportunity was amazing.\"\nNow in her sixth year teaching, music changed Mooday's life and at an early age she desired sharing that with others.\nMooday followed that passion, using some bleak times in her life to shape her faith and music. She has a B.S. in music education and B.A. in flute performance and Masters degree in music education with a certificate in modern band at Lebanon Valley College.\nThe intense years of music study allowed her to live out her dream, owning her own music classroom, passing on the lessons music taught her.\n\"I really enjoy the private lessons setting because it gives me a chance to work individually with a student, meeting their needs and helping them grow to not only play their chosen instrument, but also grow a love for music. I have a passion for working with students with higher needs and challenging myself to find what works best for their learning processes.\"\nAnd in the future, she will have more space to do that, adding on an extra 2,000 square feet, enabling her team to conduct two summer camps a year, with more room for private lessons, kid classes, and to teach homeschoolers.\nLearn more about Mooday's Music LLC by visiting her website, moodaysmusicllc.org, and be sure to check out all of her work, which includes albums, singles and EPs that date all the way back to 2017 on Spotify. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You definitely go into these competitions to win, but at least for me you never expect to win, you just hope for it but I prepared my best.\"\nShe will represent Maryland when she competes in the Miss America competition which will be held in September in Orlando, Fla.\nThe Great Mills resident won the crown following a week of competition which included interview, fitness, on-stage question, talent and evening gown.\n\"Each contestant worked extremely hard and put their best foot forward at the Miss Maryland Competition,\" 2023 Miss Maryland and board member Kennedy Taylor said, adding that Derisavi \"captured the judges' hearts in all categories.\"\nFor the talent portion, Derisavi performed a speech about her story of immigration to the United States from Kuwait at the age of 9.\nThe first runner-up was Alaysia Bookal (Miss Potomac), followed by Jaclyn Davis (Miss Northern Maryland), Allie Wolfe (Miss Montgomery County) and Elle Miles (Miss Baltimore).\n\"We are always blown away by the level of talent at the Miss Maryland competition,\" Taylor said.\nSince 2021, Derisavi has championed her community service initiative titled SeizeYourOpportunities, a research-backed resilience development program that has already reached thousands of students across the state of Maryland through school seminars that empower students through goal setting and self-efficacy workshops.\n\"Coming from a low-income background myself, I know how important it is to have some sense of resilience, especially when you go through adverse experiences,\" she said. \"What my programming does is it's research and educator-informed, so I work with social worker professionals and educators to create a workbook that talks about resiliency and teaches skills like goal-setting and perseverance.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Buccaneers and landlubbers of all ages flooded to Rock Hall for their annual Pirates and Wenches festival over the weekend sponsored by Main Street Rock Hall.They took to Main Street, Sharp Street, Ferry Park Beach and Watermen's Crab House meshing fun with history and entertainment.\nVoted Best Tourist Attraction by local media, the festival celebrated its 18th year.\nCo-organizer, Suzanne Einstein originally dreamed up the pirates concept, happy to see it expand.\n\"We came up with the idea while at Waterman's Crab House on Halloween after seeing so many people dressed up as pirates! We thought, how fun would it be to have a Caribbean style party on our public beach, a decorated dinghy flotilla in the harbor, and a Buccaneer's Ball! It was clear to us that our little waterfront town on the Chesapeake was the perfect location to host such an event!\"\nShe was right. Eighteen years later the party is in full effect, drawing people of all ages.\nJim Rich, chairperson for Pirates and Wenches Committee noted the weather was absolutely perfect to bring people out.\nHe said that for two days restaurants, bars, shops, hotels and Airbnb's were filled. Business in the area thrived, including some new businesses that just opened: Rock Hall Brewing Company, The Green Heron and Nauti Blu Cottage to name a few.\nDown the street and avenues, joyous pirates and charming wenches peddled their wares to locals and visitors alike while music played along Sharp Street and kids' laughter and joy filled the air.\nIn typical pirate fashion, much could be experienced from deer-antler weapons, to spicy pirate blend pickles to wooden pints as big as a giant's fist to artwork and beautiful jewelry. Some vendors were local or nearby, but others came as far as Florida like author historian, Robert Jacob.\nWith four buses shuttling people to and fro, it made for a safe, relaxing weekend with no incidents, reported Brian Jones of Rock Hall Volunteer Fire Company.\nThe party kicked off Friday night with rum tasting at Haven Harbour South and sea shanty sing-alongs at American Legion Post 228 at 7 p.m.\nOn Saturday, a Lions Club sponsored kids treasure dig at the Ferry Park public beach at 10 a.m uncovered fun followed by a rolling flotilla low speed vehicle parade at 11 a.m. along with pirate poker run from noon to 2 p.m.\nAfter that, pirates and wenches took to the coast for a beach party with live music from noon to 4 p.m.; and Buccaneers Ball from 7 to 11 p.m. at Waterman's Crab House where winners of the raffle were announced.\nAlso on Saturday, mysterious mermaids waved to audiences from their watery chambers, stilted individuals stalked merrily through the crowd and planners of the pirate events had a ball showing people how to participate in the multitude of activities.\nAs of last year, cannon fire shot off at intervals throughout the weekend from the Skullduggery Crew based out of Baltimore. The group stayed two days in tents, truly roughing it.\nMusic from The Brigands and other bands got people toe-tapping and twirling.\nRich said everyone has fun at Pirates, especially kids, with even more activities for them than last year.\nThe HoCo Pirate Adventure Treasure was a hit with families, participating in a treasure hunt that encompassed the entire festival area.\nAnother activity, kids could hunt down the \"most wanted pirates\" and be rewarded with prizes as well as a chance to win a movie party at Flagship Premium Cinemas.\nFortune's Folly Pirate Show got kids laughing and watching in wonder.\nNear Gunpowder Cove, the dunk machine drew a big crowd said mom and PTA member, Laura Wirth. Her daughter Lina Wirth happily volunteered to be dunked. All proceeds went to Rock Hall Elementary School.\nA new attraction from Master Ship builders Lisa Sasser and George Barnett guided kids to make their own sailboats, testing them on the rough waters of the kiddie pool. Sasser was pleased to see so many children enjoying it.\nHistory buffs were entertained as well.\nThe author, Robert Jacob regaled the crowd, knocking down some past prejudices of Black Beard and conducted a lecture about pirates in the Chesapeake.\nThe street was open for creative swashbucklers and maidens greeting people with warmth and cheer.\nWoody McKay better known as Captain Gray Fox handed out good doubloons.\n\"I love this! Every year I meet such interesting people,\" he said.\nAs he said that, award winning actress, Smithsonian scholar Mary Ann Jung introduced herself as her character, Grace O' Malley the Pirate Queen.\nGood grub was to be had as well from pizza, burgers, barbecue to smoked meat on a stick. And if the sun was too much for people, they even had a mist tent cooling people down.\nRich lauded Pirates a success, estimating the event drew 4,000 people to the town.\nHe thanked everyone on the committee who started planning around February.\n\"From my view we pulled off what can be a complicated event with a lot of moving parts. We showed people Pirates in Rock Hall is a friendly, family-oriented weekend.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Yes, it's almost time to don your favorite tie-dyed T-shirts, denim bellbottoms, mini-skirts, granny sunglasses and peace symbol necklaces. And if you're really feeling that Wavy Gravy vibe, it's almost time to to dab your neck with patchouli and burn some lavender incense.\nIn other words, it's time to let your freak-flag fly at Dove Valley Winery's 13th annual Winestock Festival, a rain-or-shine event set to run from 11 a.m to 7 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 27, on the vineyard grounds at 645 Harrington Road, off Joseph Biggs Highway (Route 274), a short distance south of downtown Rising Sun.\nThe annual event typically draws 800 to 1,000 people. As evidenced by the previous Winestock events, many attendees wear groovy threads and outwardly immerse themselves in the counter-culture celebration associated with Woodstock, the three-day-long rock music festival that was held in Upper State New York in August 1969.\nAnd what's a Woodstock tribute festival without music?\nOn the bill for Winestock 2025 are Max & Denise \"Acoustic with an Edge\" (11 a.m. to 1 p.m.), Old Skool & The Edge (1 p.m. to 3 p.m.), Smokin' Guns (3 p.m. to 5 p.m.) and the finale act, Olivia Reynolds (5 p.m. to 7 p.m.) Those bands will perform on the winery's pavilion stages.\nBeer will be for sale on the premises. Chesapeake-City-based Bayheads Brewing Company and Perryville-based 5th Company Brewing Company will be selling their various craft beers. And, of course, Dove Valley Winery will be selling its array of wines during the festival.\nThe list of food trucks includes Kacey's Kitchen, Rolling Grub, Dine 'N' Dash Delights, Wing Paradise and The Pit Shack BBQ and Pizza. Non-alcoholic drinks also will be available for purchase.\nIn addition, numerous local art and craft vendors will be displaying and selling their merchandise during the eight-hour-long event.\nAdmission for Winestock 2025 is $10 per person in advance and $20 per head at the gate. There is no charge for attendees under 21 years old. The admission fee for the 21 and older crowd also covers wine tasting and a complimentary keepsake wine glass.\nOutside food, beverages and coolers will not be allowed. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A clown named Crickett 'stands out' at Port Deposit festival\n\n September 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1049\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n PORT DEPOSIT — Hundreds of people attended the fourth annual Pirate Takeover in Port Deposit last weekend, but one person stood out in the crowd — quite literally.Head and shoulders above all the rest was \"Crickett,\" a professional clown who ambled throughout the Marina Park grounds on stilts that were hidden by his tuxedo-style pants and boosted his natural six-foot height to somewhere around eight feet.\n\"Crickett,\" whose real name is James McGrath, turned heads — upward, as well as sideways — wherever he roamed Saturday during the seven-hour event.\nMany people stopped in their tracks and tilted their heads skyward to confirm that there was, indeed, a face attached to the top of that human mountain in their midst. Clearly amazed, giggling kids ran up to Crickett to get a closer look. Several of the youngsters went airborne, giving it their best Jordan jump, as they high-fived with this spectacle that bent forward accommodatingly.\n\"Some people actually get startled when they see me,\" McGrath said. \"You get the usual jokes from people, too, like, 'How's the weather up there?' and, 'Hey, Shorty,'\" stuff like that.\nOf course, folks ask him how tall he is on those stilts. And they ask if he has ever fallen.\nThe answer to that last question: Only once in approximately 20 years of practicing and performing on stilts. And after that tumble, Crickett got back on his feet — unscathed — because learning how to fall safely on stilts is as important as learning how to walk on stilts.\nThe trick is to never extend your arms to break your fall because, instead, you will break your wrists, humerus and other nearby bones, he emphasized. Tucking your extremities, balling up your body and rolling when you hit the ground are the ingredients for a safe fall.\nAs it turns out, Crickett takes his clowning very seriously. A 44-year-old Washington, D.C. resident, McGrath performs as Crickett in the region about 100 times a year under his enterprises of Shows by Crickett, Block Party Bubbles and Clown Cabaret.\n\"I performed at the Pirate Takeover event in Port Deposit for the past few years, and it is easily one of my favorite gigs,\" McGrath commented.\nThose 100 or so annual gigs are the sole source of income for McGrath, who married for the first time in 2024 after spending many years on the road as a professional clown, including a long stint with the renowned Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\nThat clowning job with The Greatest Show on Earth took him to every state in the continental United States, save for Wyoming, the Dakotas and perhaps one or two others. McGrath performed as \"Crickett\" with Ringling Brothers in some major arenas, including the legendary Madison Square Garden.\n\"Back stage, there was a bunch of pictures of Billy Joel because he had performed there so many times. I think he holds the record,\" McGrath said of that famous New York City venue.\nSo how did McGrath morph into a professional clown?\nBorn in Massachusetts and raised in Virginia, McGrath went to the circus with his family as a kid and was drawn to all of its attractions, particularly juggling. While attending Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Va., where he graduated in 2005 with a psychology degree, McGrath learned to juggle.\n\"I always liked juggling as a hobby. I got a book, something like, 'The Complete Klutz Guide to Juggling' and taught myself how to juggle,\" he recalled.\nPerhaps the main lesson that McGrath learned while majoring in psychology was this: Live an adventurous life and see new places while you are still young and able.\nAfter attending a clowning camp in New York City, a few years post graduation, McGrath joined the Big Apple Circus as a concessions worker — just to get his big, goofy clown foot in the door.\nAs did many of the 150 other circus employees, McGrath lived in a renovated room in the back of a trailer while the show traveled to places in Georgia, Vermont, New Hampshire, Virginia and New York.\n\"I was a cotton candy twister,\" he said, before explaining, \"I was just hoping to meet some people, make the right connections.\"\nThat pay-your-dues gig made a huge difference, too, because McGrath then got a performance job with Ringling Brothers. He performed under the Big Top as Crickett with the Blue Unit of that outfit from 2006 through 2011, juggling and executing all manners of jokes, including sight gags.\n\"I was very lucky. I just happened to be submitting a resume at the time when one of the clowns jumped ship — so I was available and got the job,\" McGrath remembered.\nIt was common for Ringling Brothers to stay in the cities and towns on the tour and perform nine to 15 shows per week, before moving on to the next stop. It was a demanding way of life that was tempered by the fun and adventure it provided.\n\"We traveled by train and pretty much lived on that train. We each had a 6'-by-6' room. We were paid a salary that was just enough to live on, just enough to meet expenses. We got one month off every two years,\" McGrath reviewed.\nIt was a passion project. \"I'd work with the other clowns and we'd come up with our own gags. We'd also work with writers and a team of prop builders,\" McGrath said.\nThere was no need, however, for McGrath's talent on two-foot stilts at the Ringling Brothers level. \"They had Caribbean stilt-walkers who walked smoothly on 6-foot stilts,\" McGrath noted.\nThe secret to walking on stilts, according to McGrath: \"You have to get over your reptilian mindset and feel comfortable walking higher above ground than normal. And you have to know how to fall safely. It took me about 20 hours total of walking on stilts before it felt natural to me.\"\nHe added, \"Most gigs are one to two hours long. Some, though, are four to five hours long and you feel pretty achy after walking on stilts all that time.\"\nAfter he left Ringling Brothers and transitioned into a more domesticated life that still allowed him to clown and perform regionally, McGrath incorporated more stilts-walking into his act. He has been performing solo as Crickett, mostly on weekends, for approximately the past 15 years.\n\"It is an abnormal job, but I have a pretty normal life,\" he summarized. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hit fundraising competition Bailando con las Estrellas returns for season 2\n\n September 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Local News \n \n 574\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The second annual Bailando con las Estrellas took place Saturday evening at the Avalon Theatre, where local stars danced their hearts out to raise money for the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center.The event, a dance competition modeled after popular TV show Dancing with the Stars, is part of the center's Hispanic Heritage Month programming and aims to celebrate Hispanic culture while raising funds to meet yearly goals.\nThe fiscal goal of the event was to raise $80,000. Each dancer raised their own set of funds prior to the event and through the voting process during. By the end of the night, 86% of the goal was reached, coming in at just over $69,000.\n\"The first one was last year. We didn't know what we were doing, and it ended up going so well. We knew we had to go bigger and better this year. So we just went as big as we could possibly go,\" Executive Director of ChesMRC Matthew Peters said.\nThe team at ChesMRC balances uplifting success stories with difficult day-to-day challenges. The event provides a needed break to highlight the good, Peters said.\nThere were three judges: Liza Ledford with the Oxford Community Center; Jeremy Hillyard, Talbot County Public School 2024-25 teacher of the year; and Sharon Pepukayi, Talbot County Public Schools superintendent.\nHillyard and Pepukayi fully understood what each star was going through, as the two performed the previous year.\nThis year, Victoria Gomez Lozano performed with Tori Gomez, Joe Petro performed with Maya Robinson, John Marrah performed with Rebecca Wales, Brenda Fike performed with Samantha Martinez, James Redmen performed with Christine Redmen, Angel Perez performed with Maddie Megahan, and Milton Orellana performed with Berenice Orellana.\nChoreographer Erinne Lewis spent two weeks with the stars learning routines, but when the amateur dancers took the stage, it appeared as if they'd been training for months. Each set of dancers brought their own unique flair to the stage — some silly, some serious and some downright impressive.\nHillyard said there was noticeable improvement from season one to season two, saying the dancers \"stepped it up\" this year. He was impressed by the amount of money raised and compared it to a yearly salary.\nHe said being a judge this year felt like less pressure than performing and he could enjoy and appreciate the dancers' hard work more.\nOwner of the nonprofit consulting firm What's Good LLC Jayme Dingler was the evening's master of ceremonies. She attributed this year's success to multiple changes from last year's event.\n\"Matthew had the great idea of inviting star sponsors, so every team had a company that sponsored them, which is really fun,\" Dingler said.\nIn addition, they had a big opening number with all the stars, text voting, voting during the show and allowing ticket and sponsorship purchases to be allocated to a specific team.\nDingler said this led to a significant increase from the estimated $35,000 raised last year.\nThe big winners of the evening were Angel Perez and Maddie Megahan with the Dancing Stars (Estrellas de Baile) award, James and Christine Redmen with the Heart (Corazon) award, and Victoria Gomez Lozano and Tori Gozem with the Make it Rain (lluvia de Dinero) award.\n\"Thank you to everybody, all the sponsors this year, all everyone that's stepped up, and then, yeah, get ready for that phone call when I call you next year and ask you, you know, do you can you dance and do you want to, what are you doing on this Saturday night,\" Peters said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "New acts, old favorites to highlight Rock Hall FallFest live music\n\n October 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BOB FORD Special to the Kent County News | Section: Music \n \n 675\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Rock Hall FallFest returns Saturday, Oct. 11, for the 28th edition of the annual one-day festival that celebrates the opening of the commercial oyster season along with the bayside town's tradition of presenting and supporting live music.The \"return\" of the oyster will be honored, as always, with thousands of hand-shucked oysters on the half shell, complemented by street-fair food and assorted drink offerings.\nAs for the music, which will play continuously on alternating Main Street stages during the 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. event, two newcomers will join the performance schedule in addition to some old favorites, including the always-popular Catonsville High School Steel Band.\nLeading off the lineup on the Mainstay Stage will be Austin, Texas, singer-songwriter Andrea Magee, making her FallFest debut. She will be followed by The Llama Dalis, an eclectic, innovative art-rock quartet that also will perform at FallFest for the first time.\nThe oysters and the music are just the start. Main Street, transformed into a pedestrian-safe thoroughfare, will be lined with craft and artisan vendors and Rock Hall's array of quaint shops. A food truck convention will set up near the base of Main Street, and a Kids Kourt will feature games, prizes and entertainment for children.\nAdmission is free, as is the plentiful parking near the festivities. The nonprofit event donates all proceeds to Rock Hall organizations and projects. The main beneficiaries over the years have been the Kent County Waterman's Association scholarship fund and The Mainstay, the iconic music venue that books acts year-round on the Tom McHugh Stage.\nThe Llama Dalis, founded more than 30 years ago by brothers Michael and Dave Biddison, are a Pennsylvania-based band that reunites for festivals. Michael Biddison, on acoustic guitar, handles most of the lead vocals, while Dave plays drums and sings on the rest of their mostly original repertoire. Bob Taylor plays bass, and Steve Wheelock is the lead guitarist.\nTaylor played FallFest last year with Philip Dutton's band, The Good Stuff, a classic country cover unit, and encouraged the Dalis to join the lineup this year.\n\"We play a high-energy show for all the dancing fools,\" Taylor said, \"but a lot of our pieces are dreamy, thoughtful stuff. My daughter calls us jam band funk.\"\nThe Llama Dalis members have all performed in other bands over the years, but they always reunite to play fresh tunes written by the Biddison brothers and to revive a catalog influenced by the full spectrum of rock music. As for the name?\n\"Well, the Dalai Lama was a good guy, and Salvador Dali was an interesting character,\" Taylor said. \"We have a song called 'Hair on Fire' that comes from a Zen teacher back in the day who said you have to seek enlightenment like a man with his hair on fire. That's us — a little Zen, a little absurdist.\"\nMagee, a multi-instrumentalist, was born and raised in Belfast before pursuing her musical dreams in the United States in 2014. Her music blends folk, rock and Celtic styles, and she has toured with legendary artists including Brian Wilson, Brian Setzer and Jeff Bridges.\nMagee is the festival director for She Rises Fest, an annual event that celebrates women in music and the arts. Her nonprofit, Music Helps, provides workshops for children at Helping Hand Home for Children in Austin, a support and housing service for children who have experienced abuse and neglect.\n\"Music is about community, connection and giving back,\" Magee said. \"It's the threads that weave us together, and I'm honored to be part of that tapestry.\"\nOther acts taking the stage at FallFest include the Catonsville High School Steel Band, returning for its 25th anniversary appearance; Pat Wictor and Bob Beach, blending acoustic guitar and blues harmonica; Kent County's own hard-rocking guitarist Blake Thompson and his Family Band; and the hometown favorites, The Singing Captains, who will close the show with classic pop songs.\nRock Hall FallFest is a feast for the ears, for good appetites and honest thirsts, and for those who enjoy a throwback day of music, oysters and small-town charm.\nFor more information, directions and a full lineup, visit www.rockhallfallfest.org \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
