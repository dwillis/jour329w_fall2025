    "content": "Abortion ban suit highlights dangers to women\n\n August 9, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 675\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The first duty of a doctor is to provide the best possible care for the patient.But doctors in Missouri and other red states around America today could face prison time if that duty requires ending a patient's pregnancy based on medical concerns that might later be deemed insufficient to justify an abortion under new state bans.The fact that hospitals in Missouri and around the country have started erring on the side of legal caution, literally endangering their patients' lives in the process, is both horrific and predictable.But now a lawsuit in Texas could point the way to a response that might finally force anti-choice politicians to consider the real-world implications of their ideological extremism. It alleges that Texas law endangers women's lives.It does - clearly - as does Missouri's.Texas, like Missouri, bans all abortions except those deemed to be medical emergencies. In the wording of the Texas law, those are defined as situations that risk either death or \"substantial impairment of a major bodily function\" for the woman.What is \"substantial,\" versus unsubstantial?What is \"major\" versus minor?For medical professionals forced to make immediate decisions in the course of assessing a pregnancy in distress, these aren't academic questions but issues that could, based on subsequent second-guessing by prosecutors, land them in prison.More than a dozen Texas women now claim in a lawsuit that the Texas abortion law endangered their lives by forcing doctors to hesitate in ending dangerous pregnancies for fear of being unable to later defend that decision in court.The suit cites multiple cases like that of lead plaintiff Amanda Zurawski of Austin, who ended up in intensive care and almost died after doctors refused to perform an abortion after her water broke at 18 weeks.\"(W)ith the threat of losing their medical licenses, fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and up to 99 years in prison lingering over their heads, it is no wonder that doctors and hospitals are turning patients away,\" states the suit, referencing the penalties in the Texas abortion ban.The suit alleges that, \"As a direct result of Texas's abortion bans, Texas is in the midst of a health care crisis.\" Among the other Texas women impacted was one who had to travel out of state to end an non-viable pregnancy - a necessity, the suit states, that made her feel like \"a medical refugee.\" The term is apt.The suit also points to similar dangers endured by more than 20 women in 11 abortion-ban states outside of Texas, including Missouri.In a similar Missouri case, Joplin resident Mylissa Farmer last year was 17 weeks pregnant when her water broke, negating the possibility she could carry the fetus to term and presenting potential life-threatening complications if the pregnancy wasn't terminated.But because Missouri's near-total abortion ban makes an exception only for a \"medical emergency\" - a situation Farmer arguably wasn't in yet, though she eventually, inevitably would be - doctors in both Missouri and Kansas declined to end the pregnancy for her.This particular medical refugee was finally forced to make the long trip from southwestern Missouri to Illinois to save her life.Defenders of the abortion bans argue that in these and similar cases, doctors were protected by the statutory exceptions for emergencies. Their certainty that no ambitious prosecutor with an ideological agenda will dispute doctors' definition of that term is, at best, naive.Especially considering the politically charged atmosphere surrounding abortion services since Roe v. Wade's reversal last year.It isn't difficult to see where this is going. As Kaiser Family Foundation Health News put it in a report in June: \"To some physicians and malpractice attorneys, the question is when - not if - a pregnant patient will die from lack of care and set the stage for a big-dollar wrongful death claim.\" Policymakers in Missouri and other red states can wait for that to happen, bringing with it all the legal and human complications it will bring. Or they can acknowledge that real-world medical issues don't align neatly with political and religious dogma, and consider revisiting these extremist laws.REPRINTED FROM THE ST.

Two among them are the stalled University of Maryland regional medical center project and related physician shortage issues and out of control growth and development that threatens our quality of life.Al Silverstein is far and away the best candidate for Easton's Town Council president in the Sept. 12 election.In his statement in the Star Democrat on Aug. 6, Al says, \"It's imperative for the health and welfare of the citizens of the Mid-Shore that a new Regional Medical Center begin construction in 2024.\" He promises to be a vocal advocate for our health care needs.Before moving to Maryland, I had a lot of experience with municipalities dealing with large medical systems to make sure local needs are met. I worked for four years for the Massachusetts certificate of the need program, involved with overseeing the acquisition and upgrading of community hospitals by their affiliate Boston academic medical centers. Town public officials routinely spoke out in no uncertain terms on behalf of the needs of their communities.It is baffling to me why the only public voice we hear is from the PR department of the University of Maryland's Shore Regional Health. This needs to change and will change if Al Silverstein is elected.With regard to limited growth, Al will take concrete action. He promises to propose legislation for the adoption of an Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO).APFO is well known and used by communities to link the existence of adequate local facilities to approval of individual projects.To hear about these plans and ask Al about any concerns you may have, please come to a meet and greet for Al on Thursday Aug. 17 at 4 Dogs Brewing Co. and Pub from 6-8 p.m. There will be free hors o'oeuvres.HOLLY WRIGHTEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The latest version is printed here in full. We apologize for the error and congratulate the Benedictine Foundation on another successful event.RIDGELY - The Benedictine Foundation's 21st Chrome City fundraiser on Sunday, July 30, raised more than $100,000 to support the children and adults living with developmental disabilities that Benedictine serves.\"Chrome City continues to be a much anticipated event for Benedictine every summer.Our supported adults, students at the Benedictine School, staff members, and families look forward to a day of camaraderie and fun that includes watching the cars and motorcycles roll down the mile-long lane on our Ridgely campus. Couple that with the opportunity for the community to join us and support Benedictine's mission makes for a perfect day - and this year's weather really did make it a perfect day,\" said Benedictine Executive Director Scott Evans.In a festive and colorful combination at the Chrome City fundraiser, an unlikely pairing came together - nuns in golf carts and bikers in leather. The bikers were on souped up Harleys with waving American flags and came roaring across the campus for one of the institution's bigger charity events.Motorcycles, hot rods, classic, custom and vintage cars and more than 600 people attended. The event continues to provide an opportunity to support Benedictine and its critical services and visit the campus all while enjoying a vast collection of cars and motorcycles.\"This year's Chrome City supporters were blessed with a perfect day and a wonderful crowd of participants, supporters and Benedictine friends and family members.As in past years, the cars, street rods and motorcycles were awesome and continue to bring so much excitement to the Benedictine campus.Thank you to everyone for their support and attendance,\" said Spud Blake, founder and past committee chair.Families enjoyed picnics, pulled pork sandwiches and big cattle farm metal barrels full of both Coke and Pepsi.The idea for the Chrome City Ride sprouted from a similar law enforcement event, so there were lots of men and women dressed in uniform. A DJ played {span}Lynyrd Skynyrd{/span} and the Doobie Brothers in equal measures with classic Motown.\"This event pulls people to make that left or right turn to come down our lane and see what is happening here at Benedictine,\" Evans said.\"It is important to raise funds for what we do and our mission, but it is also important for people to see what we do and where the money goes to support our mission. This is about 15% of what we raise over the year, but it is also friend-raising. We talk about the miracles that happen every day, this is a chance for visitors to see the people they support.\" Neon T-shirts marked the more than 50 volunteers who came out to support this event as a white-haired nun came up in a chauffeured golf cart.\"It is something we do every year in July for the children.They are happy to see the bikers come in and the ancient cars. They are just thrilled about the day,\" Sister Mary Agnes said. \"22 years ago it was Sister Jeannette who got all the motorcycle police to lead them in.\" There was a fire engine at the entrance with a giant American flag waving.Sitting in the shade of a tree was Windham Hutchins of Chestertown. He has a 1938 Plymouth Coupe in an espresso coffee color and said, \"I think it is a good cause. This is my third year. You meet a lot of nice people and get good ideas to come back with and work with. I have two nieces and a nephew who work here.They always talk about this place and how they love working here.\" \"I am doing it because I get to see all of my students, and I get to interact with a lot of the community,\" volunteer Samala Brown said.Many of the residents were cruising the grounds. Greg Hviding said the best part is \"old cars and motorcycles.This is my favorite event.\" Blake, former chief of staff for the University of Maryland Police, said, \"This was a sister ride of our COPS Ride - Concerns of Police Survivors.Our first year with Benedictine we only made $22,000.Now we have raised over $2 million, but more importantly we have brought recognition to the Benedictine community here and the school. This was Sister Jeannette's favorite event because the kids are all here. And her motto was 'Get 'er done.'\" Del. Steven J. Arentz, R-36, rode his 2013 Harley Davidson to the event. He said, \"It is good people, a good event and a good time for everybody.\" \"The generosity of Benedictine's Chrome City sponsors and donors demonstrates the importance of the work our organization does to support developmentally disabled children and adults,\" said Claudia Cunningham, chief advancement officer. \"Everything about this special day is uplifting and touches lives in profound ways.\" \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY TOM MCCALL/\n \nMore than 50 volunteers showed up Sunday to share in what Benedictine Executive Director Scott Evans calls everyday miracles.\n \nPHOTO BY TOM MCCALL/\n \nSister Mary Agnes is driven by William Shockley as they pass many vintage cars during the Chrome City fundraiser on Sunday, July 30.\n \nPHOTO BY TOM MCCALL/\n \nWindham Hutchins of Chestertown brought a 1938 Plymouth Coupe behind him.

    "content": "One size doesn't fit all for hospitals - EDITORIAL\n\n August 11, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 562\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Fully a third of Missouri's rural hospitals are in danger of closing in the next few years, leaving large swaths of the state without access to emergency services, obstetrics or even the most basic health care.It's part of a national trend that qualifies as a looming crisis - one that might be addressed with a fundamental change in how the private insurance industry pays hospitals on behalf of insured patients.A study released last month by the national Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform found that 19 of Missouri's 57 rural hospitals are in danger of closing their doors in the next two to seven years because they aren't taking in enough revenue from payments to cover their costs.Here and around the country, rural hospitals' long-term financial slide was alleviated by federal pandemic aid programs for the past three years but now has resumed with the end of those programs.The numbers are daunting. One rural Missouri hospital administrator in Hermann told the Missouri Independent that after being kept afloat since 2020 by federal COVID-relief funding, \"We are back to losing over $1 million this year.\" Those financial issues are likely exacerbated in Missouri by the widely reported difficulty in getting doctors to come here - a situation that cannot have been improved by last year's enactment of a draconian state abortion ban that threatens doctors with 15 years in prison for violations.Indeed, as struggling Missouri rural hospitals cut back on services, obstetrics is in danger of becoming a prime target. As the Independent reports, for instance, Cox Monett Hospital in southwest Missouri is shuttering its inpatient obstetrics unit this summer due in part to difficulty recruiting doctors.For local residents, it will mean traveling close to an hour for services.But the main culprit in the crisis, CHQPR maintains, is the private insurance industry, with its one-size-fits-all approach to paying hospitals.That approach doesn't take into account the fact that it's inherently more expensive for smaller hospitals to provide care than it is for larger, busier ones, based on economy of scale. For example, all hospitals with emergency rooms must maintain staff 24/7, but in small rural areas, those ERs often stand empty.Nationally, CHQPR reports, more than 600 rural hospitals, or about 30% of the U.S. total, are in danger of closing in the next few years.The organization's report notes the \"mistaken belief\" that most financial losses for rural hospitals are due to Medicaid patients or the uninsured. In fact, it says, about half of rural hospital patients are under private insurance plans - and those plans, for the most part, \"are paying them less than what it costs to deliver services to patients.\" The solution, CHQPR says, is to require that private insurers pay enough to prevent closures of endangered rural hospitals. The organization also calls for restructuring the way payments are made so that they cover not just the cost of services rendered but also \"standby capacity\" - the fixed costs of keeping hospital units open and staff on hand when there are no paying patients being served.The organization claims these reforms would cost $4 billion annually.Large as that sounds, it's actually just one-tenth of 1% of America's total health care spending.Whether these are the right solutions is a broader conversation - but it's one that Missouri's political leaders in Washington should be having, on behalf of their struggling hospitals back home. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You're not alone. Everyone goes through seasons of self-defeat, pain and anguish.VERBALIZE HOW YOU FEEL. I would caution against making this a public dissertation.Write it out journal style. Tell God how you feel. Say that you are angry and bitter or that you're afraid to face the day. However you choose, find a way to pour out your heart. It is cleansing to release swirling negative thoughts. While your situation may not change, the way you feel about will.SEEK AND ACCEPT HELP FROM OTHERS You really do not have to go through this by yourself.Once you determine where you are stuck, seek out help. If you are struggling with credit card debt, for example, go to NFCC.org to find a certified credit counseling organization in your area. If it's a medical situation where you cannot afford the cost of meds, reach out for help. Simply asking for help is going to open a new world of resources you may not know exists.CHOOSE JOY. Even when you are at the end of your rope, you still possess something very valuable: your attitude. You can choose your thoughts. You can default to pain, fear and anguish, or you can proactively choose joy. You can focus on all that you do not have and all the stuff that's coming at you, or you can choose to rise above that and focus on what you do have - even if that is just the air that you breathe. Embrace it.Choose to think only about things that are lovely, true and pure. I've come to realize that what I've been through can either beat me down and make me bitter, or I can choose for my experiences to make the difference in another's life.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book Debt-Proof Living.© 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Festival of Hope to kick off Talbot Goes Purple Aug. 31 - Moves to Anchor Church; speaker announced\n\n August 16, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A2 | Section: News \n \n 775\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - The third annual Festival of Hope is set for 6 to 8 p.m.Aug. 31 at Anchor Church in Easton and includes the seventh year kickoff for Talbot Goes Purple.The festival is a partnership between Talbot Goes Purple, Mid-Shore Restoring Hope in Women and Christ Church of Easton and coincides with international overdose awareness day. The event celebrates the hope that recovery is possible for anyone still struggling, and honors those lost from substance use disorder.This year's festival again includes free food; live music with Alive@Five; family fun including a dunking booth with Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble, bounce house, face painting, games and prizes; activities with the Talbot County Sheriff's Office including K-9 demonstrations; resource tables; and a memorial for those lost. New this year is speaker Sam Davis, a Richmond-based interventionist who is in recovery from substance use disorder.Davis will start speaking at 7:30 p.m., with the overdose memorial directly after.\"We're glad to have Sam Davis come to our festival this year with his strong message of recovery and family support,\" said Sherry Collier, founder of Mid-Shore Restoring Hope in Women. Collier has organized overdose awareness day events in Easton since 2017. Her nonprofit supports women in need of recovery services. \"Our organization helps place women into recovery houses, and we often see the effect that addiction has on families.Davis' work as an interventionist is important, especially for family members to hear that help is available.\" Drug overdose deaths hit a record high of 109,680 in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Maryland, however, reduced fatalities by about 7% from 2021 to 2022. And in Talbot County, fatal overdoses declined 15% between September 2021 and September 2021. Still, the opioid epidemic continues with new challenges, including an influx of the horse tranquilizer, xylazine. Also known as tranq, xylazine is a non-opioid that is mixed into illicit street drugs, particularly the potent synthetic opioid, fentanyl.The prevalence of xylazine is on the rise - with the sedative present in almost 11% of all fentanyl deaths in June 2022, almost a fourfold increase from 2019. In Maryland, however, xylazine was present in about a quarter of all fentanyl overdose deaths from January 2021 to June 2022. That's more than twice the national rate. Xylazine has not yet shown up in Talbot County, Gamble said. Still, 13 people in the county died of overdoses in the 12 months ending in January 2023.\"While we have had some reduction in overdoses and related deaths, this epidemic continues,\" Gamble said. \"We have to continue educating young people about the realities of substance use. And we hope everyone comes out to the festival to celebrate the hope and power of recovery, but most important we want them to: Get the Facts, Get Involved and Get Talking.\" Bruce Strazza, a local recovery advocate and Alive@5 worship leader at Christ Church, has served on the Mid-Shore opioid task force and has twice spoken for the Lt.Governor of Maryland. He also serves as an active member with Talbot Goes Purple and a resource for Gamble.\"Entering 2023 I was hopeful for a better year, and while the numbers are down the risks are up,\" Strazza said. \"We thought fentanyl was bad - xylazine is worse. This could prove to be the most important year for awareness on record. We have to inform people of the risks of even trying opioids and other drugs even one time.\" Talbot Goes Purple is an awareness and educational prevention program that empowers youth and the community to \"Go Purple\" as a sign of taking a stand against substance abuse. The initiative includes purple clubs in local middle and high schools, through which students learn they do not need drugs or alcohol to meet life's challenges.For more information on festival sponsorships or resource tables, or if you'd like to include someone in the memorial, email talbotgoespurple@gmail.com.The community is encouraged to display purple lights and gear starting Sept. 1 and throughout the month as a show of taking a stand against substance abuse. More information is available at www.talbotgoespurple.org.Find TGP on Facebook@Talbot-GoesPurple.Talbot Goes Purple is in partnership with Talbot County Public Schools, Saints Peter and Paul Schools, and Mid-Shore Community Foundation. Generous support for the festival this year includes: Bright View Health, Chesapeake Parties, Easton Utilities, Holy Trinity Church of Oxford, Pepsi Bottling Ventures, Preston Automotive Group, Shore United Bank and VFW Post 5118.Talbot Goes Purple is a component fund of the Mid-Shore Community Foundation, a 501©(3) nonprofit organization - donations to which are tax deductible to the fullest extent allowed by law. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY CHRISTINA AU FDERHEIDE\n \nTalbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble in the dunking booth at the 2022 Festival of Hope. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The grant enabled construction of a permanent shade sail over the Arboretum's multi-use Visitor's Center patio that will protect more than 2,300 children and 30,000 visitors annually from harmful ultraviolet exposure, even during the sunniest summer months.\"The Arboretum is grateful for this critical funding from the American Academy of Dermatology,\" said Executive Director Ginna Tiernan.\"While the Arboretum's woodland paths and covered pavilion provide shade, the Visitor's Center holds particular appeal as a programming and gathering space. A shade structure in this high-traffic area benefits a significant number of students and visitors.\" Shore Industries of Preston designed and manufactured the shade sail and installed the structure in late spring, just in time to welcome nearly 300 guests and 26 musicians to Forest Music and dozens of children to the Arboretum's Summer Nature Camps.As an Arboretum sponsor, Shore Industries also provided in-kind services that allowed the project to stay within the parameters of the grant award.With a membership of more than 20,000 physicians worldwide, the AAD is committed to diagnosis and treatment; advocating high standards in clinical practice, education and research in dermatology; and supporting and enhancing patient care for a lifetime of healthier skin, hair and nails.

I have been dating a guy for a year. I really like him and even think he could be the one. My daughters, however, have been nothing but nasty to him, regardless of how well he has treated them. He has brought them gifts and taken them to do fun activities, but they still aren't impressed. I know it's because they feel as if I am replacing their dad, who unfortunately died when they were 6. I loved him very much, but I am ready to find another partner.I feel distraught about how to proceed in this relationship because I don't want to make everyone who's involved have a miserable life if we marry. I have tried breaking through to them about my boyfriend and telling them that he's not here to replace their dad, but they just don't listen. I am thinking of breaking up with him even though I really like him. What are your opinions on my situation? - Making Peace DEAR MAKING PEACE: Your girls need more time. While a year may seem like a long time to you and your guy, it is not long from the perspective of a life.If you and he seriously want to marry and create a family together, you both have to be willing to be patient and continue to build relationships with the girls.In addition, get the girls professional support. Put them in therapy, individually and with you as family. A therapist may be able to help all of you come to terms that will be welcoming to everyone and clear a path forward.Harriette Cole is a life stylist and founder of DREAMLEAPERS, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

    "content": "Suicides are at record levels in the U.S.; Men, specifically white men, are driving the wave\n\n August 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; APG National Enterprise Editor | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 941\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A record number of Americans killed themselves last year, according to new suicide numbers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.Who is driving the contemporary surge in suicides?\"Middle-age white males,\" said Dr.Caroline Fenkel, chief clinical officer and co-founder of Charlie Health Inc., a Bozeman, Montana-based mental and behavioral health provider specializing in virtual and outpatient care for kids, teens and young adults.Men made up 79.4% of the record 49,449 suicides committed nationally last year, according to the CDC. White men make up 30% of the U.S. population.They accounted for 60% (29,847) of the suicides last year, according to the CDC.Fenkel said men, especially white men, can feel the pressures of societal and throwback gender role expectations - and still not show stigmatized weaknesses of their mental health.Gender roles associated with career expectations in a market-based economy also play a role, Fenkel said, pointing to how society can look down at working class and lower-income men employed in some lower-paying service sector jobs.\"They are constantly told that they should be successful. That they should be making a lot of money. That they should be providing for or having a family,\" Fenkel said.Men tend to use guns to kill themselves compared to women who use other means such as attempting overdoses.\"Women are attempting suicides more often but don't succeed, while men tend to complete suicides at much higher frequency,\" said Dusti Linnell, an associate professor of practice with Oregon State University's College of Health. She helps lead the university's community mental and behavioral health efforts.\"The completions are associated with firearms,\" Linnell said.Guns were used in 54.6% of all U.S. suicides last year, according to the CDC data, outpacing other methods such as poisoning and overdoses (11.6%) and suffocations and self hangings (25.8%).Fenkel said men are more impulsive in their decisions to kill themselves - and are less likely than women to talk about their mental health challenges openly.\"They are really more likely to self-treat and to self medicate with alcohol,\" she said. \"I think they are less likely to ask for help in general.I think asking for help as a male is seen as a weakness.\" UPSETTING UPSWINGSuicides have been on the rise in the U.S. since 2000. There were 29,350 suicides reported by U.S. health agencies in 2000. They have increased 68.4% since then and 4.1% since 2019 before all the stressors and shutdowns of the coronavirus pandemic.The 2022 increases include noticeable jumps from 2021 among those ages 45-64 (6.6%) and 65 and older (8.1%) as well as Asians (5.7%) and Hispanics (4.3%).Those all outpace the overall 2.6% jump in suicides from 2021 to 2022.Linnell said she's seen worrisome increases in suicides and suicide attempts by farmers and others working in rural and outdoor vocations as well as continued mental health stigmas and a pronounced counselor shortages making it difficult for those in need to find help.Farmers, farm workers and others working outside have to deal with extreme weather changes including warmer temperatures as well as pesticides and other chemicals.Linnell said lingering stigmas about talking about mental health and suicidal thoughts can be magnified along with social isolations in smaller towns and rural regions.\"One of the most difficult things to say to another person is that you are thinking of killing yourself or harming yourself,\" she said.Fenkel said the shortage of mental and behavioral health workers is so pronounced that as many 150 million Americans live in \"mental health deserts\" where access to services and treatment can be scarce.SOLUTIONS?So what can be done?The growth of telehealth services born out of and magnified after the pandemic has improved access to mental and behavioral resources and sparked the growth of groups such as Montana-based Charlie Health, which was established in 2020.That can allow more therapists and counselors to live and work in smaller towns and rural areas while also seeing patients in bigger cities.It also can offer some privacy for those with mental and behavioral health challenges they might not trust sharing with family or employers. \"It can be embarrassing,\" Linnell said.She said Oregon State is part of efforts in the Pacific Northwest to implement and grow peer-based mental and behavioral health programs.Whether its middle-age or older men or teenagers, it can be easier to talk about sensitive topics such as suicide and self-harm with a friend than family members or employers.High schools and colleges are implementing peer-based mental health programs.Linnell said Oregon State is looking to grow peer-based \"Mental Health First Aid\" and QPR (Question, Persuade, Refer) programs.The former entails a six-hour training programs to help participants to build skills to help friends and others in need while the other has shorter 90-minute programs aimed suicide prevention.A key goal is for those considering or recovering from self-harm to believe they can get better.\"It's so important for people to know that recovery is possible,\" she said. \n \n Caption: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/CREATIVE COMMONS/LENART LIPOVŠEK LENART /UNSPLASH.COM\n \nMen made up more than 79% of total suicides in the U.S. last year, according to provisional data from the U.S. Centers of Disease Control.

    "content": "Blood on Board - Equipping Maryland's air medical response with whole blood to save lives\n\n August 23, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A4 | Section: News \n \n 846\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n MIDDLE RIVER - Tuesday, the Maryland Department of State Police, Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems and University of Maryland Medical Center announced a new public-private collaboration for lifesaving trauma response for Marylanders.Whole blood is used for emergency transfusions when minutes are critical, and is now available on board MSP's fleet of \"Trooper\" helicopters used in prehospital air medical response for critically injured patients.Whole blood, which is blood that has not been separated into components, contains all of the factors necessary for optimal clotting and has become the blood product of choice for the resuscitation of patients with extreme bleeding at leading trauma centers across the United States and elsewhere over the last five years.The \"Blood on Board\" project began with an initial roll out on May 10 starting with Trooper 1 (Martin State Airport in Baltimore County) and Trooper 2 (Joint Base Andrews in Prince George's County) to ensure all necessary logistical details were working as planned. The project was expanded to the remaining five Maryland State Police Aviation Command bases during July. Maryland is the first state in the country to offer this lifesaving Blood on Board initiative as a statewide service.This project is an example of the continual growth of the unique partnerships that comprise Maryland's trauma response system. Marking 50 years this year as a statewide network, this partnership provides Marylanders with increased care that reduces the number of disabilities and death from traumatic injury.The most seriously injured in Maryland are often transported to a trauma center by medevac helicopter to reduce the amount of time to reach definitive care at a hospital.Blood has been transfused in the field to more than 20 critically injured patients who have been injured as a result of many different types of trauma, ranging from motor vehicle crashes and machinery accidents to gunshot wounds. There have already been several patients who may not have survived their injuries to reach the hospital had they not received these blood transfusions.\"The clock for the Golden Hour starts ticking at the time of injury, not at hospital arrival.If a patient's condition worsens in the field, or they have a cardiac arrest before arriving to us, their survival chances are markedly diminished,\" said Thomas Scalea, MD, the Physician-in-Chief, R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, System Chief for Critical Care Services, University of Maryland Medical System and The Honorable Francis X. Kelly Distinguished Professor of Trauma Surgery at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. \"Administering whole blood prior to a patient's arrival at the hospital has been shown to improve survival in both military and civilian trauma situations. At Shock Trauma, we are excited that this life-saving therapy intervention is now available for critically ill and injured patients in Maryland and know that in some cases it will undoubtedly mean the difference between life and death.\" \"This is a true game-changer in our ability to care for patients with extreme hemorrhagic shock,\" said Douglas J. Floccare, MD, MPH, FACEP, the State Air Medical Director for MIEMSS and Medical Director for the MSP Aviation Command. \"This program is the result of several years of a team effort to bring the necessary pieces together, and it will serve to further improve survival for our patients from here on out.\" MSP crews underwent extensive training for several months in advance of the program's launch, and guidelines and protocols were developed, following national standards, for decision criteria around the types of patients for whom blood products could be beneficial.Whole blood units are stored in special temperature-controlled coolers at each MSP hangar. When needed, the MSP Aviation crew, which includes two flight paramedics, brings the blood to a scene and provides the advanced care.Blood products are replenished at UMMC's Blood Bank.Whole blood units that have not been used are rotated back into the Blood Bank prior to expiration to minimize the possibility of any blood being wasted.\"Seeing this program come to fruition statewide and making the immediate impact we all worked so hard to achieve is immensely rewarding for everyone involved,\" said Ron Cummins, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at the University of Maryland Medical Center.\"UMMC is fortunate to have strong partners who share our commitment to pushing boundaries and advancing care for Marylanders. There's no better example of the power of partnership than a partnership designed to save lives.\" \"This initiative to provide whole blood on the scene is a significant advancement in the life saving procedures administered by our Aviation crews,\" said Maryland State Police Superintendent Colonel Roland L. Butler Jr. \"Treating patients suffering massive blood loss is a critical part of what they do, and the replacement of lost blood greatly increases capabilities for our emergency responders to save lives. With a program like this, our Aviation Command is not just getting patients to the hospital. They are increasing the chances of long-term survival.\" \n \n Caption: Dr. Thomas Scalea, the physician-in-chief, R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, system chief for Critical Care Services, University of Maryland Medical System, explains that administering blood prior to a patient's arrival at the hospital can improve survival in trauma situations.\n \nCOURTESY MSP \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So let's gather into a huddle, wrap our arms around one another and take a collective deep breath.Dear Cheapskate: My comment is in response to \"Where to Keep Money for Mom?\" and Bonita in South Dakota, who was looking for input on how to invest $10,000 for her 62-year-old mother who has no savings, no life insurance and lives on disability.I would recommend they go to any funeral home and work with the person there who handles prepaid funerals.Essentially, you are purchasing an insurance policy to cover the funeral costs.We did this for my dad before he moved into a longterm care facility, which was going to drain his remaining assets to $0. A prepaid funeral policy is excluded from the asset base, is protected once the assets are gone and a person goes on medical assistance.With all the other drama that comes with aging parents, it is nice for my sister and me to know that the end is covered and won't create another drain/strain on everything. - Molly Dear Molly: Thanks for this wise advice. In fact, many elder law attorneys advise prepayment as a way to invest in assets that will not be countable by Medicaid or SSI.However, I want my readers to know that there are pitfalls on the road to prepaid end-of-life arrangements, which they need to know about in order to avoid falling into them.

My family and I live on a farm, and my son loves to spend a lot of time with our pigs, cows and goats. He loves taking care of them every day because they are his pride and joy. As a result of this, he and his clothes often end up having a distinct scent on them from the animals. He tries to get it off of him, but it sticks.I am offended and upset that someone wouldn't have the guts to tell me to my face. Instead, they chose to leave a note without signing their name. I now feel as if I can't trust the people around me anymore, and I feel as if it could've been anyone from my life.How am I supposed to find out who did this and confront them? - My Son's Hygiene DEAR MY SON's HYGIENE: I'm sorry, but I think you are looking at this through the wrong lens. It isn't that the person lacks courage.

    "author": "Jacob Sullum",
    "content": "Anti-opioid bias has caused needless suffering\n\n August 25, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jacob Sullum | Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 641\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Former New York Times reporter Barry Meier, whose book about Oxy-Contin is the main basis for the Netflix drama \"Painkiller,\" acknowledges that the drug is \"valuable for treating severe pain caused by cancer or chronic health issues.\" The problem, he says, was that OxyContin's manufacturer, Purdue Pharma, \"could only make billions from it by lying, by saying it was good for everyday, common pain.\" Netflix's six-part miniseries highlights that second point, vividly portraying Purdue Pharma's reckless marketing of OxyContin. But it dismisses the caveat: that there are legitimate medical uses for this drug and other prescription opioids, which can make life bearable for patients who otherwise would suffer from excruciating pain.Like the 2022 Hulu drama \"Dopesick,\" \"Painkiller\" embraces an indiscriminate aversion to opioids. The same attitude has inspired ham-handed restrictions on pain medication, which have helped drive drug-related deaths to record levels while leaving millions of patients to suffer needlessly.Although Meier's take on opioids is more nuanced than the one presented by this adaptation of his book, he shares with the screenwriters a desire to pin a complex, long-running social problem on a single villain. That much is clear from the subtitle of his book: \"An Empire of Deceit and the Origin of America's Opioid Epidemic.\" As Meier's former employer frequently puts it, OxyContin is \"widely blamed\" for \"igniting the opioid crisis.\" But is it rightly blamed?OxyContin, which was introduced in 1996, is an extended-release version of oxycodone, a semisynthetic opioid that had long been available in products such as Percocet and Percodan. Oxy-Contin contained a larger dose of oxycodone, which was supposed to be gradually released over a 12-hour period, such that a patient could obtain steady pain relief by taking two pills a day.That safeguard, according to labeling approved by the Food and Drug Administration, was \"believed\" to reduce the drug's abuse potential. As it turned out, the original design could be readily defeated by crushing the tablets and snorting the powder.According to federal survey data, however, nonmedical use of prescription pain relievers rose for 11 consecutive years before OxyContin was introduced.And regardless of how appealing it may have been to drug users, OxyContin never accounted for a large share of the opioid analgesic market.During litigation, Purdue presented data indicating that OxyContin accounted for just 3.3% of pain pills sold in the United States from 2006 through 2012. After adjusting for potency, ProPublica calculated that the product's \"real\" market share was more like 16%.OxyContin likewise accounted for a relatively small share of nonmedical use: about 17% in 2009, the year before it was reformulated. It is hard to reconcile these numbers with the idea that OxyContin was \"the origin of America's opioid epidemic.\" If \"Painkiller\" merely exaggerated the impact of one product, we might chalk it up to dramatic license. But because this product is not qualitatively different from other opioid analgesics, \"Painkiller\"'s indictment of OxyContin amounts to an indictment of the whole drug category.The episodes are introduced by grieving parents who tell true stories about deadly addictions, some of which involved patients who received Oxy-Contin prescriptions. But such outcomes are far from typical.Among patients who use opioids for chronic pain, according to a 2016 research review in The New England Journal of Medicine, \"rates of carefully diagnosed addiction\" averaged less than 8%. The authors concluded that \"addiction occurs in only a small percentage of persons who are exposed to opioids - even among those with preexisting vulnerabilities.\" In 2021, a California judge who examined the relevant evidence likewise estimated that the addiction rate is \"less than 5%.\" \"Painkiller\" aims to stoke outrage at clueless doctors who carelessly prescribed Oxy-Contin because they believed Purdue's hype. Yet the misconceptions it reinforces have resulted in a different sort of outrage, reflected in the headline above a recent New York Times video: \"They Live in Constant Pain, but Their Doctors Won't Help Them.\" COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Most other countries already ban TV Pharma advertising. Why not us?The fact or truth is that Americans often pay 200% to 300% more than most other countries for the same drugs. If Pharma needs the profits for investments why not charge other countries what we are paying hereftIt's a fake argument.Americans, in fact, are paying for the rest of the world's lower prices. Why?Because our elected officials don't have the guts to take on the bluff from Big Pharma.If American Pharma truly cared, even a little bit, about \"Americans\" they would not be screwing us all by charging countries throughout Asia and Europe less than half what we have to pay here.Our government needs to grow a backbone and represent \"we the people\".Pharma is playing us all as dupes.

    "content": "Medical group squabble lands in courtroom - Hearing suspended on first day of testimony\n\n August 31, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: A4 | Section: News \n \n 812\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - After several hours of statements and limited testimony in an injunction hearing between the Shariff Medical Group and three of its now-former employees, court proceedings were abruptly suspended \"pending further discussions,\" attorneys said jointly.Monday's hearing, attended by several dozen residents and patients, stemmed from a widely discussed breach of contract complaint filed Wednesday, Aug. 16, in Dorchester County Circuit Court.The complaint asked a judge for a temporary restraining order and subsequent injunction to prevent the now-former employees of the Shariff Medical Group from further violating non-competition provisions of their employment agreements.According to the complaint, three of Dr. Mahmood Shariff's employees - physician assistant Brandon McMullen, nurse practitioner Peter Lerza and Dr. Mark Malkus, an internal medicine physician - secretly created the Sailwinds Medical Group, a competing medical practice located less than a mile and a half from Shariff's practice, in 2022.The three former employees, who were all under employment agreements with non-competition provisions, formed professional corporations for the new Sailwinds Medical Group late last year. McMullen began promoting the medical facility on social media last summer. And in June, the defendants solicited two other Shariff Medical Group employees to leave and join their new practice, the complaint said.News of the Sailwinds Medical Group reached Shariff in July after McMullen reportedly told Shariff's son and wife that he was setting up his own practice.Shortly after, Lerza told Shariff and another doctor that he and Malkus \"planned\" to join McMullen at Sailwinds Medical Group, claimed the three had a \"way around\" their non-competition agreements and that the three had spoken with several of Shariff's employees to solicit them for the new medical practice, according to the plaintiff's complaint.The complaint states that McMullen threatened to cause trouble for Shariff with regulatory authorities if Shariff enforced its rights under the non-competition provisions, prompting Shariff to take legal action. The defendants' employment with Shariff's practice was terminated after the complaint was filed.Further outcry came after Dorchester County Circuit Judge William H. Jones approved a temporary restraining order forbidding McMullen, Lerza and Malkus from engaging or participating with Sailwinds Medical Group or any entity providing similar medical services within a 40-mile radius of the Shariff Medical Group's office on Thursday, Aug. 17. The order prevents the defendants from further soliciting employees from Shariff's practice and contacting his current patients.The 40-mile radius imposed by the order is more restrictive than the geographic limitations imposed by McMullen and Lerza's non-competes.According to court documents, McMullen took to social media the same afternoon, posting that the \"entire office was fired abruptly\" and that \"patients are left hanging.\" The posting generated hundreds of comments and shares from concerned patients and residents.In Monday's injunction hearing, Arnold Weiner, an attorney for Shariff, called McMullen's social media postings a \"blatant misstatement\" that only caused panic.\"(The) emergency that was generated never really occurred,\" Weiner said, adding that new nurse practitioners and medical assistants have been hired to fill the gaps.Within the last week, more than two dozen patients signed affidavits in support of McMullen, Lerza and Malkus being able to continue practicing in the Cambridge area.Some also shared their own personal medical stories, all to highlight the \"significant and detrimental impact\" on patient care and the patients' ability to see the provider of their choosing, according to the documents.Cambridge Mayor Steve Rideout and Hurlock Mayor Rev. Charles Cephas filed affidavits speaking to the struggle of residents being able to find medical care in Cambridge and Dorchester County.In a memo, attorneys for the defendants argued that the non-compete provisions are unenforceable due to Sailwinds' planned mental health practice and other specialty offerings being dissimilar from Shariff's practice. Shariff also repeatedly breached the terms of his agreements with the defendants, attorneys alleged.Ultimately, the case comes down to patient care, said Edmund O'Meally, an attorney for the defendants.\"This is a concern,\" he said, speaking on behalf of patients seeking treatment from their primary care providers.O'Meally called the geographic limitations imposed on McMullen, Lerza and Malkus \"inequitable,\" adding that few patients would be able to drive outside of the 40-mile radius specified in the temporary restraining order.Witness testimony was limited during Monday's hearing.Only Anirban Basu, an expert in health economics and Dorchester County economics, fully testified in support of the plaintiff's case.Basu warned of the risk of having two practices serving the same underserved population within Cambridge, pointing out that there may not be enough viability for either practice if the injunction wasn't granted.Shariff gave partial testimony in the afternoon before the court recessed for a 10-minute break that turned into an hour. Attorneys entered the courtroom again around 4 p.m., announcing that the proceedings were suspended.Further proceedings have not been scheduled. No answer was given as to when they will resume. \n \n Caption: STAFF PHOTO\n \nOne of the Shariff Medical Group's offices is located at 503 Byrn St. in Cambridge \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Local man shares story of Ukraine ambulance delivery\n\n September 1, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Detmer; mdetmer@chespub.com | Page: A5 | Section: News \n \n 574\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - A St. Michaels man recently shared stories from his experience delivering a donated ambulance in Ukraine with the Tidewater Rotary Club in Easton.Terry Mangan talked to the Rotarians at Brookletts Place on Thursday, Aug. 31, about his experience with U.K. based humanitarian group, Medical Life Lines Ukraine.Mangan also shared a news segment about the ambulance delivery convoy that aired on the Aug. 12 edition of CBS Saturday Morning.Medical Life Lines Ukraine has delivered 33 ambulances to the war-torn country, including the four that were part of the delivery to Lviv that Mangan took part in with a long-time friend he met in college, Phill Fletcher.Fletcher and Mangan raised more than $20,000 to facilitate the trip from England to Lviv that was the equivalent of driving from Maryland to Nebraska, and the donation of the ambulances.Mangan described the journey of arriving in England and picking up the vehicles, traveling across Europe as a convoy and then entering Ukraine and passing through the embattled country.\"It still doesn't quite seem real,\" Mangan said of the experience and of the attention it garnered via the TV news segment about the volunteers ferrying the desperately needed vehicles.\"You could just see the weariness and the tension on people's faces,\" Mangan said, telling the gathering it was reminiscent of what he saw when he was in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001.\"It was the same look on people's faces. You didn't know what had just happened, what's going to happen,\" he said. \"I saw that look.\" Despite the underlying tension, Mangan observed the people going through their normal activities, even in light of physical damage and potential for risk that pervaded the area.Mangan said that while the volunteers felt relatively safe in Ukraine, he was relieved to get back to Poland, shielded from an errant missile strike or other attack by deterrence of Poland's NATO membership.After having delivered the ambulances, the driver's phone received a nationwide missile alert. Mangan said because they were in a more rural area he did not feel particularly unsafe, yet the underlying tension was still present.In the western portion of the country where the volunteers traveled, there was some military presence and military vehicle traffic, as well as checkpoints with steel antitank obstacles that were not actively operating at the time.\"There was a lot of truck activity,\" Mangan said, although he didn't have any insight about the cargo. \"You didn't want to look under any tarps.\" Mangan, who retired from the banking industry, volunteers locally with CASA. He said he welcomed the opportunity to take part in the ambulance delivery mission. \n \n Caption: PHOTO CO URTESY OF TERRY MA NGAN\n \nPhill Fletcher and Terry Mangan pose with \"Ambulance No. 2\" as they prepare to leave their hotel in Przemysl, Poland, for the nearby border crossing point to Ukraine on the morning of Tuesday, July 25.\n \nPHOTO CO URTESY OF TERRY MA NGAN\n \nAll eight ambulance drivers participating in the convoy prepare to enter the Channel Tunnel from Folkestone, England, to Calais, France, at about 7 a.m. on Sunday, July 23.

    "content": "Popular CoQ10 Pills Leave Millions Suffering - Could this newly-discovered brain fuel solve America's worsening memory crisis?\n\n September 6, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A12 | Section: News \n \n 1016\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Millions of Americans take the supplement known as CoQ10. It's the coenzyme that supercharges the \"energy factories\" in your cells known as mitochondria. But there's a serious flaw that's leaving millions unsatisfied.As you age, your mitochondria break down and fail to produce energy. In a revealing study, a team of researchers showed that 95 percent of the mitochondria in a 90-year-old man were damaged, compared to almost no damage in the mitochondria of a 5-year-old.Taking CoQ10 alone is not enough to solve this problem. Because as powerful as CoQ10 is, there's one critical thing it fails to do: it can't create new mitochondria to replace the ones you lost.And that's bad news for Americans all over the country. The loss of cellular energy is a problem for the memory concerns people face as they get older.\"We had no way of replacing lost mitochondria until a recent discovery changed everything,\" says Dr. Al Sears, founder and medical director of the Sears Institute for Anti-Aging Medicine in Palm Beach, Florida. \"Researchers discovered the only nutrient known to modern science that has the power to trigger the growth of new mitochondria.\" Why Taking CoQ10 is Not EnoughDr. Sears explains, \"This new discovery is so powerful, it can multiply your mitochondria by 55 percent in just a few weeks. That's the equivalent of restoring decades of lost brain power.\" This exciting nutrient - called PQQ (pyrroloquinoline quinone) - is the driving force behind a revolution in aging. When paired with CoQ10, this dynamic duo has the power to reverse the age-related memory losses you may have thought were beyond your control.Dr. Sears pioneered a new formula - called Ultra Accel II - that combines both CoQ10 and PQQ to support maximum cellular energy and the normal growth of new mitochondria. Ultra Accel II is the first of its kind to address both problems and is already creating huge demand.Over 47 million doses have been shipped to men and women across the country and sales continue to climb for this much sought-after brain fuel. In fact, demand has been so overwhelming that inventories repeatedly sell out. But a closer look at Ultra Accel II reveals there are good reasons why sales are booming.Science Confirms the Many Benefits of PQQThe medical journal Biochemical Pharmacology reports that PQQ is up to 5,000 times more efficient in sustaining energy production than common antioxidants. With the ability to keep every cell in your body operating at full strength, Ultra Accel II delivers more than just added brain power and a faster memory.People feel more energetic, more alert, and don't need naps in the afternoon. The boost in cellular energy generates more power to your heart, lungs, muscles, and more.\"With the PQQ in Ultra Accel, I have energy I never thought possible at my age,\" says Colleen R., one of Dr. Sears's patients. \"I'm in my 70s but feel 40 again. I think clearly, move with real energy and sleep like a baby.\" The response has been overwhelmingly positive, and Dr. Sears receives countless emails from his patients and readers. \"My patients tell me they feel better than they have in years. This is ideal for people who are feeling old and run down, or for those who feel more forgetful. It surprises many that you can add healthy and productive years to your life simply by taking Ultra Accel II every day.\" You may have seen Dr. Sears on television or read one of his 12 best-selling books. Or you may have seen him speak at the 2016 WPBF 25 Health and Wellness Festival in South Florida, featuring Dr. Oz and special guest Suzanne Somers.Thousands of people attended Dr. Sears's lecture on anti-aging breakthroughs and waited in line for hours during his book signing at the event.Will Ultra Accel II Multiply Your Energy?Ultra Accel II is turning everything we thought we knew about youthful energy on its head.Especially for people over age 50. In less than 30 seconds every morning, you can harness the power of this breakthrough discovery to restore peak energy and your \"spark for life.\" So, if you've noticed less energy as you've gotten older, and you want an easy way to reclaim your youthful edge, this new opportunity will feel like blessed relief.The secret is the \"energy multiplying\" molecule that activates a dormant gene in your body that declines with age, which then instructs your cells to pump out fresh energy from the inside-out. This growth of new \"energy factories\" in your cells is called mitochondrial biogenesis.Instead of falling victim to that afternoon slump, you enjoy sharp-as-a-tack focus, memory, and concentration from sunup to sundown. And you get more done in a day than most do in a week. Regardless of how exhausting the world is now.Dr. Sears reports, \"The most rewarding aspect of practicing medicine is watching my patients get the joy back in their lives. Ultra Accel II sends a wake-up call to every cell in their bodies And they actually feel young again.\" And his patients agree. \"I noticed a difference within a few days,\" says Jerry from Ft. Pierce, Florida. \"My endurance has almost doubled, and I feel it mentally, too. There's a clarity and sense of well-being in my life that I've never experienced before.\" How To Get Ultra Accel IIThis is the official nationwide release of Ultra Accel II in the United States. And so, the company is offering a special discount supply to anyone who calls during the official launch.An Order Hotline has been set up for local readers to call. This gives everyone an equal chance to try Ultra Accel II. And your order is backed up by a no-hassle, 90-day money back guarantee. No questions asked.All you have to do is call TOLL FREE 1-800-336-2168 right now and use promo code NP823UA45 to secure your own supply.Important: Due to Ultra Accel II recent media exposure, phone lines are often busy. If you call and do not immediately get through, please be patient and call back. \n \n Caption: MEMORY-BUILDING SENSATION: Top doctors are now recommending new Ultra Accel II because it restores decades of lost brain power without a doctor's visit. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Miller launches overdose action\n\n September 7, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A5 | Section: News \n \n 426\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - Lt. Gov.Aruna Miller joined Special Secretary of Opioid Response Emily Keller, and local officials in Cambridge for the first of Maryland's Overdose Action Town Hall Series.During the event, Miller and administration officials heard directly from community members, who shared their ideas and insight on how the state can better address the overdose crisis.\"Overdose can impact any community - it doesn't discriminate by race, place, or socioeconomic status,\" Miller said. \"That's why the first step to finding comprehensive solutions to the substance use crisis begins by hearing directly from community members on what their specific needs are. Gov. Moore and I are dedicated to creating a seat at the table for everyone to come together to find pathways to recovery that truly leave no Marylander behind.\" The Opioid Operational Command Center recently announced the town hall series, through which Special Secretary Keller and OOCC staff will visit each of Maryland's 24 local jurisdictions.The tour is intended to give individuals an opportunity to speak about how the overdose crisis has impacted their communities and to discuss what more is needed to reduce overdose deaths across the state.\"It's going to take all of us working together to continue making progress in this fight,\" Keller said. \"From collaboration between state and local agencies to partnerships with community organizations, we all have a part to play. And that starts by listening to communities all across the state that have been affected by overdose, because we cannot do this work without them. Everyone's voice matters.\" The OOCC is beginning the town hall series with seven additional events scheduled for September, which is recognized as National Recovery Month for substance use disorders. For more details about the series and a list of upcoming events, visit Before-ItsTooLate.Maryland.gov/townhalls.According a statement released about the series, the Moore-Miller Administration is committed to holistically addressing the substance use epidemic and expanding access to care for individuals with substance use disorders, including through providing a 39 percent increase in support for substance use disorder services in the fiscal year 2024 budget. \n \n Caption: JOE ANDRUCYK/OFFICE OF THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR\n \nPictured l-r: Michael Coury, Cassandra Hershberger, Lt.

    "content": "Limits on how much a drug should cost\n\n September 8, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Susan Estrich | Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 602\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. government last week released the list of the 10 medications that will be the first to be the subject of the new price negotiations under the Medicare reform bill, and my arthritis drug, Enbrel, made the list.To make the cut, you either had to be taken by millions of people, like Eliquis, or cost a fortune. Enbrel costs a fortune.I'm one of 47,000 Medicare recipients lucky enough to receive a drug that my old rheumatologist, who originally prescribed it for me, described as a miracle.When he was a young doctor, he told me, his waiting room of patients with rheumatoid arthritis was full of crippled people. With the advent of \"biologic\" drugs like Enbrel, the crutches and wheelchairs are gone. I count myself very lucky to be mostly symptom-free, which, with RA, is saying a lot. As I say, I'm lucky and blessed. And well-insured.And able to cover the out-ofpocket costs. Which are also substantial.This is the hard part of medical miracles.One month, when I was switching insurance companies, I ran out of Enbrel. I made the mistake of thinking I could actually pay for my weekly shot out-of-pocket if I couldn't get the insurance situation straightened out. \"How much would it be?\" I naively asked the pharmacist. Enbrel is a SureClick pen; it comes in a pack of four. That would be $1,700 for one pen and $7,000 for the pack.Excuse me? Who can afford that?I managed to get a sample from the doctor's office to tide me over and never asked again. Every month when the specialty pharmacy calls me to renew my Medicare prescription, they confirm my $350 co-pay and I don't so much as murmur a word of complaint, because what can I say? The drug saves my life. But I'm lucky I can afford it. That's why Enbrel belongs on the list.Medicines like Enbrel cost billions to develop, and it is only fair that those costs be recouped. But there are limits, and there is no reason that the market should be foreclosed from working freely when it comes to the prices for these prescription drugs. Enbrel costs too much, but there is nothing that I, one consumer, can do about it. We need to stand together, which is to say, we need government to stand up for us and negotiate for us and give voice to our needs.What is stunning about these negotiations is that it took an act of Congress to authorize the government to use the power of the people on behalf of the people to negotiate fair drug prices.The power of the pharmaceutical industry was so great, so much greater than the power of the American people, that it was literally the law of the land that Medicare could not use its bargaining power on behalf of the American taxpayer.When the bill allowing price negotiation passed last year, the Congressional Budget Office predicted the program would save Medicare more than $100 billion during the next 10 years.Just stop and consider that for a moment: the biggest purchaser of health services unable to use its bargaining power, on behalf of you and I, leaving the industry's power to set prices unchecked. And yet this is precisely what government is for, precisely what government is meant to do, to stand up for and give voice to we the people. The pharmaceutical industry continues to fight against negotiations in the courts. \"Today is the start of a new deal for patients where Big Pharma doesn't just get a blank check at your expense and the expense of the American people,\" President Joe Biden said in announcing the list.It's about time.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Greater impact in Guatemala - 'Mission is a part of our DNA,' pastor says\n\n September 8, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 944\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n GREENSBORO - According to Pastor Doug Morley, it all started with an October 2022 visit from Pastor Luis Martinez, founder of Impacto Ministry in San Juan la Laguna, near the Pacific coast of Guatemala.\"Several from Greater Impact were moved to action as they caught Pastor Martinez's vision for the indigenous people of this beautiful country,\" Pastor Morley said. Greater Impact, located in Greensboro, is a Wesleyan church in the Chesapeake District.Nine months later, he and four members of his congregation were flying down to the Central American country.Impacto Ministry is headquartered in the town of about 10,000 on the shores of the volcanic Lake Atitlan. The rugged terrain that surrounds the lake is home to several Mayan villages served by the ministry.The Greensboro team joined another team of five from La Plata, Maryland, led by Dr. Mike Patterson for the eight-day medical mission trip from July 8 to 15.Accompanying Pastor Morley on their first mission trip were his sons Andrew and Ryan, and Greater Impact members Maria Reichart of Greensboro and Barbie Semans of Barclay.Seeing his sons and parishioners \"really engage with people and see the world from a different perspective,\" was his \"greatest joy,\" Pastor Morley said.\"They say in South America that people are more important than programs.The face that you're looking at is more important than the face of a clock,\" he said. \"And so it has caused us to slow down and to really see others from a different perspective, but also to see our lives from a different perspective.So that was very, very helpful.\" \"Obviously you're ministering in the name of Jesus Christ, so when we share our love with those around us, we're hoping that they experiences his love as well. That's part of our goal,\" he said.Though no one from the church had medical experience, they were quick learners as they set up a pop-up pharmacy and distributed medicines as prescribed by two doctors certified by the Guatemalan government.Reichart and Ryan Morley took the lead at the pharmacy table while Semans distributed reading glasses and Drew Morley handed out toothpaste and toothbrushes. \"Even when we weren't busy with the clinic it was apparent that our presence in the villages was impactful,\" Drew Morley said.Besides experiencing the local culture, the team felt an earthquake and witnessed volcanic activity from nearby Mt. Fuego.Pastor Morley helped where needed and had the opportunity to pray with many of the more than 300 patients who were seen at the various medical clinics.Many of the supplies handed out at the clinics, which also included including vitamins, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, anti-fungal creams, were provided by local community partners.To help with the cost of travel, donations were given and fundraisers were held by Choptank Recovery, Tenchi Restaurant, Shore United Bank and the staff of Greensboro Elementary School.Pastor Morley had served as the mission director for the Chesapeake District of the Wesleyan Church for several years, and had been a part of several mission trips to Guatemala and the Dominican Republic in the 1990s. His wife Karen accompanied him on several of those missions and served on a trip to Albania.\"Mission is a part of our DNA,\" Pastor Morley said. \"We just find great joy in being able to serve others, to use our gifts and abilities to help those people who perhaps could use a helping hand to lift them up.\" Something Martinez said during morning devotions stayed with Ryan Morley. \"'There is no culture better than another. Each culture has their own richness and uniqueness that makes them incomparable to any other culture.' I got to see this firsthand,\" he said.\"Something that we all came back with is how impatient we are here in the United States,\" Pastor Morley said. \"If things don't go smoothly, if things don't go our way, if the computer is slow, if the light is red too long, we kind of get irritated and anxious too quickly. There, it's a different pace altogether.\" Following this trip, Greater Impact collected over $700 worth of vitamins (which are five times more expensive in Guatemala, according to Pastor Morley) that were delivered by another medical mission to Impacto Ministry in August.A return trip is already in the planning stages because \"everyone on the team was deeply moved by the experience,\" Pastor Morley said.\"I am determined to go back,\" Reichart said. \"I would love to one day to lead another team from Greater Impact to head back there.\" The mission of Greater Impact is to \"impact Caroline County and beyond with the love of Christ for eternal gain.\" For more information, visit www.greaterimpactmd.com.Besides planting churches and hosting medical clinics, Impacto Ministry also provides this region with an after-school program that feeds and cares for malnourished children, ministry to seniors who are alone or neglected, an annual evangelistic youth camp, sports clinics, construction projects and training for pastors and leaders. The ministry also provides sewing machines and lessons to help participants and their families rise out of poverty.To learn more about serving with or contributing to the mission of Impacto Ministry, visit www.impactoministry.com. \n \n Caption: COURTESY GREATER IMPACT\n \nThe entire Maryland medical mission team stayed at Impacto Ministry's compound in San Juan la Laguna, Guatemala.

Hospitalizations have been increasing since late summer, though the latest data indicate infections may be starting to level off, particularly in the South.Still, experts worry that immunity from previous vaccinations and infections is fading in many people, and a new shot would save many lives.According to a survey last month that CDC cited, about 42% said they would definitely or probably get the new vaccine. Yet only about 20% of adults got an updated booster when it was offered a year ago.Doctors hope enough people get vaccinated to help avert another \"tripledemic\" like last year when hospitals were overwhelmed with an early flu season, an onslaught of RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, and yet another winter coronavirus surge. \n \n Caption: PFIZER\n \nThis photo provided by Pfizer in September 2023 shows single-dose vials of the company's updated CO VID vaccine for adults. U.S. regulators have approved updated CO VID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, shots aimed at revving up protection this fall and winter. The Food and Drug Administration's decision Monday, Sept. 11, 2023 is part of a shift to treat fall CO VID-19 vaccine updates much like getting a yearly flu shot. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "RSV risks, prevention: What you need to know\n\n September 14, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 13 | Section: News \n \n 526\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Centers for Disease Control have issued a health advisory alerting medical providers of an increase in cases of respiratory syncytial virus, more commonly known as RSV. Every year, more than 1,500 Marylanders are hospitalized with RSV infections.RSV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms.Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be serious.Infants and older adults are more likely to develop severe RSV and need hospitalization.The virus can worsen certain medical conditions, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure.The following are the latest recommendations regarding RSV vaccine and prevention.ADULTSTwo RSV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Each vaccine requires a single dose injection.All adults aged 60 and over should discuss the RSV vaccine with their health care provider. This is especially true if you are at increased risk for severe complications from RSV, based on any of the following health conditions: asthma, COPD, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, neurologic conditions, kidney disorders, liver disorders, bleeding disorders or have a compromised immune system. Other factors that may increase your risk are frailty, advanced age, or residency in a nursing home or long-term care setting.One of the available vaccines has also been approved for pregnant individuals between 32-and 36-weeks gestational age in pregnancy.If you are pregnant, discuss the RSV vaccine with your OB/GYN.The RSV vaccines are available through primary care offices and some pharmacies.INFANTSRSV is especially dangerous to infants. The CDC recommends certain infants receive the FDA-approved monoclonal antibody product Beyfortus (also called nirsevimab). Beyfortus has been shown to reduce the risk of both RSV-related hospitalizations and RSV-related health care visits in infants by about 80%.One dose of Beyforuts is recommended for all infants younger than 8 months, born during - or entering - their first RSV season (typically fall through spring). For a small group of children between the ages of eight and 19 months who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease, such as children who are severely immunocompromised, a dose is recommended in their second RSV season.Parents of infants who meet the above criteria should discuss the RSV monoclonal antibody product with their child's pediatrician.PREVENTION You can help prevent the spread of RSV by taking the same precautions used to prevent other respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19:· Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow - not your hands.· Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.· Avoid close contact with people who are sick, such as kissing, shaking hands and sharing cups and eating utensils.· Stay home if you are sick and, if you have to go out in public, wear a face mask.· Avoid touching your face, particularly your eyes, nose and mouth.· Clean frequently touched surfaces, such as doorknobs and mobile devices.· Get vaccinated if recommended by your healthcare provider.· If you have an infant, avoid crowds, ask people to wash their hands before touching the baby and keep the baby away from anyone with cold symptoms, including siblings and other parents or caretakers. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Will | Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 758\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - COVID-19 was not this nation's first or worst pandemic. There probably will be worse. How much worse might depend on the caliber of public health leaders. There is room for improvement.Approximately 1,200 presidential appointees require Senate confirmation. A crucial one does not, until 2025.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) has introduced legislation to require immediate confirmation of the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mandy Cohen.Herewith, some questions for her: The Great Barrington Declaration was issued in October 2020 by eminent epidemiologists and public health policy specialists who dissented from federally encouraged and mandated pandemic mitigation strategies - commercial lockdowns, school closures, masking toddlers, etc.The GBD's authors - Jayanta Bhattacharya (Stanford), Sunetra Gupta (Oxford) and Martin Kulldorff (Harvard) - favored targeting protection for the most vulnerable: the elderly and others with comorbidities.Children were the least vulnerable.This might have saved the $6 trillion the government spent to resuscitate the economy after the government suffocated it. And might have prevented a generation's learning loss. Was not the GBD correct?Anthony S. Fauci, the government's top infectious-disease specialist, and Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health, tried to orchestrate what Collins called a \"takedown\" of the GBD, which Collins denigrated as the opinion of \"fringe\" scientists.(Bhattacharya alone had more than 100 peer-reviewed articles.)Will your CDC be more receptive to heterodoxy?In March 2020, Fauci said, \"There's no reason to be walking around with a mask.\" Soon, however, masks were mandated. Do such malleable certitudes contribute to what Fauci calls the \"smoldering anti-science feeling\"?Under your predecessor, the CDC proclaimed - until the Supreme Court said there was no legal basis for this - a national housing policy: an eviction moratorium.Will your CDC have less imperial pretensions?In January 2020, at the pandemic's outset, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said the coronavirus could have leaked from the Wuhan lab that \"works with the world's most deadly pathogens.\" This possibility was promptly denounced as \"fringe\" and a \"conspiracy theory.\" A March 17, 2020, paper published in Nature Medicine journal discounted \"any type of laboratory-based scenario\" for the coronavirus's origin. A month later, however, one of the paper's authors said in a private email that we \"can't fully rule out engineering\" - the possibility that the virus not only leaked from the Wuhan lab but was created there. Today, the FBI strongly suspects the virus had a research-related origin.How do you propose to insulate the CDC from government-promoted orthodoxies voiced by government-financed scientists?\"Gain of function\" research involves engineering especially transmissible and/or deadly viruses to understand future pandemics and develop vaccines.Fauci has denied funding such research at Wuhan. But John Ratcliffe, former director of national intelligence, called Fauci's disavowal of funding \"inconsistent\" with some intelligence and said \"a lab leak is the only explanation credibly supported by our intelligence, by science and by common sense.\" Do Americans perhaps have too much confidence in government's handling of science?The New York Times reports that during the pandemic, CDC officials \"held 'weekly sync' meetings with Facebook, once emailing the company 16 'misinformation' posts.\" A federal appeals court has held that the CDC, among other government institutions, probably violated the First Amendment with \"intimidating\" communications to get social media companies to remove lawful content concerning pandemic policies. The court held that government cannot pressure social media to do something the government itself cannot constitutionally do: censor speech. Should the CDC apologize and embrace legality?About four months ago, Fauci challenged the New York Times to \"show me a school that I shut down and show me a factory that I shut down.\" But in October 2020, Fauci, who once described lockdowns as merely \"inconvenient,\" said, \"I recommended to the president that we shut the country down.\" He now says his recommendations merely \"echoed the CDC's.\" Is this a modified Nuremberg defense - I was only obeying other peopleftDuring the pandemic, as North Carolina's chief public health official, you were enthusiastic about lockdowns, and issued a \"secretarial directive\" telling people, inter alia, to \"wear a mask at all times\" outside the home, \"do not enter any indoor public space where anyone isn't masked\" and to \"remain at home between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.\" And you sometimes wore a mask featuring Fauci's picture. Any second thoughts about your enthusiasms?If Congress has curiosity about these life-or-death matters, it will pass Cruz's legislation. Then summon Mandy Cohen. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, talks with President Donald Trump during a tour of the Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory at the National Institutes of Health, March 3, 2020, in Bethesda \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You never know what someone is going through. And if we all take the time to reach out to listen and connect people to resources, we can definitely help save lives.\" Acknowledging Commission Vice President Larry Porter's frequently saying \"It's okay not to be okay,\" Commissioner Frank Bartz said, \"That's pretty much it.\" \"We need to be aware of who's around us and pick up on what's going on in our lives and sometimes just just talk to somebody and make them feel like they're important,\" Bartz said.To read the proclamation, visit the Commission's website at www.carolinemd.org and click on meeting agendas.

As of today, no comments have been posted, and the certificate application is now ready for the commission's review and anticipated approval in the coming months.Docketing of the application not only keeps the project moving forward as is required by the commission's procedural regulations but allows the commission to gather any supplemental information needed to render a decision.\"There are multiple phases in the certificate of need process.If there were interested parties, there could have been a delay. There were zero interested parties in the 30 days so we are on track with our timeline,\" Easton Town Council President Frank Gunsallus said. \"We need this hospital, so this is good news. Getting a state of the art medical facility is huge.Once certificate of need gets to a point, they can go and fundraise the capital.\" \"The commission has all the information needed to assess the project's viability, including anticipated sources of funds supporting the project, the status of state funding commitments, and plans for obtaining additional state funding,\" said Ken Kozel, University of Maryland Shore Regional Health president and CEO. \"We anticipate that state and local funding, and our capital campaign will gain significant funding once the CON approval is received.\" The projected cost of the new Shore Regional Medical Center is $550 million.\"We anticipate receiving state and local funding, and we will be launching a capital campaign seeking private philanthropic support as well,\" Williamson said.The schematic design phase of the project, which has been completed, involved the participation of multiple departments in refining layout plans and creating new external renderings. The design development phase is now in progress, focusing on the design of individual rooms for optimal workflow.Plans to build the new Shore Regional Medical Center in Easton are critical to the comprehensive health care delivery plan for Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties. The new location on Route 50 at Longwoods Road will promote better access to care, the new design will accommodate advances in high-quality care and improve patient satisfaction, and the new facility will enhance UM Shore Regional Health's ability to recruit and retain health care providers and staff.The construction of a hospital has been a heavily discussed issue in the campaign for the town council president. Al Silverstein was so bullish on building the hospital that he thought we should be banging on the governor's door in Annapolis and the University of Maryland's door in Baltimore to get it done. The ultimate winner, Town Council President Frank Gunsallus, noted the lack of medical talent to fill the new hospital and spoke on creating incentives to attract new medical personnel. \n \n Caption: CONTRIBUTED\n \nUniversity of Maryland Shore Regional Health's new regional medical center proposed rendering following schematic design phase.

I love this stuff so much, I must admit to being slightly compulsive - gathering, testing and assessing techniques. Here are a few of my new favorites: BERRIESAre you familiar with that sick feeling that comes when you notice that the berries you bought yesterday are already showing signs of mold and turning brown? Here's the remedy: As soon as you bring them into the kitchen, prepare a mixture of one part vinegar (white or apple cider) and 10 parts water. Give the berries a bath in the mixture.Swirl them around a bit and then gently drain, rinse and place in the refrigerator.Don't worry. The solution is so weak, you will not taste the vinegar. This treatment should give your strawberries an additional two weeks of useful life and raspberries a week or more. Vinegar retards the growth of bacteria that causes berries to spoil so quickly.POTATOESTo keep potatoes from growing big ugly sprouts before you have time to use them up, store them with a couple of apples. For some reason, that really works to halt the sprouting.ALUMINUM FOILLet me just say that I'm a believer! It drives me crazy that I do not know why this works, but it certainly does: Wrap celery, broccoli and lettuce in a single layer of aluminum foil before storing in the refrigerator. Celery will stay crisp and fresh for up to a month stored this way. It's simply amazing.MUSHROOMSStore mushrooms in a paper bag. Now the air can circulate and the mushrooms will remain dry and lovely for weeks.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" \n \n Caption: MARY HUNT \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Less Stress Doc' Offers Tips For Relief In New Book\n\n September 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Annie Hasselgren; Special To The Bay Times Record Observer/Star Democrat | Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 648\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTER - Seeking happiness and lower stress levels can feel elusive in today's society. As technology advances at breakneck speed and social media demands more of our attention, feelings of inadequacy or discontent in one's life feel more like the rule than the exception. Local physician Dr. Gary Sprouse might just have the antidote, however.An internist on the Eastern Shore for 38 years, Sprouse's interest in lowering the stress levels of his patients began 25 years ago and recently culminated in his book, \"Highway to Your Happy Place: A Roadmap to Less Stress.\"Sprouse has helped to treat the stress of many patients in his office for decades and, upon deciding to retire this year, he set out on a quest to do the same for the general public. Dubbed \"The Less Stress Doc,\" Sprouse developed a framework for helping people apply some simple but profound principles to calming the stressors and anxieties of daily life, and has conducted in-depth research as to how the human brain works and why we are capable of reframing our perspectives.\"What is unique to humans, unlike other beings, is that we are able to envision the future,\" says Sprouse.\"We have language. We use tools. We have these incredible skills, and stressors are side effects to those skills.It is virtually impossible as a human to live for today without worrying, as we spend too much time thinking about the future. 'Don't worry, be happy!' is great advice if you live on an island in Jamaica, but not so much in Queen Anne's County.The premise [of the book] is how to keep the skill and lose the side effect.\"Sprouse helps patients accomplish this through working on what he believes are the essential ingredients of a low-stress life: contentment, happiness, the anticipation of happiness, gratitude, and fulfillment.Sprouse says to think of contentment as the baseline of how we feel each day, which is typically stable. Happiness is the intermittent change in that baseline that is informed by events or circumstances, but we usually return to our baseline quickly. The anticipation of happiness is critical so that we have something to look forward to.Sprouse identifies this lack in suicidal and Alzheimer's patients who are either unwilling or unable to consider that things can get better - an integral component of contentment. Gratitude is key so that we can appreciate what we do have and not pine for what we don't. Fulfillment involves growing as a person and allowing ourselves to be curious, to learn, and to grow.Some of the inhibiting factors to a low-stress, happy life, says Sprouse, are feelings of being overwhelmed, excessive worrying, guilt, and regret - and these are often not as easy as what meets the eye. Sprouse works with patients to identify the source of their stress and unhappiness and \"organize\" these issues into more manageable pieces.\"We can't remove worry from our lives. Worrying is a skill we use to envision the future, thinking of all the things that could happen, and using our skills to address them,\" says Sprouse.\"I advise my patients to practice realistic optimism: focus on the good things, but don't ignore the bad things that can happen. Worry itself isn't bad - it's doing too much of it that's the problem. I want you to worry efficiently.\"\"Highway to Your Happy Place\" offers tools to compartmentalize our worries into components that can make the \"what ifs\" of life more feel surmountable and less overwhelming.\"History can't be rewritten,\" says Sprouse. \"We can only change the future through our behavior. We can lessen our guilt, regret, and worry by modifying our behavior to bring about more positive results.\"Sprouse's book launched. at the Kent Island Volunteer Fire Department on Sept.10, an event which will also celebrated his birthday and retirement.

Whitsitt Center celebrated its 40th year with an alumni picnic.Hosted at the center, honored guests, professionals in the community and residents showed up, ate a meal together and shared memories.Also in attendance was Maryland Delegate Jay Jacobs, R-36, and a resident of Kent County. He presented a Maryland General Assembly official citation to the Whitsitt Center for their 40 years service.The Kent County House Delegation recognized the establishment, for providing in-patient residential substance treatment services for the Eastern Shore and the State of Maryland.Jacobs reminisced, saying back in 2009, when the state was thinking about closing the center, and he was mayor of Rock Hall, they held a 24 hour vigil to prevent its closing.Fortunately, the center did not shut down, he added, and since then, many people have been positively impacted.Jacobs expressed hope, looking toward the future. \"I think we'll see some things take place soon as far as infrastructure goes. The building's going to be restored to its real glory and be a real piece of a thread of the fabric of this county.\"As folks finished their meals, Director of the Kent County Health Department's A.F. Whitsitt Center, Carla Thorpe, talked about the rich history of the center, handing out awards.She produced a plaque dedicated to the staff who used to work there and had now moved on.Thorpe then recognized the first patient at the Whitsitt Center, the late Bill Walls, bringing his family up to applause.Thorpe pointed out, Walls was one of the first to do harm reduction, keeping sufferers of alcohol addiction from seizures or tremors before they got to treatment.In honor of him, they established the Whitsitt Wonder Impact award.\"It's for somebody who has been through the program and has given back to those who have been in recovery,\" Thorpe said.To her left, stood a painting of the founder, the late, A.F. Whitsitt When individuals come through the doors, they will see his picture on the wall, she announced. Thorpe asked his grandchildren, Clay Mitchell and Chris Mitchell, to say some words remembering their grandfather and present an award in his honor.\"Your grandfather was an advocate. His big thing was to work with those suffering from alcoholism,\" Thorpe said.His grandchildren had memories to share, speaking of his dedication.\"This thing wasn't popular when he was the health officer in the 40's, 50's or 60's, but he did it anyway because it was the right thing to do,\" Chris Mitchell said about his grandfather.Clayton Anderson Mitchell added, \"I feel like my grandfather never really died because the mission of this organization lives on through the great staff who work here.\"Thorpe moved on to recognize a friend of recovery in the founder's honor; someone who represented A.F. Whitsitt's values, presenting Executive Director of Mid Shore Behavioral Health, Katie Dilley, the A.F. Whitsitt award.Thorpe said, \"She's working with us to see what other supports she can bring to the region. For me, she's been a mentor, and when it comes down to it, it's about the people we serve, and keeping the services we need here on the shore.\"Mid Shore Behavioral Health covers five counties, Kent, Queen Anne's, Talbot, Caroline and Dorchester.Dilley said, \"It's a gift to be in this job and work hard for you. The hope and drive of everybody in this room is what it's all about. We're here to make sure we're on the right path, and we do not lose the resources that bring life, and strength back into our community.\"To cap the picnic off, there was a rousing testimony by Shiloh Blackburn, accompanied by his wife, Marian.Blackburn's one of the 25,000 the center's helped over the years, since 1983.Blackburn described his life in great detail, from addiction to recovery, and the men who helped him make that change.He told the audience he came to the center with a trash bag of his belongings. He said he was a manipulator, a chameleon, justifying his addictions, blaming his childhood.But at the center, he was confronted with people serious about beating addictions.In Church Hill, he said he got his first 24-hour chip, noting the late Bill Walls was there.But it was not a full recovery. He said that from 12-years-old onward there was a romance to using drugs and alcohol. It was that romance that he was addicted to.After he had been clean for a while, and things were going right again, he took back his will.He found himself back at the Whitsitt Center, where lead counsellor, the late Katrina Tolliver, spoke \"some great sense\" into him. Her advice to him was to keep his mouth shut.\"I was a guy who knew a lot,\" he said, indicating he was not yielding enough to learn.But something resounded within him this time. He began to listen and learn.Then another life changing event with his sponsor.He was sandpaper, Blackburn noted, and did not just simply say, call me everyday. The sponsor challenged him. First of his advice was to pray every night, a simple prayer, to stay sober one day at a time.\"For the first day in my life it was man in the mirror time,\" he said.One day, after months and months of praying, he said, that prayer was answered. It was immediate, not desiring.\"As I was walking to this job, a calmness that I never felt before, and the compulsion to want to drink and get high was totally gone. At that moment I knew it was God who took that from me because that's the only person I was asking every day.\"He tried to tell his roofer coworkers about it, but they didn't listen.It didn't matter however.He started becoming \"childlike,\" meaning willing to learn.He described working on himself like a \"surgery of the spirit.\"His sponsor told him it's time to forgive his mother. Not by his words, but with his actions. So he started doing chores for her, asking her what he could do, being a continual presence in her life.One day, he said, she asked him if she could attend a meeting. His mother, since last March, is now 15 years sober, he said.Blackburn now has a life he could have never dreamed. He's married his best friend, and he wanted to thank the men in his life who made him.Health Officer Bill Webb, who sees miracles like Blackburn's at the meetings, said the Whitsitt Center is available for anybody who needs the help. They have 44 beds, 12 beds of which are crisis beds, for opioids and stimulants. They also accept health insurance and offer adult care. \n \n Caption: WILL BONTRAGER\n \nAccepting the Whitsitt Wonders Impact award given posthumously to their father, William \"bill\" Walls, first resident, from left, beth Walls Selinger, adam Walls, director of the a.

Along the way they discover that being active together is a secret weapon for overcoming the summer blues.SNAP-Ed delivers multi-faceted interventions that support adoption of healthy behaviors by low-income audiences.\"Physical activity has emerged as a priority for SNAP-Ed, both nationally and in Maryland,\" Maryland SNAP-Ed Director Lisa Lachenmayr said in a news release. \"Among the many lasting effects of the pandemic, sedentary behaviors increased due to increased reliance on technology for school and education. While SNAP-Ed's interest in physical activity is as a tool for obesity and chronic disease prevention, our partners also recognize the power of movement to address critical concerns around social-emotional health.\" Physical activity is a current focus area for SNAP-Ed, due to well-documented impacts on chronic disease prevention. Supporting youth in developing a lifelong relationship with physical activity also benefits overall well-being.Books are being distributed to partnering schools, early childhood sites, out of school programs, Maryland WIC offices, SNAP Outreach community partners, low-income 4-H youth programs, and summer meals sites, allowing SNAP-Ed to deliver health promotion messages while supporting family literacy and summer learning.For more information or to read the book, go to https://extension.umd.edu/active-fun. \n \n Caption: Maryland SNAP-Ed has written a new original storybook promoting family physical activity and will donate 125,000 copies across the state. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "New cardiac monitors improve emergency aid\n\n October 2, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Will Bontrager | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 987\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WORTON - In an emergency sit uation, there's no time for equipment to go down. The efficiency of equipment is often the difference between life and death. Even two-seconds difference, Logan Quinn, chief of Emergency Medical Services for Kent County said, are precious to a patient' survivability.Quinn's been researching trends in the medical field, and pre-charging heart monitor machines before administering a rhythm check on a patient for example, is just one of the ways he found is more effective.The new cardiac monitor and defibrillators his staff now possess wil help with that, he added.Seven of them, were delivered this August, from Zoll, replacing the outdated models from their old company, Physio-Control.His crew of 14 paramedics and 12 EMT's, are now better equipped with these Zoll monitors. Each substation in Rock Hall and Galena, the county ambulance vehicle, the primary paramedic unit, and his own vehicle, now have them, he pointed out.Quinn's impressed by these machines, stating that they are top-of-the-line, which will lead to better training practices.Features, exclusive to the Zoll monitors, lend what Quinn calls, \"see-through CPR\" capabilities. He explained, when a person's in cardiac arrest, they place a CPR feedback puck on the center of the chest, then another on the side. When connected, and compressions are being given, that patient's vital information appears on the monitor's screen.The machine also informs the person administering the compressions. \"The monitor shows how deep you compress, how quickly, and really coaches the clinicians,\" he said.On the monitor's screen, Quinn noted, appears the rhythm of the CPR, the ups and downs, and even reports any changes during defibrillation.Quinn remarked there is also this kind of feedback provided via the bag valve mask sensor, which is connected to the monitor's computer. When they put an airway in a patient, Quinn said, there's a sensor attached to the airway that feeds information back to the monitor. Because of the high cost, they don't carry automatic ventilators, Quinn noted, but the monitor gives them closer control over ventilation required, allowing emerstion required, allowing emergency personnel to set the volume of air they need to administer.From there, the machine tells how many breaths-per-minute, how much volume is being given, and amazingly coaches when to squeeze the bag, with a flashing countdown sequence in the lower left-hand corner.Although they're still using the bags manually to ventilate patients, Quinn said, this helps tremendously, especially because each person's lung capacity's different.The monitors also assist providers treating traumatic brain injuries, provid-ing a trend of the patient's immediate vital signs. Quinn, said it reads how much oxygen is in the patient's blood, how much CO2 they're putting out, reports the blood pressure every five minutes, and takes little readings placing them on the graph, where they can confirm the patient's blood pressure is at a safe level.Quinn received these new monitors after going to the Kent County Commissioners with his request to change the previous contract with Physio-Control to Zoll.During the meeting in July, Quinn provided them a less than stellar review of the previous monitors. Side-by-side with Pete Landon, director of Emergency Services, Quinn gave the commissioners a glimpse of his frustrations with the older machines and his plan to replace them.Quinn said, since he took over as Chief in February, he had ordered two monitors, quickly realizing the shortage was a problem. He then used grant money provided by Maryland Emergency Services, and ordered another one, budgeted for FY24, but lamented that the company he had a contract with was inconsistent with their deliveries.Additionally, Physio-Control had other problems, Quinn added. They didn't upgrade their equipment for some time. He said if something broke inside of the machines, internally, like a chip or a motherboard issue, it didn't get repaired.He said they would be provided loaners, but the problem with those were they were different models - often not compatible with the ones they had.So Quinn, wanting to fix his budget, tired of the inconsistency, sought information from the competitors of these monitors, talking to the Zoll sales representative.He told the commissioners he definitely found something better.All new equipment.A package deal.\"They'll give us six new monitors up front then put us in a five-year payment plan, replacing all the monitors in our fleet,\" Quinn said.And, he added, no indeterminate date of delivery either.The contract with Zoll is an annual payment of $59,453 that runs from 2024 through 2028. And it's money well spent.Landon lauded Quinn's efforts, \"What he's come up with is a plan that not only will save money for the county in the long run, but also brings together the training and maintenance of the equipment while also being able to replace it in an accelerated fashion.\"Commissioner John Price saw it was imperative to move with speed in order to get the new contract signed and made a motion to approve. It was an unanimous decision in the yes column.From the commissioner's approval, to signing the contract, and getting the monitors was less than a month.Quinn, who has been with the Kent County Emergency services for nine years, starting out as a dispatcher, sees big possibilities ahead for the department he's now in charge of, at only 30 years of age.\"I'm very passionate about this system. It has a lot of potential. We're one of the smallest agencies on the Eastern Shore. That can be good or bad, but it gives us the opportunity to work together.\"He acknowledged the new machines, especially intricate ones, like Zoll, are an adjustment, but commended his crew dealing with the transition training.\"I'm proud of my staff. Change is hard, but they've been showing they're really committed to not only me, but supporting us as an agency to get better. This was just the first step.\" \n \n Caption: WILL BONTRAGER\n \nChief Logan Quinn shows the capabilities of one of the seven new cardiac monitors now being utilized by Kent County Emergency Services. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It can help keep your flowers looking fresh, purify water in emergencies and even lend a hand when you're cleaning up after a disaster.DETER MOSQUITOESWhile bleach may not be the first thing that comes to mind when dealing with mosquitoes, it can effectively deter them from reproducing in stagnant water. Add a small amount of bleach to a birdbath to eliminate mosquito larvae and safe-guard the water's quality. Just 1 tablespoon of bleach can protect up to 50 gallons of water, so use it sparingly. Avoid introducing bleach into natural water bodies and ponds to protect their delicate ecosystems.CUTTING BOARDMaintain a germ-free cut-ting board by rinsing it with a bleach-water mixture (1 teaspoon per gallon) and let-ting it air dry.DEODORIZERTo banish odors and germs from your trash bin, give it a rinse with a bleach-water combination.TOY SANITATION Children's toys can harbor germs. Combat this by soaking toys in a solution of 1 tablespoon of liquid bleach per gallon of water, followed by thorough rinsing.SNEAKER REVIVALBring the whiteness back to your white sneakers with a gentle scrub using a light bleach-water solution.PATIO FURNITURE Revitalize outdoor furniture by scrubbing it with a bleach-water mix (1/3 cup of bleach to 1 gallon of water). Ensure you do this away from plants you wish to protect.Chlorine bleach is an affordable and versatile cleaning agent. Use it wisely and safely to enjoy its bene-fits without any drawbacks.

    "content": "State sees surge in COVID-19 cases\n\n October 5, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Shifra Dayak; Capital News Service | Page: 14 | Section: News \n \n 840\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Maryland is seeing a surge in COVID cases that mirrors national trends - and experts say it might continue as the state heads into respiratory disease season and as some residents take lax approaches to preventive measures.The rate of reported COVID-19 cases in the state saw an uptick during September. Sept. 11 saw the highest recorded case rate in Maryland, with 6.64 cases per 100,000 people. Case rates have seen a gradual decline since then, but are still sitting above rates during the summer months.Before last month, the last time that case rates in the state were above five cases per 100,000 residents was in March.Data from the Maryland Department of Health shows that in September 2022, reported COVID-19 infection rates ranged from 12.08 to 17.06 cases per 100,000 residents. Case rates last month ranged from 4.54 to 6.64 cases per 100,000 people, meaning this year's numbers look better than last year's.But Kate McPhaul, an associate research professor in the University of Maryland's School of Public Health, said the prevalence of testing is lower now than earlier in the pandemic.Amid the September surge, President Joe Biden's administration announced last week that it is appropriating $600 million to companies that produce COVID-19 testing kits to boost the number of tests manufactured in the nation.The same day, the administration announced that all households in the country can request four free rapid-testing kits through covid. gov/tests. Free COVID-19 tests previously were available via mail from January 2022 until June of this year.McPhaul warned that despite a resurgence in testing options, current case numbers may not be entirely accurate because fewer people overall are testing and milder cases have likely not all been reported to the state.However, there's a general indication that there has been a surge in recent weeks, including through anecdotal evidence, she said.This fall surge indicates that COVID-19 could be showing signs of spiking seasonally, McPhaul said, but since it is still a relatively new virus, predicting its behavior is difficult.In line with the surge in cases, hospitalizations and deaths in Maryland have also increased between the start of summer and now, state health department data shows.These upticks will likely continue in the coming months, according to Kristen Coleman, an assistant professor in the University of Maryland's public health school.Coleman said that reinstating preventive measures like masking and air filtration in public spaces, classrooms and more could help keep the surge at bay.\"I expect that (cases) will continue to climb,\" Coleman said. \"This fall, because of the uptick, I do see more people masking, but certainly not as many as in the beginning of the pandemic.\" A poll by the business intelligence company Morning Consult in May showed that only 24% of all United States adults were \"very\" concerned about COVID-19. It's a number that's steadily declined since the start of the pandemic. In April 2020, comparatively, 65% of adults told Morning Consult they were \"very concerned.\" For McPhaul, this decline in concern is evident through a drop in people masking and seeking out the most recent booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.\"People want the pandemic to be over with and to me right now, it seems like there's a bit of a disconnect with the COVID rate going up. A lot of the behaviors that mitigate getting sick kind of don't seem to be happening,\" McPhaul said.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in mid-September approved an updated COVID-19 booster vaccine that targets newer variants that have been fueling a rise in cases. But this booster has not been widely administered, McPhaul said.Only 24% of Maryland's population has received an updated bivalent booster vaccine at all, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Additional tracking shows that few residents in the region and nationally have received the most recent booster dose.In addition to the case surge in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia also are seeing similar trends and similar attitudes when it comes to masking and vaccines.Between the beginning of August and mid-September, Virginia's Department of Health recorded an uptick in reported COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations for COVID-19. In all except four of Virginia's 139 counties and independent cities, fewer than 25% of residents have received all the CDC-recommended doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to data from the department.Numbers across the past month in Washington, D.C., align with national trends.The rate of weekly reported cases per 100,000 city residents saw a steady uptick from 11.7 cases on Aug. 19 to 33.6 cases on Sept. 9, according to DC Health.As cases may continue rising in the region, McPhaul encouraged area residents to think about preventive measures in their communities, including masking around high-risk individuals and getting vaccinated against respiratory diseases like COVID-19, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and the flu.\"I think people just need to get that person in their head that they're protecting,\" she said. \"All of that stuff that we were promoting during the pandemic can continue to be utilized in the prevention of all of the airborne infections.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS-Nine middle school students gained lifesaving skills Wednesday afternoon, thanks to a partnership between the St. Michaels Community Center, St. Michaels Youth & Law Enforcement (SMYLE), Talbot County Emergency Services and the Perkins Family YMCA.Talbot County paramedic Rachael Cox led the afterschool CPR and AED training class at the Y, guiding the young students through the steps to take in an emergency.The class was free for all who participated, thanks to a $200 donation from SMYLE, the St. Michaels Police Department's youth program, that covered certification costs for the students. The St. Michaels Community Center assisted in facilitating the program.Cox began her class by showing how to check if a person is responsive, then asked the students what they thought the next step was.The answer? Calling 911 and staying on the line with the dispatcher.The next step, as Cox demonstrated, is checking if the person is breathing. If not, it's time to start chest compressions, she said.Each student practiced chest compressions on practice manikins and learned how to use an AED before moving on to learning how to do CPR on infants.As a community risk reduction paramedic and CPR and AED coordinator for Talbot County, Cox loves teaching. She likes being able to introduce preteens and teenagers to CPR, first aid and AED skills to prepare them for any emergency situation, even if they're alone without adults present.\"I feel like we call EMS, police, fire and dispatch first responders, but I really don't believe we're first responders because we're not there when the emergency happens-the community is,\" she said. \"And that's why I feel these types of classes are so important.\"Amethyst Monroe, a Perkins Family YMCA staffer who supervised Wednesday's class, is continuing to coordinate other developing middle school programs. She's planning another CPR and AED session soon.Monroe's aim is to make sure future programs are lowcost and provide the area's youth with more life skills.Anyone who wishes to support future after-school programming at the Perkins Family YMCA can donate to the center's annual campaign or reach out to Tracy Eutsler, the Y's executive director, at teutsler@ymcachesapeake.org.Those who are interested in scheduling CPR and AED classes can contact Rachael Cox at rcox@talbotdes.org. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTalbot County paramedic Rachael Cox demonstrates how to use AED chest pads on a practice manikin.\n \nNATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTwo young girls team up to save the life of their practice manikin.

My neighbor, a gentleman in his 50s, saw me smoking a cigarette the other day and decided to take it upon himself to lecture me on the dangers of smoking.Although I appreciated his concern, his lecture was unwelcome. I intend to quit smoking at some point, but I don't need my neighbor to intervene. I fear that the next time I bump into him, he will give me another lecture. What can I do to make him understand that his unsolicited advice is not helping? I'm a grown adult, and I don't need lectures. - Good IntentionsDEAR GOOD INTENTIONS: As you know, your neighbor expressed his concerns out of genuine care for you. Remember that when you speak to him. It is your right to do whatever you want with your life and your body. Provided that the cigarette smoke is not contaminating your neighbors' air, you should be able to smoke in peace.That said, it is likely that this man will either say something or scowl at you the next time he sees a cigarette in your hand. Can you say something?Yes, but be careful. You can thank him for his concern, but put up a guardrail. Tell him you know what you are doing. When you decide to quit, you will. Politely ask him to refrain from giving you advice on this topic in the future.Harriette Cole is a lifestylist andfounder of Dream Leapers, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

    "date": "2023-10-09",
    "author": "Mike Sunnucks; Apg Newspapers",
    "content": "Critical Condition? - Nursing home industry, group of senators push against Biden's bid to require more nursing staff at facilities\n\n October 9, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; Apg Newspapers | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1488\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The nursing home and assisted living industries - along with a number of federal lawmakers - are pushing against a Biden administration plan to require more staffing at facilities including having registered nurses be on-site 24/7.Last month, the White House unveiled details of new rules and regulations on nursing homes - which receive $100 billion annually in Medicare, Medicaid and other U.S. government payments.A centerpiece of the push (and industry opposition to it) centers on federally mandated staffing of registered nurses and nursing aides.\"If finalized, the proposal would require every facility to have a registered nurse on site 24/7, to have a certain minimum number of registered nurses and nurse aides to help provide routine care, and to staff according to resident needs based on a robust assessment of the facility's residents,\" the Biden administration said in its September proposal.The rule would apply to approximately 15,000 nursing homes with 1.2 million patients/residents nationwide.The Democratic administration is also promising increased oversight of long-term care facilities spending of Medicare and Medicaid as well as \"inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications.\" The White House is also concerned about private equity firms buying up nursing homes and assisted living centers and subsequent impacts on care.The push would also have facilities provide at least 33 minutes of care to patients from a registered nurse and just under 2.5 hours of care from nursing aides each day.\"This means a nursing home would need roughly ten nurse aides per each 8-hour shift in a facility with 100 residents,\" according to the White House briefing report.The rules would not usurp states with even higher personnel requirements.According to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, more than 80% of facilities would have hire additional nursing staff if the rules go in place - including 90% of for-profit nursing homes and 60% of nonprofit and government-run centers.The Biden administration said understaffed facilities increase the likelihoods of patient injuries and deaths as well as substandard care. \"When nursing homes stretch workers too thin, residents may be forced to go without basic necessities like hot meals and regular baths, or even forced to lie in wet and soiled diapers for hours,\" the White House said in a Sept. 1 briefing paper on the new regulations.To help address the staffing needs, CMS says it is launching a $75 million effort to help train and recruit new nurses including with scholarships and tuition reimbursements.Industry opposition Long-term and congregate care industry groups contend the staffing rules are burdensome and will put facilities out of business - especially in rural and already underserved areas - as their sector faces continued and post-pandemic labor shortages.The American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living say the Biden personnel rules will require nursing homes to hire more than 102,100 new full-time workers (including more than 22,000 registered nurses and more than 80,000 nurses aides).The groups say it will cost the nursing home industry $6.8 billion annually - challenging a $4 billion per year estimate from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.If nursing homes are required to reduce their numbers of beds available because of staffing rules and shortages that could impact more than 280,000 congregate care residents, many of them on Medicaid, the industry associations argue.\"If this rule is finalized without the financial support that nursing homes will need to hire these additional workers, hundreds of thousands of seniors will be at risk of losing the care they need,\" said Cory Rutledge, chief assurance officer at Clifton Larson Allen LLP (CLA), a Minneapolis-based professional service and accounting firm that analyzed the federal proposals for the two industry groups.Political pushback The industry - and its push against the Biden efforts - has some influential friends in Washington.Twenty-eight U.S. senators wrote U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service Administrator Chiquita Brooks-La-Sure Sept. 29 voicing concerns about President Joe Biden's push for new staffing requirements on nursing homes and assisted living centers.The 23 Republican, 3 Democratic and 2 independent senators worried about the \"staffing mandates\" include Montana Sens. Jon Tester, a Democrat, and Steve Daines, a Republican, as well as U.S. Sens.Marco Rubio, R-Florida, James Lankford, R-Oklahoma.Kyrsten Sinema, I-Arizona, Jean Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, Jim Risch R-Idaho, Thom Tillis, R-NC, and Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia.\"In many parts of the country, America's longterm care facilities are facing severe workforce shortage issues that are harming access to critical care for our nation's seniors. With this in mind, we are deeply concerned that now is the worst possible time for the United States to establish the nation's first federal staffing mandate for long term care facilities,\" the senators said in their correspondence.\"We believe the rule as proposed is overly burdensome and will result in additional closures and decreased access to care.\" The senators want President Joe Biden to rescind the rule and find \"alternative approaches\" to labor challenges.Tester previously voiced opposition to the Biden nursing home efforts in September and earlier this year and wants different staffing rules for rural areas.\"I fear a one-size-fitsall staffing mandate would undermine access to care for patients, particularly in rural communities.Instead, I urge you to work with Congress and rural stakeholders on tailored solutions that address the severe workforce challenges in underserved areas,\" Tester said in a June letter to the Biden administration. \"A blanket staffing mandate would not account for individual facilities' operational capabilities and staffing circumstances.\" His office cites Montana Health Care Association numbers showing 11 nursing homes have closed statewide since 2021 (including the loss of 850 long-term care bids last year.)Since 2021, Montana has seen the closure of 11 nursing homes, and in 2022 alone, the state lost more than 850 nursing home beds, according to the Montana Health Care Association.U.S. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington state Republican who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, also worries the new mandate will put rural nursing homes in a bind.\"The rule will put nursing homes - particularly in rural areas - in an impossible dilemma as they grapple with how to manage current occupancy levels with the insufficient workforce available to meet the requirements. This rule fails to adequately balance the needs of seniors and nursing home staff in the face of the current staffing shortage gripping our nation.\"Nursing homes would have three years in rural areas to abide by the 24/7 RN mandate and five years to get in line with all the new rules. Urban and suburban facilities would have two years to have RN's on staff around-theclock and three years for all the other mandates, according to CMS.Labor unions support There are some hardship provisions for facilities with chronic staffing shortages in underserved areas. Comments on the new rules are being accepted until Nov. 6.In many states, a distinct minority nursing homes are currently in compliance with the proposed staffing levels.Those lower percentages include California (21%), Florida (20%), Texas (4%), New York (14%), Idaho (31%), Maryland (17%), Delaware (16%), Wyoming (38%), Montana (38%), Wisconsin (37%), Georgia (6%) and Louisiana (1%), according to KFF.States with higher current compliance levels based on the proposed nursing staff regulations include Oregon (63%), Washington (49%), North Dakota (76%), Maine (75%), Vermont (75%) and Alaska (100%). Those states have staffing rules above and beyond the current federal benchmarks.Part of Biden's push stems from the coronavirus pandemic which saw more than 200,000 nursing home residents and staff deaths attributed to the virus - approximately one-fifth of all deaths attributed to the pandemic nationally.Nursing homes already report labor struggles with 86% reporting staffing shortages and 96% struggling to hire staff, according to AHCA. That includes nursing aides who sometimes make at or barely above state minimum wage levels with pay at times a kin to service and retail workers.While some patient advocates wanted Biden to go even farther with new requirements, labor unions representing nursing home workers support the new federal push.\"Our country's long term care system is in the midst of a catastrophic crisis, and nursing home workers and residents have suffered unspeakable consequences. In the absence of a federal staffing standard, nursing home workers have endured complete physical, mental and emotional exhaustion due to understaffed shifts and unsafe working conditions, and nursing home residents have been robbed of the quality care and quality of life they deserve,' said SEIU International President Mary Kay Henry after the rule's release last month.AFLCIO President Liz Shuler also backs Biden's push to require more transparency related to nursing home ownership, finances and use of Medicare and Medicaid funds.\"Workers and the families of residents have been sounding the alarm for decades about the need for a minimum national staffing standard in nursing homes, and we commend the Biden-Harris administration for answering the call.\" \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nResidents dine together in the dining hall at River Walk, an independent senior housing facility, in New York, Thursday, April 1, 2021.\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nPresident Joe Biden in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Friday, Oct. 6, 2023, in Washington. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "It's about community - Chesapeake Bay Walk to Defeat ALS set for Oct. 22 in Centreville\n\n October 11, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 892\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE - The Chesapeake Bay Walk to Defeat ALS is on track to reach its $35,000 goal on Sunday, Oct. 22, and organizers are hoping last minute walkers and supporters will join the fight.Walkers will sign in at 9 a.m. at Route 18 Park in Centreville. Even those who wake up and decide to participate that day can get in on the action and register at the walk.When Pam Clark Edwards of Centreville, was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in February 2021, her family and friends not only rallied around her, they lost no time launching the effort to raise funds for the ALS Association.Edwards' daughters, Meredith Kulbacki of Centreville and Morgan Edwards of Winter Garden, Florida, spearheaded the Oct. 2022 Walk that rallied some 140 people who walked, ran and wheeled to raise over $30,000.Their team, Pam's Praying Pineapples, will be joined by 10 additional teams this year.As of the beginning of October, the local walk had raised over 80% of its goal.\"That's pretty amazing,\" Kulbacki said. \"I think we can definitely get close to that, if not reach it by the walk.\" The community has reached out to help. Other fundraising in the form of raffles and a 50/50 drawing will be held, and about 40 items were donated by local businesses.For example, \"we have a foursome golf outing at Queenstown Harbor, an official NFLfootball signed by Justin Tucker of the Baltimore Ravens, a gift basket from Draper Brothers liquor store, cosmetic gift bags, jewelry and various services,\" Meredith said.Fun activities include pumpkin decorating for kids.The ALS chapter from D.C., Maryland and Virginia will be sending helpers to be stationed at tables, so people can find out more information about ALS itself, and maybe about how they can help, Kulbacki said.\"If they have become a caretaker to someone with ALS,\" she said. \"There will be workers there to help them through that.\" Information will be available for people who have been diagnosed with ALS.In fact, some members of Edwards' care team at Johns Hopkins will be attending the walk Ebb Tide Tent & Party Rentals in Queenstown donated a large tent, while Queen Anne's County Parks and Recreation donated the use of the park.Community support has been \"just amazing,\" Edwards said.\"Having the support of the community helps us as a family deal with all of this,\" she said.The Clark family has deep roots in the county. Pam and her husband, Fred, and Kulbacki and her family live on the family farm just down the road from the park where the walk will be held.Pam is a retired teacher in Queen Anne's County Public Schools.Pam's mother, June, and her brother Jeff have canvassed local business owners, who are supporting their longtime neighbors.Edwards' longtime friends and colleagues are part of the small committee helping her daughters. Connie Dean, Barb Thompson and Bobbie King have rallied around the Edwards family to help out where they can to help organize the walk.Kulbacki, who was raised in Centreville, spent eight years in York, Pennsylvania, and recently moved back. \"It means everything to me. It means family,\" she said.During the COVID pandemic, she and her family, which includes her husband and two children, decided to move back home \"on a whim.\" \"We felt so alone with just no family and (few) friends there,\" she said. \"We had no idea that this would happen.We say it was almost like God told us. He helped us through this, and it was almost a blessing in disguise that we moved home, so that we could help my mom and my dad and my family through this.\" \"So not only to be here with them, and then also to have so much support from everybody in the community and all of our friends and family - it's just amazing and we're so thankful for that,\" Mer said.Kulbacki knew about the ALS Association's Walk to Defeat ALS through a sad coincidence. The mother of a close friend in Pennsylvania died from ALS about a year before the Kulbackis moved to Maryland, and Kulbacki had participated in a Pennsylvania Walk in memory of Becky Miller's mom.\"I didn't know that it would affect me so deeply a year later, so it's been amazing to still be friends with her and have support from her because she knows what I'm going through,\" Mer said.\"You never know when ALS may affect a friend or family member,\" Edwards said. \"It is becoming, I think, more prevalent. I know five people who have passed away from it, not because I have been in this situation - these are people who have been in my life.\" \"It's a disease that they really do not have a treatment or cure for yet, and we just need to put money into the resources for help for these families, as well as to provide money for research,\" she said.To register online for the Oct. 22 Walk, visit Walkto-DefeatALS.org.For more information about the ALS Association, donating your time or resources and supporting the Walk to Defeat ALS Chesapeake Bay, visit als.org or contact coordinator Tara Huang at tara.huang@als.org. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTeam Chesapeake Bay is ready to lead the Walk to Defeat ALS Oct. 22.

That is not what I need right now.I need support, someone to hold my hand and help me have the courage and strength to go through this process. - Need Support DEAR NEED SUPPORT: Now is not the time for you to be worrying about hurting your husband's feelings. This is your life and your health. Whatever you need to do to walk through this moment and get the most out of it is what you should be concentrating on. It is perfectly fine for you to ask a friend or your sister to go with you to your doctor's appointments or to talk through the results and recommendations after your visits.It can be helpful to have an advocate to stay apprised of what you discover. That person may also think of questions that you may have missed. It's one thing to get a diagnosis and another to figure out a plan of action for improving your health.Invite the person you think will be most helpful to you.Be sure to get their full agreement.When the time is right, you can inform your husband of what is going on and how you are tackling your health issues - if you so choose.What's most important is that you address your problems and do your part to get healthy.Harriette Cole is a lifestylist and founder of Dreamleapers, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

    "content": "UM Shore Regional Health celebrates 'health care heroes' - Luncheons, unveiled murals recognize health care workers' efforts during CO VID-19 pandemic\n\n October 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Contributed | Page: 5 | Section: News \n \n 628\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - UM Shore Regional Health's Senior Leadership team recently hosted post-COVID luncheons for team members in each of the five counties UM SRH serves - Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Talbot and Queen Anne's - to celebrate the World Health Organization declaring an end to the COVID-19 public health emergency earlier this year and to honor all team members who served during the pandemic as \"caregivers.\" The luncheons also served as a remembrance for those team members who gave the ultimate sacrifice during the pandemic and lost their lives, Calvin Molock, Jr. and Bronte Johnson.Family members of both Molock and Johnson attended the luncheon in Easton. Plaques honoring Molock and Johnson will be placed at UM Shore Medical Centers at Cambridge, Chestertown and Easton, as well as UM Shore Medical Pavilions at Denton and Queenstown.\"COVID made us here at Shore, and health care teams and community members everywhere, realize very quickly how nimble and course-corrective we had to be as new information on COVID came to light,\" said William Huffner, MD, Chief Medical Officer and Senior Vice President, Medical Affairs, UM SRH.\"There were a lot of unsung heroes during COVID, but especially infection prevention teams everywhere, who helped us address the changes as they came.We all are just so appreciative of everyone who stepped up to help our caregivers and communities during this challenging time and these luncheons are just a small token of our appreciation for our team's dedication.\" Artwork honoring health care heroes was unveiled during the post-COVID luncheons in Cambridge, Chestertown, Easton and Queenstown.During fall 2022, Kelly Strannahan, Patient Experience Manager at UM SRH, reached out to the Kent Cultural Alliance with an idea of how to honor the commitment of UM SRH team members and health care workers to the communities UM SRH serves in a meaningful and permanent way.The Kent Cultural Alliance proposed having a competition to create mural-size artwork for each UM SRH facility in each county and collaborated with arts councils in Dorchester, Talbot and Queen Anne's counties, working with each to select an artist from their county to complete the commission.Each artist was provided with canvases, made possible with the support of The Finishing Touch in Chestertown.In Dorchester County, the artist is Miriam Moran, for Talbot County, the artist is Kevin Garber, and in Queen Anne's County, then-high school senior Claire Parker was selected.In Kent County, the honor was given to Paul Santori, who early on in the pandemic had a severe case of COVID and was hospitalized at UM Shore Medical Center at Chestertown. Santori succumbed to a non-COVID related health issue in winter 2023.His wife, Inez Santori, made the decision in conversation with Kent Cultural Alliance Director John Schratwieser to transfer the commission to Paul's dear friend, Ron Akins. Paul had sketched his ideas while lying in the hospital for several weeks before his death. With Inez's support, Ron was able to realize Paul's vision for the mural.Each of the county arts councils provided a stipend of $1,250 for their respective artist, and this stipend was supported in part by Kent County's Hedgelawn Foundation.The five arts councils receive funding from the Community Arts Development program of the Maryland State Arts Council, which receives financial support from the National Endowment for the Arts. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF UM SHORE REGIONAL HEALTH\n \nPictured, from left, at the unveiling of artwork at UM Shore Medical Center at Easton, are Joan Levy, executive director of the Talbot County Arts Council; artist Kevin Garber; Sherri Hobbs-Messick, chief quality, safety and experience officer at UM Shore Regional Health; LuAnn Brady, senior vice president and COO of UM SRH; Ken Kozel, president and CEO of UM SRH; and William Huffner, MD, chief medical officer and senior vice president of medical affairs at UM SRH. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'We know stigma is killing people' - Childhood traumas often drive addictions, Societal judgments often hinder recovery\n\n October 16, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Laura Tayman | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 669\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE - Emily Keller, the Special Secretary of Opioid Response for Maryland's Governor Wes Moore, shared her experience with the opioid epidemic right at the beginning of the Queen Anne's County Community Overdose Action Town Hall.\"I lost my best friend Ashley to an overdose in 2016. She should have had more treatment options. Unfortunately, my story isn't unique.\" The town hall held Sept. 21 at Kent Island High School, was the ninth out of 24 counties that the State of Maryland's \"Before It's Too Late\" team is holding across the state, sponsored by state representatives who are continue to tackle the opioid epidemic. A panel of staff from county offices were on hand to share their efforts and listen to testimony from the community.Major Christopher Amoia, Operations Commander of the Queen Anne's County Sheriff's Office, gave data he believes indicates the collaboration among county agencies is working. \"Since 2018 to the present, we had a reduction of overdoses by 380%, and deaths were lowered 267%,\" he said. Amoia credited expanding programs like DARE and promoting community awareness. Still, as of the day of the meeting, the number of overdoses to date this year is even with all of 2022.Deputy State's Attorney Christine Rickard shared how her team partnered with law enforcement. \"We are going after the drug dealers who are dealing this poison to our residents,\" she said. She is also working with the county's Drug Court. \"We know why people are committing crimes-to support their habits. We are working to get them the help they need.\" There are positive things happening with the county's drug court program, shared the Honorable Judge Lynn Knight, \"We used to just lock addicts away,\" she said. \"Now we are getting very involved with the option of plea deals that allow the offender to enter a treatment program, complete 12-18 months, keep checking in with the court, and submit to regular drug tests.\" County Commissioner Jim Moran said county efforts have also focused on youth, saying, \"We tell them we don't want them to be a statistic.\" Community member Paula Dickerson of Grasonville addressed the panel, \"We feel unseen. We have a community center that sits empty despite our area that has crime and an obvious drug problem.\" Dickerson, who is now 27 years sober, accepted the challenge from Moran to gather community members and arrange for a similar presentation at the Grasonville Community Center.Linda Kohler, Executive Director of Chesapeake Charities, encouraged the panel to consider creating more sober living homes for adults. \"Currently, there is one in Talbot County, ready to assist with services like providing drives to rehab and finding jobs.\" Kohler said they have a grant now to train more peer support specialists.Tom McKnight, (a county resident who says he is 32 years sober) suggested adults who are now sober might be a better way to reach students.\"We've lived it,\" said McKnight.\"We have stories to tell.\" Madeline Eskew, a student at Kent Island High School, had an uncle die from substance abuse in 2010 and a close cousin had to move out of state to find an acceptable treatment facility. \"I just encourage officials to focus more on the mental health side of the problem.\" Keller told Eskew, \"More often than not, addicts are masking an adverse childhood experience and try to suppress their pain.\" Kent Island High School student Avery Mortimore voiced concern about students who take the big step to access treatment but face hostile peers when they return to school. \"They don't want to be judged or shamed. They can't fully re-acclimate and don't fit in.\" \"We know stigma is killing people,\" said Keller. \"It's the reason people aren't getting help. We see it in adults as well.\" When asked what she would do in that situation, Mortimore said, \"I would focus not just on stopping addiction before it starts but on what you do during and after treatment.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nLaura Reno from Not My Child Opioid Foundation signs a banner in support of recovery from opioid use. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She does amazing work on my hair, and I have no interest in finding a new stylist anytime soon.However, every time I am around her, I cannot help but notice her bad body odor. It has become so bad that I find myself holding my breath at certain points during the session. She had to be on set with me for a photoshoot recently, and I know the other people in the room could smell her.I don't want to hurt her feelings or embarrass her, but at the same time, I cannot ignore this any longer.What should I do? - Sensitive to Smells DEAR SENSITIVE TO SMELLS: While it will feel awkward in the moment, telling your friend about her body odor is actually a gift to her.There's no way that you are the first person who has noticed her odor. If she is unable to check it, she may at best lose clients and at worst lose her job.When you do hair, you stand in close proximity to others all day long. Personal hygiene is paramount, especially in roles that bring people into each other's intimate space.Speak to your stylist privately.Tell her what you have noticed and why it is important.Suggest that she figure out what her issue is - it could be medical or basic hygiene.

Ewing Dinner Auction was held to benefit Chester-wye, the longtime center to provide care for adults with developmental disabilities. The event was again hosted at the Kent Island Volunteer Fire Department.Event Co-Chair Wheeler Baker welcomed those who attended the Oct. 14 event, thanking the many dedicated attendees and sponsors of the event. Auction donations will go to support critically needed renovation of two of the Chester-wye houses, the Ewing and Nash Houses, noted Baker, \"The project will include wheelchair accessible living spaces, new kitchens, wheelchair friendly baths, all customized for individuals with developmental disabilities.\"Baker also thanked the KIVFD for graciously hosting the event for so many years. Music for the event was provided by the Guthrie Matthews Method Band.The printed program provided a brief history of Chesterwye - originated through the efforts of Bobby Ann and Stuart Nash, who had a little boy, \"Chip\", with Down syndrome. With laser focus, Bobby Ann pushed the county to provide a place where young and older adults with disabilities could be cared for and learn to live life as fully as possible. Chesterwye was the result.Following the meal of steak and crab cakes, catered by Chesapeake Celebrations, county commissioner Jim Moran spoke briefly. \"For over 57 years the Chesterwye has provided homes and support for individuals with developmental disabilities,\" he said, noting, \"Chesterwye was the first organizations in Maryland to provide personalized housing, 'forever homes', as alternative to institutions of the day.\" Moran also recognized the late Thomas J. Ewing as one of the founders, donating land where the Ewing house now stands.Kay Ewing Maloney, owner of the former famed \"Holly's Restaurant\" in Grasonville, was the guest speaker. Her late father, Thomas J. Ewing, for whom the dinner-auction is named, founded the restaurant in the early 1950s. It became a landmark for both locals and travelers to the Eastern Shore until is was eventually sold a few years ago.Recounting some of Chesterwye's history, Maloney emphasized, \"Remember, we're here to raise money for Chester-wye, which is a great organization! All of the funds raised go directly back to Chesterwye, for it's upkeep and mission.\"Any one of us could have been born with such disabilities, shared Baker, \"But by the grace of God, there go I,\" reminder enough, he said, to help those who need help.A highlight of the fundraiser - a live auction - was conducted by Jeff Heisey, of Atlantic Auctioneers, Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Beach condo vacations were among those items, as well as baskets of cheer, and a semi-automatic shotgun that sold for $2,700. But the top item sold was a bobble head replica of Snoop Dogg, that went for $5,000. The total from the items sold was $21,300. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY DOUG BISHOP\n \nCenterpiece of the 42nd Annual Thomas J.Ewing Dinner Auction, the legendary Walnut Cake, originally made by the late Mrs. Florence Howard, beginning in 1979.\n \nPHOTO BY DOUG BISHOP\n \nFrom the left; Chestetrwye 42nd Thomas J.

With proper interventions and more community support, we can help curb drug use and improve outcomes for young people who are the most at risk of developing a substance use disorder.\"The funding was made available through the Office ofJuve-nile Justice Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) FY 2023 Mentoring for Youth Affected by Opioid and Other Substance Misuse grant program.The federal funds will be used to help implement the youth mentoring program to benefit children impacted by opioids, their families, mentors and communities on Maryland's Eastern Shore.Through this program, Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Eastern Shore will partner with local health departments to provide seminars on opioid and drug use as well as additional training through the learning exchange.The OJJDP FY 2023 Mentoring for Youth Affected by Opioid and Other Substance Misuse grant seeks to enhance and expand mentoring services for children and youth impacted by opioids and other drug misuse.The OJJDP aims to assist youth and their families negatively affected by opioids and other substances, especially youth in historically marginalized and underserved communities who will benefit the most from prevention and intervention programs.The program's goal is to improve outcomes (such as improved academic performance and reduced school dropout rates) for youth impacted by opioids and other substance misuse through mentoring.Senators Cardin and Van Hollen worked to secure $415 million for the Office ofJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) in the Senate fiscal year 2024 appropriations package to further support efforts to connect young people impacted by opioids and other drug misuse with the resources they need to live healthy and stable lives. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland joins DC, 40 other states suing Meta\n\n October 25, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bridget Byrne; Capital News Service | Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 787\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Maryland, the District of Columbia and 40 other states are suing Meta alleging that its platforms cause harm to children by building addictive features, Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown announced Tuesday.\"Our country is facing a youth mental health crisis fueled by young people's extensive and compulsive use of, and reliance on, social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram,\" Brown said at a press conference outside Hampstead Hill Academy, a Baltimore public school. \"This has placed an entire generation of young people in jeopardy.\"Maryland and 32 other states are filing a joint lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and the District of Columbia and eight other states are filing separate complaints in federal, state or local courts.The scope of the legal claims may vary, but all are expected to assert that Meta used harmful and manipulative tactics purposefully to keep children on its platforms.In 2021, a bipartisan coalition of state attorneys general announced an investigation into Meta, focusing on whether the parent company of Instagram and Facebook violated consumer protection laws by promoting the sites' apps to children and teens.\"Based on the information obtained during that investigation, we allege that Meta's actions have violated the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act,\" Brown said.Nationwide, states have seen a surging youth mental health crisis: the number of children ages 3 to 17 who experienced anxiety or depression from 9.4% in 2016 to 11.8% in 2020 - a 25% increase, according to the National Institute of Health. Maryland ranked 19th in the nation for overall child well-being.\"Just like Big Tobacco did a generation ago, Meta has chosen to maximize its profits at the expense of public health, specifically the health of our children,\" Brown charged.In the suit Maryland joined, the attorneys general allege that \"Meta has harnessed powerful and unprecedented technologies to entice, engage, and ultimately ensnare youth and teens.\"\"Its motive is profit, and in seeking to maximize its financial gains, Meta has repeatedly misled the public about the substantial dangers of its Social Media Platforms. It has concealed the ways in which these Platforms exploit and manipulate its most vulnerable consumers: teenagers and children. And it has ignored the sweeping damage these Platforms have caused to the mental and physical health of our nation's youth,\" the filing states.Meta said in a statement that it agreed with \"the attorneys general's commitment to providing teens with safe, positive experiences online, and have already introduced over 30 tools to support teens and their families.\"But Meta added: \"We're disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path.\"Brown was joined by Hampstead Hill Academy Principal Matthew Hornbeck, who said that over the 20 years he has been at the school he has seen the impact the rise in social media use has had on his students. Hornbeck described measures to curb phone use at Hampstead Hill, but stressed they were \"merely a workaround.\"\"(Social media) hijacks normal, healthy thinking,\" Hornbeck said. \"It sucks up so much time and keeps the user wanting more and more. It's not an overstatement to say it can steal big chunks of a childhood.\"\"The urge to check your phone is stronger than any consequence we have at school,\" he said.Treeme Cannizzaro, an 8th grade student at Hampstead Hill, said at the press conference that limiting phone use in schools does not address the impact social media has on mental health when students are not at school.\"My friends and I can't help but get on our phones to see what we've missed,\" Cannizzaro said. \"Limiting access to social media has had a positive impact on my mental health during the school day, and I hope that social media companies can find more ways to decrease the anxiety and depression my friends and I feel from social interactions online.\"In May, the Federal Trade Commission proposed barring Meta from monetizing the data it collects for underage users.Also in May, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued an advisory stating that, although there are some benefits, social media use presents a \"profound risk of harm\" for children and called for further research into social media's impact on youth mental health.\"Children are exposed to harmful content on social media, ranging from violent and sexual content, to bullying and harassment,\" Murthy said in a statement. \"And for too many children, social media use is compromising their sleep and valuable in-person time with family and friends.\"Efforts to regulate social media's impact on social media have gained traction this year, but also have faced challenges in court. Federal judges blocked newly-passed children's safety laws in California and Arkansas. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The complex will have 18 more beds than the hospital's existing facility.The other main portion of the complex will be utilized for medical offices.Over 1,100 parking spaces, a 36-acre open space area, stormwater management facilities and landscaping are also included in the plan.The new regional medical center will replace the town's existing hospital, which is 3.5 miles away and tucked into downtown Easton.In addition to the large-scale medical center, the hospital system is proposing removal and relocation of a section of Maryland Route 662C and modifying entrances into the Talbot County Community Center, which is adjacent to the property.At the Oct. 19 meeting, the hospital system also sought a waiver of parking lot landscape hedge and vegetative buffer requirements, or approval to plant native grasses and plants instead of hedges to enable proper drainage flow towards proposed stormwater management facilities and to allow for better visibility at parking lot exits.Questions raised by planning commission members during the meeting centered on parking, accessibility, emergency access, landscaping and traffic.After additional discussion, the planning commission voted to approve the sketch site plan with several conditions for the applicant to meet, including addressing remaining comments from the Easton Staff Development Review, meeting with the commission again to review if additional landscape screening is appropriate and working with the town engineer to explore alternatives for emergency access.Though the town's planning commission approved the sketch plan, the start of construction is dependent on receiving a Certificate ofNeed from the Maryland Health Care Commission. UM Shore Regional Health filed the CON application in early January.The hospital anticipates a response from the state by the end of this year or by January 2024, according to Ken Kozel, president and CEO of UM Shore Regional Health. Hospital officials hope to begin construction in late spring 2024. \n \n Caption: CONTRIBUTED\n \nUniversity of Maryland shore Regional Health's new regional medical center proposed rendering following schematic design phase. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It seems like everything comes so easily to her, and it's hard for me not to compare our paths.Recently, my friend received a $10,000 scholarship for a study abroad program in Japan and landed an internship at one of the top investment banking firms in the United States. She applied to only one internship and only one scholarship, and things fell into place effortlessly. It's as if a fairy comes in every night while she's sleeping and throws magic pixie dust at her to make everything work out. Meanwhile, I feel like I have to fight tooth and nail just to make half as much progress. Every day is a continuous struggle to accomplish the goals that I have. I try hard to be positive, but obstacles pop up constantly. How can I deal with these feelings of envy and move forward with a more upbeat outlook on life? - Jealous DEAR JEALOUS: It is understandable that you would be envious of your friend for what appears to be an easy life. As you also know, it is toxic to dwell on what other people have. No good will come out of that longing. Instead, you must focus on yourself. Do your best to view your life as your perfect challenge. You are gaining resilience as you live through each experience.Claim your small victories.To keep on track, create a vision board. Look through magazines and newspapers for images that reflect the things you want for your life. Cut them out. Brainstorm words and ideas that represent your dreams.Write them down. Next, on a large piece of cardboard or paper, place the images and words together. Make a simple art piece out of this collection of ideas to create your vision board. When thoughts creep in about your friend's success - or anyone else's - wish them well and pivot back to planning your own life. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "All hands on deck - How local hospitals handle mass casualty incidents\n\n November 1, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 3A | Section: News \n \n 757\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - It was all hands on deck Monday morning at two University of Maryland Shore Regional Health facilities as emergency department staff treated patients from a school bus crash in Easton.Ten of the 11 patients involved in the crash between a Caroline County school bus and a SUV were taken to Shore Regional Health facilities - three patients to the hospital in Easton and seven to the freestanding emergency department in Queenstown.The number of patients in need of evaluation and treatment triggered first responders to categorize the crash as a mass casualty incident, or a situation that overwhelms local healthcare systems' resources and capabilities.\"When (first responders) say, 'we got something bad,' we listen,\" said Dr.Walter Atha, the regional director of emergency medicine for the University of Maryland Shore Regional Health.\"They (called) ahead, and that's exactly what happened yesterday: they gave us a heads up and said 'Look, we're going to have numerous (patients), many more' - in fact even (taxing) their own capacity to bring them in,\" he added.From there, back and forth discussions ensued on which patients could be brought to the hospital in Easton versus the Queenstown facility, though all four of Shore Regional Health's facilities can perform initial resuscitation efforts.An incident command system, or structure that's put in place if there's a large-scale ongoing emergency situation, was also implemented to manage plans to move forward.While emergency medical services personnel triaged patients at the scene Monday morning, a yellow alert, which signifies an internal or external disaster, went out to hospital staff. That partnership between first responders and physicians is crucial in managing an emergent situation.The alert notifies everyone from leadership positions to those on the frontlines to prepare - \"just brace yourself\" for however the situation may go, Atha said.Sending the systemwide alert lets units far removed from the emergency department prepare to decompress the emergency department's other needs so staff can perform resuscitation if needed.Situational awareness is key when preparing for an influx of patients, Atha said. It's particularly important to evaluate the resources on hand, including personnel needs and the location of certain equipment. The hospital in Easton also can contact an on-call physician in anticipation of increased critical volume.But in preparation for a rush of patients from Monday's crash, an on-call physician wasn't needed - a doctor with expertise in resuscitation concerned about patients needing high level care \"came in on his own goodwill\" to help, Atha said.\"So many people in the community say, 'I will come help,'\" he said.Treating young patients like those involved in the bus crash can be a challenge though.Atha said physical shock from injuries in children doesn't manifest the same way it does in adults. The resilience of children makes them \"notoriously difficult\" for first responders to triage because some kids who look well could be seriously injured.Difficulties can also arise with ensuring there is enough staff on hand to answer questions from families and to keep everyone calm.And with any mass casualty incident that occurs in a rural area, distance makes a difference, both positive and negative.\"Frankly, there's a little advantage in that maybe we have a little extra time if it's far removed in terms of knowing what's coming in, rather than it happening a block away,\" he said. \"On the other hand, you want to get to trauma victims as soon as you can, so that's the challenge: the distance.\" But still, mass casualty incidents in the Mid-Shore region are \"not that frequent,\" Atha said.\"This is the largest-scale that I've seen in a while,\" he said, struggling to remember other serious incidents during his 10-year tenure at the hospital.Even with the low frequency of such incidents in the area, Atha felt the emergency department staff had the resources they needed to respond to it adequately.\"The feedback I got from the folks on the frontlines who were actually taking care of the patients (said) things went as smoothly as they could,\" he said.To keep improving emergency department responses to various incidents, hospital staff set up review meetings to debrief on what went well and what didn't. A meeting on the response to the bus crash was held Tuesday morning.Atha commended all who were involved with the Monday's response.\"It's not just the people who put hands and gloves on those patients; it was everybody at every level stepped up and was ready, I think that's really important,\" he said. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nAn emergency department staff member at the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton works at the nurses' station. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "County health report shows progress\n\n November 1, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 2B | Section: News \n \n 1004\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - During her biannual report to the Caroline County Commission at its Oct. 24 meeting, Health Officer Robin Cahall touted successes, including significant state grant funding, increased behavioral health services with better outcomes and progress in achieving 2023 initiatives.However, communicable diseases like tuberculosis are present in the county, and the department, along with its partners, is reaching out to vulnerable populations with services.Cahall presented a slide show with Behavioral Health Director Jessica Tuel that provided information on funding, staffing and numbers related to services delivered to county residents.For fiscal year 2023, the health department received about $6.9 million in grant funding. Along with state and local funding, the total is $8.5 million.The approved county match was $409,054 - less than 5% of the total budget for the health department.The department continues to apply for additional grant funding.The fiscal year 2024 budget, however, will increase with a county match of just over $589,000, or about 7% of the department's total budget.Because the state contribution is based on a wealth index, the approximate ratio of state to local percentages of the department's baseline funding is nearly 80% state and just over 20% county.The wealth index hasn't been updated since 1996, Cahall said, but the Maryland Association of County Health Officers has created an ad hoc committee to review the process for determining the formula.Core funding must be used for specific purposes according to the state, and most of that \"goes towards our environmental health services,\" Cahall said.Those local health services include communicable disease control, family planning, maternal and child health, wellness promotion, data management and protective equipment, among others.Among this year's initiatives, the Behavioral Health Program has moved to Denton Plaza, and a second Mobile Treatment Unit is up and running. The department is making progress towards National Public Health Accreditation and expanding chronic disease prevention.The health department's newest partnerships include the ongoing Caroline County Collective Impact.\"We have several different members of our leadership team that participate in different action teams for collective impact,\" Cahall said.\"That's been very successful for us in the sense of collaborating with our community partners and leaders to get some things done.\" For example, Mobile Integrated Health is a partnership among the Department of Emergency Services, the Basic Life Support Committee and Shore Health, and the Resource Directory Project partners with the Caroline Human Services Council and the Caroline County Public Library.The Communicable Disease, Family Planning and Women and Child Health Division is \"definitely one of our priorities,\" Cahall said.The department performed 180 teburculosis tests and identified 38 latent tuberculosis infections. The department treated 28 of those individuals; primary care providers could treat the others.So far in 2023, the department performed 531 pregnancy tests and a registered nurse handled 1,249 unduplicated office visits. A lot of prenatal care and referrals went to Choptank Community Health providers.commission President Travis Breeding asked about the health department's response to \"a really large influx of new English language learners\" at the northern end of the county.\"Are you seeing additional requests for assistance and support among the new American population, the immigrant population?\" he asked.Cahall said they were seeing a slight influx in terms of immunization requests, but the department referred people to Choptank Community Health or other providers.\"We don't want the health department to be primary care for anyone,\" she said.\"We have a great immunization team,\" Cahall said. \"We actually have two new nurses and our director of nursing. We can definitely use one more on our communicable disease side.We're trying to work that in, but it's definitely manageable.\" Cahall said behavioral health is one of the biggest programs within the health department.Cahall said there has been a 37% decrease in visits to receive buprenorphine (the medication used for the management of opioid use disorder), care coordination has increased 84% and maintenance has increased 12%.\"That data indicates that our clients are shifting from active treatment to maintenance and they're also shifting to discharge,\" Cahall said. \"This is definitely showing improvement in our treatment.\" She pointed to a 60% decrease in use of the mobile treatment unit (MTU) \"because we've worked really hard on discharging and putting our clients into maintenance when it's needed or when they're ready.\" Cahall reported percentages instead of numbers for drug intoxication deaths because \"we're dealing with small numbers\" and they may not all be Caroline County citizens.Cahall's last slide listed four top 2024 initiatives. She said the Coordinated Community Supports Project is \"going to be huge for us.\" The department has nearly $400,000 to expand current school-based mental health services; the current capacity is an average of 260 students in five schools.Other initiatives include Mobile Integrated Health, expanding sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing capabilities and establishing organizational performance measures based on the State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP).commissioner Frank Bartz asked how the department is helping those with mental health concerns and if more people were receptive to seeking help.\"I have seen a huge difference, especially in the last three years,\" Tuel said. \"People are really worried about their mental health and are caring for themselves, which I'm really happy about.\" Tuel said that most people with \"substance use disorder often have mental health concerns, as well. They are treated just like any other patients.\" \"Coordinated community support not only supports children and adolescents' mental health, but the family as a whole,\" Cahall said. \"The other thing we've worked on is an anti-stigma campaign we've seen a shift in the stigma situation.\" Commission Vice President Larry Porter, who participated in the meeting remotely because of illness, weighed in at the end of the report and thanked Cahall and Tuel for the information.\"We've come a long way from our health report card that we used to have where we were last in everything you didn't want to be last in, and first in everything we didn't want to be first in,\" he said. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nCaroline County Health Officer Robin Cahall updates County Commissioners Oct. 24. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Know that you can make a difference' - Nonprofit for children affected by conflict in Ukraine hosts fundraiser at Avalon\n\n November 3, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom Mccall; tmccall@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 711\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Short videos and still photos were projected across the screen of the Avalon Theater Wednesday night, including one image of a young girl, maybe 10 years-old.Susan Mathison asked those gathered to consider just this one person and her needs for food during the war in Ukraine.\"Because of our ability to distribute food, that kid and her family ate that week and they will as well next week,\" she told dozens of locals who had gathered at the theater to learn about Mathison and her partners' work.On Feb. 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which started in 2014. It is estimated that tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians have died and hundreds of thousands of military members.The Common Man for Ukraine, a non-profit aligned with rotary clubs around the world, feeds, clothes and provides sleeping bags for children affected by the war.Along with feeding those in need, The Common Man for Ukraine brings in mental health workers to help young people cope with losing their homes, and in many cases, their families.Mathison is one of the founders of the group. She and three friends - Alex Reyes, Steve Rand and Lisa Murray, all based in New Hampshire - decided they needed to do something about the suffering they had seen from the conflict.None of them were foreign aid workers or diplomats, she said, but they were determined to figure out how to help.\"The world has a lot of catastrophes right now. And the media and our hearts can be distracted from one to the other, to the other,\" Mathison said. \"Our challenge as humans is to find a cause that matters to you and makes a difference. Find something and know that you can make a difference in the lives of someone, somewhere.\" \"We are just four people.Alex owns a couple dozen restaurants in New Hampshire.Steve is a hardware store owner, I am a retired forester and Lisa is a public health specialist. We had no humanitarian aid experience.Steve and Alex were rotarians.This was a total start from zero.\" Their approach was to fly to Ukraine, talk to people and find out what they needed.\"Steve contacted the district governor of all the rotarians in Poland and Ukraine. Alex put up the first million dollars. We are going to raise a match of a million dollars. So we want to help, what can we do?\" Mathison said.The Ukrainian Rotarians recommended some projects, which The Common Man for Ukraine was eager to see put on the ground.\"What is the one thing we can do really well? We decided to work on kids.They seem the most vulnerable, most innocent victims.We wanted to stay out of the fray of politics. 2.5 million kids are in hiding from Russian bombing and kidnapping.They are internally displaced,\" she said.\"They are looking for a place to sleep. They are hid in safe houses and secret locations all over Ukraine.\" The Rotarian connection helped this nonprofit find safe houses and deliver food on a 40-day rotation. Mathison said they have delivered 800 tons of food, 10,000 sleeping bags and 500 generators to date. They keep two warehouses on the Polish border with Ukraine.\"The Russians have a history of winning wars by starving people out,\" Rand said. \"They are trying to interrupt every line of resupply.If we had a warehouse in Ukraine, it would be a target to be blown up.\" The organization brings 30 children a month to a safe place in Poland, where they get art therapy, play therapy, talk therapy and perhaps most importantly, they network with others who have lost a parent, said Mathison.\"Our three legged stool is food, warmth and love.That last leg is mental health counseling,\" she said.She said her hope is that these kids will be the ones to rebuild Ukraine when the war is over.To learn more about the nonprofit, visit commonmanforukraine.org. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nSteve Rand, in blue vest, hands out cards and receives donations after Susan Mathison is done speaking at the Common Man for Ukraine fundraiser at the Avalon Theater.\n \nTOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nSusan Mathison spoke on the Avalon stage.

But the typical kitchen sponge has around 10 million bacteria per square inch. That's no typo! And it gets worse, so brace for what I am about to tell you.Gerba has discovered that usually there are about 200 times more fecal bacteria on the average kitchen cutting board than on a toilet seat. It doesn't necessarily get there through actual contact with feces, but arrives via raw meat products or the organs from inside of the animal, where a lot ofthe fecal bacteria originate.With all those gazillions of bacteria on kitchen sponges, you may assume the best way to clean our kitchen sponges is by a minute or two in a microwave oven set on High. Seems reasonable, right? Well, it's not!Putting that kitchen sponge through a complete cycle with detergent daily, or as often as you run a load of dishes, is a much better solution. The heat plus detergent are sufficient to kill bacteria and mildew.Another option, especially ifyou don't have a dishwasher, is to soak that daily sponge in a good antibacterial sanitizer for at least 10 minutes up to overnight. But don't spend $8 for a 16-ounce bottle from the store. Make it yourselffor pennies!According to the Food and Drug Administrationl, 1 teaspoon ofliquid chlorine bleach per 1 quart ofclean water can be used to sanitize all kitchen surfaces such as cutting boards, countertops, refrigerator shelves - and sponges!CQPYRIGHT 2023 CREATQRS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The QA YMCA is 70,000 square feet indoors (providing a workout just walking around inside the building?)The project to date cost $22.6 million. Of that, $15,235,000 came from private donations (248 donors thus far). QAC government provided $3.5 million, State Capital Grant provided $3,065,000, and the Maryland Department of Aging another $800,000.The goal of the YMCA is for families to live their healthiest lives and reach their full potential in mind, body and spirit. It offers a stay-and-play space for parents to bring their young children to be cared for by trained members of the Y staffwhile the parents workout. This service is provided free within the cost of the family's membership fee.The Active Aging Center is only the second one located in the Chesapeake region to offer congregate meals for seniors at discounted prices, chronic disease prevention programs, Enhance Fitness, swimming classes, social groups and benefits counseling tailored for ages 55-plus.The QAC Active Aging Center is open to all members of the community age 55 and over, and a YMCA membership is not required to enter. Check with the QA Department of Aging or Active Aging Center for more details about this offer.The pool at the Y has six 25-yard length swimming lanes, one ofwhich will always be open for lap swimming. Children ages 16 and under are required to take a simple swim test administered by the lifeguard to be able to swim in the pool.Gill shared an experience he had during the early years of planning of this Y.\"A father came to our meeting saying, 'My son drowned in the Corsica River in 1974. Ifwe had a YMCA back then, my son would have received swim lessons there, and would be alive today,'\" he said. \"That father's comments stuck with me as we have gone forward to where we are today.\" Among those who spoke at the grand opening ceremony, was Patricia Saelens, QACPS Superintendent of Schools. She said, \"We have have already begun partnering with the Y to provide water safety training to our school children starting with our elementary school children. We're very excited about doing this.\"As a not-for-profit organization, the YMCA provides financial assistance to ensure no one is turned away from membership, programs and services due to the inability to pay. The upkeep of the YMCA facility is at no cost to the county. Every Y is self-supporting, funded by private dollars. The new facility in Centreville will employ over 100 staff members.PHOTO BY DOUG BISHOP Area elected officials are pictured at the ribbon cutting ceremony for the grand opening of the new Queen Anne's County YMCA as Maryland Department of Aging Secretary Carmel Roques, Wednesday afternoon, Oct. 18, in Centreville. To her right, Eastern Shore Excutive Director Robbie Gill is pictured. Gill has overseen this project since it was first conceived 17-years ago. Approximately 200 people attended the event.The completed \"Phase 1\" facility now exists. Phase 2 will include the addition of an outdoor pool, six outdoor pickleball courts and space for family gatherings and activities, again, at no cost to the county. Phase two is planned to be completed by summer 2024.There are rules at the YMCA that may appear to be \"a throw back\" to a bygone era. \"No profanity. Shoes and shirts must be worn at all times. Fighting will result in suspension of YMCA membership.\"The heritage of the YMCA is to promote Christian values and an environment of caring for everyone. It is to be a happy place to come and be with others.Centreville Town Councilman Eric Johnson Jr. was present at the grand opening. He said, \"The YMCA is a focal point for community health, active aging, fitness, family, community, and so much more. I couldn't be more excited about this perfect addition to our town.\"County Commissioner Jim Moran added, \"What have our active adults using the YMCA, We have our families using the YMCA, and we have our students using the YMCA. This facility checks off so many boxes when it comes to our community and quality of life.\"To make an appointment to tour the new QA YMCA, or have questions answered, call 443-262-9994.

    "content": "Crisis Within A Crisis - The distressing, problematic intersections of homelessness and mental health\n\n November 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; APG National Enterprise Editor | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1894\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n America's mental and behavioral health crises are no more pronounced than with homeless/unsheltered people.Homeless individuals have higher rates of severe mental illnesses and behavioral health problems - and are far less likely to have received help - than the general U.S. population, according to various studies and analyses.A June study released by North Carolina-based RTI International found approximately 3.7 million American adults, or 1.8%, ofthe general population suffer from schizophrenia spectrum disorders. That number is higher than previous estimates.Among homeless populations in the U.S, individuals suffering schizophrenia, one ofthe most challenging and erratic mental health disorders, total as much as 33%, according to various studies.Nationally, 4.4% of the population suffers from bipolar disorders, according to the National Institute ofHealth. That number is as high as 42% among the homeless.Another 45% ofhomeless people deal with mental health challenges, including anxiety and depression, versus 21% ofthe general population, according to reports from the Brain & Behavior Research Association and Mental Health America.Homeless people also have more than double the rates ofsubstance abuse as the general population, according to numbers from the American Addiction Centers.NO EASY SOLUTIONThe situation also exposes plenty ofwarts in broader systems ranging from health care and mental health to criminal justice and past and contemporary mistreatment of society's poorest and most vulnerable.Women make up 38% of the U.S. homeless population while Indigenous, Hispanic and Black persons make up disproportionate shares of the homeless population - 5%, 24% and 37%, respectively - as compared to their shares of the general population.Chris Bouneff, executive director the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Oregon, said homelessness is frequently the unfortunate outcome ofuntreated behavioral health situations or the result of mental health systems that have not helped individuals address traumas and other root causes.Bouneff said the approach to helping unsheltered individuals is too often reactionary and pigeonholed into different silos, such as housing, jobs and health services (including behavioral and mental health).Trying to address serious and chronic mental and behavioral health problems once people hit the street with a health care system not aligned to help poor people is an uphill battle, he contends.\"You will never be able to build out ofthe problem,\" Bouneff said.The Oregon mental health advocate said there needs to be better coordination between groups helping the unsheltered.That means better linking housing agencies, shelters and mental and behavioral health providers whose operations and funding streams tend to be siloed to those areas.\"We have a funding dynamic where you do one thing - housing or health care - and never the two shall meet,\" Bouneff said.It also means offering an \"array\" of services and options for homeless persons facing struggles, rather than searching for one magic solution.\"The challenge is we are always looking for one thing to solve the problem,\" Bouneffsaid. \"In behavioral health, it doesn't work that way. You have to have an array ofthings available. You can't just have a housing first solution, for example.\"The reality across the country is that many homeless shelters are just that - shelters.Many shelters, especially smaller ones in smaller communities, are focused on providing beds, showers and food to homeless neighbors. They offer limited to no mental and behavioral health services to their clients.\"Our services offer drug-free shelter, hot showers and hot meals. We are not trained on mental health,\" said Candy Sanders, executive secretary and volunteer coordinator for the Klamath Falls Gospel Mission in southern Oregon.The shelter-which offers 92 beds, including a dozen for homeless women with kids - does partner with local medical and behavioral health providers.Bouneffsaid having a more cohesive approach can also help overcome hesitancies that homeless persons might have toward mental and behavioral systems, including bureaucracies and past bad experiences.Fifty-eight percent ofAmericans who report struggling with mental health (28 million people) receive no treatment, with many citing costs. That challenge is magnified for homeless persons.On top ofthat, there are also segments ofunsheltered homeless populations who resistantly avoid accessing services-including housing and shelters as well as mental and behavioral health assistance. That's a very tough nut to crack for service providers as well as law enforcement.\"There are certain components ofthis chronic homeless population that like their lifestyle. They want to live on the street,\" said Pinellas County SheriffBob Gualtieri in the Tampa area, discussing issues with crime and services for unsheltered residents.\"This isn't a services issue. This isn't an availability of services issue,\" said Gualtieri, noting the complexity ofthe issue. The Florida sheriff said one shelter in the county (which includes St. Petersburg and Clearwater) is only at about halfofits 425-person capacity.POLICE ON THE FRONT LINESThere are also new approaches being tried across the country aimed at front line interactions with homeless persons, including those experiencing mental and behavioral health crises.Many times that job falls to police officers -who traditionally have not been trained or equipped to address severe and chronic mental illness.Mental health advocates, as well as some law enforcement officials, are trying to change that.A number ofpolice departments have increased mental and behavioral health training for officers, making it a mandatory requirement for new recruits.Other agencies have launched co-responder efforts that pair social workers, as well as mental health crisis professionals, with officers on certain police calls.InWyoming, Cheyenne Regional Medical Center started a co-responder program earlier this year with the Cheyenne Police Department, with plans to expand to the Laramie County Sheriff's Off.ce. The program received money to get going via a state grant totaling just under $345,000.Natalie Villalobos, director ofsocial work at CRMC Behavioral Health Services, said co-responders accompany local police on certain calls related to mental health, as well as domestic incidents. The goal is to assist police, offer help and services to those in need, and build relationships with community members who might gain from mental health or homeless services.\"You have people in crisis. You have domestic violence situations,\" Villalobos said.She said in a smaller city such as Cheyenne -with a population ofaround 67,000-police and social service providers often deal with the same individuals on the behavioral and mental health fronts.\"We are interconnected,\" Villalobos said.There are currently five social workers and other mental health workers from the hospital -including Villalobos - who ride along with police on calls related to the program.Right now, the effort is based on staffing and certain times of days, and the hospital workers keep their distance during certain police calls.But during other calls, the CRMC co-responders can offer services and counsel family members and victims, and build rapport with residents dealing with homelessness and mental illness.EFFORTS IN FLORIDA, WISCONSINThe St. Petersburg Police Department in Florida launched its own co-responder program in2021 aimed at improving community relations after the 2020 death ofGeorge Floyd in Minnesota sparked civil strife, nationwide protests, and calls for cutting or defunding police budgets.The effort is contracted out to GulfCoast JFCS, a Clearwater, Florida-based behavioral health firm with a staffof20, including 14 \"navigators\" who accompany patrol officers on calls and a youth engagement specialist that is funded through a grant from the National Football League.Community Assistance and Life Liaison (CALL) navigators respond to homeless-related calls, suicide threats, juvenile truancies, neighborhood disputes, substance abuse situations and responses related to Florida's 72-hour commitment law (the Baker Act).There are 577 officers on the St. Petersburg police force, which received more than 372,600 emergency and other calls for service last year.\"CALL has made over 10,000 contacts in the community since inception (in) February 2021 and served nearly5,000 unique clients,\" according to Megan McGee, assistant director ofthe administrative services bureau ofSt. Petersburg Police.\"Ninety to 95% ofthose calls that are diverted to the CALL team are handled without police. Officers have also sent over2,000 referrals to the team. For the month ofAugust, (the team) received 48 referrals from officers,\" McGee said.After an $850,000 pilot effort, the CALL program now has a $1.67 million budget and is expanding its hours ofoperation to 8 a.m. to 2 a.m.In Wisconsin, the Madison Police Department has had a mental health unit since 2015. The squad includes six full-time mental health officers and three embedded crisis workers. They assist patrol officers as needed, including those related to homelessness.The Eau Claire Police Department has had a similar effort in place since 2022 aimed at helping unsheltered people access services including for mental and behavioral health.Police departments' mental health outreach also comes as law enforcement agencies face their own rise in suicides and look to overcome historical and stigmas to asking for help. There were also a record number ofsuicides among the U.S. population last year (49,449).\"There are certain components of this chronic homeless population that like their lifestyle. They want to live on the street.\"Bob GualtieriSheriff, Pinellas County, Florida\"The suicide rate for police officers is alarming. More police officers die by suicide than they do in the line ofduty,\" said Jennifer Hannah, a lieutenant with the Madison Police Department in Wisconsin. \"MPD has not been immune. Repeated exposure to trauma, ifnot addressed, processed and treated, grows throughout an officer's career and can affect all areas ofan officer's personal and professional life. But oftentimes, the stigma associated with seeking help prevents officers from reaching out for support.\"Hannah said officers still worry if\"they will be perceived as being weak\" or face adverse career ramifications ifthey are public about their challenges. Like other agencies, Madison police have launched peer support efforts to help officers talk to their cohorts.Those peer efforts, greater awareness of challenges and overcoming stigmas within their own department can help foster more understanding and empathy on calls dealing with behavioral health crises and incidents, law enforcement officials said.OREGON'S APPROACHBack in Oregon, Bouneffsaid the state is embarking on an effort to send mental and behavioral health specialists - and not police - on some calls.The initiative is part ofa $39 million effort and 40-cents-per-month charge on phone lines to build out 988 call centers to field mental health crisis calls, and $118 million in state spending to bolster mental health services and crisis responses-including for burgeoning homeless populations.\"Law enforcement is not in the business of responding to mental health calls. They are not trained for it. They are not good at it,\" Bouneff said.He said Oregon and its localities are still figuring out how to structure those responses and when police will need to be involved or take the lead because ofthreats or incidents involving violence and self-harm.He did note the bipartisan support for dealing with mental health and responding to intersections with homelessness.\"Some ofthe strongest supporters are rural Republicans,\" Bouneffsaid. \"You can't hide this in a rural community.\" \n \n Caption: Homeless persons in the U.S. suffer from higher percentages of mental and behavioral health challenges than the general population.

We had over 70 volunteers from the community to help - including student volunteers from the Boys Scouts, the sea cadets, adult volunteers, and local school volunteers.\" Volunteers - of all ages - wore \"Make a Difference Day\" shirts that said: \"Ask me a?\" on the back. Volunteers spent the day providing information and services throughout the event.While the Division of Housing and Community Services oversees the event, a large committee plans and executes it. Composed of people from local businesses, agencies, and individuals from the community, many of the original Make A Difference Day board members remain on the committee and are active members in both the planning and in volunteering during the day.Sea cadets volunteered their time and politely welcomed each person in attendance by opening the doors and formally greeting them.Sea cadets are 10 to 17 yearolds who participate in the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps (USNSCC), a youth leadership development program sponsored by the U.S. Navy.Once through the doors, attendees were given a navigator (who spoke their language) to guide and help them through over 50 tables, services and resources, all conveniently in one location.Each person and family could select the services they needed. Services included: legal aid, social services, meals and food access, education, transportation, housing, personal hygiene, and much more. Eddie the Barber, stylist Ashley Calderone and many Queen Anne's County cosmetology students completed 30 to 40 free haircuts on Saturday.The dental van completed over 30 free dental screenings and provided goodie bags to all.Other services included free flu shots and medical testing (blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose testing).The Lions Club helped more than 10 people with vision needs. Additional services were also offered throughout the day.Giveaways were offered to everyone and were crowd pleasers - toiletries, hats, mittens, blankets, slippers, socks, diapers and wipes, and food from the Maryland Food Bank. Many of those were made possible by donations.The entire event is funded through grants, sponsors and monetary donations from the community. And all donated items found homes that day. \n \n Caption: TAMARA FORTE\n \nKent Island Lions Club members John Kirby, Dave Sipes, and Charlies Sipes aid families in need with eye exams and glasses at the annual Make a Difference Day in Sudlersville on Nov. 4.\n \nTAMARA FORTE\n \nThe Make a Difference Day sign welcomes the community in the doors of Sudlersville Middle School and shares the goal of the event, \"providing county resources and services for families in need.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I recently accepted a job that proved to be overwhelming to me.I thought I would be good at it, but I had to stretch a lot, and it just seemed like I was not doing anything right. I ended up quitting after one week. I felt like such a failure.My boss didn't say that I was doing a bad job, but she kept pointing out things that I needed to work on. I just couldn't take it. Now I am unemployed and feel like even more of a loser. How can I regain my confidence when my perfectionism is probably what landed me here in the first place?-Crippling PerfectionismDEAR CRIPPLING PERFECTIONISM:Give yourself credit for recognizing that you may be too much of a perfectionist. In our culture, being a high achiever - being the best■is lauded.Know that you are not alone in your desire to do everything right and likely better than others. Know, too, that this is unhealthy and can lead to situations like you described where you feel compelled to walk away rather than face whatever situation is before you.According to VeryWell-Mind.com, signs of perfectionism include: all-or-nothing thinking, being highly critical, having unrealistic standards, focusing only on unmet goals, fear of failure, procrastination, defensiveness and low self-esteem.You can work to combat those feelings by establishing daily affirmations that speak to your talents and goodness. Give yourself a break. Showing up and doing your best are good. And good is just fine.You may want to see a therapist to help you navigate the current crisis and help you develop strategies for managing your expectations and outcomes.Harriette Cole is a lifestylist andfounder ofDREAM-LEAPERS, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

The restaurant was at its limit for capacity that weeknight evening.Bosom Buddies Charities, Inc., Chair Claudia Boldyga welcomed all who attended saying, \"There's just nothing quite like cracking crabs and enjoying the company of family and friends. BBC's mission is to raise awareness, encourage early detection, support treatment, and celebrate healing. In our 17 years, BBC has raised almost $3 million enabling our organization to purchase state-ofthe-art equipment, including the first digital and later 3D mammography for Anne Arundel Medical Center on Kent Island, and provide invaluable nurse navigator and genetic counseling support for health care facilities on the Eastern Shore and Annapolis.\" She added, \"We're a 100% volunteer organization and the proceeds of our fundraising stays in our local communities.The important work we do to fulfill our mission would not be possible without the support from local businesses like Harris Crab House. We want to thank the entire Harris and Oertel families for this beautiful waterfront venue and delicious food, and we're grateful to Harris Crab House throughout the past 10 years. All the food and drink you are enjoying this evening has been completely donated by Harris Crab House!\" She continued, \"Ten years ago, a group of ladies came up with the idea to have this crab feast to raise money for breast cancer awareness.One of those ladies was Pat Harris. In her historic battle with this disease, Pat showed courage and tenacity.Tonight, we celebrate Pat - an amazing woman and her unsung contributions to our cause.\" Harris passed away earlier in 2023 from a 20 year on again, off again battle with breast cancer.Married to Jerry Harris, he and Pat went on the build the restaurant, and have a large family that today includes grandchildren and great grandchildren.The evening's food not only included steamed hard shell crabs, but a wonderful seafood buffet of fried soft shell crab almandine, large steamed shrimp, fried oysters, roast beef, chicken alfredo, and sides of roasted red potato slices, Brussel sprouts, pasta salad and vegetable crab soup.It was announced that the upcoming Bosom Buddies Ball will be held Saturday evening, March 23, 2024, at the Westin Hotel, Annapolis.This event always sells out.

I cannot take away the pain of those children, who are left motherless, but I can do something meaningful in Nicole's honor.\"Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble, who says he has long supported recovery and has spearheaded prevention efforts in the region with Talbot Goes Purple and other programs, quickly agreed to partner on Nicole's Promise.In December, deputies will take the children and teens on a holiday shopping trip, before returning to the sheriff 's office for cookies and activities with an elf.\"I have seen too many families get torn apart by this disease of addiction, and the hardest hit are the children that get left behind when a parent overdoses,\" Gamble said. \"We're glad that we can help bring some holiday cheer to those kids as we continue our fight against the opioid epidemic.\"Grace Street is accepting donations for Nicole's Promise.

    "content": "Seminar Focuses On Trends In Pancreatic Cancer Care\n\n November 24, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Contributed | Page: 8 | Section: News \n \n 698\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n NEAVITT - Pancreatic cancer is a relatively rare cancer, representing only 3% of estimated new cancer diagnoses each year.However, it is especially lethal. Presently the third leading cause of cancer death, pancreatic cancer kills more than 50,000 Americans every year.For the Mid-Shore Pancreatic Cancer Foundation Inc., supporting efforts to advance the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer and educating the public about risk factors and symptoms of the disease are key strategies for saving lives.On this year's World Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Day Nov. 16, the Foundation sponsored a seminar, \"New Trends in Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment,\" in the Cadby Theatre at Chesapeake College in Wye Mills.Designed for clinicians involved in patient care, the evening program featured presentations by three leading University of Maryland Medical System oncology specialists: Nader Hanna, a professor of surgery at UM School of Medicine and director of clinical operations for the Division of General and Oncologic Surgery at the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC); Yixing Jiang, a professor of medicine at UM SOM and director of GI medical oncology at the Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center at UMMC; and Jason K. Molitoris, an associate professor of radiation oncology at UM SOM, associate medical director at the Department of Radiation Oncology at UMMC, and director of Clinical Hyperthermia Program.Hanna provided an overview of various risk factors for pancreatic cancer, including heredity (indicating a family history of certain genetic mutations) and smoking, and noted that symptoms of the disease, such as weight loss, back pain, jaundice and adult-onset (over age 65) diabetes, most often don't present until the disease is relatively advanced.He also reviewed various diagnostic strategies and surgical approaches, stressing the importance of surgical resection as the most significant factor for survival.Jiang discussed the genetic aspects of pancreatic cancer and how chemotherapy drugs are tailored to address the specific mutations identified in individual patients.She noted that systemic chemotherapy provides curative results for less than 30 percent of patients and that side effects can be very severe. However, in many cases it does improve survival time and also palliates cancer-related symptoms.Molitoris described the role of radiation in treating pancreatic cancer, including challenges caused by the location of the pancreas near other tissues that can be damaged by radiation.He described the criteria for cases in which radiation is employed prior to surgery to shrink tumor size, or after surgery to palliate complications from the disease and improve quality of life.\"We were really pleased to have a good turnout for this event, and the presenters provided very clear and detailed updates from the standpoint of their practice,\" said Bill Shrieves, president of the Mid-Shore Pancreatic Foundation Inc.\"The Foundation does a lot to support pancreatic cancer patients and to raise funds for research on the disease, but as one of our volunteers commented, this event might be the most important thing we've done as an organization.If just one of the clinicians who attended does something different based on the information that was shared and it improves the outcome for a pancreatic cancer patient, that is the best kind of success,\" he said.Shrieves also credited support from Tidewater Rotary in making the event possible.\"A generous grant of $5,000 from Rotary's Flags for Cancer Program made it possible for us to offer this event free of charge, and we are very grateful for that support,\" he said.Established in 2013, The Mid-Shore Pancreatic Cancer Foundation Inc. sponsors and participates in events that raise awareness about pancreatic cancer in the community, and also helps patients and their families in the Mid-Shore region find assistance, financial support and transportation to and from treatments.The group funds research through direct grants or support for other organizations, such as the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.For more information about The Mid-Shore Pancreatic Cancer Foundation, Inc., visit midshorepancan.org/or call 410-745-9243. \n \n Caption: MID-SHORE PANCREATIC CANCER FOUNDATION\n \nThe Mid-Shore Pancreatic Cancer Foundation, led by Foundation President Bill Shrieves (second from right), recently hosted University of Maryland Medical System physicians Dr. Jason K.

However, about 99 percent of Medicare beneficiaries do not have a Part A premium since they have at least 40 quarters of Medicare-covered employment, as determined by the Social Security Administration.Medicare Part B covers physicians' services, outpatient hospital services, certain home health services, durable medical equipment, and other medical and health services not covered by Medicare Part A. The standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B enrollees will be $174.70 for 2024, an increase of $9.80 from $164.90 in 2023. The annual deductible for all Medicare Part B beneficiaries will be $240 in 2024, an increase of $14 from the annual deductible of $226 in 2023.A beneficiary's Part D monthly premium adjustment is based on his or her income and affects roughly 8 percent of people with Medicare Part D. These individuals will pay the income-related monthly adjustment amount in addition to their Part D premium.NATIONAL FAMILY CAREGIVERS MONTHCelebrated every November, National Family Caregivers Month is a time to recognize and honor family caregivers, including spouses, adult children, relatives, and friends, who provide invaluable support to older adults and people with disabilities.More than 53 million family caregivers provide unpaid care across the country.AARP estimates that in 2021, family caregivers provided 36 billion hours of care valued at $600 billion, up from 34 billion hours of care valued at $470 billion just two years before. At the same time, at least 2.7 million grandparents-and an unknown number of other relative caregivers-carry the primary responsibility for caring for grandchildren whose parents are unable to do so.\"We recognize the need for a robust, coordinated approach to supporting family and kinship caregivers,\" said Maryland Department of Aging Secretary Carmel Roques. \"As the youngest Baby Boomers turn 65 in 2029 and lifespans continue to climb into the 80s and beyond, the demand for at-home care is going to soar.\"MARYLAND FAMILY CAREGIVER SUPPORT PROGRAMIn an effort to help family and informal caregivers care for loved ones at home for as long as possible, the Maryland Department of Aging administers the Family Caregiver Support Program (FCSP) through the Area Agency on Aging (AAA) network. AAAs provide FCSP services including counseling, case management, training, support group resources, information and referral, and respite care. To learn more about the program, funded by the Administration for Community Living, or find events taking place in your county celebrating family caregivers, go to aging.maryland.gov. To find out what local resources are available in your area, contact Maryland Access Point at 1-844-627-5465 or go to www.marylandaccesspoint.info.VA CAREGIVER SUPPORT PROGRAMThe Veterans Administration Caregiver Support Program (CSP) has launched new legal and financial planning support services, as well as a new web-based educational tool, to provide comprehensive support to veterans and promote the health and well-being of veteran caregivers Eligible participants, including primary family caregivers who support veterans, can access licensed attorneys and certified financial counselors who can provide expert-led consultative financial planning and legal services relating to the needs of injured veterans and their caregivers.In addition, these primary caregivers can access essential financial and legal resources at the VA Caregiver Support: Providing Legal and Financial Services to Veteran Caregiver website.\"Being a primary family caregiver is a noble and challenging role requiring immense dedication and sacrifice,\" said Dr. Colleen Richardson, CSP Executive Director. \"At CSP, we are dedicated to providing caregivers with the resources they need to navigate the encounters of caregiving and achieve their caregiving goals.\"SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITIES AND VILLAGESThe Maryland Department of Aging (MDOA) was pleased to take part in the National Village Gathering held last month in Silver Spring, MD to increase collaboration with the Village network as part of the MDOA's Supportive Communities Initiative.Villages are community-based, nonprofit organizations formed through a cadre of caring neighbors who connect members to an array of practical support and social services that enable older adults to enjoy an independent quality of life in their homes and communities.Through the Supportive Communities Initiative, MDOA will continue to engage with the Village network, as well as other neighbor-to-neighbor initiatives, faith-based groups, and nonprofit organizations in an effort to improve opportunities for Marylanders to age in place.Learn more about Villages at vtvnetwork.org or find a Village near you at www.wavevillages.org.The above information is courtesy of the Maryland Department of Aging \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The cost of the project was $2.3 million.\"Our prior equipment was more than 20 years old,\" said Penny Olivi, director of Radiology Services at UM Shore Regional Health. \"With this completely upgraded room and the state-of-the-art digital X-ray equipment, we are now able to offer new, more complex procedures that will help patients with minimally invasive interventions.\" The Interventional Radiology suite typically sees about 100 patients each month, and the IR team provides clinical support for all areas within UM SRH; however, the key areas where the team provides the most support are cancer care and dialysis access.The new suite was designed so that it could be completely disassembled, down to the cabinetry, and then reassembled and integrated into UM Shore Regional Health's new regional hospital, set to open in 2028.\"This is groundbreaking technology and a huge advantage for our Shore communities,\" said Ken Kozel, president and CEO of UM Shore Regional Health. \"Knowing we could safely transfer the equipment to the new regional medical center, we wanted to offer this state-of-the-art advanced care to our patients now.\"And now patients don't have to travel across the Bay Bridge for this type of expert care and minimally invasive procedures.They're available right here, close to home.\" Interventional radiologists diagnose and treat disease and a wide range of conditions in the body by utilizing various small tools, such as catheters or wires.X-ray and imaging techniques, such as CT and ultrasound help guide the radiologist.Interventional radiology can be used instead of surgery for many conditions, and in some cases, it can eliminate the need for hospitalization. Interventional radiologists work closely with a patient's care team and play an important role in a patient's treatment plan.UM SRH Radiology Services also partners with the Radiologic Sciences Degree Program at Chesapeake College. The partnership allows X-ray students to attend clinical rotations in all UM Shore Regional Health facilities.Many current members of the Shore Radiology team attended Chesapeake College's program, and this ongoing partnership enables UM SRH staff to share their knowledge and expertise with the next generation of radiologic technologist graduates.Interventional Radiology training is also provided onsite by UM SRH Radiology Services. General X-ray technologists with an interest in this intense, minimally invasive surgical approach to diagnosis and treatment are trained by experienced and skilled techs and the IR Radiologist team, Dale Johnson, MD, and Brian Callahan, MD.There is also an advanced certification in IR available to UM SRH team members. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF UM SHORE\n \nUM Shore Regional Health Radiology Services team members held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new Interventional Radiology Suite at UM Shore Medical Center at Easton on Oct. 17. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lead Persists As Problem In Holiday Gifts\n\n December 14, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Cecelia Shilling; Capital News Service | Page: B9 | Section: News \n \n 798\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS - Lead poisoning has hit the news recently with pollution from leaded aviation gasoline, poisoning from applesauce pouches and federal lead pipe replacement projects.But some lead poisoning threats come during the holiday gift-giving season from jewelry, toys, makeup and other gifts.\nIn October, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency highlighted the dangers of lead exposure from leaded gasoline still used by some small planes.Communities near general aviation airports experience disproportionate exposure from emissions, the release said.\nThe Food and Drug Administration is investigating lead found in cinnamon applesauce pouches sold under WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks brands.\nAs of Nov. 22, there have been 52 cases of elevated blood lead levels in young children potentially linked to these pouches.\nOn Nov. 30, the EPA announced a proposal to require replacement of lead service lines nationwide within 10 years, according to a press release. The administration is investing $15 billion in replacing lead service lines, providing technical assistance to communities and developing a national inventory of lead pipes.\n\"The lead dust equivalent of only three granules of sugar is all it takes to poison a child,\" said a University of Maryland Medical Center release.\nAdded to all those threats during the holiday season is the lead sometimes hidden in common gifts like jewelry, makeup or toys, said Jay Apperson, a spokesperson for the Maryland Department of the Environment.\nVintage items or things manufactured in other countries are more likely to be contaminated.\n\"No child should be left behind because of lead poisoning,\" said Apperson.\n\"Public education about the importance of getting tested, along with strong enforcement, will all go a long way towards eradicating lead poisoning.\"\nChildren are the most vulnerable to lead poisoning and experience symptoms like irritability, issues with attention and learning, delayed growth and hearing issues. Severe cases can cause brain damage and neurological dysfunction, even death.\nAnd lead poisoning can impact cardiac health, pregnancy and hypertension.\nIn Maryland, children must be tested for blood lead at 12 months and 24 months according to the Maryland Department of Health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses a reference value of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter to identify children with blood lead levels higher than average.\nLead paint found in older homes is a leading cause of lead poisoning, with most childhood exposure coming from hand-to-mouth contact with lead dust.\n\"If a child has a very elevated blood lead level, that's almost surely the root cause of lead-based paint. If you get down to these relatively lower levels, say in the 3.5 (micrograms per deciliter) range, then you might need to look at other potential sources that might not be so obvious,\" Apperson said.\nInexpensive jewelry has often been found to contain lead. Lead allows metals to be shaped easily and is cheaper than alternatives like zinc, said the California Department of Toxic Substance Control.\n\"Lead is also sometimes used as a stabilizer in some plastics, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which is often incorporated into children's jewelry items,\" said the department.\nAnother common gift item, makeup, can also be a problem. Kohl eyeliners, used in Asian and African cultures for example, may contain large amounts of lead and other metals, according to the FDA.\nOne 2013 case from the New Mexico Department of Health began when an Afghan refugee family brought eyeliner to the U.S. An Albuquerque clinic reported that a toddler had a blood lead level of 27 micrograms per deciliter linked to the use of kajal eyeliner, the report said. Lab testing later identified the eyeliner's lead content as 54%.\nInexpensive toys can also have lead in paint, metal or plastic. Vintage toys made before 1978, when lead paint was banned for residential use, or imported toys are more likely to contain the substance.\nIn 2007, for example, about 253,000 \"Sarge\" toys, a character from the Cars movie, were recalled by Mattel for containing lead paint, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\nAbout 675,000 Mattel Barbie accessory toys were also recalled that same year due to lead paint. Both toys were manufactured in China.\nThe non-profit organization Kids in Danger said recalls of children's products due to excessive lead content increased to 19 instances in 2022, the highest rate of lead-related recalls in the last 10 years, according to a 2023 document called \"Hidden Hazards: 2022 Children's Product Recalls.\" Nine lead-related recalls were announced in 2020.\n\"We really have to focus in on what will be permanent eradication of exposure and poisoning and that job needs to be finished,\" said Ruth Ann Norton, president and CEO of the Green and Healthy Homes Initiative.\n\"And that takes both funding and diligence.\" \n \n Caption: FDA VIA AP\n\n On Monday, Nov. 13, U.S. health officials are warning doctors to be on the lookout for possible cases of lead poisoning in children after at least 22 toddlers in 14 states were sickened by lead linked to tainted pouches of cinnamon apple puree and applesauce. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Complicated Crossroads\n\n December 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1754\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After high-profile mass shootings, calls to focus on mental health - including passing more red flag gun confiscation laws and expanding involuntary commitment statutes - have become as frequent as pushes for increased gun control.\"It's about mental health.\" has become a common refrain after shootings.\nThe mental health component of America's longstanding debate over guns and its crossroads with high-profile mass and school shootings is dotted with misperceptions and misunderstandings of the issue, what's already on the books and how red flag and commitment laws are and are not being used to help those in crisis from hurting themselves and others.\nThere are also civil liberties and constitutional questions regarding allowing the government and/or police to put someone in a mental hospital or take away their guns.\nPOLICE, 911 CALLS\nOne of the biggest challenges is that mental health action and interventions often start after an emergency 911 call to police when a crisis situation is already happening.\nIt's often a police officer rushing to a scene who is the first to deal with someone threatening or already harming themselves or others.\n\"The de facto response is still law enforcement,\" said Lisa Dailey, executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center, a Virginia-based group focused on civil commitment laws and other mental health issues.\nShe said the mental health system and approaches have to change that dynamic.\n\"They are not being implemented to get people the care that they need in the right time frame,\" Dailey said.\nDespite the talk of increasing mental health resources and putting a dent in long-held societal and family stigmas, Jack McDevitt, a professor of practice emeritus in criminology and criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston, said a 911 call is still frequently the entry point to law enforcement and other agencies response to a person going through a mental health crisis and potentially harming themselves or others.\nSometimes those police officers have no background information on a person's mental state or history of mental illness.\nMcDevitt, who has helped Massachusetts lawmakers with gun policy proposals, said it is important for 911 operators to be able to get information and mental health histories from callers. But that is not always easy in stressful and sometimes violent situations when emergency calls occur.\nHe sees merits in having counselors and social workers respond to some mental health calls and wellness checks that do not involve violence - with police sometimes in a support role.\nThat may help diffuse situations.\n\"They aren't the ones knocking on the door,\" said McDevitt, referring to programs in Florida, Wisconsin, Wyoming and other states.\n'PATCHWORK SYSTEM'\nAll U.S. states have some form of involuntary or civil commitment laws that allow for temporary or short-term placements in inpatient mental health settings, including hospitals, when a person shows serious signs of committing suicide or harming or killing others.\nThe landscape for those state laws is mixed with some states allowing for court-order holds and commitments related to substance abuse, according to a report by the Treatment Advocacy Center. five states - including Florida, California, New York, Wisconsin and Wyoming - allow for 72-hour holds.\nAnother seven states (such as Georgia and Texas) and the District of Columbia have 48-hour limits on the time someone can be involuntarily committed.\nEight states - including Maryland (30 hours), Delaware (24 hours) and Montana (the next business day) - have shorter time limits, according to TAC.\nSome state laws allow for family members to petition for commitments and there are situations where judges can impose holds related to substance abuse and self-harm.\nFor example, judges in Colorado can impose 180-days holds for substance abuse treatment.\n\"Our system is very patchwork,\" Dailey said.\nDailey said states need to look at how to better match mental health policies, including commitment laws, to the needs of patients. She said proper mental health treatment programs can take six months - not the 72-hour holds on the books in most states.\nDISINCENTIVES AND DIFFICULTIES\nThat varied and piecemeal approach isn't just related to varying state laws related to commitments and gun confiscation.\nMental health systems across the country are challenged by lack of inpatient facility capacity and a system where treatment, housing, employment and substance abuse services can be siloed.\n\"It's still really difficult to navigate the system,\" said Dailey, pointing to the lack of a central agency, information or support source for patients and their families.\nThat can leave individuals dealing with severe mental illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar and borderline personality disorders to navigate various bureaucracies while trying to overcome stigmas and fears of past and contemporary mistreatment of the \"mentally ill.\" \"Individuals have often had very bad experiences at inpatient or law enforcement settings,\" Dailey said.\nStigmas toward mental health continue including hospitalizations for patients worried about reactions from their families, friends and employers.\nThere are pushes in New York and some other states to allow for longer mandated hospitalizations and to make it easier for police and courts to involuntarily commit seriously mentally ill persons, including homeless people, after a series of high-profile assaults.\nSome bioethicists and mental health professionals argue that inpatient hospitalizations are not always the best treatment path for some patients.\nCivil libertarians worry expanding forced hospitalizations can lead to discriminatory treatment by courts and police of some classes of patients. There is plenty of history in the U.S. and other countries of political, religious and ethnic minorities as well as women being disproportionately \"put away\" by government authorities and mental health practitioners.\n\"Involuntary hospitalization is a serious deprivation of liberty that can be justified only in the narrow circumstance where there is mental illness and an imminent physical danger to the person to be committed or to others, evidenced by observed behavior, and where there is no less restrictive alternative. In such cases, strong procedural safeguards must be in place throughout to ensure that the due process rights of the individual are protected,\" said the New York Civil Liberties Union in response to state and local efforts to expand civil commitments.\nBut even if police and courts are more aggressive in pursuing forced hospitalizations, many states and regions lack the number of mental inpatient beds needed to accommodate such a push.\nPolice officers have to go through a number of legal and bureaucratic hoops to gain temporary and short-term holds.\n\"It'a big challenge,\" said Dailey, noting that officers can spend several hours going through the inpatient mental health process.\nSome states require specific staffing to transport an individual to a mental health hospital or another inpatient facility. And even then, police will find facilities completely full.\n\"It's much easier to bring them in and book them,\" she said.\nBY THE NUMBERS\nThe U.S. has seen a contemporary decline in the number of mental hospitals and institutionalized patients.\nIn 1955, when state mental asylums and short and long-term commitments were more common there were more than 500,000 beds nationally, according to the American Psychiatric Association.\nIn 1963, there were 800,000 mentally ill developmentally disabled persons kept in institutional settings - often at overcrowded and toxic mental hospitals, according to the Kennedy administration which pushed for systematic changes away from asylums.\nAs many as 1.5 million people were treated annually at those sanatoriums in the early 1960s.\nA study last year by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute Inc. showed there were still close to 471,500 patients at government-run, private and other mental hospitals in 1970.\nThat number stands at just 121,300 in 2020, the most recent data available.\nMoves toward de-institutionalization and U.S. health care business models focused away from inpatient settings have driven that trend.\nRED FLAG LAWS\nShootings in Maine in October that killed 18 people and injured 13 and at the University of Nevada Las Vegas Dec. 6 that killed three persons have sparked new looks at mental health approaches and red flag gun laws - especially after details of the New England killings by U.S. Army firearms instructor Robert Card emerged.\nTwenty-one states have so-called red flag laws on the books allowing for court and law enforcement to temporarily seize guns from individuals deemed likely to harm others or themselves.\nThose states include Nevada, Washington, Oregon, California, Florida, Maryland, Delaware, Illinois and New York, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, which supports increased gun control laws.\n\"Red flag laws are a tool law enforcement and others can use when somebody is clearly at high risk of doing something with a firearm, but they can't be arrested because no crime has been committed and they don't appear to need a mental health hold or qualify for one,\" said Amy Barnhorst, a psychiatrist at University of California, Davis, Health and a violence prevention expert in an analysis of the issue earlier this year.\nMaine's gun confiscation law requires an extra step of those states of having the individual question go through a mental health evaluation.\nMcDevitt said most of the time gun confiscations are done in response to concerns about potential suicide attempts and firearms are usually returned to their owners.\nIt can save some people from hurting themselves,\" said McDevitt, citing research showing for the laws can help reduce suicides.\nThere were 26,933 suicides committed with firearms in 2022 compared to with 19,592 homicides, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.\nSuicides by firearms made up 56.9% of all gun deaths and 54.4% of all suicides last year, according to CDC figures. McDevitt said owners often get guns back after anywhere between 30 days and six months depending on the state statute.\nPushes for additional red flags in other states face resistance from gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action worries red flag gun laws could be used by the government to take guns from critics and political opponents.\n'RARELY USED'\nDespite their increased advocacy, McDevitt said gun confiscation proceedings are rare.\n\"There aren't thousands and thousands of these things. They are pretty rarely used,\" he said.\nA 2022 analysis by the Associated Press said red flag laws have been little used due to lack of awareness and resistance from some sheriff 's offices and police departments to such policies on Second Amendment grounds.\nPart of that also stems from families being reluctant to broach the issue, McDevitt said.\n\"That's a very difficult conversation to have.\nMost people don't want to do that,\" he said. \n \n Caption: Bellevue Hospital in New York City is the oldest public hospital in the U.S. and is probably the country's most notable mental hospital via frequent references in movies and books as well as on television shows.\n\n Twenty-one U.S. states have implemented red flag laws that allow guns to be confiscated from individuals deemed mentally ill and a danger to themselves or others. Firearms account for the majority of suicides in the U.S. and more people take their own lives with guns than commit homicides with firearms. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The cat was turned into the Humane Society, which then contacted the Caroline County Health Department's Environmental Health Division to facilitate rabies testing.Any person in the vicinity of Legion Road should avoid contact with wildlife, feral cats, unknown animals and any animal (including cats or dogs) that appears sick or to exhibit signs of rabies. Additionally, all residents in the area are urged to make sure their pets and mammal livestock are up to date on rabies vaccinations.\nTo report a potentially rabid animal, contact Animal Control at (410) 820-1600 or the non-emergency line of the 911 Center at (410) 479-2222.\nPlease contact the Caroline County Health Department immediately if you have had, or may know of anyone who might have had, any possible human or animal exposure to a rabid animal at (410) 479-8045.\nIf you have an emergency regarding a potential rabid animal or exposure and are calling after normal business hours or on the weekend, call (410) 829-5910.\nAn exposure can mean contamination of open wounds, abrasions, mucous membranes or scratches by potentially contaminated with infectious material from a rabid animal.\nAdditionally, any penetration of the skin by teeth constitutes a bite exposure. All bites, regardless of body site, represent a potential risk of rabies transmission, but that risk varies with the species of biting animal, the site of the bite and the severity of the wound.\nRabies is a serious, but preventable viral disease that attacks the nervous system. It is predominantly seen in raccoons, bats and skunks, as well as dogs and cats.\nAll wild or unknown animals must be avoided whenever possible since the possibility of exposure to rabies can occur anywhere and anytime.\nPet owners should remember that the best way to protect themselves, their families and their pets is to keep their animals up to date on rabies vaccination.\nThe Health Department regularly offers low-cost rabies clinics to help residents protect their pets. The next clinic will be held in the spring. Please monitor the Health Department's Events Calendar for more information.\nFor more information about rabies, visit CDC's Rabies Prevention webpage at cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/index.html. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Sponsorship levels ranged from $5,000 or more to $250.\nAbout 130 people attended the preview party Friday, Dec. 1, to put in their bids for tiny, tabletop trees to elaborately decorated trees with extras, and everything in between.\nI think it's the best year yet,\" said Compass Hospice CEO Heather Guerieri Sunday afternoon.\n\"A lot of the same people do trees and sponsor over and over, and they just get more talented and more creative every year.\" Co-chairs of this year's festival were Melanie McMahan and Dave Whaley.\nWhen all the receipts were counted, the result was \"the most successful Festival of Trees to date,\" Baird wrote in a Dec. 15 email.\n\"It's been great,\" said Compass Hospice Development Director Shelly Baird Sunday afternoon.\n\"We have 76 trees, which is the most we've ever had.\" This is the sixth year the event has been held at the Towers Family Historical Museum on Sennett Road.\nOwners Bill and Gail Towers \"are so generous,\" Baird said. \"They host this and they donate and they're amazing.\" \"We just want the bids to go up,\" Gail Towers said, laughing as she imitated the chiming sound of new bids on the Trice Auctions website.\n\"I just can't wait till it starts bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.\" The preview party's \"Pick of the Tree Lot\" raffle raised $3,000. The winner, who could choose any tree in the display, chose \"Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire,\" a snowy, woodland-themed tree and extras donated by the Strzempka family. It was won by Jill Pugh of Shore Industries of Denton, one of the festival's sponsors.\nThe Strzempka family's 2022 tree won the raffle as well. Along with this year's tree, they donated a fire pit and supplies, as well as decorations created by family members from across the country.\nCreated in memory of the family patriarch who had been cared for by Compass Hospice at the end of his life, \"the whole family came three different days to get it perfect,\" Baird said.\n\"One of the granddaughters, I believe in Seattle, donated these hand blown icicles. Another grandchild made the skirts. These are handmade mittens by another family member,\" she said.\n\"I don't know all the stories, but I'm sure many of these other trees have a story,\" Baird said.\nAbout four trees sported a Grinch theme. Some trees were rustic, other elegant.\nSeveral tabletop trees were made of seashells. North Caroline High School's Spanish IV class created a \"We are Bulldogs!\" tree while Choptank Electric Cooperative honored 100 years of Disney.\nSome creators donated several trees; florist Sherry Councell created a dozen.\nFestival attendees picked up information for online bidding hosted by Trice Auctions of Denton. Bidding ended at 4 p.m. Sunday, and winners picked up their trees the following Monday and Tuesday.\nThe festival \"proceeds stay in Caroline County for hospice services and grief services,\" Guerieri said. \"We don't turn people away based on ability to pay if they don't have insurance for hospice.\" Baird said fundraisers like the Festival of Trees provides for Compass Hospices services in Caroline, Kent and Queen Anne's counties.\n\"We have to raise about $500,000 to $700,000 a year through donations\" because insurance doesn't cover every hospice service,\" Baird said.\n\"Our entire grief services support department is not covered by insurance, so all of about $400,000 of that goes to that department. We provide counseling to close to 800 people a year, and a lot of them were not even involved with hospice.\" Among them are children in each of the three counties' schools.\nCompass Hospice, based in Centreville, provides hospice and supportive care in-home and at the Barnette Center in Centreville and Arcadia Assisted Living in Denton; community grief support; and veterans services.\n\"This is just such a heartwarming experience to be able to volunteer and be among such a special group of people that do care, and their heart is in it,\" volunteer Connie Calloway Hutson said. \"That's the reason I do it. I'm just so proud that I can do it.\" Bill Towers said they sponsor fundraisers for hospice \"because it's an organization that needs some support.\" \"And he has a heart of gold,\" Gail Towers said.\n\"They do a great job.\nWe've never had to use hospice,\" Bill Towers said, as his wife added, \"It's one of those things that you're glad that they have it.\" \"But you hope you never have to use it,\" he said. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n From left, Compass Hospice Development Director Shelly Baird, volunteer Connie Calloway Hutson, volunteer Jody Herb and CEO Heather Guerieri wrap up the Festival of Trees Dec. 3 at Towers Family Historical Museum in Denton.\n\n CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n This detail is from the \"What a Treasure\" tree, donated by the Cory Family.\n\n CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n This Christmas Tree Farms tree was one of a dozen donated by Sherry Councell to Compass Hospice's Festival of Trees.\n\n CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Compass Hospice's Shelly Baird poses with this \"God Bless America\" tree donated by Nagel Farm Service.\n\n CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Bill and Gail Towers host the 2023 Compass Hospice Festival of Trees at their Towers Family Historical Museum in Denton. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trans patients face barriers to care\n\n December 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tommy Tucker; Capital News Service | Page: A9 | Section: News \n \n 840\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS - Paisley Parsons is 10 years into his medical gender-affirming transition, and a majority of that time he's spent looking for a good team of doctors in Maryland.Parsons, from near Hagerstown, had limited access to nearby care when starting his transition. Driving to Philadelphia, the District of Columbia or Baltimore were the best options to receive what he needed.\n\"It took me probably six or seven years to find a team of doctors that I felt like was up to par, but prior to that, finding someone educated and competent was few and far between,\" Parsons said. \"A lot of it was a proximity issue, and most doctors around me just had no idea about anything trans related.\" While access to gender-affirming care has improved since Parsons first started his transition, it still varies across Maryland.\n\"Some of my patients travel hours to see me,\" said Dr. Helene Hedian, the director of Clinical Education at Johns Hopkins' Center for Transgender and Gender Expansive Health in Baltimore. \"There has been an increased demand for services in the past year, which at times has led to long wait times.\" There is a concentration of qualified doctors in urban areas like D.C. and Baltimore, with less access the farther a patient is from a major city.\nFor those looking for a doctor with experience in gender-affirming care, Hedian recommends looking through the provider directory on GLMA: Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ Equality's website.\nThe directory confirms the concentration of doctors in urban areas. For example, a search for gender-affirming hormone therapy in Easton, shows the closest doctor is over an hour away in Baltimore, D.C. or Odenton, Maryland.\n\"Baltimore City is probably the nexus of the trans community in terms of access, but the wait times are really long for our experienced providers,\" said Lee Blinder, the executive director of Trans Maryland, a trans-led community organization.\n\"Many people in our more rural areas of the state, or even in some of our counties in our suburban areas, are not able to access an affirming provider.\" Blinder is a founder of Trans Maryland, formerly known as Trans Healthcare MD, which started as a community resource for connecting trans and non-binary residents to qualified practitioners.\n\"Trans Maryland started out of my own and our other co-founders' lack of access to gender-affirming care,\" said Blinder. \"We are extraordinarily lucky to be based in Maryland, certainly looking at the national landscape.\" In May this year, Gov.\nWes Moore signed the Trans Health Equity Act, which requires the state's medical assistance program and Medicaid to provide coverage for gender-affirming care beginning Jan. 1.\nMoore also signed an executive order in June, protecting anyone seeking gender-affirming care in Maryland from legal punishment by other states.\n\"Those two events in the past year have contributed to increased demand for gender care in the state of Maryland,\" said Hedian. \"People are traveling into the state, especially because in many states they're not able to receive the care that they used to get.\" As of 2022, 24,000 transgender adults live in Maryland, with an estimated 6,000 enrolled in Medicaid, according to a study by the Williams Institute on Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care.\nThe Maryland Department of Health estimated that the number of Medicaid enrollees seeking gender-affirming treatment under the bill would increase by approximately 25 individuals per year, up from 98 in 2022.\n\"We're aware of the issue and we know that being able to address health care shortages, (is) something that has been long standing within the state,\" Moore said to Capital News Service. \"I also know that things like the Trans Health Care Act was the right thing, in the right manner, and we want to make sure that our state is welcoming.\" Moore said that having the medical facilities and personnel to treat people is a priority, and that doctor and nursing shortages extend to other areas of medicine.\nTo adjust to the demand, Dr. Julius Joi Johnson-Weaver, a board-certified family physician, offers gender-affirming care through a program at their private practice. Johnson-Weaver is transgender and non-binary and has experienced many of the care-access issues their patients have dealt with.\nIt sparks a lot of anxiety, Johnson-Weaver said, when someone is ready to transition \"in whatever way it typically starts to feel urgent,\" and they are told, \"Oh yeah, it's gonna be six months, you know, or it's gonna take a long time to get an appointment.\" Del. Bonnie Cullison, D-Montgomery, vice-chairman of the House Health and Government Operations Committee, cosponsored the Trans Health Equity Act.\nShe said she is aware of the access issues and works closely with Trans Maryland to solve them. And, she said, she agrees with Moore that the bill was the right step for protecting health care for trans Marylanders.\nCullison encourages transgender constituents to reach out about these issues: \"Talk to us, keep us informed. Let us know what we can do policy-wise, or advocacy-wise.\" \n \n Caption: TOMMY TUCKER/CA PITAL NEWS SERVICE\n\n A poster at the University of Maryland Health Center in College Park reminds students to update their name and gender marker in the school's system, Friday, Dec. 1. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Nicole left behind six children.\nLast week, 19 children and teens aged 3 to 16 who lost one or both parents to addiction met at the Talbot County Sheriff's Office in Easton for the Christmas event.\nAfter a visit and gift from Santa, the group rode in a caravan with Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble and his deputies and staff to Target, where each child had $150 to spend and teens had $200 to spend any way they chose.\nThe kids fanned out with the sheriff and his crew and had a blast deciding what to buy. Target donated wrapping paper, bows and popcorn.\nAfter a generous Secret Santa paid for the gifts, the group headed back to the sheriff's office for a visit with an elf, hot chocolate and cookies, pizza and gift wrapping, plus an impromptu game of soccer with the sheriff.\nNicole's Promise also provided top wished-for gifts for 22 children in Talbot County and 30 children in Caroline County, thanks to Mid-Shore Restoring Hope in Women. In total, Nicole's Promise provided gifts this holiday season to 71 children and teens.\nGrace Street is the area's first recovery community organization. RCOs are a nationally recognized model that help bridge the gap between professional treatment and a successful life in long-term recovery through enhanced supports and services.\nChesapeake Charities received a one-year grant from Maryland's Opioid Operational Command Center to establish the Grace Street RCO.\nEaston's center delivers an assortment of non-clinical, community-centered, peer recovery support services, harm reduction resources, workforce training and development, youth programming, overdose prevention activities and resources and support groups. The center helps people establish healthy lifestyles and reacclimate into society while building recovery capital and working to reduce stigma often associated with addiction.\nGrace Street serves people in Easton and Talbot County and in neighboring counties across the Mid-Shore. Referrals are not necessary and services are free. The center is open weekdays and Sundays, 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. and Saturdays, 2 to 7 p.m. Daytime hours vary.\nFor more information, visit GraceStreetRecovery.org. \n \n Caption: CONTRIBUTED\n\n Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble, along with some of his deputies and staff, pose with Grace Street Program Director Kate Dulin and several children during Nicole's Promise in Easton.\n\n CONTRIBUTED\n\n Grace Street volunteer Michele Dyott, left, smiles during gift wrapping with Trent Acree, 11, and a Christmas elf during Nicole's Promise in Easton.\n\n CONTRIBUTED\n\n Talbot County Sheriff's Office Capt.

    "content": "'This is a game-changer' - Caroline moves forward with mobile health plans\n\n December 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 1074\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON - Caroline County is one step closer to a mobile integrated health program.Data compiled in a 71-page needs analysis report has set the stage for a grant request approved by the Caroline County Commissioners at their Dec. 5 meeting.\nPresenting highlights of the report were four members of an executive committee focused on the program and finding funding for it. They included Director of the Department of Emergency Services Mark Sheridan, Health Officer Robin Cahall, EMS Chief Kathy Jo Marvel and County Health Department Director of Nursing Holly Trice.\nExecutive committee members who were absent from the meeting are Chrissy Bartz, of the Basic Life Support Committee, and Dr. Jeffrey Uribe, Caroline County Medical Director.\nThe report describes the current medical needs of county residents, how and where emergency medical teams respond to them and how they can be better served by a more efficient and effective program.\n\"We don't want to just focus on reoccurring ambulance calls because that is a small part of it,\" Sheridan said. \"We want to look at the health of all the people in Caroline County and how can we provide that point of care that they may need.\" The goal of the mobile integrated healthcare program is \"a huge partnership with all of us coming together to basically take care of people,\" Sheridan said.\nThe report, initiated in spring 2023, was compiled by Annapolis-based Tetra Tech and funded by the Caroline County Basic Life Support Committee.\nIt substantiated what EMS has experienced, but it provided the data needed to seek grant funding from the Maryland Department of Health to create a mobile integrated health program.\nFollowing a nationwide trend, \"911 calls are getting more and more primary care-related and less emergency,\" Marvel said. Many of the calls EMS receives are from people who \"don't really need to go to the ER, which now has compounded into long ER wait times because they're using the ambulance and the ERs to treat what could be treated with primary care.\" Tetra Tech compiled call data and discovered \"69 unique addresses that generated the bulk of calls; 558 repeat calls, to be exact, to just 69 different addresses,\" Marvel said. \"It was a total of 70 individuals within those addresses that we could identify right now, just out of EMS, that are prime candidates for a mobile integrated health program.\" \"We don't want you to think we don't want to do 911 calls, but 911 is built for the emergency calls; they're not built for us to be going out into the public and taking care of these people,\" Marvel said. \"These people need other resources. The ER isn't good for them either, because you'd see a doctor once for blood pressure medicine, and then 30 days later you're out of that prescription and then you're going back to the ER for another 30 days for blood pressure medicine.\" The problem is \"the health care system as a whole,\" she said, not a single department or agency.\nA map of high density response areas verified what Sheridan and Marvel suspected. Most of the emergency responses were directed to \"high populated areas of foreign descent that came here and don't know how to ask for help or don't know how to get help.\" \"What we found through the study was 63% of the contacts that we do annually don't need a paramedic at all,\" Marvel said. \"We have limited access to health care\nWe have long transport times because we don't have a hospital.\" Lack of transportation to primary care has prompted Commission President Travis Breeding to call for a mobility on demand program.\n\"We have lack of follow up with primary care, and then the big one is always that transportation piece,\" Marvel said.\n\"So, what's our purpose and goal? We want to reduce those high-frequency EMS repeat callers, improve access to preventive health care in Caroline County - people need the right care when it's needed (and) a whole community effort\" as well as support from the county commission, Marvel said.\n\"All the resources have to be on the same page and somebody is going to have to manage this data,\" she said.\n\"And then we have to figure out what that sustainable funding is going to look like because we can't do it on our own.\" Armed with data from the Tetra Tech report, the executive committee is seeking a Community Health Resource Commission grant, so Cahall and Trice created a Health Equity Resource Communities request for proposal, which funds up to $1 million a year for five years.\nSpecifically, the committee is applying for \"a little over $2.7 million for a 5-year period,\" Cahall said. \"What we're looking at (is) five years' worth of personnel and training, vehicle purchase and maintenance, community outreach education, technology upgrades, and quality assurance and program evaluation.\" Instead of a trip to an emergency room or urgent care, a nurse or EMS clinician potentially will be able to assess a client's needs at home, possibly through a telehealth visit with a doctor, and then follow up with appropriate resources from other community partners, like the departments of health or social services.\nLetters of support for the grant application have come from University of Maryland Shore Regional Health, Choptank Community Health, the Mid-Shore Local Health Improvement Coalition, the BLS Committee, Caroline County Behavioral Health, DES, Dr. Uribe and others.\nEven if that funding doesn't come through, the committee is committed to moving forward with a mobile integrated health program in the county. \"We're going to keep going,\" Cahall said. \"We're still doing a strategic plan.\" The committee should hear if they've received the funding by mid-February.\nThe full report is online at www.carolinemd.org/DocumentCenter/View/9045/Caroline-County-MIH-Needs-Analysis.\nTo view the full Dec. 5 presentation to the County Commissioners, visit www.carolinemd.org/667/Live-Meetings, and click on the video link. \n \n Caption: SCREENSHOT\n\n Presenting highlights of the report to the Caroline County Commissioners Dec. 5 are four members of an executive committee focused on creating a mobile integrated health program.

Though the commission took effect last June 1, appointments were not completed until late October.\nThe commission also requested the ability to seek financial support mechanisms as it believes \"there may be opportunities in public health foundation-level support through grant mechanisms.\" The commission members requested the establishment of maryland.gov emails as well as the establishment of a website. The members also officially recognized the contributions of staff providing subject matter expertise and noted \"government-involved staffing helps facilitate the logistics and work of this commission.\" \"I think we all experienced the incredible challenge of the pandemic of the century in the past few years, and during that challenge recognized how incredibly strenuous the task was ahead of our public health force in particular, and the roadblocks and the gaps in public health, funding and resources really restricted our ability,\" said Dr. Meena Brewster, one of three co-chairs on the state board.\n\"We have a lot to do to be out there and be a part of this,\" said Lushniak, who added the commission has no hidden agendas and will be \"transparent.\" The next meeting will be held at 2 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 4, at the Baltimore County Department of Health.

Working in collaboration with primary and specialty care providers throughout the region, University of Maryland Shore Regional Health's Population Health team has made significant progress in the past year toward the goal of helping people with chronic diseases manage their conditions to maintain optimal health in their home settings.\"Population Health's case managers, transitional nurse navigators and pharmacists, and Shore Community Outreach team members are making a positive difference in the health and well-being of residents across the five-county region served by Shore Regional Health,\" said Nancy Bedell, director of Population Health.\n\"In addition to working with providers, they have established working relationships with many community organizations, government entities and employers, and maintained a strong presence at health fairs and other events where they can share information and resources to help individuals maintain their best health.\" Highlights of the Population Health team's activities in the past year include:\n▪ Community Case Management (Shore Community Outreach Team). This team, known at SCOT, enrolled 115 patients and conducted 920 home visits in Kent County. After six months, 75 patients identified as \"high utilizers\" realized an average decrease in health care charges of $5,919 per patient.\n▪ Medication Management. Visiting 10 senior centers throughout the five-county region every month, Population Health's transitional care pharmacist provided more than 500 consults to 1,500 participants, and additionally responded to more than 1,200 medication alerts.\n▪ Transitional Nurse Navigators (TNNs). Follow-up phone calls and home visits made by TNNs reached more than 20,000 patients and resolved more than 3,500 alerts. 75 percent within three days. They also followed 649 patients, many of whom ultimately transferred into support programs for those with heart failure, COPD and diabetes.\n▪ Heart Failure and Diabetes Continuums. 182 patients were enrolled in the HF Continuum, which includes acute care, cardiac rehab, rehab, cardiology and follow-up by the TNNs. In the Diabetes Continuum, inpatients with HgA1c greater than 9 were identified, provided a consult with a diabetes educator, and at discharge, referred to our Diabetes and Endocrinology Center.\nPatients retested six months later realized a 10 percent or more reduction in their HgA1c.\n▪ Health Equity. Population Health team members provided on-site screenings and education at Amick Farms and Angelica Nurseries. employers with a high percentage of employees from underserved populations. focusing on diabetes and heat-related illnesses. In Kent County, SCOT has worked with local church leaders to establish the African-American Women's Advisory Committee, which is offering health-related educational program targeted to the African American community.\n▪ Advance Directives. Population Health team members have partnered with a host of senior-focused organizations and residential care communities throughout the region to enable individuals to complete their advance directives and have them scanned into their electronic medical records (EMR). This ongoing initiative resulted in more than 1,000 advance directives completed and filed last year. \n \n Caption: Alma White of Calvert Heights Apartments in Chestertown, was among the local residents to get a blood pressure check from Shore Community Outreach Team Nurse Coordinator Emily Welsh in May 2023.\n\n University of Maryland Shore Regional Health Pharmacist Melanie Chapple, PharmD (left) is shown with Amick Farms Health Center team members Valerie Kriegisch, PA and Heather Bautista, CMA.

    "content": "Where life begins at the Talbot County Free Library\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Life \n \n 793\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In an article published in the Guardian in 2004, Sandi Toksvig recalled a lecture she attended while studying anthropology at Cambridge University.At one point, the professor held up a photograph of an antler bone with 28 markings on it. The lecturer told the assembled students that scholars considered the antler \"to be man's first attempt at a calendar.\" But the professor, a woman, wasn't finished. \"Tell me,\" she went on, \"what man needs to keep track of when 28 days have passed?\"\nI came across this delightful story in Leah Hazard's new book \"Womb: The Inside Story of Where We All Began\" (612.627 HAZA), now available for check-out at the Talbot County Free Library.\nI have to admit, when I first saw the work sitting on the library's New Books shelf, my initial, perfectly male response was to look away, as if I had inadvertently caught sight of something I shouldn't have.\nI had a similar response as a pre-med student eons ago, when I saw my first illustration of the female reproductive organs. I remember taking one look at that cascade of complex anatomical structures — ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, vagina — and thinking that Ob-Gyn was not in the cards for me. All over the world, women sighed in relief.\nBut I'm considerably older now and, hopefully, a tad wiser. And so, bravely and forthrightly, I removed the volume from its shelf, held its cover to my chest, walked over to the desk, checked it out to myself, and then smuggled it, unseen, out of the building.\nAnd I'm so glad I did.\nHazard is a Harvard graduate who works now as a midwife in the U.K. She is also an excellent writer with a wicked sense of humor.\nReading her book, I discovered that I was not the only male to take one look at the inner workings of the female reproductive system and pale.\nSince men came to dominate the field of obstetrics, their patients have been subjected to any number of pejorative diagnoses (\"hostile uterus,\" \"irritable uterus,\" \"incompetent cervix,\" etc.) that reflect this male discomfort with any anatomy other than their own: but it was not always thus.\nThirty-some-odd years ago, I read Laurel Thatcher Ulrich's ground-breaking history \"A Midwife's Tale,\" based on a diary Ulrich discovered in a long-forgotten corner of the Maine State Library.\nThe diary was maintained from 1785 to 1812 by a midwife named Martha Ballard. Ballard used the diary as a sort of ledger, keeping meticulous, coded records of her methods, successes and failures as she rode back and forth across the frontiers of New England delivering babies.\nFrom Ulrich's book I learned that when male doctors began to encroach in the early nineteenth century upon the heretofore feminine domain of birthing, infant and maternal mortality soared. It wasn't until the first decades of the twentieth century that \"modern medicine\" began to achieve the same success rate midwives had enjoyed for hundreds of years.\nFrom Hazard's book I learned many of the reasons why.\nA midwife like Martha Ballard didn't just attend at a birth. She moved in with her patient; cooked her meals; administered soothing, effective herbs; delivered the baby and then remained in place until she was certain both patient and child could survive on their own — her entire visit often lasting days, even weeks.\nThe French word for midwife is accoucheur — literally \"the person at the bedside.\" But with the advent of male physicians, the caregiver moved from the woman's side to her feet. The word \"obstetrics\" comes from the Latin obstare, \"to stand opposite.\"\nMale doctors first began \"to stand opposite\" women giving birth as the Industrial Revolution was getting underway, and unsurprisingly their approach to the process took on a decidedly industrial air. Speed was of the essence.\nIn 1807, Yale-trained physician Joseph Stearns admitted in a letter to a colleague that he had learned about ergot (a fungus found on wheat crops) from \"an ignorant Scottish midwife,\" but went on to report, \"It expedites lingering parturition, and saves … a considerable portion of time …. Since I have adopted the use of this powder I have seldom found a case that detained me more than three hours.\"\nSoon, in their rush to speed up the process, doctors were using — with increasingly deleterious effects — much higher doses than the \"diluted thimbleful\" of ergot recommended by midwives.\nBut Hazard's book serves as more than just a corrective to the customary patriarchal view of the female reproductive system. In the images she conjures of the inner workings of the womb — the little unseen miracles of cervical crypts, blastulae, uterine milk and even menopause — she returns to us the mystery and majesty of what a woman, being a woman, lives through and accomplishes. We men can only look on in awe. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Health department recommends making condoms available at local high school\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LAURA TAYMAN | Section: News \n \n 643\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last month, Kent County Board of Education members were provided stark facts about the rise in sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in the community, the state, and the country at its recent monthly meeting.Ashley Minietta, communicable disease and family planning contact for the Kent County Department of Health, made a presentation to the board before the holiday break, saying the solution to reversing the trend is \"to provide ground support, monitor trends, and turn data into action.\"\n\"While 20% of Marylanders have an STD, almost half of the cases are ages 15-24,\" Minietta said, citing the 2020 U.S. census map — putting Maryland in the South region of the country, \"It's one of the highest rates in the region.\"\nMinietta said the barriers to effectively preventing both STDs and teenage pregnancies in Kent County are lack of education, the cost of birth control, parental resistance to alternatives, lack of public transportation, the geographic barriers of the rural area and lack of health care options.\nTeen pregnancy rates are down, Minietta said, because parents have been proactive with putting teenage daughters on birth control. But pills and IUDs do not allow the prevention of STDs that can lead to long-term health consequences.\n\"Research in 2020 shows only 9% of sexually active high school students used a condom,\" Minetta said. \"That has only increased.\"\nMinetta shared various ways local school systems are providing a condom availability program to meet the needs of their high school students, including those in Queen Anne's, Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot and Wicomico counties, and counties on the western shore.\nWhile some have availability through the school's nurse's office, others provide a \"brown bag\" approach, where students can pick up a paper bag on an anonymous basis.\nBoard member Aretha Dorsey said that as a parent she was concerned that a program like that would encourage secrets among parents and their children.\n\"I feel like parents' rights are being taken away,\" Dorsey said. \"I believe that kids might form a lack of respect for their parents and think they can do things their own way.\"\nBoard member Francois Sullivan said Kent County and its rural location is a valid argument for such a program.\n\"There is a difference between a nurse providing condoms and a cashier.\"\nWhen asked to share her opinion, student board member Madison Messick said she couldn't even remember her sex education class.\n\"I think this is really important,\" she said. \"There is a stigma. We can't go to Walgreens because we know the cashier. I know kids that would definitely benefit from this.\"\nVienna Walker, supervisor of student services for the Board, said she recommended the board adopt a policy where Kent County students can meet with a high school nurse and ask for information and guidance.\nSuperintendent Karen Couch said she had been asked by parents how students could be opted out of a program if they don't approve. Walker said she would need to check with the state's Department of Education to see how that could be handled.\n\"Some students have much more open communication with school nurses than their parents,\" Walker said. \"Their office is much less threatening to students who then become comfortable enough to come back if they are not feeling great.\"\nThat is Walker's goal. She recommended the board consider approving a program that requires students to visit nurses who can provide education and guidance on condom use.\n\"Nurses also encourage students to be open and honest with their parents,\" Walker said.\nMessick agreed.\n\"Students will participate not because kids don't trust their parents,\" she said. \"The program encourages conversations between parents and their children. It's like therapy where they can't tell parents what their child is talking about. This actually helps to form a better relationship between students and parents.\"\nSchool Board President Joe Goetz said he would like for Walker to get information from other districts on how they manage parent objections.\n\"I think real life examples would help,\" Goetz said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Endurance athlete dominates diabetes: Rock Hall resident raises over $1,000 for the cause\n\n January 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1133\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ROCK HALL — Early in 2023, Phil Anderson, a Rock Hall resident of 10 years, underwent open heart surgery, a triple bypass, due to uncontrolled diabetes.He went into the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia with feelings of anger at his predicament. As a former Gold's Gym owner, a participant in countless endurance races and someone who was confident of being one of the fittest people in the room, the situation confounded him.\nWith support from his family, he had a successful surgery. His doctor assured him that for a man like him, who spent years exercising and practicing good dietary habits, the surgery would be like giving a tune-up to a car.\nWith that confidence, and a mindset of setting goals and overseeing steps to carry them through, he asked himself how he could give back.\nHow could he help society based on his current experience?\nFour months out of surgery, he signed up for the American Diabetes Association's Tour de Cure, a \"metric century,\" a 62-mile bicycle ride to raise funds for the organization. The beauty of the Tour de Cure for Anderson was the ride was completed independently at any place and time chosen by the rider.\nTraining for it began in Rock Hall.\nAnderson's goal was to cycle five miles the first week, then each following week he'd tack on five extra, until, after 12 weeks he'd reach 60 miles.\nWhile he trained, he fundraised. Rock Hall locals frequently saw him at the grocery store with a table set up, or holding a raffle at the Pirates and Wenches event on Aug. 11.\nHe planned to do the metric century in September on a Saturday, but anticipating storms over the weekend, he bumped it to Friday.\nThat day was windy, he recalled.\nPedaling his Gary Fisher hybrid bike, he made the circuit all around Kent County.\nStarting in Rock Hall, Anderson headed east to Chestertown, cycled north to Kennedyville, took some of the large hills at Galena, stopped at Massey Air Museum to take a photo, back to Chestertown, then home to Rock Hall.\nHe rode 65 miles in five hours.\nFor Anderson, it was one of many endurance races and events, but this was special in a different way.\nHe raised $1,260, placing 18th nationally, becoming one of 30 nationwide tour champions.\nAnderson thanked all the businesses and private donors that reached out to him, impressed with the way Kent County gave; Rock Hall specifically.\nThere were many to thank, but some of the most generous contributions came from Donna Walls at Harbor Shack restaurant, Suzanne Einstein at Blue Crab Sailing Charters, Andrew Carroll at Bayside Market and Amy Mitchell and Jim Rich at Java Rock, key supporters.\n\"All of this came from a town of less than 2,000 people,\" Anderson said.\nAlways setting new, reachable goals for himself, he didn't stop at the Tour de Cure.\nAfter that, with a good friend, he completed the Chestertown Challenge, a half marathon.\nThen on Veteran's Day, Nov. 11, he hiked 11 miles through Rock Hall. Anderson wore a 22-pound weighted vest representing the 22 veterans who commit suicide every day.\nHe chose to walk an extra mile to symbolize the extra mile veterans go to secure our freedoms.\n\"To everyone who served, thank you,\" Anderson said.\nAdding creativity to his planning strategies and good health, Anderson extends his hand to help those in need. He does it because diabetes was an eye-opener for him that started a lifelong journey to wellness.\nDespite having his surgery later in life, he was diagnosed with diabetes in his 30s, driven by a lifestyle of being on the road while working for various publications and newspapers throughout Pennsylvania. When he received his diagnosis, he asked his doctor what he should do.\nDiet and exercise, the doctor suggested.\nAnderson did just that. He lost 100 pounds, then started exercising. He became a competitive runner and cycler, competing in duathlons and snowboard competitions. He recalled cycling from Orlando to Miami, 250 miles, in three days.\nDuring his health pursuit, he learned about what his body needed, how to build and maintain muscle and how to avoid unhealthy habits.\n\"That started a second career path. So in my 40s, I told myself, I know just as much as the average guy in the gym,\" Anderson said.\nUsing that knowledge, he ran his own personal training studio.\nHowever, the habits to maintain his health went to the wayside when he moved to the Eastern Shore. As stated on his fundraising page, as a Type 2 diabetic, he never made a real effort to treat his condition, thinking that diet and exercise would be enough to suppress the effects of the disease.\nDiabetes, Anderson described, was like an invisible slide.\nHe assumed since he was always exercising, and not overweight, he'd be alright. Any symptom he had, he could attribute it to something else.\nIf he was always thirsty, it was because he was an athlete, exerting himself. If his eyesight was worsening, it was typical of old age.\nThen in October, 2022, thinking he had really bad heartburn, he sat on the couch, in pain. Like a cycler biking against the wind, he tried to ride it out. He even started thinking he might have had a heart attack.\nLater, doing tests, talking with his doctor, he learned it was out-of-control diabetes.\n\"In the hospital, I found out my blood sugar level was four times the normal person's, and three out of four arteries were blocked.\"\nThis was a shock to him, especially since in that condition, he had hiked 19 miles of the Appalachian trail with a 30-pound backpack.\nHow could he do that with three blocked arteries? he asked.\nNo other choice, the surgery had to happen.\nIt sobered him further about diabetes, and strengthened his resolve to help people accomplish their health goals.\nOf all the things Anderson's learned, he said there are four things to prevent that invisible slide he experienced. Pay attention to your body. Try and move more. Get better sleep. And find a hobby to reduce stress.\nPerhaps for Anderson this is a resurgence in his second career. He's planning on getting back in the wellness industry where he'll instruct clients how to develop a base level setting goals then optimizing it for efficiency.\nHe says it is crucial to have a vision before starting any exercise or nutrition plans.\n\"It may be to kick around the soccer ball with your grandkids,\" Anderson said. \"Whatever it is, it needs to begin with an image. Then it's following the rules of your routine.\"\nAnderson, as he's demonstrated in his life, has the results to prove these methods work.\nAs of right now, he's off insulin shots, only taking a few pills a day. His most recent tests indicate he's at the range of high to normal.\nDiabetes can be prevailed over.\nIt takes vision, effort, and making a promise to yourself, Anderson said.\n\"If you can't keep a promise to yourself,\" he added, \"then how can anybody else trust you?\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Many use this time to make New Years resolutions — promises to do better. Start going to the gym. Start eating right. Start going to church more often. These are all good things.\nBut too often these resolutions are short-lived.\nI believe that in order to continue pursuing our resolutions and goals, there are three significant things in 2024 that we must also be challenged to quit. It is time to quit making excuses, quit procrastinating and quit complaining.\nMost likely you can look back and find many occasions last year where you found yourself making excuses by saying, \"I cannot do this because I am too old, too young, too tall, too overwhelmed, too poor, too busy, not smart enough, not prepared enough.\"\n\"So, I'll put it off until tomorrow. I'll do it later. I'll start when I have more time or energy or money.\"\nThis then leads to complaining. We complain because we aren't where we want to be or because we don't have what we want or because life hasn't given us what we feel we deserve. We complain because we are too old, too young, too tall, too overwhelmed, too poor, too busy, not smart enough, not prepared enough. And it becomes an endless cycle: make excuses, procrastinate, complain.\nWhat if this year we were to quit making excuses, quit procrastinating and quit complaining about our situation and instead took action with God's help to continue pursuing the significant changes in our lives.\nI believe that 2024 could be our best year so far. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Department of Aging funding anticipated to remain flat, secretary says\n\n January 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: General Assembly \n \n 443\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Funding for the Maryland Department of Aging is expected to remain flat over the coming year, according to Maryland Secretary of Aging Carmel Roques.The secretary's comment came after Del. Chris Adams (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) asked if there were concerns about the department's budget outcome during an Eastern Shore Delegation meeting Friday morning.\nConcerns are not with losing funding, but with an anticipated inability to grow funding.\n\"The okay news is we don't anticipate our funding to be cut, but we're not going to have additional funding,\" Roques said. \"And the way we're going to try and make that a better situation is the way we engage with, in a collaborative fashion, … our health and our housing agencies.\"\nThe majority of the department's funding comes from the federal government. State funding comprises a smaller portion of the dollars the department has to distribute.\nIn fiscal year 2024, Upper Shore Aging, the designated area agency on aging for Talbot, Caroline and Kent counties, received almost $782,000 from the state Department of Aging.\nQueen Anne's County received about $333,000, and Cecil County received roughly $554,000.\nMAC Inc., which is the area agency for Dorchester, Somerset, Wicomico and Worcester counties, received just over $1.3 million.\nKnowing the funding was unlikely to grow, the department took steps early on to maximize the funding available to direct it more effectively at the local level, Roques said.\nThose steps included working with stakeholder groups to look at three state programs — subsidized assisted living, congregate living and senior care money — to think about redesigning the long-term services and supports system in place from the state funding.\nAccording to Roques, the work being done now will not \"dramatically\" change anything about fiscal year 2025, but it will in the coming years.\nThe Administration on Community Living, a federal agency that increases access to community supports for older adults and those with disabilities, also recently changed regulations to include guidance that will impact equity, she said.\nRoques said the update to the regulations is \"good news\" for the rural elderly population, their families and care providers.\nThe state's rural communities have the highest populations of adults age 50 and older, according to data shared during her presentation.\nThe rural counties on the Eastern Shore have some of the highest numbers. In 2020, 50.8% of Talbot County's population was over age 50.\nMaryland's overall population is rapidly growing older. In the next six years, the state will see more residents over 60 than under 18 — a first, Roques said.\n\"...What's being baked into that guidance is that rural communities need to be more heavily weighted in the formula for distribution of funds to recognize that their challenges are very different,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Howard Anthony Community Service Award.For All Seasons is a behavioral health and rape crisis center. They are also the only agency in Talbot County doing this work in Spanish and English.\nThey bring in 20 to 25 new people a week for their new no wait five-days-a-week services. Because of COVID-19 they got skillful at telehealth and now offer services in all 24 jurisdictions in Maryland.\nAccording to Beth Spurry, the president and owner of Wye Finanicial Trust and a mentor of Dorman's, in the past decade, Dorman has taken the organization from just 24 employees to over 100, most of whom are women.\n\"Because those nearly 100 employees that are meeting the mental health, the rape crisis needs of our community are the employees that are handling the toughest of the tough and doing it with a smile on their face. I have a smile on my face because of them. So thank you for this award,\" Dorman said.\nA few days after the award was announced, she reflected.\n\"It is their largest award. I was first a part of Rotary when I first got out of college. It was called a group study exchange,\" Dorman said. \"The group study is a professional exchange. I was given the opportunity to apply to be a part of a group that traveled to Japan. I was there for six weeks. I visited higher ed places in the Ibaraki Prefecture.\"\nIt is a specialized award. You cannot have been in Rotary for 10 years. You have to have lived and worked in the community in which you were serving for 10 years.\n\"It is a big deal for them. They have an opportunity to pick one person from the community. So I was blown away when he (Tom Hill) called me and told me that it was going to be me,\" Dorman said.\n\"I think it brings to light the importance of living through service in your community. That is the core of who I am, as far as servant leadership. I am as good as the team I have put together. We continue to serve in the community. It spurs a conversation about the importance of service no matter how big or small,\" Dorman said.\nFor All Seasons hosts many events throughout the year, like the backpack giveaway and Frosty's Holiday Village, that reach thousands of people.\n\"In all of that, the biggest piece for me is providing an example for my children, for women, for girls, for young people. My kids know I am busy and on my phone all the time, but they always know I am doing really important work. And that plants in them that they can be someone in the community,\" Dorman said.\nShe said she has a supportive team that helps her. Starting with her husband and her kids, Dave and Melinda Finley at Anchor Church on Goldsboro, Alice Ryan of the Women and Girls Fund, and Spurry.\n\"I was given a huge gift at the awards ceremony in having her (Spurry) be the person to present me the award. Beth has not only been a guiding light, but a pretty strong mentor. She will say, 'I think you can do better and here is why.' She has been an incredibly encouraging mentor,\" Dorman said.\nShe said this was a really important moment in her career.\n\"If all fell away tomorrow, this is the community that has supported me as I am supporting them. I will have a part of the Anthony family legacy forever and be able to say here is the impact I had in the community, which I call home,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We are the YMCA. We don't want to compete with any other area gyms. We are a YMCA and our motto is 'from cradle to grave' and 'diapers to diapers'.\"\nThis community home welcomes all ages to get active and stay healthy for their lifetime.\nChildren up to 12 years old are welcome to join the \"Stay and Play\" program that encourages parents to \"work out or take a class while your kids have fun in a safe environment.\" The large Stay and Play playroom is full of toys, coloring, a large play boat, a kitchen set, a slide, dolls, and strollers.\nIn addition to the inside play area, the Stay and Play room has an outside playground as well.\nIn addition to the Stay and Play room, children can participate in many other activities at the YMCA, including day camp, swim lessons and birthday parties. For an additional fee, members and non-members can sign their children up for \"Schools Day Out\" days for ages 4 to 12 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. to help with child care when schools are closed.\nFinancial assistance is available for both YMCA memberships and programs due to generous volunteer donations. In addition, the YMCA can be rented for birthdays and other parties with pizza and swimming for a reasonable price.\nOlder children and teens get an added bonus at the YMCA. Once a child is 11 years old, he or she can sign up at the front desk to take a class to be trained on the workout machines.\nThis personalized, youth class explains and shows how to safely use the workout equipment.\nEach machine has a code to scan to show a \"how-to\" video as well.\nA diverse community of members of all ages are present at the YMCA classes too. Classes like cycling, boxing, strength circuit, barre, pilates, body combat, step and more run from early morning into the evenings. These classes have members from about 11 years old to 80 years old and beyond.\nThe sense of community is so strong, with generations passionately working out together with the goals of being healthy and staying active.\nAs adults become older, the YMCA offers many opportunities with their Active Aging Center.\nAdults, 50 years or older, can register to be a part of the Active Aging Center. Participants do not need to be a member at the YMCA to attend Active Aging Adult events, but a YMCA membership increases the number of programs available to the member.\nThe Active Aging Center offers classes that include: walking track, pool laps, aqua zumba, creative club, lottery bingo, puzzle time, dominoes, barre class and more.\nFor the month of January, there is no joining fee for YMCA memberships, a $75 savings. The YMCA is always looking for volunteers, donors, members and workers too.\nFor more information, go to ymcachesapeake.org or call 443-262-9994. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Certificate of need approved for new regional medical center in Easton\n\n January 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Local News \n \n 880\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Maryland Health Care Commission unanimously approved the University of Maryland Shore Regional Health's certificate of need application on Thursday, marking a significant step forward in bringing the new regional medical center in Easton to reality.The approval came the day after Gov. Wes Moore released his fiscal year 2025 budget proposal with $100 million in funding for the hospital over four years.\nThe newly approved certificate of need authorizes UM Shore Regional Health to implement its regional medical center project with the approved spending outlined in its application.\nHowever, the application was approved with several conditions imposed by the commission. These ask the health system to provide patients with information, upon inquiry or as required by law, concerning an estimate of out-of-pocket charges prior to arriving for surgery and to provide detailed updates on its progress toward obtaining state funding.\nIf UM Shore Regional Health fails to secure the in projected state funding by July 2027, the system must request a project change to amend its source of funding. The money in the governor's budget must be approved by the state legislature to clear that hurdle.\nThis isn't the first application the hospital system has submitted to the Maryland Health Care Commission.\nA certificate of need application was filed in 2012 for a similar project on the same site. Though that application was docketed, it was withdrawn in mid-2018 because the project had changed significantly after the docketing.\nA second similar certificate of need application was filed in September 2018, but the commission's review was deferred at the health system's request, according to the 2023 certificate of need application submitted by UM Shore Regional Health.\nThe estimated cost of the project is $539.5 million.\nImprovements to the new medical center include all private rooms (a change from the predominantly semi-private rooms in the current hospital), heartbeat monitoring in all rooms, a dedicated 25-bed observation unit, three behavioral health holding rooms and larger operating rooms, according to Moira Lawson, the program manager for the commission's certificate of need division.\nThe six-story 325,000-square-foot, 147-bed hospital will replace the existing hospital on Washington Street in Easton, a majority of which was built between 1955 and 1975, according to Maryland Health Care Commission documents.\nThe new facility is slated to occupy just over 235 acres off of Longwoods Road near U.S. Route 50 in Easton, about 3.5 miles from the hospital's current location.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook said the approval of UM Shore Regional Health's certificate of need was \"a significant step forward in our mission of getting a new, state-of-the-art, regional medical center in Easton.\"\n\"I'm grateful to Gov. Moore and his administration for their support in our journey in building a new facility that will serve our community for decades to come,\" she said in an email.\nCook also extended gratitude to UM Shore Regional Health President and CEO Ken Kozel and his team for their \"tireless efforts\" in moving the project forward.\n\"This has been a top priority for the residents of our town, and I know they'll be excited to hear this news,\" she said.\nThe Town of Easton is ready to help support the planning and construction of the new hospital, Cook added.\nThe governor's capital budget proposes allocating $20 million in funding every year for the next three fiscal years and a $30 million allocation in fiscal year 2028.\nThe proposed funding for the regional medical center adds on to the $10 million received in the state's fiscal year 2024 budget, which must be spent by the end of June.\nKozel called the news an \"incredible step forward,\" thanking the governor, lieutenant governor and the \"dedicated\" delegation to the General Assembly.\n\"This commitment from the Moore-Miller Administration and the state of Maryland reflects a remarkable pledge to the future of rural health care and to the people of the Eastern Shore of Maryland,\" Kozel said in a news release Thursday. \"Our patients and communities will benefit from this investment for generations, as will our team members who will have the opportunity to deliver world-class care in a modern facility.\"\nTalbot County Council President Chuck Callahan also expressed gratitude to the governor for the funding allocation.\n\"I can't thank him enough,\" he said. \"I personally talked to him several months ago and asked him to be beside us and work with us here on the Shore, and that's what he did — he looked out for us, and I can't thank him enough, and this council can't thank him enough, and the citizens of Talbot County (can't thank him enough).\"\nSen. Johnny Mautz (R-Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Wicomico) said the funding was a step in the right direction.\nIn December 2022, former Gov. Larry Hogan earmarked $100 million for the project in his fiscal year 2024 budget recommendation announcement — a number that wasn't quite reached when last year's budgeting process was completed.\nThe hospital system began engaging with the Hogan administration in early to mid-2022 and originally asked for $100 million, according to Trena Williamson, the regional director of communications and marketing for UM Shore Regional Health. That work continued with Moore's administration last January.\n\"It isn't (the) $100 million that's being requested; however, it is a pledge, and I think it's a good faith effort on behalf of the administration to move the project,\" Mautz said.\nLate last year, hospital officials said they hope to begin construction in late spring 2024. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Job hunters get a free makeover at Grace Street\n\n January 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 381\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The building on Ocean Gateway between the astrologer and Starbucks is the home of Grace Street, a recovery community for those affected by substance use disorder.But on Thursday, Jan. 18, the center's parking lot and office became the site of a variety of local nonprofits, who gathered to offer their services to locals seeking some confidence to bolster their job searches.\nOne vendor came hurtling into the parking lot in a utility van filled with men's clothing. Sharp Dressed Man, a nonprofit based in Baltimore, offered free suits to men who could use a new look.\nPinstripes, cashmere and bundles of Bombas socks were laid out next to a black leather overcoat.\n\"The idea is we take the van out full and bring it back empty. We call it the Sharp Dressed Van,\" said Christopher Schafer, founder of Sharp Dressed Man.\nPeople from the community lined up to figure out their size and pick out a whole new look. At first they were a little shy, but once they started trying something on, they got excited.\n\"We are doing so much to try and help people to build some confidence and get ready for the workforce with fresh suits, coats, dress shirts, and they have got socks with the partnership with Bombas,\" said Founder of Grace Street Kelley Callaghan.\nInside Grace Street, a host of other services were offered.\nThere were harm reduction materials available for free, including at the region's sole harm reduction vending machine, which includes Narcan, the life-saving opioid overdose reversal medication.\nAlso available are Fentanyl test strips, Xylazine test strips, safer sex items, sharps disposal and hygiene items. They had shelves full of free HIV tests and condoms in a basket.\nLater in the day, free haircuts were performed by Big Mixx Beautiful Beginnings Unisex Salon of Chestertown, as well as several workshops and free health services.\n\"We have a credit workshop inside with Devon Hainey, the branch manager with Truist Bank. We have a mock interview workshop with BAAM. There was HIV and Hep C testing with Talbot County Health Department. We are connecting people to resources,\" Callaghan said.\nShe summed it up.\n\"We have already gotten 20 guys suited up that are going to come out of here with a fresh cut, a fresh attitude. If you look good, you feel good,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "New Centreville YMCA offers programs for both physical and social development\n\n January 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TAMARA FORTE Special to the Bay Times Record Observer | Section: Local News \n \n 1469\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — As the Queen Anne's County Family YMCA opened its doors in October, they also opened a new home to the community.The beautiful, new structure for the YMCA of the Chesapeake is located on 210 Vincit St. in Centreville and is welcoming, clean, state-of-the-art and bursting with friendly energy. The YMCA membership pamphlet states, \"A better you makes a better us. With the Y, you're not just a member of a facility, you're a part of a cause. With a shared commitment to nurturing the potential of kids, improving health and well-being, and giving back and supporting our neighbors, your membership will not just bring about meaningful change in yourself, but also in your community.\"\nLaura Feller, wellness and membership director at the Centreville YMCA, explains, \"Most people think it is a gym, but we are not. We are the YMCA. We don't want to compete with any other area gyms. We are a YMCA and our motto is 'from cradle to grave' and 'diapers to diapers'.\"\nAlthough many might chuckle at those mottos, they are quite evident from the moment you walk in the doors. This community home welcomes all ages to get active and stay healthy for their lifetime.\nChildren are not only welcomed to come, but they are also encouraged to be an active part of the YMCA family. Children up to 12 years old are welcome to join the \"Stay and Play\" program that encourages parents to \"work out or take a class while your kids have fun in a safe environment.\" The large Stay and Play playroom is full of toys, coloring, a large play boat, a kitchen set, a slide, dolls, and strollers.\nIn addition to the inside play area, the Stay and Play room has an outside playground as well.\nOne Stay and Play worker said, \"It's a good location. Everybody's so nice and welcoming. I like staying active and have coached little kids. This [YMCA] helps me stay active. The kids here aren't allowed to have technology [in the Stay and Play]. They have to go and play tag [and other games and activities]. They are restless from school, and this is their recess.\"\nWithout the distraction of technology, kids are enjoying each others' company, increasing their imaginative play and learning good social skills as well. Brielle Forte (age 5) always asks to go to the Stay and Play and shares, \"My favorite part of the Y is playing outside when we play tag and hide and seek. I like playing in the boat and running on the track too.\"\nIn addition to the Stay and Play room, children can participate in many other activities at the YMCA including day camp, swim lessons and even have a birthday party. For an additional fee, members and non-members can sign their children up for \"Schools Day Out\" days for ages 4-12 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. to help with child care when schools are closed.\nSwim lessons are also open and run through March 8. Although the swim lessons are an extra fee, Feller said, \"All people and all children on the Shore should know how to swim. We are so close to the water. Getting healthy should not be a luxury that only some people can afford. Swimming is a life skill.\"\nFinancial assistance is available for both YMCA memberships and programs due to generous volunteer donations. In addition, the YMCA can be rented for birthdays and other parties with pizza and swimming for a reasonable price.\nOlder children and teens get an added bonus at the YMCA. Once a child is 11 years old, he or she can sign up, at the front desk, to take a class to be trained on the workout machines. This personalized, youth class explains and shows how to safely use the workout equipment. This informative class is helpful for all ages and guides users on how to change the settings and use the machines for the most beneficial outcomes.\nEach machine has a code to scan to show a \"how-to\" video as well.\nJax Forte (age 11) said, \"I like the machines. It gives you an opportunity to use things you don't have at your house.\"\nHis brother, Ryland Forte (age 13), said, \"I love being able to workout. It makes me feel so much better. It makes me happier and stronger for the day.\"\nA diverse community of members of all ages are present at the YMCA classes too. Classes like cycling, boxing, strength circuit, barre, pilates, body combat, step and more run from early morning into the evenings. These classes have members from about 11 years old to 80 years old and beyond.\nThe sense of community is so strong with generations passionately working out together with the goals of being healthy and staying active.\nWayne Outlaw, a YMCA instructor, said, \"I just wanted to help out with a need. I want to take all those obstacles [associated with working out] out of the way. I teach a stretch class, body combat, core and low intensity HIIT. I just love exercise.\"\nOne participant in Outlaw's class said, \"I am 57. I am doing a seven-day trial right now [at the Y]. So far, so good. I love the classes. Some gyms there are just machines and no classes. After not working out for a long time, these classes help me get back into working out.\"\nWhether you are an avid fitness class participant or a first timer, each class offers something for everyone. The modifications and choices allow each member to work as hard as they want or need to.\nCommunity members of all ages are enjoying more than just the classes. Walking the track is a favorite for all ages. At any point, you can see young children running or walking with their families, couples or friends connecting and catching up while walking, as well as others running to train and strengthen their bodies.\nOne couple — who enjoys walking the track regularly together — said, \"We come and walk together. We may try the open gym with basketball or pickleball soon. [The YMCA is] a great place for kids to hang out, both middle school and high schoolers. It's a great place to be.\"\nIn addition to the pool, members enjoy the sauna too. Queen Anne's County teacher Gabrielle Corder said, \"I love [the YMCA]. I love working out before work every day and then going to the sauna. I look forward to [the sauna] after my workout each morning.\"\nAs adults become older, the YMCA offers many opportunities with their Active Aging Center. Adults, 50 years or older, can register to be a part of the Active Aging Center. Participants do not need to be a member at the YMCA to attend Active Aging Adult events, but a YMCA membership increases the number of programs available to the member. The Active Aging Center offers classes that include: walking track, pool laps, aqua zumba, creative club, lottery bingo, puzzle time, dominoes, barre class and more.\nThere are classes on health topics like \"Top 10 Arthritis Tips\" and social events like \"Hot Chocolate and Snowflakes\" craft event, DIY doormats, monthly birthday potlucks and more. Some older adults enjoy coming to the Y daily for lunch as a way to be social and get out of their houses. Lunch is served at noon daily, and registration occurs two weeks in advance at the Active Aging Center counter at the YMCA. There is a small cost associated with the lunch based on age and needs, but the menu states, \"No one is turned away for the inability to pay.\"\nThe YMCA is the answer to so many needs in our community. Throughout the day, you can see multigenerational games of pickleball and basketball, where participants are both learning and teaching each other. You can see all ages working out together as well as sharing advice, tips, and strategies. You can hear encouraging words and friendly greetings. You can see people showing concern and care for each other in conversations as well as care for the facility in tidying up and picking up trash, even if it does not belong to them.\nThe YMCA is a fun place for parents to let their kids get some energy out on a rainy, cold or too hot day. It is a safe place for teens to meet their friends, workout, stay healthy and do their homework together. It is a social place to meet friends, take a new class or learn new skills. It is a healthy place to set and meet goals. It is a special place where people like to be together in community, a place to raise families, share wisdom and grow together.\nFor the month of January, there is no joining fee, a $75 savings. The YMCA is always looking for volunteers, donors, members and workers too.

    "content": "New hospital was decades in the making\n\n January 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Local News \n \n 1611\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Although the certificate of need was approved for the University of Maryland Shore Regional Health's long-awaited new regional medical center, work remains to be done in the coming year before construction begins.The Maryland Health Care Commission's Jan. 18 approval of the hospital system's application is launching a flurry of activity in further developing the new medical center.\nFor now, the hospital system is \"eagerly\" awaiting approval from the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission on UM Shore Regional Health's full rate application in the coming months — the final regulatory approval needed to move the regional medical center project forward, said Trena Williamson, UM Shore Regional Health's director of communications and marketing.\nThe hospital system is continuing work with the state, Talbot County and the Town of Easton to refine and approve site and building plans. Work is also ongoing with the project architects to refine and finalize facility design, Williamson said.\nSite work at the new regional medical center's location off of Longwoods Road is planned for this spring. Construction is anticipated to begin in spring 2025, with doors tentatively opening in summer 2028.\nProject updates, including plans, upcoming milestones and photos, will be available to the community in a new section on UM Shore Regional Health's website in the next several weeks, Williamson said.\nKen Kozel, UM Shore Regional Health's president and CEO, said he was grateful for the hard work and dedication of the University of Maryland Medical System, the local hospital system, elected officials and the community in securing state funding and certificate of need approval.\n\"The level of detail, forward thinking and planning required to usher in a facility like this for our community to utilize well into the future has been monumental. I am proud of the work thus far,\" he said. \"Bringing a project of this magnitude and complexity to fruition will require continued perseverance by all involved.\"\nAs the hospital system moves into the next phase of the project, Kozel said he's looking forward to sharing more details in the months ahead as they are finalized.\n\"I encourage our community to follow the progress and stay involved,\" he said.\nDevelopment of the new hospital is a project Mid-Shore residents and local officials have closely followed for over a decade. Many have questions on what improvements the new hospital will bring, how it will be funded and what work remains to be done in bringing the long-proposed vision to reality.\nCERTIFICATE OF NEED\nAlthough plans for the new hospital have been in the works for over a decade, the official green light to further development and begin construction was only recently received through the approval of the certificate of need.\nAttaining that certificate required approval from Maryland Health Care Commission's Certificate of Need program, a state regulatory process designed to ensure that new health care facilities and services are developed only as needed.\nIf the commission determines a project is needed, it's tasked with ensuring the project is cost-effective, geographically and financially accessible, financially viable and that it will not have a negative impact on other health care facilities and services.\nThe certificate is required to build a new health care facility, to move an existing facility to a new location, to change the bed capacity of a facility, to change the type or scope of any health care service offered or to make a health care facility capital expenditure that exceeds the threshold established in Maryland statute.\nUM Shore Regional Health, formerly known as Shore Health System, first began looking at alternatives for the hospital project in the latter half of the 2000s, keeping the five-county area's growing and aging population and a lack of physicians in mind.\nThe need for a new hospital stemmed from a number of concerns with the existing building, which the hospital system called \"functionally obsolete for inpatient care\" in its application for the certificate.\nEaston's original 32-bed hospital opened its doors in 1907. Just eight years later in 1915, a new hospital was built on South Washington Street.\nThough a small portion of the hospital built in 1915 is still a part of the current complex, the building has expanded, with the current structure including components updated throughout the last 100 years, according to the application.\nA number of areas were considered for the site of the new hospital over the years, including locations in Queen Anne's County, a site near Chesapeake College in Wye Mills and a parcel off of Route 322 at Oxford Road.\nRedevelopment and renovations of the existing hospital campus were also considered.\nSurveys conducted early on in the project planning process made it clear that an accessible location was important to residents in the community; however, \"no general agreement\" on the most accessible location emerged, according to the application.\nUltimately, replacing the hospital off of Longwoods Road in Easton was determined to be the most cost-effective from the start, according to the 2012 application.\nThe commission considers eight criteria in its review of applications for the certificate, including the state health plan, need, viability of a project proposal, impact on existing providers, availability of more cost-effective services, health equity and an applicant's character and competence, according to the Maryland Health Care Commission.\nThe hospital system submitted its first application for the certificate for a new hospital off of Longwoods Road in Easton in September 2012. The application was docketed for formal review by the commission but was suspended due to financial concerns at the time.\nA modified application for the project was submitted by the hospital system in October 2016, which was also docketed for formal review. But in July 2018, that application was withdrawn due to significant project changes after docketing.\nAnother certificate of need application for a similar hospital project on the same site was filed in September 2018, but review was deferred at the request of UM Shore Regional Health.\nNews on the new hospital remained relatively quiet until January 2023, when the latest application was filed with the Maryland Health Care Commission. Just over a year later, on Jan. 18, the certificate was approved.\nWHAT'S IN STORE\nThe new regional medical center will sit on more than 200 acres of land off of Longwoods Road, adjacent to the Talbot County Community Center and just north of the Easton Airport.\nThe new location is about 3½ miles from the existing hospital, which is tucked into downtown Easton on Washington Street. The move puts the new hospital closer to U.S. Route 50, providing greater visibility, easier and safer access for ambulances and helicopters and more parking — over 1,100 spaces.\nSketch site plans for the hospital, which were approved by the Easton Planning Commission late last year, indicate that access to the hospital from Route 50 will be via Medical Center Drive, a new road to be developed near the existing entrance to the Talbot County Community Center.\nResidents who frequently travel Route 662 will see some changes to their usual route — a portion of Longwoods Road will be relocated as a ring road around the new hospital, the site of which sits in the middle of existing Route 662.\nThe hospital system is working with the State Highway Administration on plans and approvals needed to relocate the road.\nPhysical road work, along with rough grading of the project site to prepare for construction in spring 2025, are anticipated to begin in late summer to early fall of this year, Williamson said.\nThe main hospital tower is proposed as a six-level, 325,000-square-foot building with 147 licensed beds in private rooms. That number includes 110 acute care beds and 12 special hospital rehabilitation beds, both of which are classified as inpatient beds, and 25 observation beds.\nWhat's proposed is a change from the current hospital, which has 146 licensed beds in mostly semi-private rooms. The existing facility has significant excess physical capacity compared to its licensed bed capacity, according to the application, which creates \"operation and cost inefficiencies.\"\nThe new hospital will see an increase in the number of licensed medical, surgical, gynecological and addictions beds and psychiatric beds, though the number of licensed obstetric, pediatric and rehabilitation beds is lower than the licensed capacity at the existing hospital.\nThe new hospital is slated to have 27 emergency department treatment spaces, two of which are designated as psychiatric exam spaces, and three rooms designated as psychiatric holding areas for patients awaiting admission decisions.\nSeven operating rooms are proposed — an addition of one from the current hospital.\nA ground level helipad will be located outside of the emergency department at the new location.\nThe current hospital has a rooftop helipad, but it's too small to accommodate Maryland State Police helicopters, meaning those patients must be taken by ground to the hospital after the helicopter lands at the airport, according to the application.\nAdjacent to the hospital, a 60,000-square-foot medical office and outpatient services building is proposed.\nFUNDING\nThe new regional medical center is estimated to cost $539.5 million.\nOver half of the project — $333 million — is proposed to be funded through debt financing.\nThe state government is another significant source of funding.\nGov. Wes Moore's fiscal year 2025 capital budget, released Jan. 17, proposes allocating $20 million every year for the next three fiscal years and adding a $30 million allocation in fiscal year 2028.\nThe recently proposed state funding for the regional medical center adds on to the $10 million received in the state's fiscal year 2024 budget, which must be spent by the end of June.\nAbout $39 million in cash flow from operations, $50 million in philanthropic gifts and approximately $18 million in investment earnings on bond proceeds during construction compose the remainder of the project's funding.\nThe proposed mix of cash flows, debt, philanthropy and state support are consistent with the University of Maryland Medical System's \"historical approach to funding large, systemwide strategic initiatives,\" according to the application for the certificate. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This YMCA is only one of two in the Mid-Shore area with an \"Active Aging Center\" (for senior citizens, 55 and above). The other is at the St. Michaels YMCA in Talbot County.The Active Aging Center is a partnership between the Queen Anne's County Department of Community Services Area Agency on Aging, and the YMCA in Centreville.\nJoining the Active Aging Center is free for seniors (55 and above), and offers so much to provide outstanding activities, the majority of those related to improving seniors quality of life. Everyone who has visited the Y in Centreville has been amazed at what a wonderful and all encompassing facility it is.\nBeing an Active Aging member includes the free use of the following at the Y; lap swim in the heated pool, use of indoor walking track, \"wellness center\" exercise equipment, art classes, lottery bingo, puzzle time, as well as a variety of specialized dance classes. These activities are all free to seniors, and come with limited use times for each, most begin in the mornings as early as 9 a.m., and concluding shortly after noon.\nGrowing in popularity is the weekday luncheons for seniors. A monthly calendar of what is being served each day is printed for seniors to take with them and choose which days they want to sign-up for, in advance. Meals are served promptly between noon through 12:15 p.m.\nThere is a small senior's cafe where the luncheons are served by Senior Center Aide Noah Fate-Cloud, always with a smile.\nA sampling of what's been offered for the lunches thus far has included chicken salad, potato salad, three-bean salad, Mandarin orange slices, roast beef on a Kaiser roll, coleslaw, and fruit cocktail. An assortment of soups, sandwiches, fruit, vegetables and desserts are typically on the menu.\nAll lunches come with healthy choices of fruit juices, milk or water. The lunches focus on having healthy and appropriate serving portions of each item, and lean toward gourmet meals.\nAmong those attending regularly, Geraldine Colabella, of Centreville, said, \"There is no comparison between the meals served here and fast food places, which I consider to be 'junk food'.

This YMCA is only one of two in the Mid-Shore area with an \"Active Aging Center\" (for senior citizens, 55 and above). The other is at the St. Michaels YMCA in Talbot County.The Active Aging Center is a partnership between the Queen Anne's County Department of Community Services Area Agency on Aging, and the YMCA in Centreville.\nJoining the Active Aging Center is free for seniors (55 and above), and offers so much to provide outstanding activities, the majority of those related to improving seniors quality of life. Everyone who has visited the Y in Centreville has been amazed at what a wonderful and all encompassing facility it is.\nBeing an Active Aging member includes the free use of the following at the Y; lap swim in the heated pool, use of indoor walking track, \"wellness center\" exercise equipment, art classes, lottery bingo, puzzle time, as well as a variety of specialized dance classes. These activities are all free to seniors, and come with limited use times for each, most begin in the mornings as early as 9 a.m., and concluding shortly after noon.\nGrowing in popularity is the weekday luncheons for seniors. A monthly calendar of what is being served each day is printed for seniors to take with them and choose which days they want to sign-up for, in advance. Meals are served promptly between noon through 12:15 p.m.\nThere is a small senior's cafe where the luncheons are served by Senior Center Aide Noah Fate-Cloud, always with a smile.\nA sampling of what's been offered for the lunches thus far has included chicken salad, potato salad, three-bean salad, Mandarin orange slices, roast beef on a Kaiser roll, coleslaw, and fruit cocktail. An assortment of soups, sandwiches, fruit, vegetables and desserts are typically on the menu.\nAll lunches come with healthy choices of fruit juices, milk or water. The lunches focus on having healthy and appropriate serving portions of each item, and lean toward gourmet meals.\nAmong those attending regularly, Geraldine Colabella, of Centreville, said, \"There is no comparison between the meals served here and fast food places, which I consider to be 'junk food'. The meals here are healthy, and if they weren't good, I wouldn't come back! Plus, for those of us who don't want to cook anymore, that's another plus.\"\nColabella's friend, Maggie Kovack, who comes with her, added, \"Everything about these lunches are good!

    "content": "Moms of children with special needs find respite at Hummingbird Inn\n\n January 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Local News \n \n 1736\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Though the situations that brought six mothers of children with special needs to the Hummingbird Inn on a snowy January weekend are different, they shared a common thread: a desire to seek respite and connection.The weekend retreat, organized through nonprofit A Mother's Rest and held for the first time at the cozy Queen Anne Victorian bed and breakfast inn in Easton, provided the women with a much-needed and long-awaited chance to relax and refresh.\nBut the three-day weekend trip offered more than just respite — it gave the six mothers a space to be open and vulnerable with themselves and each other.\nA Mother's RestFounded in 2017 by Andrea Roberts, A Mother's Rest Charitable Respite Foundation aims to improve the emotional and physical health of caregivers through affordable three-day weekend retreats.\nThe nonprofit operates two of its own respite inns — one in New Market, Maryland, and a second in northeastern Georgia. Both inns, open year-round, offer a multitude of weekend retreats for a variety of caregivers.\nBed and breakfast inns, like the Hummingbird, can participate, too, through A Mother's Rest's Porch Partners program, a national network of inns offering space for those seeking a break.\nEric Levinson, the owner and innkeeper at the Hummingbird Inn, learned about A Mother's Rest from his sister, a realtor in western Maryland who met Roberts.\nLevinson reached out to Roberts, and from there, it became evident that his inn would be an ideal location for a respite retreat, he said.\nThere was also a personal connection for Levinson: his mother had specialized in working with children with disabilities and those in need of extra care, making the concept resonate even more.\n\"Just knowing other people who have these types of children or (who are) caretakers, and how much they give to them and take little for themselves … that opportunity just seemed like a really great thing to be able to do,\" he said.\nLevinson first spoke with Roberts last January, blocking out all of his inn's rooms for the weekend. The inn was fully booked within three to four days, he said, meaning that the six women who came to Easton had been waiting for a year before coming to stay.\nThough it's in the name, the nonprofit's retreats aren't just limited to mothers of children with special needs. The weekend trips are also offered for couples, dads, adoptive or foster parents, families and other caregivers in need of a break.\nSome retreats are designated for caregivers dealing with specific disabilities or situations, like parents of children with Down syndrome or caregivers to combat-injured veterans.\nBut at each retreat, no matter the life circumstances that brought them there, the need for a weekend away to sleep and relax, and to have the opportunity to connect with others who understand their daily challenges, unites caregivers across all spectrums.\nA weekend in EastonAlthough a snowstorm blanketed the Mid-Atlantic region on Friday, Jan. 19, it didn't deter six women from driving several hours to Easton for a weekend to themselves.\nCheck-in started at 3 p.m. on Friday, with inn staff helping each woman get settled in her room.\nEach room, named after a town on the Eastern Shore, held a surprise care package with soaps, socks and eye masks. A floral arrangement also sat in each room, homed in a mug labeled \"hug in a mug.\"\nThough respite retreats affiliated with A Mother's Rest don't have planned activities, a number of local businesses that heard about the event reached out to Levinson asking how they could help to make the weekend even more special.\nOut of the Fire offered a $50 credit for a meal. Legal Assets reached out with a special meal discount. Bluepoint Hospitality offered free coffee or beverages and free pastries, pie or ice cream. Friends called Levinson saying they'd like to buy the women a bottle of wine.\nThe community offered more than just food and drink, though — Chatterbox Hair Salon provided free shampoos, styles and blowouts, and the Avalon Theatre offered tickets to its weekend comedy or blues show.\nLevinson and his team helped make reservations for the offerings and even drove some women to their hair appointments, taking away the stress of coordination.\n\"When I would talk to people about it, it was always the same: they knew somebody or they had a family member in this situation, and people just know how it's a lot, and you give up a lot — not begrudgingly, these are your family and children obviously, but everybody needs a break,\" Levinson said.\nFor Maureen Robinette, a mom from northern Delaware, the weekend served as a much-needed break from the busyness of raising her two active sons and her 9-year-old daughter with special needs.\n\"My husband will take my boys to whatever sporting event, he coaches them, he takes them to practices,\" she said. \"So just every night, I'm on (daughter) duty, and it's just exhausting.\"\nRobinette, who works full-time, spent her weekend walking around town, shopping, reading and enjoying breakfasts and dinners. She also took advantage of the offer from the nearby salon.\n\"It was amazing,\" she said of her experience, laughing. \"It was very relaxing, I just felt we were pampered by this place.\nAnd of course, as with any bed and breakfast, a mouthwatering meal was served every morning.\nOn Saturday, Levinson served up a sausage quiche and Belgian waffles. Sunday's menu boasted a blueberry yogurt parfait, a savory breakfast galette and creme brulee French toast.\nAnd just before the women checked out on Monday, Levinson offered an Austrian egg cake, filled with leeks, eggs, cheese, onions and breadcrumbs, and pikelets, fluffy Australian pancakes topped with strawberry sauce.\nReflections and connectionsWhile the respite weekend primarily served as an opportunity to rest, with no pressure to do activities or engage with others, the six women who came to Easton found connections.\nOver breakfast on Monday, Jan. 22, five mothers who stayed for the full weekend shared stories of hardships, interspersed with smiles at happy memories and positive developments with their children.\nCandy Warner, a mom of two adult children, including a 30-year-old son who experiences uncontrollable seizures and aggression following a stroke before birth, traveled from near York, Pennsylvania, for the weekend retreat.\n\"It was wonderful, they always are,\" she said. \"I'm always anxious to go home, but I don't want to go home because it's like reality.\"\nWarner took the chance to connect with two of the other moms in Easton for the weekend, walking over to dinner at Scossa and talking in a candid way that only others like her could understand.\n\"I mean, we all have the same emotions, anywhere from being happy to being totally angry and frustrated, just on different levels depending on our children's diagnoses,\" she said. \"So we can all relate to each other, no matter what diagnoses our children have or what we're going through.\"\n\"Sometimes there's a connection … you just feel like you just make a new friend for life,\" Warner added, choking up with emotion.\nRobinette said it's easier to talk with other moms who are going through the same things, others who aren't going to judge or give unsolicited advice.\n\"I feel like all of us are here to just listen to our stories,\" she said, adding: \"I just feel like it's just great to talk openly and share experiences, and understand what everyone else is going through, like stuff that you can't talk to your normal friends about.\"\nTalking with normal friends can result in a look of pity, Warner said.\n\"I don't want your pity, just sit and listen to me sometimes,\" she said. \"I don't need your feedback.\"\nRobinette agreed.\n\"I didn't tell people at work for the longest time, because I just didn't want to get emotional, you don't want pity,\" she said with emotion in her voice. \"Now I'm fairly open with it, because it's been long enough and it's just easier to explain stuff.\"\nIt can be isolating to parent a child with disabilities, said Melissa Egan Kerr, a mom of two from the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania. She said that feeling was compounded by the pandemic. And though some moms do choose to use the respite retreats to keep to themselves, the one in Easton was a little different.\n\"...This one, it is just like a really organic feeling of connecting with people and talking, and how therapeutic that is to just share your story with people who you know get what you're talking about,\" she said.\nDeborah Adams, an adoptive mom of two children with trauma from earlier on in life, said A Mother's Rest retreats have saved her family, and at times, their sanity.\n\"It's easy to just feel so isolated … to just cut ourselves off,\" the Richmond, Virginia, mom said of her and her husband's experience raising their children with hidden disabilities. \"And this is a way to get out of it and to have kind of some self-safety, and that's huge.\"\nAdams found out about A Mother's Rest about four years ago, just before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"I went on a retreat, a random retreat,\" she said, \"And all of the moms that were there, we all just connected on a level that you cannot connect with anyone.\"\nA lasting impactEven before all of the women had checked in to the Hummingbird Inn that Friday afternoon, Levinson said he planned to host more respite retreats — a sentiment that still held true Monday morning at checkout.\n\"You could hear the gratitude in their voice, how much this meant to them,\" Levinson said of his six guests.\nThe weekend also held special meaning to Michael Abbott, the inn's event coordinator. Abbott, who lost his own mother at a young age, said he knew the retreat was something he wanted to give extra special care to.\nFor Abbott, that meant remembering the little things, like driving some of the mothers to their hair appointments or remembering that one guest preferred iced tea over coffee in the morning.\nBeing able to provide a safe, peaceful and welcoming space to decompress was meaningful to Abbott, too. He recalled one mother taking her first look at her room for the weekend.\n\"She's like, 'Oh my god, this is so lovely and so peaceful. I can see myself sitting here and reading in the corners. It's just what I need, and so inviting,'\" he remembered.\nTo Abbott, that was clear.\n\"I just thought that she was ready to just let go, have a moment to herself, which I don't think she gets a lot,\" he said.\n\"It's just something they needed,\" Abbott added, choking up. \"Moms go through a lot.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "As Maryland considers medical aid in dying, here’s how it’s playing out in D.C.\n\n January 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SAPNA BANSIL Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1368\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — A 74-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's disease. An 88-year-old man with congestive heart failure. A 54-year-old woman with cancer.These are among the 24 terminally ill patients who, between 2017 and 2022, ended their lives under Washington, D.C.'s Death with Dignity Act, according to public records.\nThe law gives D.C. residents with incurable illnesses the option to die by ingesting lethal medication and requires the government to generate annual reports on those who chose to do so.\nThose reports are of interest this year as legislatures across the country push to expand access to medical aid-in-dying options like the one in D.C. In neighboring Maryland and Virginia, for example, measures to legalize the procedure are now pending in the legislatures.\nIn Maryland, aid-in-dying proposals in past years have faced pushback from a number of opponents.\nReligious groups and pro-life activists argue it infringes on their belief in the sanctity of life. Physicians fear it may violate medical ethics. And disability rights groups worry that aid in dying would be used to encourage individuals with disabilities to end their lives.\nBut advocates say there's unprecedented momentum this year for an aid-in-dying law in Maryland — in part because arguments for the option have been strengthened by its implementation in D.C. and 10 other states.\nPeople in Maryland \"should feel safe knowing that it's tried and tested,\" said Donna Smith, the Maryland and D.C. campaign director for the nonprofit group Compassion and Choices. \"It's not a large number of people that use this, but for the people that need it, it's everything.\"\nIn 2016, D.C. became the sixth jurisdiction in the nation to pass aid-in-dying legislation. According to a Capital News Service analysis of annual reports released by the D.C. Department of Health, the 24 people who have died under the law ranged in age from 40 to 98. Seventeen patients had cancer, while others had neurological, heart or lung conditions.\nData was available through February 2022. The District officially counts 23 people as having utilized aid in dying; however, 24 patients are listed in Department of Health records.\nMany who sought aid in dying did so to end their suffering, according to Dixcy Bosley, a nurse care manager in D.C. who specializes in hospice and end-of-life care. As a volunteer with Compassion and Choices, Bosley has counseled several patients in the District who pursued it as an option.\n\"I've been with five people,\" Bosley said, \"and every single one was just a really peaceful experience.\"\nBosley recalled the first aid-in-dying patient she cared for in the District: A man in his 60s and former electrician who depended on an oxygen tank to breathe. To be eligible, patients must have less than six months to live, make a series of oral and written requests and be sound of mind.\nBosley said she was struck by how the man planned for his death. He set a date and had family and friends visit to say their goodbyes.\n\"He was not suicidal,\" Bosley said. \"He really just wanted to stop suffering.\"\nOn the day he died, his wife and daughter were by his side as he mixed and ingested the medication. Through the cracked windows in his room, they could hear the sounds of a neighboring elementary school.\n\"We could hear the kids in the elementary school playing and laughing outside,\" Bosley said. \"I just felt like it was just a beautiful death.\"\nETHICS AND ACCESS\nFewer people have utilized aid in dying in D.C. than advocates had expected, according to Smith.\nAmong the biggest barriers to accessing the procedure is the lack of doctors and pharmacies willing to provide care. In D.C., there have never been more than four physicians who have prescribed life-ending medications in any given year, the CNS analysis found.\nAnd according to Bosley, many retail pharmacies refuse to fill aid-in-dying prescriptions. Major retailers declined or did not respond to CNS requests to discuss their policies on this.\nThe Medical Society of the District of Columbia, which represents physicians in the District, did not offer an opinion as the D.C. Council was debating its law in 2015 and 2016. A spokesperson for the group declined to comment for this story.\nBut many providers feel that aid in dying is inconsistent with their obligations to treat and heal their patients.\n\"People bristle at the idea that we would be able to heal through killing,\" said Daniel Sulmasy, a physician who serves as director of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University. \"This is something that I think grates against the fundamentals of the profession.\"\nMedStar Georgetown University Hospital prohibits doctors from participating in the District's aid-in-dying program, according to Sulmasy.\n\"We can stop treatments and make sure people are comfortable, but we never act with the specific intention of making somebody dead,\" he said.\nWithin the advocate community, there are also concerns about racial disparities in accessing aid in dying.\nIn D.C., where 45% of the population is Black, 22 of 24 patients who have utilized the option are white, the CNS analysis found. One patient was Black, while another was Hispanic.\nSimilar trends have appeared in other states that have legalized aid in dying. In California, among most racially diverse jurisdictions with an aid-in-dying law, 0.8% of patients have been Black.\nThe disparities stem, in part, from broader health inequities, Smith surmises.\n\"I know in (the Black) community, we're still fighting to live,\" said Smith, who serves as the diversity, equity and inclusion advisor to Compassion and Choices. \"We don't get adequate health outcomes to begin with. So it's hard to say, 'Okay, let me offer you this option (at the end of life)' when you haven't been given the support you need to live.\"\nPROSPECTS IN MARYLAND\nMaryland is among 18 states currently weighing aid-in-dying legislation. The bill is modeled after existing laws across the country and is the same as a measure that failed to make it out of committee a year ago.\nLike in other jurisdictions, the bill would require patients to self-ingest medication. Physicians and health care facilities are not obligated to provide aid-in-dying services.\nSimilar measures have been considered in Maryland in the past but failed to pass — though they came close. In 2019, the House of Delegates approved an aid-in-dying bill that failed in the Senate on a 23-23 tie vote.\nThis year, as issues of bodily autonomy gain heightened awareness following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) has indicated a willingness to bring an aid-in-dying bill to a vote.\nGovernor Wes Moore has also expressed support for bringing the option to Maryland.\n\"If a bill makes it to my desk with transition with dignity at its core, I will sign it,\" Moore said.\nSenate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Caroline and Cecil) expects most Republicans to oppose such a bill.\n\"From a perspective of the sanctity of life, a lot of times, it boils down to our religious beliefs on some issues,\" Hershey said. \"This is certainly one of them.\"\nAmong those who hope the Maryland bill passes is Diane Kraus, a 59-year-old Baltimore native who was diagnosed in May 2021 with metastatic breast cancer and has since been advocating for the right to end her life.\nKraus has undergone four different types of chemotherapy and continues to receive treatment every three weeks. But it's become increasingly difficult for her to manage her symptoms, which include pain, nausea, confusion and headaches, among others.\nMotivated by her own experiences with a terminal illness and 35 years of working as an occupational therapist in hospice and home health settings, Kraus testified in support of Maryland's aid-in-dying bill last year.\n\"I wanted it for me,\" Kraus said in an interview with CNS. \"I had seen so many people die in pain and so many people have such a poor quality of life at the very end. And they would say, 'I just want to go home and be with God and be with my relatives.' … And that just really struck me.\"\nKraus was devastated when Maryland's bill stalled last year and has considered relocating to a state where aid in dying is legal.

    "content": "Compass CEO updates Caroline Commissioners on hospice work\n\n January 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly | Section: Local News \n \n 803\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — While a brick-and-mortar hospice facility isn't on the immediate horizon for Caroline County, Compass Regional Hospice has addressed the need of county residents for a higher level of care, according to the organization's CEO.Compass Executive Director Heather Guerieri explained how a memorandum of understanding with Arcadia Assisted Living works during her report to the Caroline County Commissioners at their Jan. 9 meeting in Denton.\nAccompanying Guerieri were Board Secretary and certified hospice volunteer Terry Mead, who lives in Caroline County, and Clinical Homecare Manager Jessica Losten, who grew up in the county.\nFrom January through November 2023, Compass served 90 Caroline County patients, 61 of whom were residents in one the four assisted living homes and skilled nursing facilities in the county.\nThe MOU between Compass and Arcadia, which is located on 5th Avenue in Denton, was effective August 2023 and allows the assisted living facility \"to provide beds for Caroline County residents that want to stay in the county, aren't in an assisted living or a nursing home, (and) don't want to leave the county to come to our facility in Centreville,\" Guerieri said.\n\"Bricks-and-mortar is a lot of money, and we're not seeing the (number) of patients … that would warrant a building here currently,\" she said. \"So, this agreement with Arcadia was a win-win, both for Arcadia and for our patients.\" Arcadia is obligated to provide a minimum of one to two beds for residential hospice level of care, but Compass only pays the facility when someone is admitted as a hospice patient.\nThe tri-county Barnette Center in Centreville has 10 beds for both a residential level of care and general inpatient care, which is the higher level of care for symptom management. Thirteen Caroline County residents were served in Centreville in 2023.\nThe higher level of care in Centreville that is not provided by Arcadia includes round-the-clock nursing and physicians who can monitor medications to help patients be more comfortable.\nThe Barnette Center is rarely at full capacity as people stay for a few days to have their symptoms safely managed and then go home, or they are at the very end of their lives.\nAlthough he praised Compass for their work in providing \"absolutely incredible\" home care, Commission Vice President Larry Porter said, \"I'm never going to be happy until we have a brick-and-mortar facility in this county for people to go to.\"\n\"We would love to have something here, too,\" Guerieri said. \"We just have to be able to afford it, so it doesn't close down like the last one did. We just want to be smart.\"\nThe former hospice center in Denton opened in 2015 through an arrangement with Talbot Hospice, but was shuttered in 2018. Four years later, Compass abandoned plans to build a free-standing hospice facility in the county because of the \"immense impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the healthcare industry, staffing, and building material costs,\" Guerieri wrote in a July 2022 op-ed piece.\nGuerieri provided current financial statistics about the organization which is running \"at a loss of $177,943,\" she said. \"Even though we're a nonprofit, you don't like to have a loss, that's for sure, but that's why we have fundraisers.\"\nShe said \"93% of the people that we served in Caroline County were patients that had Medicare as their primary payer source, only 4% had private insurance, one patient had Medicaid and one was uninsured.\"\n\"And just to make a point about the uninsured, we do not turn anybody away based on ability to pay,\" Guerieri said.\nOverall, Compass was able to bill people for room and board at $153,000, with a discount of $63,217.97 for charitable room and board. Insurance income was $1.6 million and lost revenue was almost $36,000 with total expenses of $1.84 million for 2023, she said.\nThe December 2023 Festival of Trees fundraiser at the Towers Family Museum in Denton raised over $50,000, \"so a huge thank you to all of Caroline County residents for the continued support,\" she said.\nThe festival, co-chaired by Dave Whaley and Melanie McMahan, featured 76 trees. Of the 21 sponsors, 20 were Caroline County businesses and one was a family. About 150 people attended the preview party. Guerieri praised Bill and Gail Towers for hosting the event the past few years.\nMead, who is also president of the Caroline Foundation, said the foundation's board is a \"strong supporter of hospice in this county,\" giving $800,00 to support that care for the past eight years.\nCompass also provides free grief counseling services \"to anybody in the community that needs our services\" including children in the county's schools. Guerieri said.\nGrief counselors will go to the school and even provide transportation if needed so children can receive help.\n\"We're doing a lot of work in the schools,\" she said. \"The counselors are always calling us from the schools for our grief counselors to come in there.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Compass Regional Hospice's annual gala raised $130,500 to benefit hospice care, supportive care and grief support services for Queen Anne's, Kent and Caroline counties.\n\"This is a wonderful evening that not only brings money to Compass Hospice, it also represents what Hospice means to this county,\" said Compass board member Kirk Helfenbein.\nQueen Anne's County State's Attorney Lance Richardson called the Chesapeake Bay Beach Club a \"beautiful venue for a great cause. Compass Hospice provides exceptional care and we're very fortunate to have them in our county.\"\nThe $250 per person fundraising event that attracted 170 people began with cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, followed by a formal seated dinner, a live auction and Call to Cash, and dancing to the sounds of Sinatra Vocals performing the \"Great American Songbook.\"\nPrior to the gala, sponsorships and tickets accounted for $80,000 of the total raised. During the event, the live auction, Call to Cash and jewelry raffle raised $50,500.\nHeather Guerieri, executive director of Compass Regional Hospice, thanked the organization's board members, \"amazing volunteers\" and the gala's sponsors and auction donors.\n\"Our longevity and success extends to this amazing community. We could not be where we are today without you,\" Guerieri said. \"It's a privilege and honor to provide hospice and group support services to this community. Thank you for supporting us and trusting us with such a sacred task.\"\nCompass grief counselor Sherrie Young offered the blessing. Matt Spedden served as the spirited emcee for the live auction and Call for Cash.\nThe highlight of the evening was the debut of a new video created by Chris Sciannella of Chester. In it, Camp New Dawn for bereaved children is featured, as well as the testimony of Katherine Hager, whose mother received care through Compass. She is clerk of the court for Queen Anne's County.\nGuerieri thanked Sciannella for the \"countless hours\" he donated producing the video. \"I like to give back,\" he said.\nSciannella said he and his six siblings lost their father at a young age. \"We didn't have (a Camp New Dawn) when we were grieving.\"\nSpedden said that each person attending the gala had probably \"experienced Hospice in some way,\" as he had with his father and grandmother.\nCalling Compass Hospice's care \"an amazing, amazing experience,\" he praised the organization for its \"programs not only for the people that are leaving us, but the ones that are left behind.\"\nSciannella's CAS Productions was a platinum sponsor, along with Kent Island American Legion Post 278.\nGold sponsors were the Chesapeake Bay Beach Club, R.B. Baker & Sons, Inc., and Luminis Health/Gilchrist.\nRuff Roofers, Queenstown Bank, Shore United Bank and PepUp were silver sponsors.\nFor 39 years, Compass staff have provided comprehensive, professional and compassionate support to people living with a life limiting illness, and those learning to cope with the death of a loved one.\nAll proceeds of the gala benefit hospice and supportive care, as well as our grief support services for the tri-county area. No one is turned away for inability to pay.\n\"We are so thankful to this community and their amazing generosity prior to and during our Gala,\" Compass spokesperson Lexy Mollica wrote in an Jan. 29 email. \"It is such a humbling experience for us to see the unwavering support for our mission from citizens throughout Caroline, Kent, and Queen Anne's counties.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There were rows of tables set up, brimming with swag, like stress balls, pens and little flashlights, and the smell of free chili filled the air.\nCommunity service hubs like food insecurity stalwart Aaron's Place and housing-insecurity-focused His Hope Ministries all came together to give back to the community's most in need.\n\"Our wellness program is offering oral cancer screenings today free for adults, and our vaccine program is offering COVID vaccines and flu vaccines free of charge,\" said Leigh Marquess, the director of wellness at the Caroline County Health Department.\n\"We have wellness tables in the other room, and they are offering information about tobacco prevention and cessation for our community. There are around 10 people from the Health Department working here,\" Marquess said.\nShe was standing in the doorway to Dr. Adrienne Webb's space, where Webb was offering free oral cancer screening check ups. Across the hall, there were free COVID and flu shots.\nVisitors frequented the free coat racks and the free clothes and diapers in the main hall, next to sign-in tables where volunteers helped direct community members to those who could help meet their needs. Some families came from as far as Marydel to get these resources.\nStefanie Johnson is part of the Caroline Homeless Board and is the Executive Director of His Hope Ministries.\n\"An important part of today is what we call our 'point in time survey' where we try to capture the numbers of those who are actually experiencing a housing crisis in our community. For one day, we go out and see who we can find and see if we can help them,\" Johnson said.\nPeople experiencing a housing crisis can be found living in cars, couch surfing or in tents. The more accurate the numbers gathered, the more help that can be provided, Johnson said.\nShe wanted the community to know that there is support and had a whole giveaway room full of food and clothes, like wool hats and scarves and booties, set up at the event. Some of these were hand-knitted by a 94-year-old woman.\n\"And we have Cheryl Beulah back there of Aaron's Place, giving away food. She works with Amy Cawley of the Maryland Food Bank,\" Johnson said.\nSmall white and blue boxes with donors' names written on them were lined up and filled with non-perishables.\n\"We are a food pantry. We have seven pantries throughout the county. It all fits into the mission of fighting food insecurity. We offer wrap-around services, like helping people get a GED or do early start education, because as we always say, 'Where there is food insecurity, there is something else going on,'\" Beulah said.\nThere was one attendee who was seated in a hallway, taking a break from the bustle. She said she wishes that all the people that need help would just reach out to those who could provide services.\n\"They need to reach out too. Call the Health Department or Social Services. Tell your friends. They have it every year. I love it. I enjoy it. I love what they do for the community. It is a blessing. Without the grants, they can't do this,\" said Joanne Clanton of Denton. \"If I see stuff I love or like, I am going to get it or I might get it for a family member. It is nice stuff and you socialize. There are people, homeless people, with kids sleeping outside. Let's try to reach out and spread love. Let it be a rainbow across the world.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

As life is long, one who is healthy at one time could use help later on. If they have earned volunteer service hours with Partners In Care, they can get services performed for their previous effort.\nKathleen Dormody is the program coordinator for the Mid-Shore Branch of Partners In Care. She serves Talbot and Caroline counties. Partners In Care is a statewide organization, which also serves Anne Arundel, Montgomery and Washington counties.\n\"Right now we (Mid-Shore) have truly engaged active members of less than 100. Organization-wide, we have 2,700 members. Our volunteers are considered members,\" Dormody said. \"We are founded on the concept of time banking. What that means is with our volunteers — let's say they are doing a transport — they take a member to a doctor's appointment. They get time for that transport.\"\nShe explained that further down the road, they can use the hours they have banked. Volunteers can also used banked time for services for an older relative.\n\"When they get to the point where they are no longer driving, they may need our services. What we do is fill the gap between medical care and total isolation. Our mission is to help older adults, 60 plus years of age, to age in place with dignity and respect,\" Dormody said.\nAmong the services offered by Partners In Care are a small household repair program, a support group for the vision impaired, a program where veterans provide services for other veterans, trainings on internet safety and a ride partners program, in which volunteers provide transportation to those in need.\n\"Unlike Delmarva Community Transit, we are door to door,\" Dormody said.\nThe driver will pick the member up, take them to the appointment, wait for them at the appointment and drive them home.\n\"I love filling that loneliness. You may be on the phone with a member chatting for ten minutes. Letting them know that they are cared about. Most of our members are 80 years and up,\" Dormody said.\nFor more information about Partners In Care, its volunteer opportunities and the services is offers, visit partnersincare.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She was born in 1913 in Attalla, Alabama, (northeast of Birmingham, along I-59) to her parents, where she lived until she was seven-years-old. Her family then moved to Washington D.C., during the early 1920s, long before the Great Depression.She graduated from the then Wilson Teachers College in Washington, D.C., in 1933. Shortly after, married the late William Franklins, who she recalls meeting in Hyattsviille, a then rural suburb of the nation's capitol. They were married on April 9, 1938. Mr. Franklins was employed with the U.S. government's foreign service, and they were almost immediately assigned to move to Germany shortly after the wedding. The Franklins lived in Germany before World War II began.\nMary recalls, \"I've travelled the world. Seen lots of places.\"\nWilliam and Mary's final residence together before his passing many years ago was at the beautiful Wharf House in Centreville, not far from Doc's Restaurant today. They were both active members of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Centreville.\nShe is now receiving active aging care in Chestertown, under the supervision of her main caregiver Beverly Emore, who started attending to Mary in 1990, along with longtime friend Linda Carroll, who has also looked after Mary's needs for more than 30-years. Both Emore and Carroll, along with all other people close to Mary, address her daily as \"Mom-mom\".\nThough hearing is difficult, Mary can still read without glasses, and loves to read, which has been a live-long passion. She plays bridge, Scrabble, and is an avid crossword puzzle player. If you want to ask her questions, best to write your questions on paper, since she can read the questions, and verbally answer them. She also still loves to talk, and has lots to say.\nShe admires flowers, children, pets, chocolate and good people. Her favorite dish of food is \"a good crab cake!\" She's still a registered and active voter in all elections.\nCarroll said, \"I haven't been able to confirm it, but Mary may be the eldest person ever to reside on the Eastern Shore. If not, she's got to be right up there as one of the eldest people ever!\"\nAsked, \"What do you attribute to your longevity of life?\" Mary replied, \"I have no idea!\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Don't make the mistake of letting Leap Day pass you by. Learn how to use this rare extra time as a springboard to personal change, turning a single day's action into lifelong habits.The Leap Day mindset: Embracing the extra day\nIf you struggle with making time for yourself, set aside this day for self-growth activities. An extra 24 hours can make all the difference with the right mindset. By viewing Leap Day as a chance for a mini-reboot, you're setting the foundation for transformational change.\nTaking opportunities to make changes builds new neural pathways, which helps protect cognitive function. Reflect on your goals, struggles and needs through purposeful activities like journaling, meditation or booking a session with a therapist. With how busy life gets, it can be a rare opportunity to get the time to sit with yourself and check in on how you're doing. That's all the reason to leverage Leap Day as a launchpad for personal development.\n\"If you don't take out time to focus on your own enrichment, sit with yourself and begin to tune into your inner voice, this can get harder and harder to do over time, \" says Julia L. Pressman, LCSW.\nSmall leaps, big gains: Micro-changes with macro impact\nThe idea of change can be daunting, but it doesn't always have to be drastic. Start implementing small, manageable changes on Leap Day, like eating a healthy breakfast or taking a 15-minute walk after lunch.\nDon't underestimate the power of micro-changes, as they can lead to significant, positive shifts in your life. By taking that brisk walk on Leap Day, you may find that it's something you enjoy and can easily incorporate into your routine. That one small change will slowly become a habit that promotes a healthier lifestyle.\n\"Over time, micro-changes increase our perception of what choices are available to us,\" Pressman says. \"When we try to do things differently than we typically do them, we learn more about ourselves and what works for us.\"\nLeap of faith: Trying something new\nHave you ever saved a new recipe or fitness class, promising yourself that you'll get to it one day? As a wild card in the calendar year, there is no better day than Leap Day to step out of your comfort zone and finally try that thing you've been putting off.\nWho knows, trying out that honey cake recipe might end up with you falling in love with baking and creating a side hustle. That's what happened to former U.S. national volleyball player, Tui Tuileta during the pandemic. Tuileta used his free time to bake cookies and post his creations on social media. It quickly picked up and led him to fulfill orders locally, baking 400 cookies weekly from his parents' oven. Attempting new things spices up your routine and can lead to unexpected opportunities — you never know if you don't try.\nThe joy of the moment: Celebrating the day\nThe rare occasion of having 366 days in the year calls for a celebration. Make this a special day by hosting a Leap Day-themed party. That way, you'll make special memories to last until the next Leap Year.\nAs part of the celebration, indulge in festive foods. Make it a potluck so your friends and families can share foods they love, filling your dinner table with a variety of options like party favorite samosas — a flaky Indian pastry with potato filling.\nConnecting the dots: Building relationships\nLeap Day offers 24 extra hours to spend with your loved ones. Take the time to write heartfelt letters expressing your appreciation for people in your life or plan a family cooking activity. Tanghulu, a traditional Chinese candied fruit street food, is an easy, delicious and fun snack to make with kids.\nIt's important to prioritize relationships as they are critical to personal development. They are a source of support during difficult times and help improve self-esteem and general well-being. Plus, a little appreciation goes a long way. Expressing gratitude releases oxytocin, the love hormone that strengthens the bond between two people.\nPaying it forward: Kindness and community\nExtend the spirit of Leap Day into the community by performing acts of kindness. Volunteer at a local food bank or spend the day decluttering your closet to donate items you've outgrown. Volunteering helps out the community and benefits your mental health by encouraging you to meet new people, increasing your social skills and boosting your self-confidence. Research, including a study by Western Connecticut State University, has shown that the more people volunteer, the happier they are.\nA day for creativity: Unleashing your inner artist\nEngaging in artistic pursuits comes with several therapeutic benefits that you may be unaware of. According to PhD psychologist Dr. Brenner, tapping into your creativity can reduce stress and anxiety and even boost your immune system. Dr. Brenner also explains that once you're in a creative flow, the brain releases large amounts of happy chemicals like dopamine, endorphins and serotonin.\nWhether it's painting, writing or knitting, dedicate some time on Leap Day for these artistic pursuits you usually don't have time for. There's no pressure to create a masterpiece, just get started and let your creativity flow for your mental well-being.\nLeap Day resolutions: Setting goals with a twist\nYou may have already set New Year's resolutions, but Leap Day resolutions are different. Given the rarity of a Leap year, it's an opportunity to create goals that are a bit more farfetched than your typical New Year's resolutions. Want to conquer your fears and go skydiving? Or, for a less extreme idea, why not challenge yourself to perform random acts of kindness every day? Setting these out-of-the-box goals will help you get out of a mundane routine and fully experience the joys of life.\nIt's one thing to set goals and another to execute them. Decide on a timeline for when you want to achieve each resolution and set actionable steps to make it happen. The best motivator is setting meaningful goals that will bring self-fulfillment.\nThe culmination: Making Leap Day last\nEnd Leap Day on a high note by reflecting on how you spent this rare bonus day with intention and purpose. It's a unique opportunity to make a significant change in your routine or simply enjoy an extra day of life's pleasures, indulging in hobbies or activities you normally don't have time for. Keep the positive momentum going and use Leap Day as a springboard to leap forward into the year with renewed energy and purpose.\nRobin Donovan is the author of more than 40 cookbooks, including the bestselling Campfire Cuisine, Ramen Obsession, and Ramen for Beginners.

The witnesses included Joaquin Duato of Johnson & Johnson, Robert Davis of Merck, and Chris Boerner of Bristol Myers Squibb.\nIn his introduction, Sanders cited a recent poll published by the Kaiser Family Foundation showing that 82 percent of American adults say the cost of prescription drugs is unreasonable, while 73 percent believe that there is not enough government regulation limiting that cost.\nAccording to a report published by the committee's majority staff before the hearing, several key treatments offered by Johnson & Johnson, Merck and BMS require U.S. patients to pay much more for drugs on an annual basis than those in other countries pay for the same drugs.\n\"Are the prices that you receive from countries like Canada or France — which look to me to be about one quarter of the price you get from the United States — … covering your costs?\" Sen.

Sixty volunteers gathered Feb. 3 at the Centreville United Methodist Church to support the mission.Centreville Rotary President Matt Schiwy had participated previously with other Rotary clubs working with Rise Against Hunger and wanted the Centreville Rotary to sponsor an event.\nA global organization, the mission of Rise Against Hunger is to end world hunger by the year 2030, and the organization believes that achieving the goal is possible.\nStarted in 1998 under the name Stop Hunger Now, its headquarters are in Raleigh, North Carolina. From there, the international hunger relief non-profit organization coordinates the packaging and distribution of food and other aid to people in developing nations.\nThe food and processing materials are not free for the sponsoring organization. Schiwy said, \"We had to pay $4,000 for everything to be delivered here, and hauled away to be shipped to whatever area of the world the food is going to.\"\nThe set up began before 9 a.m. on Saturday. However, the actual packing process, using an assembly line of volunteers to package the food, didn't begin until 11 a.m. The total time packaging the 30,000 meals took just about two hours.\nThe foods are simple essentials — rice, soy, dehydrated vegetables with seasoning, all measured out by hand, and placed in a small plastic bag which was sealed. The bag has directions on it for using boiling water for cooking the contents, which makes enough for six meals per bag.\nEach assembly line person had a specific role. It worked very efficiently. After sealing each bag, the bag was placed inside a box, along with at least 40 other bags, and then the box was sealed to be placed in the cargo truck and shipped to a large warehouse.\nAll Rotary International Clubs are service oriented. Each performs different services and activities that bring communities together, using people of all-ages. The volunteers who helped Saturday, ranged in ages from 16 to 80. Students from Gunston School, Queen Anne's County High School and Chesapeake College participated. Gunston School Headmaster John Lewis, and Chesapeake College President Cliff Coppersmith, were both among the volunteers. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Embracing the calm: New yoga studio coming to Shore\n\n February 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TAMARA FORTE Special to the Kent County News / Star Democrat | Section: Entertainment \n \n 798\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Big things are happening at 932 Washington Avenue, Suite G in Chestertown. The soon-to-be new yoga studio, Slack Tide Yoga, is starting to take shape. Owner, Adriane Watson, excitedly shared construction on the interior began in February.With only minor modifications required — updating signage, flooring, paint, bathroom finishes, lighting and in-studio heat — Watson is using Second Wind Contracting to furnish the interior improvements. While that happens, she said, \"I get to source the fun parts — scents, art, furniture and decor, all thoughtfully curated to create a serene environment that nods to the nearby waterways and landscapes. As you pass by in the coming weeks, you'll notice a bright green banner hanging in front of the location.\"\nSlack Tide Yoga studio aims at helping each person, no matter their fitness level or needs.\nWatson explains, \"My highest priority is to create an environment where my members feel comfortable, above all else. Prospective students can expect a welcoming, judgment and stigma-free atmosphere. I believe in cultivating spaces that make practicing yoga approachable, attainable and welcoming for everyone — regardless of experience, body type, age, etc. My goal is to help students create embodied experiences that create opportunities for them to feel present and connected to themselves in a world that so frequently pressures us to disassociate, perform and hustle.\"\nWatson, is well-known locally for teaching at TwoTen (Chestertown), Kent County YMCA and Fit Flock (Chestertown), and Soul Society Yoga (Kent Island). She is a 200-hour registered yoga teacher with 15 years of personal yoga practice. Watson explained, \"I moved to Church Hill from Centreville in 2020, and quickly realized that commuting to Kent Island or Middletown for personal practice is not convenient, given the distance.\nChestertown's existing boutique wellness industry combined with robust attendance in my Chestertown classes and feedback from my students reinforced my intuition that people here would respond positively to a dedicated yoga studio that offered a consistent schedule of offerings. Aside from affording an excellent opportunity to develop physical wellness, a yoga studio can also foster a sense of community and serve as a safe haven wherein students can find respite from the rigorous demands of daily life — something I believe we all need. Sometimes, the difference between feeling well versus feeling unwell is simply having somewhere to go.\"\nThe name 'Slack Tide' has a special meaning that sets the tone for the yoga studio. Her website explains. \"There's a moment sailors call slack tide, when the tide is neither coming in nor going out, but perfectly still. It's a moment frozen in time. When all is calm and peaceful. Much like the serene interval between tidal movements, yoga offers a space for stillness, where the ceaseless waves of daily challenges momentarily recede. Embracing the calm within, practitioners find themselves in a state of mental and physical equilibrium. Just as the slack tide is a pause before the next surge, yoga provides a pause in the rhythm of life, inviting practitioners to discover inner peace, balance, and strength before navigating the dynamic waters beyond the mat.\"\nWhat can the public look forward to? Watson said, \"While the class schedule is not yet finalized, I will offer a well-rounded schedule of classes, including vinyasa (otherwise known as flow — dynamic sequences with movement linked to breath), yin (a passive, mostly floor-based practice with principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Postures are held for 5-7 minutes with the goal of targeting deep connective tissues), gentle/slow flow (gradual progression between postures, incorporating more time for breathwork and meditation) and classes designed specifically for beginners that teach the foundational movements. In the future, I plan to offer chair yoga and a strength and balance class, both of which would be appropriate for beginners or anyone with physical limitations. I am exploring options to offer heated classes as well.\nAs an instructor, Watson likes to emphasize functional movement, and offers sequences that explore mobility while building strength at the end range of motion. \"My classes always have great playlists, a light mood and a long savasana,\" she said. Additionally, they'll offer special workshops on posture and alignment, along with events like sound baths and collaborations with other wellness providers (think yoga + acupuncture, essential oils, etc). Watson said she welcomes anyone who is curious, or even hesitant, about beginning a yoga practice to stop by and have a chat so they can find the right class for them. She'll also offer private instruction for students who may want more individualized attention.\nAlthough the opening date is not set yet, Slack Tide Yoga studio is predicted to open in early spring 2024. Stay tuned for more information on opening day and an open house by following the studio on Facebook at Slack Tide Yoga Studio, Instagram at @slacktideyoga studio or sign up for email updates at www.slacktideyoga.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Gladwin from the University System of Maryland spoke about a new program that would bring medical students to the Eastern Shore, and Sara Rich talked about the growth of the Choptank Community Health System.\nGladwin, who is dean of the University of Maryland School of Medicine and vice president for medical affairs at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, talked about the Rural Health Equity and Access Longitudinal elective program.\nOnce in place, he said the program will have students spend their first two years in Baltimore, coming to the Eastern Shore to do rotations. For students' last two years, they will spend four months of each year learning and training on the Eastern Shore.\nThis program will address a need for more health care on the Shore, Gladwin said. The five counties in the state with the fewest primary care physicians per capita are all on the Eastern Shore.\n\"As we all know, there is a pressing need to enhance physician and medical provider services and hospital services for the Eastern Shore,\" he said.\nThis new program is a partnership between the University of Maryland, Baltimore, the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. Between the three partners, Gladwin said $300,000 has been invested to start the program.\nHe said a director, assistant director and administrative support staff have been hired. The estimated cost to support and build the program is about $2.2 million per year, Gladwin said.\n\"We put in a federal grant for the program,\" he said. \"And we think it would be very helpful to get state support for this.\"\nGladwin said they are mainly seeking scholarship support for the program. He said they would like to be able to give out full scholarships to students in the program who agree to staying on the Eastern Shore to work.\n\"We think there's a lot of interest (from) our students in rural health care, in health equity,\" Gladwin said. \"And we think this could be a signature program to attract future doctors.\"\nEastern Shore Delegation Chair Del. Chris Adams (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said he was appreciative of the efforts to get this program going.\n\"It is surely needed,\" he said of the program.\nAlso during the meeting on Friday, Choptank Community Health System CEO Sarah Rich talked about Choptank Community Health's expansions on the Shore.\nCurrently, the health system has seven health centers and 18 school-based health centers across Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties.\nRich said progress on the construction of its new center in Federalsburg is moving along \"very well.\" The health system broke ground on this project in the early summer of 2023.\nThis new center will have five wings for medical, dental and behavioral health services. It will house a rural residency program in partnership with the University of Maryland School of Medicine and University of Maryland Shore Regional Health, as well as a dental residency program.\nRich also talked about Choptank Community Health's expansion into Kent County, which includes a health center in Chestertown and a school-based health center in Rock Hall.\nBehavioral health in schools is another way the health system has expanded.\n\"We know that is a huge need,\" she said. \"So we do have therapists now in Caroline and Talbot counties.\"\nRich said they plan to offer these services to students in Kent County and Queen Anne's County schools next. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Health coalition raises issue with state regulations\n\n February 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 472\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — During an Eastern Shore Delegation meeting held Friday on Zoom, the Eastern Shore Behavioral Health Coalition expressed concern about new state regulations moving to a fee-for-service model and a proposed bill regarding telehealth services in schools.The Eastern Shore Behavioral Health Coalition gave a presentation about behavioral health issues and initiatives on the Eastern Shore. Tina Brown, director of Eastern Shore Crisis Response, said they currently serve eight of the nine counties on the Shore, and as of now, all services provided are funded by grant money.\nFor Brown, moving toward a fee-for-service model will be \"devastating to our clients on the Shore and our program on the Shore.\"\nThe issue arises with the population on the Eastern Shore needing to be more significant to support those services in a fee-for-service system. Brown said that for the program to be successful, her team would need to see 10,515 cases every year and be able to bill for at least one hour.\nThat is three times the number that her team saw last year and is 59% of the population in Kent County.\nUnder the new regulations, the crisis team must cut their time working with families and children.\nCurrently, the mobile response stabilization service would work with families for about eight weeks. Under this new model, the team would be able to work with families for only two weeks.\n\"If we don't have that support, then I think what we're going to see people back in the emergency rooms or interactions with the criminal justice system,\" Brown said.\nTELEHEALTH SERVICESAnother concern brought to the delegation was a proposed bill regarding telehealth services in schools.\nJessica Tuel from Caroline County's Local Addictions Authority said there is no way to ensure background checks on providers or to check qualifications for the services they would provide, as well as an inability to connect or communicate between outside telehealth providers and school staff.\n\"If the student sees an outside provider and is in an active crisis after the session, there is going to be no one there to support that child,\" Tuel said.\nOTHER INITIATIVESIn addition to these concerns, the coalition brought up other initiatives. About $4 million has been allocated to assess the status of the Upper Shore Community Mental Health Center, and plans are underway for a crisis stabilization center there.\nAdrienne Breidenstine, vice president of policy and communications for the Behavioral Health System in Baltimore, helps lead the fund Maryland 988 campaign that supports establishing a 988 trust fund through a cell phone fee of 25 cents to help fund crisis services on the Eastern Shore.\nThis 988 campaign will generate $15 to 20 million annually and can be used to support Maryland's network of non-aid helplines and related crisis services.\n\"This is the year to do it,\" Breidenstine said. \"We urge that you support this legislation when it does come for a vote.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Safe Chain Solutions to settle alleged counterfeit HIV drug claims\n\n February 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Local News \n \n 754\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Over two years of civil litigation against Cambridge-based pharmaceutical distributor Safe Chain Solutions relating to its alleged implication in a counterfeit HIV drug scheme has reached a settlement, according to federal court documents.A consent judgment and permanent injunction filed Feb. 20 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York is awaiting a signature from a federal judge, which will formally settle Gilead Sciences Inc's complex lawsuit against the local pharmaceutical distributor and its founders, brothers Charlie and Patrick Boyd.\nGilead is a biopharmaceutical company that develops and markets a variety of medications, including drugs that treat or prevent HIV.\nThe complaint, originally filed in 2021 and amended in 2022, alleged Safe Chain's involvement in the distribution of authentic-looking bottles of two of Gilead's HIV medications, Biktarvy and Descovy, to pharmacies across the country.\nGilead's deeper investigation into the alleged scheme revealed that some of the bottles contained completely different drugs not used to treat HIV. Some of the bottles reportedly contained quetiapine, or Seroquel XR — an antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, according to the amended complaint.\nThe complaint alleged that some of the counterfeit bottles purchased from Safe Chain, which were received by pharmacies and later reported to the pharmacies by customers, came with falsified pedigrees, or documentation, that claimed to trace the drugs back to an authentic source.\nThe consent judgment and permanent injunction will prohibit Safe Chain from selling any Gilead product in the United States, including a number of Gilead's HIV medications.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Gilead will have the right to have an independent firm audit Safe Chain's purchase and sales records for all products bought and sold after the consent judgment is entered, according to the document.\nThe firm will not provide information to Gilead unless it relates to Gilead-branded products or non-compliance with the order.\nAdditionally, Safe Chain will be required to relinquish its rights to over $2.7 million in frozen assets, which includes over $1.9 million of Safe Chain's funds in an equitable trust account and money in the brothers' personal investment and life insurance accounts.\nIf a court finds that Safe Chain violated any terms of the consent judgment and injunction, the company would be required to pay Gilead 100 times the wholesale acquisition cost of the Gilead product sold, according to the document.\nThe wholesale acquisition cost for Biktarvy is over $3,000. Descovy is over $2,000.\nDespite the lawsuit's allegations, Safe Chain believes that the drugs \"were actually legitimate Gilead products that had been diverted into the stream of commerce,\" said August Matteis, an attorney for the the company.\nIn counterclaims against Gilead, Safe Chain alleged that Gilead's accusations were \"false and defamatory\" and that Gilead was \"motivated by trying to destroy the secondary market for its drugs,\" he said.\nAccording to Matteis, Safe Chain believes Gilead sued the company in \"an attempt to cover up the fact that thousands of bottles of Gilead HIV drugs entered the stream of commerce due to poor oversight of Gilead's free drug access program in Florida.\"\n\"There has been no judicial ruling on Gilead's claims against Safe Chain or on Safe Chain's counterclaims against Gilead,\" he said. \"Safe Chain agreed to settle this case to end the legal costs associated with this litigation and to get back to running its business.\"\nGilead's lawsuit was not the only documentation explaining concerns with Safe Chain.\nA June 2023 warning letter issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration detailed the company's violations of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. It followed the FDA's monthlong inspection of Safe Chain's Cambridge facility from April to May 2022.\nSpecifically, it called the company out for not having adequate verification systems required under law that \"may have resulted in suspect product entering the supply chain\" rather than being quarantined, according to the letter.\nThe letter also confirmed that Safe Chain purchased products from other drug wholesalers that were not authorized, failed to maintain records of suspect product investigations and failed to respond to notifications of illegitimate products.\nThe Feb. 20 injunction prohibiting Safe Chain from selling Gilead products ensures that Safe Chain \"will never again be a source of counterfeit versions of our medicines,\" according to a Gilead spokesperson.\n\"This is the latest result of years of work reflecting our longstanding commitment to protect patients and the public from bad actors selling counterfeit and illicit versions of Gilead's medicines,\" the spokesperson said in an email. \"This includes working closely with the FDA, FBI and prosecutors to dismantle this counterfeiting network, deter bad actors, and thwart illegal pharmaceutical distribution.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Many rural hospitals losing money, hundreds could close nationally; Medicare Advantage adds to challenges\n\n February 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: National \n \n 1190\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Rural hospitals across the U.S. are struggling – with half operating in the red and 418 \"vulnerable to closure.\"That is according to a new analysis by the Chartis Center for Rural Health.\nChicago-based Chartis looked at the financials and operating conditions at 2,115 hospitals in rural areas and small towns nationally.\nThe landscape is a cause for concern as pre-pandemic challenges conspire with new ones created by Medicare Advantage reimbursements.\nThe health consulting and research firm found 55% of independent rural hospitals and 42% of ones affiliated are suffering financial losses. Some of those hospitals and health care providers are struggling to pay vendors on time, while others are struggling to make payroll, said Michael Topchik, national leader for Chartis' rural health programs.\nAlan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, said rural hospitals and medical centers were facing tough times before the pandemic. They benefited from the big spending outlays during COVID.\nNow, realities are sinking back in, Morgan said.\n\"It's a real concern,\" he said.\n'OLDER, POORER, SICKER'\nRural hospitals and rural health care overall face structural and demographic challenges. \"In general, rural Americans tend to be older, poorer and sicker,\" Topchik said.\nTopchik said the current marketplace and national landscape for health care access and viable medical business models centers on private insurance and higher wealth levels.\n\"Any hospital that has a higher percentage of its communities that is employed and has commercial insurance is in a far better place,\" Topchik said.\nThat puts rural and small towns at disadvantage because they tend to serve communities with more households on Medicaid and Medicare than private insurance. \"Poverty drives health outcomes,\" Topchik said.\nPoverty rates are higher in rural areas (15.4%) than their metropolitan counterparts (11.9%), according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nRural poverty cuts across racial and demographic lines.\nSeveral states with Republican governors and legislatures have also declined to or pulled back from Medicaid expansion to cover more lower-income households. That hasn't helped hospitals and other providers in rural and urban areas.\nThe new Chartis report found 89% of rural hospitals in Kansas are operating at a loss, the most of any state. In Wyoming and New York, 83% of rural hospitals are in the red, along 75% in Vermont and 74% in Alabama.\nSince 2010, 167 rural hospitals have closed nationally or ditched inpatient services. Last year, 23 rural hospitals closed, according to Chartis.\nMEDICARE ADVANTAGE\nMedicare Advantage plans – which are offered by private insurers with extra benefits and services offered to seniors – are proving to be a major challenge for rural hospitals and providers.\nTopchik puts it more bluntly.\n\"Medicare Advantage – it's a nail in the coffin,\" he said. \"Medicare Advantage is a really, really sticky wicket.\"\nRural and smaller hospitals are struggling with adequate reimbursements for services provided under Medicare Advantage plans.\nEnrollments in Advantage plans grew by 48% in rural areas of the U.S. between 2019 and 2023, according to Chartis. Marketing campaigns for those plans have increased in outlying regions and small towns.\n\"Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, on average, is less than the cost of care. A significant, ongoing challenge has been commercial and Medicare Advantage insurance administrative barriers, including delayed responses from insurers and denials of authorization requests,\" said Lisa Goodman, vice president of communications for the Oregon Hospitals Association. \"It is not unusual for a hospital to wait three days or longer to receive a response from a Medicare Advantage plan, and in many cases, those requests are denied. While Medicare and Medicaid do provide coverage to the vast majority of Oregonians, inadequate reimbursement and administrative burdens and challenges contribute to the financial headwinds rural hospitals face.\"\nGoodman said rural hospitals in the Pacific Northwest and throughout the country \"disproportionately rely on the predictability and stability of Medicare and Medicaid payments.\"\nShe said in 2022, Oregon hospitals had their worst financial year in three decades, with inflation and staffing shortages. She said labor expenses rose 26% from pre-COVID levels.\nTopchik said some of that stems from those medical centers having smaller billing departments and patchwork reimbursements for Medicare Advantage services compared to set and uniform rates.\n\"They're not being reimbursed,\" he said. \"Traditional Medicare was very predictable.\"\nThe Better Medicare Alliance – which represents Medicare Advantage providers – did not respond to interview requests regarding the Chartis report. The group – whose members include large insurance groups and health care providers – said 32 million Americans utilize Medicare Advantage plans.\nOn Feb. 15, the group said it wants rate adjustments for Medicare Part D services that better reflect growing demand and the costs of services.\n\"There has been a notable increase in seniors using health care services from their doctors and providers, which makes sense, given an increasingly aging population and the pent-up demand after the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the Medicare Advantage program continues to adjust to significant policy changes, including the implementation of major changes to Part D. To ensure program stability for the 32 million beneficiaries who rely upon Medicare Advantage, adjustments should be made to appropriately account for these trends,\" said Mary Beth Donahue, president and CEO of Better Medicare Alliance, in a statement.\nMedicare Advantage plans — which launched in 2003 and are now a $13 billion industry — enjoy substantial support on Capitol Hill.\nIn late January, 61 U.S. senators wrote CMS voicing support for advantage plans, pointing out that many of its beneficiaries are disabled or seniors making $20,000 per year or less.\nSignatories of the letter include U.S. Sens. Steve Daines, R-Mont.; Ron Johnson, D-Wis.; Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; Rick Scott, R-Fla.; Jon Tester, D-Mont.; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; Tom Carper, D-Del., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n'IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE'\nAt the beginning of 2023, a new federal hospital designation aimed to help financially struggling rural hospitals avoid closure — but will further change what kinds of services are available.\nThe Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) designation offers hospitals a potential $3.2 million annual payment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service if they convert into an emergency room and outpatient medical services model and ditch inpatient services.\nChartis projects close to 400 rural hospitals will convert to the REH model.\nMorgan said there are misconceptions that rural hospital operators are to blame for their predicaments. Instead, he says the main factors are labor shortages, tough finances driven by patient loads with higher levels of Medicaid, Medicare and uninsured patients, and Medicare Advantage reimbursement challenges.\n\"This isn't rocket science,\" Morgan said.\nBut the answers aren't so easy, and some federal and marketplace actions add to rural health challenges.\nThe Chartis study found substantial numbers of rural hospitals have cut inpatient services, such as chemotherapy treatments or obstetrics.\nMorgan said Medicare Advantage plans work well in suburban and urban hospital settings, where more patients overall are on private insurance, and bigger hospital systems are better equipped to work with MCA providers on reimbursements.\n\"Medicare Advantage is a great urban program,\" Morgan said, stressing the juxtaposition to its impact in rural regions.\nOn a broader level, Morgan said the American health care system will have to come to the realization that while private health care can work in metropolitan areas, it is a challenge in small towns and the hinterlands.\n\"At some point, we just have to treat rural hospitals and rural health care as a utility,\" Morgan said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She shared an experience she had with a doctor who downplayed the pain she was experiencing because of endometriosis.\n\"All I could think about was my nieces or some other younger generation, laying in that bed and being spoken to that way and not knowing how to advocate for themselves. And that made me really angry. So it is kind of my theme this year is just, please advocate for yourself,\" Hannawald said.\nShe highlighted the need for doctors to listen to and understand patients' experiences and for women to advocate for themselves regarding their healthcare.\nOTHER ACTIONS\nThe County Council unanimously approved several other items, including:\nReappointing Jennifer Williams to the Police Accountability Board.Appointing Tanisha Shields, case manager for Tabot Caroline County from the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services, to the Local Drug and Alcohol Abuse Council.The council received a request from Critchlow Adkins Children's Center for a letter of support for their effort to secure a state bond initiative of $500,000 to expand their space. The council unanimously approved this request to provide a letter of support for Critchlow Adkins Children's Center's state bond funding request.\nAn update was given by Dr. Maria Maguire from the Board of Health. This update included introducing Brendan Cane as the new director of environmental health, providing data on cancer rates and priorities like reducing melanoma diagnoses and announcing new and expanded health department programs and services. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ferguson indicated he was unwilling to bring the bill for a vote if it was likely to fail.\n\"For this year, it's certainly over,\" said Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee Chair Will Smith (D-Montgomery), noting the bill would have fallen one or two votes shy of passing his committee.\nAlthough Democratic leaders — from Gov. Wes Moore to Ferguson and Smith — all previously expressed support for the bill, they said there would be no last-ditch efforts to change lawmakers' minds on an issue that is deeply sensitive for both supporters and opponents.\n\"I told every member of this committee that on issues like this, it's a vote of conscience,\" Smith said. \"It's so personal. It's such a tough issue … In order to come to me and say, 'Hey, look, I'm expressing unreadiness, I cannot vote for this bill,' I would honor that.\"\nThis bill, known as the End-of-Life Option Act, sought to make Maryland the 12th jurisdiction to legalize medical aid in dying, which provides patients with incurable illnesses the option to die by self-administering lethal medication. Patients would have been eligible if they had less than six months to live, were of sound mind and made a series of oral and written requests.\nAs the Senate and House considered companion bills over the past few weeks, the issue became the subject of contentious debate and hours of testimony. Proponents said aid in dying was a matter of dignity and bodily autonomy, while opponents expressed religious, ethical and moral concerns.\nThe bill's failure elicited strong emotions from its supporters on Friday, many of whom have experienced years of setbacks on the issue.\n\"It's gut wrenching,\" said Sen. Ariana Kelly (D-Montgomery), a member of the Judicial Proceedings Committee and a bill co-sponsor. \"The proponents of this bill have come before the legislature, year after year, explaining why it's necessary. I have a broad community of constituents back at home and friends and colleagues who I see in Annapolis who are gutted … People feel this very personally.\"\nAmong those who testified in support of the bill was Diane Kraus, a 59-year-old Baltimore woman living with metastatic breast cancer. She said she wanted to have the option of medical aid in dying in the event her condition became terminal.\n\"I'm really disappointed,\" Kraus said in a phone interview. \"I don't want to have to move out of state in order to be able to use this.\"\nBut one opponent said the bill's demise was the right outcome.\n\"I'm actually very pleased,\" said Sen. Mike McKay (R-Allegany, Garrett, Washington). \"I know that it's a very, very personal piece of legislation that affects each of us much differently than (Republicans) to (Democrats) or rural to suburban … There's just people (who) weren't comfortable moving forward.\"\nWhile the bill has met its end for this session, lawmakers said they anticipate reintroducing aid-in-dying legislation in upcoming terms.\n\"This is one that in time, maybe things will change with more education and more discussion,\" Ferguson said. \"And so it's best to just know that it's just not happening this year.\"\nAngelique Gingras contributed reporting for this story. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Advocating for endometriosis awareness\n\n March 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 598\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For years, Shannon Hannawald has been a vocal advocate for what is seen as a \"private disorder.\"Endometriosis is a disorder in which tissue similar to the tissue that lines the uterus grows outside the uterus in places where it doesn't belong. Hannawald has made it her mission to spread awareness and create a community of support for people diagnosed with endometriosis.\nEndometriosis affects 1 in 10 women and often begins during teenage years. Hannawald was one of these girls. At 15, she was experiencing severe menstrual cramping, which caused her to be in and out of hospitals.\nShe went years without receiving a diagnosis. Hannawald said that she felt isolated and got to the point where she started to believe it was all in her head and that she was \"crazy.\" After years of having her pain go unvalidated, she attempted to take her own life.\n\"I was tired of fighting. I was tired of nobody listening to me,\" Hannawald said. \"I started to wonder if maybe I was crazy. Maybe it was in my head because nobody would listen to me. Thankfully, my mom found me before anything happened and called the ambulance.\"\nAt the age of 20, she found a new doctor, who immediately recognized her symptoms, and after receiving laparoscopic surgery, she was confirmed to have severe stage 4 endometriosis.\nCurrently, the only way to diagnose endometriosis is through laparoscopy, a minor, minimally invasive surgical procedure that is done under general anesthesia.\nAccording to a study by Yale, on average, women in the United States will suffer from symptoms of endometriosis for ten years before receiving a proper diagnosis. Hannawald said her pain was often assumed to be related to her menstrual cycle or in her head entirely.\nDoubts about women's pain has been shown to affect treatment for a wide range of health issues, including heart problems, reproductive health, chronic illnesses, adolescent pain and physical pain.\nOver the years, Hannawald has had a total of 16 surgeries related to her endometriosis. She says that endometriosis has affected every aspect of her life, from her fertility to her relationships with her family.\nHer goal now is to ensure that no one goes through the same struggle she has.\nHannawald started the Endo Warriors of the Eastern Shore Facebook group during the pandemic. She created the page so that other women with endometriosis would see it and know they aren't alone.\nHer group has grown and provided a community for education, awareness and support regarding endometriosis.\nHannawald joined the Endometriosis Association and has been recognized for raising awareness and securing proclamations from multiple towns and 16 counties on the Eastern Shore. She speaks to nurses and doctors so they can understand a patient's perspective.\nFor the last three years, she has worked to get municipal buildings like courthouses, town halls and police stations lit up in yellow for March to show community support in spreading awareness.\nMarch 15 is \"Yellow Day,\" a day meant to raise awareness about endometriosis. She motivates people to wear yellow and encourages county leaders to do the same.\nHannawald says she still deals with doctors who downplay her pain. It makes her angry, but she continues to advocate for women, particularly, she says, for her nieces and young girls whose pain is not taken seriously by medical professionals.\nShe says she hopes to build a better future for them, but until then, she encourages young women to advocate for their bodies.\n\"Don't settle for an answer. Don't let a doctor define who you are,\" Hannawald said. \"You know your body better than anyone. And if you feel like there's something wrong, then you need to keep fighting.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Opioid deaths spur push for kids to carry naloxone\n\n March 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SAPNA BANSIL Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1188\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Jackson Taylor remembers when a peer passed out from an overdose across from his high school. He knows friends who have struggled with addiction. One has been in and out of rehab.Those experiences help explain why the Rockville High School senior now trains his peers on how to administer naloxone, a lifesaving medication that reverses opioid overdoses. They're why he carries naloxone at school and why he wants all districts to let their students do the same.\n\"It's just like a student having a heart attack,\" said Taylor, who runs a student task force on drug and opioid issues in Montgomery County. \"It might be rare, but on the off chance it happens, you want to be able to save them and help them.\"\nCurrently, a disparate and ambiguous set of district-level policies has created confusion on the role students may play in preventing opioid deaths among their peers. But a bill before the Maryland General Assembly aims to provide a clear and uniform set of standards.\nThe measure, HB 1268, would explicitly authorize students across the state to possess and administer naloxone — also known by its brand name, Narcan — as adolescent opioid deaths surge and teens lobby for urgent solutions.\nWhile the practice is already permitted for students in Montgomery County, others have gotten punished for carrying naloxone in school, according to the bill's sponsor, Del. Joe Vogel (D-Montgomery).\n\"We know that our student populations are uniquely vulnerable when it comes to (the opioid) issue,\" Vogel said. \"And this (bill) is, to me, a common-sense step to say, 'Hey, you should not be punished for carrying naloxone with you in a school hallway, and you should not be punished for saving a classmate's life if they're overdosing.'\"\nAt a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, Taylor, 18, was among those who testified in support of the measure. So, too, did Maryland's Special Secretary of Opioid Response, Emily Keller, an indication that the bill has the backing of Gov. Wes Moore's administration.\n\"Empowering people and giving them the tools necessary to help is a vital strategy, especially with young people,\" Keller said in her testimony. \"Making naloxone accessible with every Marylander is one of our priorities because we know it's the number one life-saving tool.\"\nThe bill responds to an alarming national trend: Between 2018 and 2022, adolescent deaths from opioids quadrupled, according to an analysis by KFF.\nThe rise in overdoses has coincided with two factors, said Patricia Kapunan, the medical director for Montgomery County Public Schools. One is the use of social media to market pills without a prescription. The other is the rise of fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid that is being mixed with illegal drugs, often unbeknownst to the user and with deadly effects.\nIn 2021, fentanyl was involved in nearly four times as many fatal overdoses among young people in Maryland as the next deadliest drug, cocaine, according to the state's Vital Statistics Administration.\n\"Suddenly, (fentanyl) is showing up everywhere, and suddenly one pill can kill,\" Kapunan said.\nImplementation questionsIn response to the opioid crisis, lawmakers have mandated that school districts take preventive actions. The Start Talking Maryland Act of 2017 required public schools to teach kids about the dangers of opioids and have naloxone available on campuses. It also authorized nurses and other health and school personnel to administer the medication in overdose emergencies.\nMost districts have not extended the same permission to students. In Cecil County, students are not necessarily punished for possessing naloxone, according to director of student and school safety John Roush. But \"they would be talked to by their school administration about it and informed that we don't have a policy for (them) to carry that in schools,\" he said.\nRoush thinks the bill is a good idea and may help save lives, though he anticipates challenges with implementation and logistics.\n\"We have over 15,000 kids in our system here,\" he said. \"How do you get Narcan out? How do you get information out? How do you make them educated on the use? How do you make them aware? It seems like there would be a lot of time and details to be worked out in that regard.\"\nWhile the bill requires schools to educate students about the benefits of naloxone, it does not specifically address one major logistical consideration: training kids on how to dispense the medication.\nAvailable over the counter as a nasal spray, Narcan must be administered by tilting the person's head back and firmly pressing the plunger. Because the medication's effects are temporary and overdose symptoms may return, it is critical that the individual providing Narcan also call 911 and seek medical aid.\nTo the American Medical Association, the benefits of expanding naloxone access in schools still outweigh the risks. Following a debate on the issue, the group approved a resolution last year encouraging \"states, communities and educational settings to remove barriers to students carrying safe and effective overdose reversal medications.\"\n\"Narcan saves people quickly, and lack of Narcan kills people quickly,\" said Kenneth Certa, an AMA delegate from the American Psychiatric Association, which co-sponsored the policy. \"When somebody is turning blue and cold, you don't have much time. And to wait until a dose gets from another part of the building can be too late.\"\n'Hugely empowering'In Montgomery County, which saw a 78% spike in youth overdoses from 2021 to 2022, a policy permitting students to carry naloxone took effect on May 1, 2023.\nKapunan, who crafted the measure, said students were never punished for possessing overdose-reversing medications and were already protected under good samaritan laws if they acted in an emergency. But teen advocates nonetheless pressed for a policy change that eliminated ambiguity and codified their right to intervene.\n\"Those levels of permission were really important to students,\" Kapunan said. \"For me, it was a very small part of the regulation. For them, it was hugely empowering.\"\nKapunan says the policy does not mean schools are depending on kids to save lives. During the 2022-23 school year, naloxone was dispensed on school grounds in Montgomery County 18 times, almost always by nurses. Since the policy change, there have been no known instances of a student administering naloxone to a peer at school.\nBut to supporters, the measure remains an important preventive step, permitting those in closest proximity to an overdose to act without fear of repercussion.\n\"Students know before the teachers do, is the truth,\" Taylor said. \"I'm a lot more likely to know, 'Hey, my friend has a pill in his bag that he's thinking about taking, and it could have a repercussion' than a teacher would know.\"\nVogel, who is running for the open U.S. congressional seat in Maryland's 6th District, said expanding policies like the one in Montgomery County has become a necessity. Six months ago, he met with student leaders who spoke to the urgency of the opioid crisis and their desire to help address it.\n\"A lot of them have taken matters into their own hands,\" Vogel said. \"A number of them have stepped up and said, 'We want to get trained on how to administer naloxone, and we want to be able to carry naloxone.' … That's what this bill is in response to.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The connectivity issues have impacted mostly back-office systems, and SMH is using alternate systems and downtime procedures to continue normal business operations until it is independently deemed safe to reconnect to UnitedHealth Group services,\" the Sarasota hospital said in a statement.\nSica said DeSoto Memorial Hospital hasn't let the technology situation impact patient care. He said switching over to a new system takes time, especially for smaller hospitals, and he doesn't have the billing and claims personnel to go back to more paper-based financial frameworks.\n\"You just don't change overnight,\" he said. \"There's quite a bit of man hours involved.\"\nINDUSTRY CONSOLIDATIONThe weekslong disruption — which has continued despite a potential $22 million ransomware payment by UnitedHealth — has extended across the country.\nUnitedHealth and Change said pharmacy networks impacted by the hack were returning to service Wednesday, some electronic payment platforms were up Friday and other hospital-related technology systems including medical claims could start being tested Monday.\n\"We are committed to providing relief for people affected by this malicious attack on the U.S. health system,\" UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said. \"All of us at UnitedHealth Group feel a deep sense of responsibility for recovery and are working tirelessly to ensure that providers can care for their patients and run their practices, and that patients can get their medications. We're determined to make this right as fast as possible.\"\nFederal agencies are launching investigations into the cyber attack — which Sica and other hospital executives worry could encourage more hackers.\nUnitedHealth acquired Change in a $13 billion merger in 2022 that has been part of a major consolidation of the medical technology space.\n\"All those little processes at one time were separate companies,\" Sica said. \"And over time United acquired all of them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This program utilizes community nurses, and since July 2023, it has provided over 800 screenings for blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol and lifestyle at venues including senior centers and community fairs.\nCiotola stressed the ability to adjust to the changing needs of the community; A1C1 pre-screenings in particular being invaluable to community health.\n\"The push from a medical standpoint in our community is not to try and treat all of the diabetics — it's to prevent diabetes, especially the adult onset diabetic,\" he said.\nThe health department's infants and toddler program works in conjunction with the Board of Education, and since July 2023, the program has seen 83 referrals, serving over 100 individual children, according to Ciotola.\nAnother crucial program of the health department is the nurse-practitioner-run family planning clinic, in which all clients are at or below the poverty level, with 77 percent of those clients non-English speaking, he said.\nColorectal cancer screenings are also available to members of the public who may be under insured, Ciotola said.\nCounty preventive programs also include children's sun safety events that provide UV color changing bracelets that demonstrate what sunlight can do to the skin. And for years the health department has supplied mouth guards to Queen Anne's and Kent Island high schools and the Lions Youth Football League. While Queen Anne's County Health Department does not perform direct oral or dental care, they do collaborate with Choptank Community Health and the Kent County Health Department, Ciotola noted.\nThe health department's smoking cessation program is pushing toward asthma awareness and how the smoking habits of household family members can affect attacks. And the department is ramping up programs addressing marijuana use and how to keep youth away from vaping.\nCiotola reminded the commissioners his department has led the state through its Mobile Integrated Community Health to provide home care right to the doorstep. Working with neighboring health centers, MICH addresses patient needs and services following hospital discharge.\nWorking in conjunction with state agencies, he reported, the mobile program has been able to significantly reduce unnecessary 911 calls and 30-day post hospital readmissions.\nPlaying an integral role in Public Health Emergency Preparedness, Ciotola told the commissioners, the health department recently had a tabletop exercise with local hospitals, emergency services and law enforcement to detail and plan for active incident response and recovery.\nAnd in the county's continued fight against the opioid epidemic, since January, the health department has distributed 140 doses of Narcan throughout the community, he reported. Queen Anne's County is one of the few jurisdictions offering overdose boxes to businesses and public facilities.\nQueen Anne's County has had nine reported cases of opioid overdose and thus far no deaths in 2024, he said.\nExpired Narcan can be exchanged at the Department of Health at 206 N. Commerce Street in Centreville. Their officials continue to regularly engage in active public outreach, addressing addiction and spreading the word of the importance of Narcan, Ciotola said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gluten-Free Tourism: Destinations catering to dietary restrictions\n\n March 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jessica Clark Wealth of Geeks | Section: Entertainment \n \n 739\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Celiac Disease Foundation estimates one out of every 100 Americans deal with celiac disease, with untold millions more having gluten sensitivity.2024 is set to become a blockbuster year for the travel industry. But what do you do when dietary restrictions complicate travel? For gluten-free people, the world of travel may not be as complicated as they think.\nWith the constant rise in gluten intolerance, more people are demanding gluten-free options when they travel abroad, creating an entirely new sector of business for countries that may not have even considered it in decades past.\nAccording to Global Market Insights, the gluten-free market brought in 12.3 billion dollars in 2023 and is projected to increase an average of 10.1% per year through 2032. Europe has a 6.9 billion dollar gluten-free industry, also growing each year. But gluten-free foods aren't mainstream enough for people to eat with confidence anywhere they go. At least not yet.\nNavigating the Airport\nTSA allows flyers to bring dry food and snacks through the airport in their carry-on. Rather than risk the possible difficulty of finding gluten-free foods in an airport, consider bringing homemade gluten-free snacks. Grab some gluten-free crackers, fresh fruit, or gluten-free granola bars and toss them in your bag.\nWhile people should still research gluten-free restaurants in each airport, having something on hand will save a bad situation in a pinch.\nEating out With Celiac or Gluten Sensitivity\nWhen dining out, question servers about ingredients used to ensure they are gluten-free. Some surprising foods contain gluten, so asking the waitstaff before ordering is critical. In some cases, it can be appropriate to ask to speak to the chef.\nEmese Maczko of Eco Lodges Anywhere says, \"I think it is easier to eat gluten-free than it was 10-20 years ago. But you still need to plan ahead. You cannot just wing it. I never go to a place without having a list of places I can eat with locations saved on my phone. Cities are easier since there are more choices.\n\" Road trips and the countryside are harder. Despite Italy being famous for its pizza and pasta, I was surprised by the number and quality of gluten-free foods I found in restaurants. But I searched them online in advance. I would not have found them by just walking around.\"\nWhen possible, book a room or place to stay with a kitchen. Even a small kitchen can help when gluten-free foods are hard to find. A quick trip to a local market offers an abundance of gluten-free, fresh foods you can cook where you are staying.\nGluten-Free Friendly Destinations\nOrganizations have popped up worldwide to offer help to those traveling with celiac disease. Explorers can reach out to them directly for assistance in navigating their country with Celiac disease or gluten sensitivities.\nItaly for the Win\nRome, Italy, was named the number one choice for gluten-free eating by Your Celiac Guide.\nItaly, as a whole, is making strides in providing gluten-free options thanks to its Associazione Italiana Celiachia APS organization, known in English as the Italian Celiac Association. An organization that trains restaurants countrywide to cater safely to celiac needs. They provide training and workshops to chefs on cooking techniques, cross-contamination, and more.\nMore Gluten-Free Friendly Destinations\nLondon, England, with its fifteen dedicated gluten-free restaurants and bakeries, is another excellent choice for those with gluten issues. Their celiac organization, called Coeliac UK, does the same as its Italian counterpart, though without being government-backed.\nDublin, Ireland, and Edinburgh, Scotland, in addition to Hungary and Australia, deserve recognition.\nBella Bucchiotti, a travel writer at xoxoBella, says, \"As an avid traveler and someone with celiac disease, I found that Greece, French Polynesia, and Germany were great for finding gluten-free options. When you're traveling abroad, it's smart to do some research on the local food and traditional gluten-free dishes beforehand.\n\"While I've usually been able to find gluten-free food in most countries, I did face some difficulties in rural parts of Thailand and Peru due primarily to language barriers. To deal with those situations, I always bring gluten-free snacks and cards explaining my dietary needs in the local language, which helps me communicate in restaurants.\"\nDon't Stay Home\nGluten issues should never prevent people from enjoying global travel. Though gluten intolerance can add an extra step to excursions, those with food sensitivities shouldn't stay at home. With some forethought, planning, and research, travelers with dietary restrictions can find safe, gluten-free meals anywhere their heart might take them.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It could knock a dragon out. I guess it was like sticking your head in a barrel of TNT.\"\nThe Chaptico resident said he was officially diagnosed with having cancer caused by exposure to Agent Orange — a chemical defoliant that U.S. troops sprayed to kill foliage and prevent the enemy from making surprise attacks — in 2015 and received nine weeks of radiation along with much-needed disability payments.\n\"I have friends who are Vietnam vets and one friend [known as] Lone Wolf tells of walking through the jungle and suddenly there was no jungle where they had sprayed Agent Orange, and they had to walk through that to get to where they were going,\" said King's brother, Joe Norris, who worked for The Enterprise and other local newspapers. \"They were all affected by it. I'm grateful because King got to live a lot longer than most of them did. They've been gone, most of them, for 20, 25 years.\"\nKing, 73, also was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2014, and a year later determined it had been caused by exposure to Agent Orange. The cancer returned with a vengeance in 2020.\n\"My [prostate-specific antigen] number was so high they weren't sure there was any hope for me at all,\" King said.\nIn April 2023, he went to MedStar St. Mary's Hospital in Leonardtown where a CT scan revealed a tumor in his bladder. King was put on a medication that he said cost him $15,000 a month, but his white blood count fell from 896 to 6.\nJust before Christmas of last year, his back started hurting, and he was told his vertebrae was swollen and was crimping his spinal column. He was flown to Georgetown University Hospital and given 10 shots of radiation.\n\"King, you're dying,\" King said he was told by his doctor. \"'Quit going to the emergency room, quit getting stents in, quit seeing doctors. There's nothing anybody can do for you. You just have to accept it. I said, 'I don't want to accept it. I want to see my little great-granddaughter grow up.'\"\nBut through it all King was also thinking of others. He regularly brings pizzas to the nurses at the Leonardtown hospital to thank them for all they do. A card signed by many of them sits on a table next to his chair in his camper home.\n\"I thought, 'Well, I can't do anything about COVID,'\" he said, \"'but I can feed them. They appreciate the food.\"\nWhen he returned to St. Mary's County following his 9-month tour in Vietnam, King became a sheetrock plasterer and was even requested by name, but in 1979 his health issues began in earnest.\n\"My knees started burning like crazy 24/7,\" King said. \"It went through my body like a worm. Every joint, everything. It felt like a million spiders were crawling over my body.\"\n\"People were all like, 'It's all in his head, it's all in his head,' because there didn't seem to be anything medically wrong with him,\" Joe said while seated next to his brother. \"I was the one who said, 'Look, you don't know what that man went through.' The stress alone of what he went through could be causing this. No matter what it is we have to stop acting like it's nothing and rally. ... It was hard.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Father writes book to connect with son experiencing long COVID\n\n April 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 686\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — In October 2023, Michael Smith wrote \"Move That Cloud\" to reconnect with his son Dylan Smith, who had lived with long COVID since 2022.Now, Michael hopes his book will help his family again as he tries to raise money to pay for a medical treatment that he says could change his son's life.\nMichael began writing to express his feelings to his son in a format he could consume when he wasn't feeling well enough for conversations.\nLong COVID is broadly defined as signs, symptoms and conditions that continue or develop after acute COVID-19 infection — the symptoms of long COVID range from fatigue and taste disorders to joint pain and heart palpitations.\nDylan has lived with long COVID since 2022, when he was 11. His symptoms have been severe, his parents said. He has been unable to walk or eat properly and relies on a nasogastric feeding tube for nutrients. He experiences severe nerve pain throughout his body and has experienced non-epileptic seizures due to the trauma he was experiencing with pain.\nMichael said anyone who has experienced severe pain has a short tolerance for people and conversation in general. So it made sense to him when Dylan withdrew from him and isolated himself due to his illness.\nBut Michael wanted to let his son know that he loved him.\n\"I wanted to express how I was feeling or the conversations I wanted to have with him in a different format,\" he said. \"I chose a different format and tried to make it heartfelt. I'm not a writer, but I tried to make it somewhat consumable and enjoyable so that it would be more effective and well-received.\"\nStacey Smith, Dylan's mom, said this book was like therapy to Michael, and she couldn't express how proud she was of the effort he put into connecting with and supporting their son.\n\"Dylan had no problem listening to it,\" she said, recalling the day Michael showed them the book. \"And when Mike got done … he said, 'Dylan, I really miss you, and it's hard not talking to you. And I just want you to know that I'm here for you, and hopefully, one day, we can sit and go through this together and talk about how to get through the difficult times that you're going through.'\"\nNow, the Smiths hope this book will help their son physically. Over the course of two years, the Smith family has visited countless doctors and hospitals to help their son recover from long COVID, but pediatric treatment for long COVID is an under-researched specialty, they said.\nThen, they learned of the Spero Clinic's Neurologic Rehabilitation program. Based in Arkansas, this program seeks to treat symptoms of long COVID as a neurologic disease with a 14-week intensive program combining technologies, therapies and rehabilitation, all designed to assist the central nervous system to heal.\nStacey said this program has helped young people with similar or worse conditions than Dylan's go into complete remission. The Smith family is raising money for their son to attend this program in June and has published \"Move That Cloud\" to help.\nMichael said people can find the book on Amazon and in various local bookstores. He hopes the book will not only help his son but also help children everywhere learn to process their emotions in a healthy way.\nAnnette English, a teacher at Saints Peter and Paul School and friend of the Smiths, said Dylan Smith is a kind, intelligent and polite boy filled with life before he contracted Long Covid. English says it's up to the community to rally behind the Smith family and help Dylan Smith receive the treatment that could change his life.\n\"I really liked for people to find it in their heart to think about if this were their child,\" English said. \"And give him hope that there is a better future for him. He's lost two years of his life. It's a child who really needs this.\"\nThe Smiths said people can keep up with Dylan's health journey through their website howisdylan.com. The Smith Family has also made a GoFundMe page for those who want to donate. It can be found at gofund.me/72b8a853. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Valentine's Day heart transplant woman makes remarkable recovery\n\n April 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DOUG BISHOP Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 620\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WORTON — It's been a little more than a year since Mary Ann Christophel, 71, then 69, of Worton, awoke in the recovery room after receiving a heart transplant the day before, with her attending nurse saying, \"Happy Valentine's Day Mrs. Christophel, you have a new heart.\"For the former registered nurse, no words could have been sweeter to hear.\nThe past year since the transplant has been a great, inspiring time of recovery, she said.\n\"I didn't have a rejection of the new heart,\" said Christophel, \"nor any infection.\"\nIn January 2023, Christophel informed her cardiologist, Erica Feller, that her energy was rapidly declining. She told the doctor, \"I'm declining, and I don't think I'm going to make to summer.\"\nShe had experienced two previous heart attacks over the years leading up to this. Both times she was revived by electric shocks. The first one came while riding a bike. She said, \"I was told I was laying out in the street for quiet a while, but they brought me back — it was a miracle.\" The second time while she was driving her car, which fortunately ended up in a open farm field. Again, she was brought back.\nShe was first informed in 2007 while having an annual physical at age 53 by her doctor that she had an irregular EKG test. She couldn't believe it. She said, \"I felt fine, and I've always been active.\" However, she began to notice her energy level was slipping.\nChristophel received orders to attend cardiac rehabilitation the hospital in Chestertown lwhere she had worked 12-hour shifts caring for patients previously.\nShe already knew Sherri Hill, who has been the University of Maryland Shore Regional Health clinical coordinator at Cardio Rehab there for many years. Christophel began doing the cardio exercises there, even though she admits, \"I had a bad attitude about being there. Sherri encouraged me, as she does everyone who comes.\"\nIn the years leading up to her heart transplant, she did as much as she could to strengthen her heart.\nIn 2021, Christophel's 25-year-old niece, Ericka Byler, suddenly died from cardiac arrest. It was later discovered that her passing was caused by a DSP gene that is inherited and can be associated with other family members. Christophel said, \"Until that time, the doctors didn't know what was causing my heart issue... I was then tested for the gene, and the test came back positive. The only way to solve the problem was to have a heart transplant at this stage of the heart issue with me.\"\nAs her energy level was declining rapidly in January 2023, Feller had Christophel admitted to INOVA Hospital in Fairfax, Virginia and put on a list waiting for a heart. Early in February 2023, a match was found.\n\"I knew lots of people were praying for me,\" she said, \"and God was answering those prayers. On the day before my heart transplant surgery, I prayed with my daughter, Julie, and her husband at the hospital, 'Dear God, I'd love to have a heart on Valentine's Day.'\"\nFollowing the successful transplant surgery, Christophel continued to work diligently at the UM Shore Regional Health's Centers for Cardio-Pulmonary Fitness & Wellness in Chestertown, following the instruction of Sherri Hill, and cardio rehab specialists Robin Parker and Wendy Barnette to make a full recovery. The week of Valentine's Day 2024, members of her church, Hope Fellowship in Chestertown, along with family and friends, hosted a one-year celebration of her heart transplant.\nChristophel said, \"For the past year, Sherri, Robin and Wendy, they listen to me, always asking important questions to make sure I'm progressing positively. Going there is my safe place for me to exercise.\"\nChristophel is married to her longtime sweetheart, Kirk Christophel. They have four children, along with 16 grandchildren. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Specifically, the agreement — which was negotiated by the town, the county and UM Shore Regional Health — vests Shore Regional in Easton's Regional Healthcare zoning district.\nThe regional medical center is planned to be built off Longwoods Road in Easton. In January, the Maryland Health Care Commission approved the hospital system's certificate of need application.\nAccording to previous Star Democrat reporting, construction on the medical center is anticipated to begin in spring 2025, with doors tentatively opening in summer 2028.\nAt the workshop Monday, Easton Town Attorney Sharon VanEmburgh explained why amendments to the decade-old agreement are needed and gave an update on what stakeholders can expect.\nVanEmburgh, UM Shore Regional Health Attorney Ryan Showalter and County Attorney Patrick Thomas are hopeful that they will have drafted amendments to the agreement ready in the next several weeks.\nVanEmburgh said that once drafted, the proposed amendments will need to go to the town and county planning commissions for approval. From there, the town and county councils would need to hold public hearings, then vote on resolutions for the amendments.\nShowalter said they wanted to bring the different stakeholders, including representatives from the county and town governments, together Monday night to make sure everyone heard the same information.\n\"We thought, at least to kick this off, it would be good to provide everyone with a basic understanding of where we are and where we're going,\" he said.\nWhen it comes to possible changes to the Development Rights and Responsibilities Agreement, VanEmburgh said the construction world is different than it was 10 years ago.\n\"Supply chain issues, construction time frames were all very different,\" she said, \"so that necessitates some changes.\"\nAlong with construction, VanEmburgh said certain dates listed in the agreement no longer make sense and aren't realistic in today's climate. She also said the hospital's needs and their utility requirements have changed since the agreement was signed.\n\"So we anticipate having an amendment to the DRRA that will address some of those issues,\" she said.\nVanEmburgh said some \"housekeeping amendments\" to the agreement are also necessary.\n\"Some of the property transfers have already happened,\" she said regarding housekeeping amendments. \"There are going to be some updated references in terms of the property ownership.\"\nApart from the amendments to the Development Rights and Responsibilities Agreement, VanEmburgh said additional agreements will need to be made as the project moves forward, like public works agreements and stormwater management easements. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "VAMSA seeks donation of 25 acres for veterans care site\n\n April 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DOUG BISHOP Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 651\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE — Two years into a successful start of VAMSA, the Veteran and Military Support Alliance organization, retired U.S. Army veteran Joe Candella, who serves as president of VAMSA, and retired U.S. Air Force Medical Administrator Eric Johnson, Jr., VAMSA executive director, explained their vision for veterans care, going forward.VAMSA seeks to make sure all local veterans receive the benefits they've earned in service to our nation.\n\"Through statistics provided, 30% of all veterans don't receive any benefits from the Veterans Administration they're entitled to. That is shameful,\" Candella said.\nMay will mark the first anniversary of the VAMSA's resource center, located in office space located at Bay Bridge Marina, 337 Pier One Road, Suite 101, Stevensville, provided free by owner and veteran Walt Petrie.\nThe resource center provides a place where military veterans who are experiencing any type of concerns obtaining their VA benefits or services they may need can find immediate help.\nThe center also provides a 24/7 hotline, 1-844-MIL-VETS, for any veteran suffering from PTSD and immediate assistance for suicide prevention, which several years ago was considered an epidemic among military veterans.\nJohnson said, \"There's been a slight decline in the suicide rate going down the past two-years, when veterans were dying on average of one every hour. However, those still dying in this way is unacceptable, and the need for help for veterans suffering is still urgent.\"\n\"This resource center is for all veterans and their families,\" Johnson said, \"The VA benefits veterans earned also cover family members. We want to help their families too.\"\nBoth Candella and Johnson are pleased with the quick coming together of VAMSA and what its been able to accomplish thus far. The resource center is what Candella called \"Phase 1 of what we want to do for veterans. Phase 2 would be to have a small community where veterans could live and have the resources right there within the same property.\"\nThey're looking ahead to complete that vision of veterans care.\nCandella explained, \"There are those in Queen Anne's County who own large farms/acres that they might be able to afford to donate to help create such a small community for veterans. We have an architect working on a drawing/design for such a community of tiny small homes, starting at 300 to 500 square feet for one veteran to reside. For two people to reside, the home would be slightly bigger. We're thinking we'd have 25 to possibly 50 tiny homes within the 25-acres, a center for services veterans need, an exercise room, and a swimming pool. This community would be veteran centered for their needs.\"\nJohnson referred to the community as, \"Operation Thank You for Your Service.\"\n\"Fellowship is so important for veterans,\" Johnson said. \"All of them lived by a moral code — 'I'll die for you, you'll die for me,' if it came to that. Those in combat learned to live by that code.\"\nCandella said, \"As soon as we get the resource center staffed full-time, we'll be ready to move forward with the living community, and I'm expecting with the support we've received thus far, that will be in a matter of a few months\" Since the interview, the center is now staffed full-time. He added, \"There are communities like the one I've described already in existence in Brunswick, Georgia, and in Alabama. Those communities for veterans were put together by local people wanting to assist veterans in need.\"\nAlso serving on the VAMSA board of directors, Dr. Sushma Jani, professional psychiatrist, of Centreville, who wrote the clinical practice guidelines for both the Department of Defense and Veterans Administration.\nJohnson said, \"We're blessed to have such people working with us. Many of us believe that the mission of their project to care for veterans has been divinely inspired. Everything that has happened thus far has been the answer to many peoples prayers.\"\nAnyone who would be interested in helping with the donation of 23-acres for a veterans community can email executive.director@vamsa.us. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Crafting the perfect spring salad\n\n April 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Kristen Wood Food Drink Life | Section: Life \n \n 804\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Celebrate the season's vibrancy with this guide to assembling the ultimate spring salad. From choosing fresh greens to mixing in flavorful proteins and homemade dressings, discover how to construct a dish that captures the essence of spring in every bite.Transitioning into spring, the seasonal shift introduces a variety of fresh produce perfect for revitalizing meals. The art of assembling the ultimate spring salad involves constructing a harmonious blend of textures, colors and flavors.\nWith an emphasis on freshness and seasonality, combining these elements into a salad creates a dish that is not only beautiful and flavorful but also maximizes the nutritional benefits of seasonal produce. This approach not only enhances the taste experience but also supports sustainable eating habits by utilizing ingredients at their peak.\nSetting the foundation\nAt the heart of every great spring salad lies its foundation: the greens. Spring brings an array of tender and flavorful greens that can transform a simple salad into something extraordinary. Choosing the right mix of greens is the first step in crafting the perfect spring salad. From the buttery softness of Boston and bibb lettuce to the peppery bite of arugula and the earthy richness of spinach, each type of green offers its own unique flavor and texture.\nThe key to a perfect base is variety. Mixing different types of greens enhances a salad's visual appeal with varying shades of green and creates an abundance of delicious flavors in each bite. For a truly spring-inspired salad, consider incorporating some of the season's first tender greens, such as baby kale, sprouts, mâche and watercress. These greens are not only packed with nutrients but also have a freshness that can only be found in the spring.\nFruits and vegetables\nLeafy greens provide a tender, flavorful base, creating the perfect backdrop for the bright, crisp textures and sweet, tangy flavors of delicious spring produce. Radishes add a peppery crunch, while sweet peas and asparagus bring a delicate, earthy, unmistakably spring flavor.\nFor a touch of sweetness, strawberries, mangoes and citrus fruits can be sprinkled throughout a spring salad, creating a delightful contrast with the more savory elements. Selecting the freshest produce and combining these elements thoughtfully ensures a salad is as beautiful to look at as it is to eat.\nProteins and crunch\nAdding protein to a spring salad adds substance, making it a satisfying meal on its own. Grilled chicken or fish can be marinated in herbs and lemon for a zesty flavor that complements the greens. For vegetarians, chickpeas, black beans or tofu are excellent protein-rich additions that bring a pleasant texture to the mix.\nA crunch factor is essential for adding depth and interest to a salad. Sliced almonds, pumpkin seeds or homemade croutons can be sprinkled over the top for a satisfying bite. These elements not only add a protein boost but also introduce a variety of textures that keep every bite interesting.\nDressing it up\nThe dressing is the final flourish that ties all the salad components together. Light and zesty dressings are preferred for spring salads to heavy, creamy ones. A basic vinaigrette made with extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, a touch of honey and fresh herbs can be whisked together in just minutes.\nFor something a bit more adventurous, a blend of avocado, yogurt and lime creates a creamy dressing without the heaviness. Fresh herbs, such as basil, mint or dill, can be blended into dressings for an extra pop of spring flavor. The key is to dress the salad lightly just before serving to maintain the freshness and crispness of the ingredients.\nServing and presentation\nHow you serve a spring salad should be as colorful and inviting as the ingredients it contains. Start with a large, shallow bowl or platter to allow all the components to be displayed. Layer the greens first, then artfully arrange the vegetables, fruits and proteins on top. A sprinkle of edible flowers or fresh herbs just before serving adds a gourmet touch that can elevate the salad to a show-stopping centerpiece. The beauty of a spring salad lies in its simplicity and the natural appeal of its ingredients, so let them shine.\nFinal thoughts\nCrafting the perfect spring salad is an art that celebrates the best the season has to offer. The joy of salad-making lies in the freedom to experiment with flavors and ingredients, always resulting in a dish as nutritious as it is delicious. Embrace the creativity and freshness of spring in every bite, and let your salad reflect the season's best.\nKristen Wood is a photographer, food writer, recipe developer and the creative force behind MOON and spoon and yum, a vegetarian food blog.

It will be serving pediatric and behavioral health patients.\"Last year our Choptank providers and our care teams took care of 32,000 patients throughout our health system,\" Rich said, \"that represents medical, dental and behavioral health service lines.\"\nThe Federalsburg facility is replacing the old one and will be 21,000 square feet and have five wings.\n\"There are two wings for medical, two for dental and two that are for staff,\" Rich said.\n\"We are making a lot of progress on the Federalsburg Health Center,\" she said. \"We anticipate it being open for patient care before the end of this year.\"\nThe new facility will have a mental health component too.\n\"Behavioral health will be integrated throughout those medical and dental wings as well,\" she said.\n\"I am particularly happy to see it go in Federalsburg,\" Commissioner Larry Porter said. \"Good job.

In the last school year, they have had 8,769 medical visits and 1,135 behavioral health visits.\n\"So that is about 9,900 visits right here in Caroline County.

    "content": "Try kindness and see your day improve\n\n April 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MELINDA BURRELL | Section: Columns \n \n 536\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When was the last time someone was kind to you? Or you were kind to someone else? What were the ripple effects of those moments?A few days ago, a colleague offered to help me meet a deadline since he had extra time and I was busy. It made me feel appreciated and supported, and eager to aid him in return. Also a few days ago, I wrote a \"thinking of you\" note to a friend going through a tough time. She was surprisingly grateful, which made the rest of my day feel lighter and more meaningful.\nNone of this would surprise scientists. The \"science of kindness\" finds that being kind to others not only makes us happier but also healthier. Literally. According to the Mayo Health Clinic, when we are kind, our blood pressure goes down and our serotonin and dopamine — the well-being and satisfaction chemicals in our brain—go up.\nBeing kind helps us as individuals. It also makes our communities healthier. Kindness is contagious. One study showed this by giving participants a certain amount of money, having some of them receive a kind act, and then give part of their money to a stranger. Those who had received a kindness were more generous than those who hadn't. They paid the kindness forward.\nWe're so wired to respond to kindness that we don't even have to actually do it. We become more generous if we just think about doing something kind, or if we see another person do a kindness. This even works in polarized situations. Another study found that thinking about kindness (\"befriending meditation\") can reduce our negative feelings about people from the other political party.\nSo why don't we do kind acts more often?\nWe tend to underestimate exactly how meaningful it will be for the other person when we are kind. We're shy.\nWe can get over this. We can treat kindness like a muscle, practicing and strengthening our ability. An Oxford University study showed that doing a kind action every day for seven days increased people's happiness. The more kind acts participants did, the happier they were, regardless of whether the kindness was towards, family, friends, strangers, or themselves.\nBetter yet, we can treat kindness as a mentality rather than a sequence of actions. We can think about how we can live more compassionately, more patiently, more generously with each other and ourselves.\nUp for it a 7-day kindness challenge? Kindness.org and the Random Acts of Kindness Foundation have ideas.\nGather your family, a work or sports team or a book club. Set a goal for numbers of acts of kindness for the week. Reach out to someone who might be lonely or down, hold your tongue instead of making a snarky remark, compliment someone you see on the street, pick up a piece of litter, leave a generous tip.\nThen talk about how it made you feel. Did you feel more connected? Satisfied? Lighter? Did you start to identify more opportunities for kindness? Can kindness become our mindset?\nMelinda Burrell is syndicated by PeaceVoice, is a former humanitarian aid worker and now trains on the neuroscience of communication and conflict.

She weighed less than a pound.\n\"She was the smallest baby that had been born in Talbot County that survived,\" LaTonya said.\nLaTonya remembers the two of them being on the front page of the Star Democrat that month.\n\"So the front of the paper basically says 'Baby girl beats the odds,'\" LaTonya remembered.\nBecause Onyae was born early, she was flown into Baltimore to Johns Hopkins Hospital. She stayed there for three months before LaTonya could take her home. For those months, LaTonya had to travel back and forth from Easton to Baltimore, relying on rides from different people and eventually, medical transportation.\nTwo decades and some change later, Onyae gave birth to her daughter Aliah Murray 31 weeks into her pregnancy.\n\"She beat the odds too,\" LaTonya said about her granddaughter.\nAliah was born breech, which means that she positioned feet or bottom first, rather than head first, when being birthed. She weighed 2 pounds.\nAliah spent three weeks in the hospital before Onyae could take her home. Two of those weeks were spent in Baltimore, and one week was spent in Salisbury.\nLike her mom did with her, Onyae traveled back and forth to hospitals to see her baby.\n\"I just wanted to bring her home every night,\" Onyae said. \"I was looking at her clothes, but she wasn't there with me.\"\nAlthough it's a coincidence that both LaTonya and Onyae had this experience, it isn't a surprise that the shared experience has contributed to their strong front when it comes to 3-year-old Aliah's health.\nAliah is unable to walk.\nOnyae saw the signs of this early.\n\"I noticed it around 10 months because she wasn't walking or even crawling,\" she said.\nOnyae said multiple doctors dismissed her concerns about Aliah's mobility. One appointment in Baltimore was only 10 minutes long. At another appointment, the doctor told Onyae not to worry because her child was around the same age as Aliah and wasn't walking yet either.\n\"So from there I just started asking my mom questions,\" she said.\nThe mother-daughter duo, who live in Federalsburg, continued taking Aliah to different doctors, looking for answers.\n\"It was really challenging because, of course, we had to carry (Aliah) all the time,\" LaTonya said.\nWhen Aliah was 2, Onyae finally felt heard by a doctor, who gave her referrals to different doctors that might be able to help.\nThe Murray family still doesn't have answers. They don't know if Aliah's birth has anything to do with the challenge she now faces. But, as a family, they continue to work toward getting those answers.\n\"My family is very supportive,\" said Onyae, who also has a sister and brother that help out.\nAliah — who loves Mickey Mouse, Strawberry Shortcake, Paw Patrol and Ms. Rachel — has braces and other equipment to help with her mobility challenges. Every morning she and Onyae read books and go over shapes, colors and numbers.\nAliah might be starting pre-K in September. It's something that she and her family is looking forward to. Onyae said that Aliah has a little backpack that she will put her toys in.\n\"She says, 'Mom, I'm ready to go to school,'\" Onyae said, laughing.\nAnd although they still don't have answers, expectations or plans from doctors, Aliah has been making progress. LaTonya said Aliyah has learned to roll, scoot and crawl.\n\"Sometimes we'll catch her, and she'll try to pull herself up to us,\" LaTonya said.\nThough the experiences with doctors have been frustrating, Onyae is still hopeful. The family has plans to take Aliah to a neurologist next.\n\"I was so small, and now I'm 25, and I have my own child,\" Onyae said. \"So I'm very hopeful that things will change.\"\nLaTonya has hopes that telling their story might lead to helpful advice from another family or person who has been through this.\n\"I just want the right people to hear and understand her challenges and be like, 'Well, try this place,' and, 'Call this place,'\" she said.\nFor other families that might be going through the same thing, Onyae has one piece of advice: \"Don't lose hope.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "One in a million: Local boy has 'one of the rarest genetic conditions'\n\n May 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TAMARA FORTE Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 974\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — Being a parent is a wonderful but busy job that brings many day-to-day needs, questions, and concerns. Imagine having to worry more about every fall, bump, or even vaccine that your child receives on top of all the daily worries. On November 27, 2022, Jon and Erin Krisman, of Centreville, learned their two-and-a-half-year-old son, Ethan, was one in a million.As a small toddler, Ethan was diagnosed with FOP, Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressive, which is, \"one of the rarest, most disabling genetic conditions. It affects one in a million people. FOP turns muscles, tendons, and ligaments into bone, progressively restricting movement. This loss of mobility robs people with FOP of the ability to walk, open their mouth, and even toilet or bathe independently\" according to ifopa.org.\nEthan's one-in-a-million journey began when he was born with malformed toes. The doctors assured his parents that there was nothing to worry about. Then, at three weeks old, Ethan got a growth-sized lump on his back. Even after an MRI at five months old, the doctors were not sure what was causing Ethan's body to react in this manner.\nWhen Ethan was learning to walk, at one-year-old, a normal toddler tumble caused facial swelling and hard bumps on his head. Again, the doctors assured the Krismans they had nothing to worry about, as it was just typical bruising. At two and half years old, more bumps and swelling occurred after Ethan received his flu shot. After two and a half years of wondering and numerous doctor visits, the Krismans received their answer. A rare bones specialist, diagnosed Ethan with FOP. It was the first case the specialist ever diagnosed. Devastated, the Krismans began to learn all they could about FOP.\nThere are less than 1,000 cases of FOP in the world. Kim Schultes, Ethan's preschool teacher, explains that Ethan is \"very quiet at school, but very silly at home with his brother. He is very smart and sweet. The kids love him, and he loves the other kids as well.\" FOP ranges in severity. Currently, at four-years-old, Ethan can go on walks, loves playing legos, and loves playing with Lucas (his older brother).\nHis parents said they try to encourage Ethan to do as much as he can on his own, but they never know what injury will cause new bone growth or even potentially lock his jaw closed. \"Every time Ethan is not feeling well or gets hurt, Lucas is right by his side ready to hold Ethan's hand. It would be wonderful to bubble-wrap Ethan and keep him safe from any injury or illness that could speed up the progression of the bone growth, but that is not realistic.\"\nFOP ranges in its severity from mild stiffness to deafness to not being able to walk. Some may need a wheelchair or a special van. Thankfully, Ethan can walk and play carefully. But, the Krismans do have to take extra precautions. Ethan cannot ride a bike; he wears a protective headband, and has an assistant to help him in school. Trying to hold back the tears, Jon Krisman shared the struggle they have knowing that a cure does not exist. \"People should be aware of [rare diseases] just like they are aware of other things happening in their community,\" he said, \"you never know what someone is going through or their family is going through.\nThe Krisman's know rare diseases are not that uncommon. \"Not a lot of people talk about it or know about it unless it's directly impacting you. We want people to know that FOP doesn't run Ethan's life. It's part of who he is, but FOP isn't Ethan. Just because somebody has a disability or condition, it is not who they are. It's a common thing and people should feel comfortable about it.\"\nBuilding awareness is important to the Krisman family.\nThe family's website aims to bring awareness while raising funds to help find a cure for FOP. While there is no cure for FOP, hope is on the horizon. In the summer of 2023, the FDA approved the first treatment for FOP. Girls have to be at least 8-years-old; boys have to be at least 10-years-old. Ethan is not yet old enough for this treatment.\nWhile balancing working full-time, many doctor visits, and raising their two boys, the Krismans have set goals to raise awareness about FOP locally and raise funds to find a cure for FOP. With a goal of $10,000, the website has raised almost $6,000 to date.\nAndrea Schultes, Ethan's teacher, researched FOP last summer in order to ensure Ethan's school experience was successful. Schultes explains that she \"immediately fell in love with the [Krisman] family the first day she met them.\" Schultes said she was amazed by their strength. \"Meeting Ethan and putting a face to everything I read over the summer, I knew I wanted to do something to raise awareness and to try to raise funds to go towards helping research for a cure.\"\nSchultes planned and held a fundraiser for the Krisman family this April. \"I want the community to come together to support the family because it's not an easy road that they are traveling down,\" she said.\n\"Ethan's Walk!\" was held on April 21, at the Route 18 Park in Centreville. Participants were encouraged to \"dress up like your favorite superhero\" in honor of Ethan, who is a daily fighter, an inspiration, and a real-life superhero.\nThe t-shirts from the walk stated, \"not all superheros wear capes.\" Music, face painting, games, Kona Ice, and encouraging signs helped guide walkers — of all ages — as they celebrated just the beginning of the local community's help and support for the Krisman family. \"\nTo help support the Kriman family, to learn more about FOP, or to make a donation to help find a cure, visit https://ifopa.salsalabs.org/teamcurefop/p/inhonorofethankrisman/index.html or email Jon Krisman at jwkrisman@gmail.com or Erin Krisman at emtaynor@comcast.net. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "For All Seasons is growing with the Latino community\n\n May 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 802\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — For All Seasons, a behavioral health and rape crisis center serving the Eastern Shore, has had what could be described as a long and continuously adapting relationship with serving the local Latino community.Ivy Garcia, director of Latino services at For All Seasons, said it began in 2006 when she was hired as an interpreter for the nonprofit. Garcia said though the work she was doing at the time was important, the more she talked to the local community, the more she realized that this was just a stepping stone.\nShe moved on to become an advocate, and when word got out that a Latina was advocating for the Latino community, more and more Latino clients began to seek resources.\nGarcia's passion shone through her work as she began to advocate for more and more services, including a Spanish language crisis hotline, staff training, educational groups, and the Latino Program at For All Seasons.\n\"The people started to trust and confide themselves to me,\" Garcia said. \"I started doing education workshops on self-esteem and women empowerment. I also bring in guest speakers like Planned Parenthood and the Department of Health, and we eat food together and discuss topics they may have questions about.\"\nToday, For All Seasons has established a Latino Program to help serve the many needs of the local Latino community. This program provides bilingual education and outreach initiatives for communities throughout the Mid-Shore region.\nThe services provided range from support groups, case management, advocacy and referrals to local resources. Garcia leads a support group for Latinas on Mondays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., where she listens to the needs of women and finds ways to assist their ever-changing needs.\nBeth Anne Dorman, president and CEO of For All Seasons, said it's important for people to understand that the Hispanic community in Talbot County is growing. Currently, 15% of the clients For All Seasons serves are Spanish-speaking, and Dorman said they are preparing for those numbers to continue to climb.\nEducation has been the staple of expanding mental health services for the Latino community. Garcia said that mental health is seen as taboo to many Latinos and carries a stigma of being associated with \"crazy.\" For Garcia, it's essential to explain to clients that mental health should be taken as seriously as physical health.\nHowever, education does not stop with clients. Garcia and Dorman have made a point of educating both community members and staff on culturally relevant information in order to better serve the Latino population.\nThe entire agency team receives cultural education so that when Spanish-speaking community members come in, all staff can better understand ways to assist and accommodate expected needs.\nAlongside the education the staff receives, Dorman said For All Seasons has also created a safe environment where staff can ask questions if they have questions pertaining to cultural differences that may arise.\nGarcia said that because many of their Latino clients are undereducated about health, especially mental health, it's important for staff to put in extra work to help assist them and meet them where they are. However, what she keeps at the forefront of her work is admiration for her clients.\nMany of her clients are migrants who have left behind friends, parents and children to come to the United States to work to send money back to their loved ones. Still, when they journey to the United States, they will often go through intense trauma and may not know the tools to navigate their new reality.\n\"It's important to sit down with clients and tell them that though I may not be in your shoes, I see you and admire you for doing that,\" Garcia said.\n\"Because to leave your family is not easy, but you are doing it for love and because you didn't have another option,\" Garcia said. \"It's a passion that I have for this community that I don't think I will ever lose in my lifetime.\"\nDorman said one of the moments that made her feel that the Latino Program was working was two years ago when they hosted a backpack giveaway in the nonprofit's parking lot.\n\"I'm not joking with you. They were lined up down the street, and we were their safe place to land,\" Dorman said. \"When you think about the trauma that these families have experienced, you think about being in a space where they know nothing, they know no one, and they are coming here for them to show up in the parking lot of For All Seasons during the backpack giveaway, and be able to know that there's a place for them to be served.\n\"And that they're a part of our community and they are a part of something. To me, that's the moment that I think just really sort of says it all about who we have become for the Latino community and Talbot County.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'A nonstop smile': Delaware boy enjoys dream vacation thanks to fundraiser\n\n May 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 378\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A Delaware boy born with serious medical challenges recently enjoyed a dream vacation, thanks to money raised by a local golf tournament.Bruce Johnson Jr. and his family visited the American Dream Mall in East Rutherford, N.J., which features North America's largest indoor water park and a number of other attractions, including a Nickelodeon theme park, a Ferris wheel, a mini golf course, an ice skating rink, an aquarium, a Legoland playground and a wave pool.\n\"This trip allowed Bruce to enjoy activities such as an amusement park and water park that he would not have been able to do,\" his mother, Amy Wilson, said. \"He had a nonstop smile. We are so blessed for the entire experience.\"\nBruce, a third-grader at Delaware School for the Deaf, has a medical condition that prevents him from spending too much time outside, so the indoor attractions at American Dream Mall were just what he needed.\n\"He can't do regular kid things because he has heat intolerance so bad, which affects his lungs,\" Wilson explained. \"So if we can do everything inside, he can be a normal kid.\"\nBruce was born with microtia/atresia and bilateral hearing loss. Microtia is the absence of an ear or an underdeveloped outer ear, and atresia is hearing loss due to the absence of an ear canal.\nBruce uses hearing aids, which use vibrations to send sound from the outside through his skull to his auditory nerve. He is also fluent in American Sign Language.\nThe Newark boy and his family were the beneficiaries of the 27th-annual Sunshine Scramble golf tournament, held Oct. 9 at the Newark Country Club. The tournament raised an estimated $15,000 to answer Bruce's dream and other children's dreams.\nThe Sunshine Foundation answers the dreams of children who have profound, lifelong medical conditions such as spina bifida, cerebral palsy, severe autism, Down syndrome, hydrocephalus, severe epilepsy, sickle cell disease, blindness, deafness or trauma from abuse. Many of those children may be turned away from other wish-granting organizations that require a life-threatening or critical diagnosis.\nBruce said he loved the entire trip and had trouble picking a favorite part.\n\"I enjoyed the amusement park as I've never been able to experience it,\" he said. \"I also loved riding on electric animals and chasing my mom and Aunt Angie. It was so fun.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "The gift of sight: Nonprofit has provided 15,000 free pairs of eyeglasses to Delaware students\n\n May 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 546\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Approximately 30 Keene Elementary School students received the gift of sight Thursday when a nonprofit stopped by to deliver free eyeglasses.The excited kids received their new glasses during a brief ceremony in the school library.\n\"It's amazing to see one of our kiddos put on glasses for the first time and seeing their face light up when they can see,\" Principal Mariellen Taraboletti said. \"It's very heartwarming.\"\nThe glasses were courtesy of Vision to Learn, a nonprofit that has been serving Delaware schools since 2014. It started in California and now operates in 15 states.\nSchool nurses perform an initial vision screening on students and, on average, approximately one-third are referred for an eye exam by an optometrist.\nVision to Learn comes to the school and performs eye exams in a specially outfitted van. Kids who need glasses get to pick out their frames, and the nonprofit returns to deliver the glasses about a month later.\nOver the past decade, Vision to Learn has performed 20,000 eye exams in Delaware and provided 15,000 pairs of glasses – all free of charge. The effort is funded by donations, as well as billing Medicaid.\nAt Keene, County Executive Matt Meyer presented Vision to Learn with $100,000 from the county's share of the American Rescue Plan Act, enough to provide glasses to nearly 700 more kids.\nAnn Hollister, CEO of Vision to Learn, said it never gets old seeing kids receive their glasses.\n\"It's a little aha moment. So often kids tell us they didn't know the world looked like this,\" Hollister said. \"It's a special moment when they realize, 'Oh, I can see better.'\"\nOften, she added, parents don't realize their kids are struggling with their eyesight.\n\"If a child has a tummy ache, they might go home and tell a parent. But they don't know they can't see,\" Hollister said. \"At a young age, they just think that's what the world looks like.\"\nWhile school nurses have done vision screening for years, having Vision to Learn come to the school to do eye exams and fit kids for glasses is a huge convenience for parents, Taraboletti said.\n\"It's not even just the free glasses,\" she said. \"You don't have to take off work to go to the eye doctor, you don't have to then go back and pick up the glasses. People are busy, and it just makes it so much easier.\"\nBeing able to see properly helps kids do better in school, Hollister said.\n\"Studies show that it makes a profound difference in academic outcomes,\" she said. \"It's one of the most impactful interventions you can provide a child. Everything else works better if you can see.\"\nChristina School District Superintendent Dan Shelton concurred.\n\"A lot of times when we talk about accessibility, we talk about accessibility by access to programs and access to services and access to courses,\" Shelton said. \"But none of that stuff is very helpful if you can't see it.\"\nKeene fourth-grader David Pierre has worn glasses for a few years but was happy to receive a new pair with an updated prescription.\n\"All my other ones have scratches,\" Pierre said.\nAiden Onfroy, also a fourth-grader, was happy to have a new pair of glasses.\n\"The first pair of glasses I got, I still wore them but every couple seconds, I kept on squinting,\" Onfroy said. \"I can see way better.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Escape the Vape Youth Summit held at Chesapeake College\n\n May 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ERIC SYLVIA Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Life \n \n 672\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WYE MILLS — On a rainy Saturday, approximately 35 students from area schools gathered at Chesapeake College for an event called Escape the Vape, a youth summit.The kids ranged in age from sixth grade to high school and chose to participate in an event designed to empower youth to embrace a vape-free and smoke-free lifestyle. Those attending came from Dorchester, Kent, Talbot and Queen Anne's counties.\nThe program was spearheaded by Dorine Fasset of Queen Anne's County Department of Health, Prevention Services and her colleague Anna Ashley. In addition to the Department of Health, this event had support from Citizens Against Smoking Tobacco Coalition and Chesapeake College Office of Student Diversity, Equity & Inclusion.\nThe program is made available through a grant from Kent County Health Department and Maryland Department of Health.\nAccording to the latest available data from the 2021-2022 school year, over one in four high school students within the five-county Mid-Shore region are current tobacco users. This epidemic is largely driven by the use of electronic smoking devices, e-cigs, or vapes, which have been heavily marketed to teens.\nThe summit featured rap and dance performances aimed at promoting a passion for healthy choices and encouraging young people to reject harmful habits. Special guest Sterlen Barr, CEO of Rapping About Prevention, hoped to inspire attendees with his message of positivity and resilience.\nDr. LaMarr Shields of Baltimore's Cambio Group led the morning session with his son Mosiah by his side. An inspirational speaker, educator, thought-leader, author and artist, Shields creates with purpose in all aspects of his professional and personal life using the common thread of Ubuntu philosophy: a person is a person through other people.\nAn Open Society Institute Fellow and a former faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Education, Shields is co-founder and senior director of education and innovation at the Cambio Group. Shields dedicates his life to inspiring adults and youth alike to pursue a higher purpose, achieve sustainable value for long-term success, and cope with adversity in order to create opportunities in their personal, professional and spiritual lives.\nFurther inspiration was provided through the music and dance of Barr, aka NoPuffDaddy, delivering a high-energy performance using facts, humor, personal experience, teamwork exercises and audience participation. Rapping About Prevention teaches the importance of maintaining a positive, drug-free, safe, healthy and active lifestyle all while having an amazing and memorable experience.\nBarr's own journey began in Philly over 30 years ago when he lost his grandmother to lung cancer. He began writing and rapping as a way to work through his grief, and hopes to help prevent other families from feeling the same pain. A lifetime athlete and former boxer, Barr's presentation style is high energy on purpose — and it too draws the students to the message.\nPresented to students in middle and high schools across the country, he reaches thousands each year with his work. He says, \" Kids don't care about how much you know until they know how much you care.\"\nShields shared, \"We are addicted almost at birth to sugar and salt — it's one of the reasons kids say they vape — because it tastes good.\" Shields has spent a lifetime understanding the reasons people and especially our kids get hooked on these substances so easily. These summits are one of the ways he says we can combat it — through understanding and providing a message that reaches the kids. Watching the response as he walked his audience through his presentation made it clear the message was hitting the mark.\nHigh school student Wyatt Tolker attending the session with his mom Kerieanne Hinerman, Dorchester County's Tobacco Program Coordinator, was inspired to write verse in response to one of the exercises.\nSpeaking after the session with Tolker, he relayed the thought process behind his inspiration, \"I've always written stuff — I have a notebook full of things I've written. When Dr. Shields asked us to write down our responses, I knew I wanted to present a message that would appeal and speak to the other kids in the room, regardless of their age.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "We need to know medical conditions of candidates\n\n May 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 822\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n With the recent agreement between the Biden and Trump presidential campaigns on debates, the top of the list of outcomes to watch for from those debates will be voter perceptions of the physical and mental state of the candidates. It will be heightened this year in large part due to the relatively advanced ages of both major party candidates.Such perceptions, while widespread and generally accepted, are not always accurate.\nThat was the case when the first televised presidential election debates between John Kennedy and Richard Nixon were held in 1960.\nGoing into the debates both candidates had sterling credentials. Both were young — Nixon was 47 and Kennedy was 43. Nixon served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, as a U.S senator, and as a two term vice president. Kennedy also served as a as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and as a U.S. senator. Both were World War II veterans. Kennedy was also a war hero who saved the crew of a Navy PT Boat after it was attacked and sunk.\nRegarding their credentials on personal health conditions, they were polar opposites.\nTo address chronic and debilitating back pain Kennedy regularly took codeine, demerol, methadone, barbiturates, anti-anxiety medication, prednisone and ritalin. He also suffered from Addison's disease, a thyroid condition which required regular injections of steroids. None of this was evident on the debates especially on the first one watched by an estimated 60 to 70 per cent of the voting universe then.\nIn post-debate surveys after the first debate, many viewers perceived Kennedy as vigorous, healthy, and robust. Many also viewed Nixon as tired, ill, and lethargic.\nSome suggest Kennedy's long-term affliction with of Addison's disease and long-term use of steroids resulted in hyperpigmentation which gave him a healthy tanned appearance on the debates. Nixon's haggard appearance likely resulted from a bout with the flu and a painful knee injury that he suffered while climbing out of a car. Neither were chronic nor serious.\nIn any event, as is often the case in the political arena, initial perceptions become permanent.\nUltimately Kennedy defeated Nixon by a very thin margin.\nPresidents with serious medical and cognitive conditions that were downplayed, not publicly acknowledged, or discussed openly occurred well before the 1960 presidential debates.\nGrover Cleveland underwent surgery to remove a cancerous tumor in his mouth.William McKinley suffered from depression, phlebitis and epilepsy.Woodrow Wilson had a debilitating stroke after which his wife was the de facto president.Franklin Roosevelt's physical in 1944 revealed advanced arteriosclerosis, cardiac weakness and acute bronchitis. Ignoring recommendations from his medical team to retire, FDR ran for and won an unprecedented fourth presidential term. Five months later he had a stroke and died.Dwight Eisenhower had a massive heart attack in 1955 and a stroke in 1957.Ronald Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease five years after leaving office. There were indications of it in his second term, but it was not confirmed until after he left office.\nThere are common threads to all the above medical situations. The public was not made fully aware of them or fully informed just how serious they were. That lack of openness and transparency resulted from intensive efforts by presidential staff, campaign advisors, family members and the media to shield the president from concerns about fitness to serve.\nIt is ironic that John F. Kennedy once responded to a question about how he addressed the enormous amounts of information provided to him by advisers and staff. JFK said, \"Before making a decision, I always ask … what am I not being told?\"\nThat is a question voters should demand answers to going forward. Voters and the media on both sides of the current ideological divide in America must embrace a uniform process to get and share those answers. The purpose is not to influence voters but to help them reach informed decisions.\nI suggest every presidential candidate and every vice presidential candidate be examined by a bipartisan team of independent medical professionals, and their observations be made readily available to every American prior to elections.\nI further suggest that post-election and annually while in office, every sitting president and vice president be required to be examined by a bipartisan team of independent medical professionals whose observations are shared with Congress and every American.\nThis is not a huge ask. It is a best practice for every organization committed to excellence in leadership performance.\nAs a CEO of a wide range of not-for-profit organizations, I got regular comprehensive annual physical and cognitive exams. The reason was simple. It assured those whom I served that I was able to perform my assigned duties and responsibilities.\nSurely, we deserve and can expect no less for those who seek election to and serving in what is universally acknowledged to be the most demanding jobs in the world. Next up should be the same for those in high levels in the legislative and judicial branches of government.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hugh spoke about the history of the retreat and its mission.\"Patriot Point is the Military Bowl Foundation's 294-acre retreat that provides safe, secure and tranquil outdoor recreational retreat facility for wounded, ill and injured active duty service members, veterans and their families and caregivers who face daily struggles related to their time spent defending our great nation,\" he said.\nHugh said some come to hunt or fish while others come just to enjoy time away. Each group coming determines what they are looking for, and Hugh and Joy provide what is needed. Located between Madison and Taylor Island in Dorchester County, Patriot Point was formed in 2016 purchasing the property and formalized the concept of the previous owner, Jim Buggs. Buggs, a sportsman, businessman and conservationist, informally hosted recovering service members.\nSince purchasing the property, significant improvements have been made to provide upgrades without losing the original rustic appearance. Most groups coming range in size with the average being about 10.\nHugh graduated from The Citadel with a degree in business administration followed by several years of experience in Naval Special Operations and multiple civilian senior management positions.\nA former Navy SEAL, he had various overseas assignments. His work experience was varied after leaving the military. His first visit to Patriot Point was as a guest for a duck hunt sponsored by the Grand National Waterfowl Association. Initially as a volunteer, his passion to help wounded veterans led to his current position.\nBringing his wife on board, Joy's passion for the veteran and first responder communities made her a perfect fit for the retreat. Along with her husband, Joy's task is to provide the guests whatever is needed to make their experience positive.\nOwned and operated by Patriot Point LLC, their sole member is the Military Bowl Foundation Inc., a nonprofit organization. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The YMCA does not turn anyone away due to financial limitations and currently provides about $15,000 a month in assistance, he said.\n\"It's a place where everyone is kind of connected,\" he said.\nQueen Anne's County Family YMCA is estimated to reach 8,000 members by the end of 2025, and with that, Gill projected the Y to give away $400,000 in assistance a year by then.\n\"Which equates to about one in three folks receiving assistance in some capacity,\" he said\nAbout 80 staff serve the Centreville location's approximately 1,000 daily visitors, including members, and community partner trips, including the County Active Aging Center and local schools.\n\"So it's a very busy place,\" he said.\nThe YMCA is currently addressing growing pains, including that only the front of the building is easily accessible by wheelchair, while most of the parking is in the facility's rear, he said.\nSite work has begun for the final phase for the Centreville YMCA, which includes a rear parking area with an extension to Little Kidwell Avenue, an outdoor pool and pickleball courts, Gill said.\nTotal cost estimates for the pool, pavilion and the site work is about $1.8 million. The Y has raised about $800,000 of the necessary funds and is confident the remaining amount could be raised in time for a groundbreaking in September, Gill said. Opening of the YMCA's new outdoor facilities is expected in time for next Memorial Day, he said.\nThe entire price tag for the Centreville YMCA project was nearly $25 million through, \"primarily private funding with some county help and some help from the state as well,\" he said.\nGill noted the project has been an excellent example of community partnership and credited local support in bringing it to fruition.\nThe Queen Anne's County Family YMCA is located at 210 Vincit Street Centreville, more information can be found at ymcachesapeake.org/locations/queen-annes-county-family-ymca. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Learning things never has to be boring,\" 10th grade ambassador Samuel Mora of Queen Anne's County High said.\nAfter completing the escape room, groups were invited to have a snack and share their experiences.\nThe QAC Drug Free student ambassadors had utilized the escape room idea to enter a national competition with Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Kille said. The goal of the competition was to enter an idea of how to share the dangers of pills with their peers, she said.\nThe students' escape room was selected as one of the top six winners of the competition's 200 entries, earning them $5,000, she said.\nOfficials with Save the Day Escape Rooms lent expertise and mentorship to help the ambassadors craft the perfect puzzle space, Kille said.\nA collaborative effort with the whole community, the ambassadors partnered with local businesses and drug-free organizations to offer the event including: the QAC Drug Free Coalition, Opioid Operational Command Center, Chesapeake YMCA, Save the Day Escape Rooms and the Mattress Store in Annapolis and Chester.\nInformation about QAC Goes Purple is available at qacgoespurple.org/home. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Clinic sponsor, Moshe Markowitz explained, “We | Section: Life \n \n 385\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The program's mission is to provide a range of treatment services to adults residing in Queen Anne's County and surrounding counties, whose health and well-being has been impacted by the use of drugs. \"It's a service that is desperately needed here on the Eastern Shore\" Kristy Conklin, clinical program director said.The clinic located at 101 Drummer Drive in Grasonville will focus on outpatient, intensive outpatient and health home — a health care delivery approach that focuses on the whole person and integrates and coordinates primary care, behavioral health, other health care, and community and social support services.\nAccording to Markowitz, providing a modern approach to opioid treatments as well as a friendly and welcoming environment where patients feel safe improves patient outcomes overall.\nIn recent years, opioid treatment facilities have undergone significant transformations to better address the complexities of opioid use disorder. These changes reflect a more integrated and patient-centered approach, aiming to provide comprehensive and accessible care.\nTraditionally, opioid treatment facilities focused on detoxification and abstinence-based models. However, modern facilities now employ an integrated care approach, combining medication-assisted treatment with counseling, behavioral therapies and other support services. This holistic method addresses not just the physical dependence on opioids but also the psychological and social factors contributing to addiction.\nToday, medication-assisted treatment is widely accepted as the gold standard for treating opioid use disorder. Facilities now routinely use medications such as methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone to reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings, significantly improving treatment retention and outcomes, explains the professionals.\nAccess to treatment used to be restricted to specialized clinics, often posing a challenge for patients in rural or underserved areas like Queen Anne's county. Modern facilities have improved accessibility through office-based opioid treatment, where certified physicians can prescribe buprenorphine. This is the model for the Grasonville Health Services facility. Additionally, telemedicine has expanded, allowing patients to receive care remotely, increasing convenience and reach.\nFacilities like Grasonville Health Services emphasize personalized treatment plans, tailored to each patient's medical history, co-occurring mental health disorders, and social support systems. This individualized approach enhances the effectiveness of treatment.\nBy creating a physical location on Kent Island and offering tele-health services, Grasonville Health Services is focused on this niche in the Queen Anne's County area.\n\"The next closest facility is in either Easton, or Annapolis, making access to these types of services more challenging,\" Markowitz said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The executive director's daughter, Ashley Hopkins, is the equine manager for the nonprofit and also co-owner of Timber Grove Farms, now the organization's location, which includes an indoor and outdoor arena.\nAs it's grown and moved, Positive Strides has branched out to serve people in Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties. The riding sessions often help riders improve flexibility, balance and muscle strength.\nThomas said the benefits aren't just physical, but mental and emotional as well.\n\"The one common goal we have here for every rider is some instance of gained independence,\" she said.\nEarlier this month, Positive Strides hosted its Jaime Lee Hutchison Memorial Spring Show & Festival.\nOver 30 riders participated in the friendly competition, a culmination of the organization's spring 10-week program Thomas said around $8,000 was raised during the two-day show.\n\"This was our first really big effort to turn this into a fundraiser,\" she said. While the nonprofit applies for grants and hosts an annual Spring Classic Bike Ride fundraiser, the upkeep of the horses is an expensive endeavor. Basic care can total up to $7,000 per month.\nThe event is held to commemorate Jaime Lee Hutchison, a rider at Positive Strides who died in 2017. Lee Hutchison, Jaime's mother, is on Positive Strides' board of directors.\nJaime was the first rider with a disability that Thomas taught in Talbot County. She is the impetus behind Thomas' desire to lead the organization and assist children in need.\n\"I love how I had to think outside the box,\" Thomas said of her time with Jaime. The executive director said she is often humbled by how much the center's participants teach her — instead of just her instructing them.\nShe has also noticed children embrace the horses and make gains not just in riding technique, but socialization and memorization. Programs, including unmounted ones, help participants with sequencing of tasks and following directions.\nChildren learn horse parts, markings, equipment, types of combs and more. The center also has a life-like horse, Bucky, who provides an opportunity for first-time riders to ease the nerves of getting onto a real horse.\nPositive Strides' HorsePower program works with the Delmarva Youth Movement to bring kids to the farm who may have never been up close with an animal so large before.\nFor those that participate in a riding program, Thomas has seen increased confidence when they successfully complete a session. \"'I can do this, I can control this 1,200-pound animal,'\" she said of the confidence boost many kids experience.\nThe June 15-16 horse show was the chance not just to fundraise, but for many parents to watch their kids ride the horses for the first time. Often, Thomas says family members are shocked by the progress made.\n\"I always want it to be more of a family than a program,\" Thomas said.\nTo learn more about volunteering opportunities at Positive Strides Therapeutic Riding Center, how to make a donation, or its programs and services, visit https://www.positivestridescenter.org/. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Hanson Street.\n\"Most notably is the sheer space and size of this building,\" Maguire said, \"which we are very grateful to occupy, as we have grown in our programming and our staff.\"\n\" … In this building we have triple the size of our clinical space, so that more health services, such as cancer screenings, comprehensive health assessments, preventive immunizations and health counseling, can be provided.\"\nOther improvements include increased parking spaces, more exam rooms and a new emergency response operations center. There will also be more conference rooms and meeting rooms to help the department with community outreach.\nGillis Gilkerson handled contracting and construction for the new facility, which is an addition to the company's Achievement Park, a 14-acre area that also houses UM Shore Medical Pavilion and DaVita Easton Dialysis Center.\nGillis Gilkerson bought Achievement Park in 2011 to transform what was an industrial printing building into a medical complex. Founder Palmer Gillis said \"his mind went to work\" when he first saw the empty space.\n\"We recognized an opportunity to consolidate multiple Mid-Shore medical practices onto one campus,\" Gillis said during the ceremony. \"Our team embarked on a vision to transform the Cadmus Lane printing facility into a high-profile, state-of-the-art medical and professional office park.\"\nMaguire said the new building will allow the department to house its Women, Infants, and Children program, along with other leadership, onsite instead of offsite.\nResidents can still receive services at the South Hanson Street location until the new location opens July 22.\n\"This council and the past council have done really good work to get to this point,\" Talbot County Council President Chuck Callahan said. \"I'm glad to be a part of it. I'm glad to have good people behind us.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Delays in hospital approvals could add to costs\n\n June 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: GENE RANSOM | Section: Columns \n \n 752\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In a recent meeting, the Health Services Cost Review Commission postponed the decision on the University of Maryland Shore Regional Health's rate application. While MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society, understands the necessity for thorough consideration, we urge the cost review commission to act swiftly and favorably on this matter during the upcoming July meeting.At the last session, the commission expressed broad support for the Shore Regional Health project but emphasized the need for a more comprehensive evaluation process for capital projects. MedChi agrees on the importance of process improvement.\nTypically, we do not engage or take positions in these types of applications. However, the unique circumstances surrounding this case compel us to advocate against any further delays. Striving for perfection should not impede the progress of a project that promises significant improvements to health care in a rural community. We recommend supporting this application and simultaneously moving forward with the rehaul of the capital policy, as discussed in the June meeting.\nSince 2017, Shore Regional Health has been actively implementing a strategic plan to leverage the model incentives aimed at enhancing health care outcomes in rural areas. Their efforts include substantial investments in expanding access points and community-based initiatives, focusing on women's health, primary care, behavioral health and the preventative management of chronic conditions like congestive heart failure, diabetes and oncology.\nSpecifically, their plan targets every county with:\nMental health partnerships.Primary care and women's health services.Urgent care, telehealth and mobile integrated health services.Medical specialties focused on chronic conditions.\nNotably 75% of the University of Maryland Shore Medical Group's community physician relative value units are dedicated to preventative health and chronic condition management, including:\n31% for primary care and women's health.43% for behavioral health and chronic condition management (covering cardiology, pulmonary, endocrinology, nephrology, digestive health, oncology, rehab, and mental health).\nDespite ongoing challenges, such as emergency room wait times, not moving forward with this facility's improvements will only exacerbate these issues. MedChi would also strongly advocate for reinvestment in community physicians and alignment to improve outcomes. Nonetheless, the Shore Regional Health group by themselves have already shown positive results:\nPer capita potentially avoidable utilization has halved since 2014, moving from 55% above the state average in 2014 to 4% below in 2023.Emergency department admissions per capita have decreased by 26% since 2014, shifting from 17% above the state average in 2014 to 3% below in 2023.Readmissions have reduced by 30% since 2016, compared to an 8% reduction statewide, placing their readmission rates among the best in the state.Admissions for ambulatory-sensitive conditions have decreased by 50% since 2015.Shore Regional Health has demonstrated impressive performance on Total Cost of Care metrics.\nA modernized regional medical center is crucial for the region. Easton, the only full-service hospital in a five-county area as large as Delaware, is operating with semi-private rooms in facilities that are 50 to 60 years old. Serving a rural population presents unique challenges that the new facility is designed to address.\nThe projects' size and cost are well-calibrated to meet the community's needs, despite seeming reductions in treatment spaces and beds compared to Easton and Dorchester. The facility's bed complement aligns favorably with state averages, justified by fiscal year 2023 volume levels at Easton. The building's cost is reasonable, given the transition to private rooms and the additional costs associated with rural construction and inflation. The Maryland Health Care Commission has evaluated and deemed the project costs reasonable.\nThe retained revenues from volume declines, leading to a 10% premium on hospital-based services, have supported the community health model, reducing the total cost of care and improving outcomes.\nHowever, the path to project feasibility under the fixed-revenue model remains challenging. The Health Services Cost Review Commission's capital funding proposal, which provides 25% funding due to Easton's perceived inefficiency, places a significant financial burden on Shore Regional Health. Nevertheless, the proposal allows for the use of savings from the Dorchester transition, potentially increasing funding to near 40%, though a considerable financial gap still exists.\nTiming is critical. The state has already committed $100 million in support, and the project's feasibility relies on adequate funding levels in rates. If road construction, necessary for the project, does not commence this summer and is completed before winter, a six-month delay will incur a $12 million cost.\nGiven these factors, we strongly urge the Health Services Cost Review Commission to approve UM Shore Regional Health's application promptly. The benefits of this project to the community are substantial, and further delays would be detrimental to the region's health care infrastructure and outcomes.\nGene Ransom is CEO of MedChi, the Maryland state Medical Society. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But this tax season was different.Sheehan, who has a rare eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa, struggled to read the tax documents of her customers. She decided to close the doors of the firm, Accounting & Management Associates, on July 1.\nIt's allowed her to shift focus toward a new goal: taking her nonprofit, Chesapeake Bay Sight Foundation, to new heights.\n\"I believe it had to happen because it made me realize this is my purpose,\" Sheehan said.\nDiagnosed at 18 years old, Sheehan has seen every side of the degenerative disease that affects one in 4,000 people. Her mother, who went completely blind in 2000, suffered from it as well. She \"never complained a day in her life,\" Sheehan said.\n\"I look at it as a blessing because if I can help one person not go through what I do every day, I've accomplished my goal,\" Sheehan said.\nRIBBON-CUTTING\nOn June 14, the Chesapeake Bay Sight Foundation held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for what will soon be its new office on Beach Avenue outside of Easton. Created in 2011, the foundation aims to fund eye disease research and raise awareness about blindness.\nKnown for its Dining in the Dark fundraiser, in which attendees eat dinner while blindfolded, the nonprofit is looking to extend its reach, Sheehan said. With more time on her hands and the help of marketing director Breanne Tsang, Sheehan is excited for the foundation's future.\nIn addition to setting up and decorating the Beach Avenue office, the foundation is launching a Dine for Blind credit card, which will offer discounts at eight local restaurants for those who buy one.\nIn her day-to-day life, Sheehan isn't bothered by the silly mistake, whether it's wearing two different shoes or mistaking rubbing alcohol for powder. But back when the disease began to affect her, Sheehan's mindset wasn't as positive.\nOne day at church, Diana Mautz, the late mother of state Sen. Johnny Mautz, changed that outlook.\n\"One day she grabbed me and she goes, 'You've got a gift,'\" Sheehan recalled. \"'Your blindness is a gift. Go do something about it and help out other people.'\"\n\"I start the foundation the next day,\" Sheehan said. \"So she is our initiator. It was in honor of my mom and dad, but she is the woman that made me start this.\"\nNow 13 years into existence, the foundation encourages not just eye disease research at a high level, but eye care and checkups for everyone.\n\"Knowing ahead of time can change everything,\" Sheehan said.\nCLINICAL TRIAL\nChesapeake Bay Sight Foundation raises funds for the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine's Wilmer Eye Institute, which is home to the Singh Lab, run by Dr. Mandeep Singh.\nHome to 17 researchers, the lab is working on finding cures to retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration and other eye diseases.\nThe Wilmer Eye Institute received more than $20 million from the National Eye Institute at the National Institutes of Health to conduct a clinical trial investigating treatment for retinitis pigmentosa.\nSheehan is hoping to participate in that clinical trial in early 2025. In September, she plans to have surgery to remove two cataracts.\nNo matter what the future holds, she's excited to embark on a full-fledged commitment to her nonprofit.\n\"I'm going blind, and I'm proud that I am,\" Sheehan said. \"Because maybe I can make it useful and help other people.\"\nTo learn more about the Chesapeake Bay Sight Foundation, visit chesapeakebaysightfoundation.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A child's heart at the Talbot County Free Library\n\n July 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Life \n \n 1005\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As soon as I learned there was a new biography of Dr. Helen Taussig out, I raced to my computer, pulled up the library's website (tcfl.org), clicked on the \"Find\" tab at the top right of the screen, scrolled down through the drop-down menu to \"Suggest a Title,\" and in less than a minute had asked that a copy of the book be added to our community's collection.It's easy to explain my excitement.\nWhen I was in college and dreaming of becoming a physician, I spent two summers working in a pediatric catheterization lab. My primary responsibility in Louisville's old children's hospital was to create a database (we did this by hand in those days) of all the cases we had treated of the most common form of congenital heart defect: tetralogy of Fallot. Up until 1944, when Dr. Taussig proposed a novel surgical solution for the condition, babies born with tetralogy of Fallot were doomed to short, often miserable lives.\nTetralogy of Fallot is the result of a dreadful misstep in fetal development that, as the name would suggest, results in four anomalies in the child's heart and its major vessels.\nThese are:\nPulmonary artery stenosis: narrowing of the vessel meant to carry unoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs.Interventricular septal defect: a hole in the wall separating the two lower chambers of the heart, the ventricles.Misplaced aorta: the aorta seems to arise not from the left ventricle as in a normal heart, but from both ventricles.Right ventricular hypertrophy: a muscular build-up of the lower right side of the heart due to the increased pressure under which it must labor.\nChildren with tetralogy of Fallot may appear normal at birth (their bodies having been supplied with oxygen-rich red blood through their mother's placenta), but soon afterward their lips and nail beds grow blue (in doctor-speak, \"cyanotic\"). This is a sure sign that their hearts are struggling to deliver a proper amount of oxygenated blood to their bodies.\nAs they grow and the demands on their hearts increase, the condition worsens and, untreated, the children eventually die.\nHelen Taussig was a bright young woman who, in 1927, despite suffering from dyslexia, managed to graduate second in her class from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\nThe profession that Taussig was entering was famously unfriendly to women. A few years earlier Harvard Medical School had hired its first female professor, but only after making the poor woman sign a contract forbidding her to eat in the faculty club or walk in any academic procession. One of the country's leading academic physicians was known to tell his students that there were three types of human being: men, women and women doctors.\nAs male doctors were uninterested in caring for \"blue babies\" destined to die anyway, one of the few opportunities offered Taussig was the underpaid directorship of a small, poorly funded pediatric cardiology clinic at Hopkins. She accepted the position.\nAdding to the difficulties Taussig faced when she set out to study the blue babies no one else seemed to care about was that a recent bout of whooping cough had left her functionally deaf.\nIt has been my privilege to place a stethoscope on any number of newborn chests and listen to the determined little beats of a heart no bigger than a walnut. To distinguish by ear between the sounds made in such a tiny heart by, say, an interatrial septal defect and an interventricular one requires intense concentration, patience, and lots and lots of practice. I never accomplished it.\nTaussig taught herself to do it by touch. Placing her hand on a child's naked chest, she could make an accurate diagnosis based entirely on the minute vibrations she detected with her palm. Indeed, her diagnoses were famously more accurate than those arrived at by ear. Her clinical skills gave a whole new dimension to the phrase \"the laying on of hands.\"\nPerhaps most important for the cyanotic children in her care, Taussig quickly discerned that those whose parents treated them with tender pity (everyone knew these children would be lucky to see their tenth year) sure enough soon died, while those whose parents insisted upon giving them hope tended to live longer.\nTaussig began to require a similar hopeful attitude from herself and her staff in the belief that even a year or two of additional life meant a child might survive until a medical remedy for his or her condition had been discovered.\nAnd then she came up with the remedy.\nIn a child with tetralogy of Fallot, Taussig reasoned, if you took a portion of the left subclavian artery (which issues from the aorta) and surgically attached it to the pulmonary artery above the stenotic obstruction, then at least some of the poorly oxygenated blood being sent out to the body by the left ventricle should be recirculated to the lungs for an additional dose of oxygen.\nEventually she talked a surgeon, Alfred Blalock, into attempting the operation after his brilliant assistant, Vivien Thomas (of \"Something the Lord Made\" fame), proved the surgery could be performed successfully on dogs. Overnight, children who were expected to die received a new lease on life, and parents from all over the country began bringing their blue babies to Hopkins for the miracle cure.\nThe problem with reading a biography of someone you admire is that, as you approach the end of the book, you know you are also approaching the end of your hero's life. And Taussig was not just admirable, she was a tough but loving doctor who was still working hard at 87 to save lives when her own was taken in a tragic traffic accident.\nYou can find \"A Heart Afire\" — Patricia Meisol's testament to the good doctor's remarkable career — among the biography volumes under TAUSSIG in the New Books section of the Talbot County Free Library's Easton branch. And even today, anyone whose child is born with tetralogy of Fallot should get down on their knees and give thanks that a sweet yet fierce woman named Helen Taussig refused to give up on children like theirs. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pregnancy has become risky in too many states\n\n July 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 703\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Access to health care for women has shrunk dramatically in red states as a result of the abortion bans that are causing OB/GYN doctors to leave these states. These are doctors specializing in women's pregnancy, child birth and follow-up care.Most Planned Parenthood clinics, providing similar care, have been forced to shut down. They were an important part of women's health care. The reasons doctors are leaving are that they are being threatened with losing their medical licenses and prison time, if treating a pregnant woman having a miscarriage or other emergency may mean the end of her pregnancy. 28 million women live in states with total or partial abortion bans.\nIn many red states with abortion bans, women with ectopic (outside the womb) pregnancies, natural miscarriages (which is experienced by a large majority of women who are trying to get pregnant), hemorrhaging or water breaking during pregnancy, conditions that all fall under women's emergency health care, cannot be treated under the bans until fetal heartbeats disappear or the woman is on the brink of death. Women have been refused care in emergency rooms and told to bleed out in the parking lot.\nThe state of Texas was one of the early states passing a ban against abortion after six weeks of pregnancy (when most women do not know that they are pregnant) along with such threats against the medical professionals. In the intervening two years, a new report reveals that infant mortality has risen dramatically in Texas.\nA 2022 study by Johns Hopkins University, reported in JAMA Pediatrics found, after the ban had been in force for one year, an 8% jump in infant deaths in Texas before the first birthday due to congenital anomalies — the kind of conditions that are often identified in utero and lead to abortions in states where the procedure is legal, since they can be incompatible with life.\nThis compared to a decrease of about 3% in the rest of the United States. Texas women were forced to carry non-viable pregnancies to term. This sounds like some medieval torture forced upon women and their families.\nThe Texas ban makes no exceptions for the life of the mother, the viability of the fetus or the suffering of families across the state. When a state forces a woman with pregnancy complications to carry her pregnancy to term, she is 14 times more likely to die than if she had an abortion.\nThe study also noted that Texas had about 10,000 additional births between April and December 2022 due to the ban.\nThe maternal mortality rate for 2021 in the U.S. was 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births compared with 20.1 deaths before the abortion bans in the U.S. in 2019. In high income countries, other than the U.S., the death rate is 13 per 100,000 live births.\nWomen die as a consequence of complications during and following pregnancy and childbirth. Why do three times more women die in the U.S.? Most of these complications are treatable during and following childbirth, if there are doctors and clinics willing to treat pregnant women as well as women who have just given birth. In abortion ban states these health care clinics are no longer available. In addition, many of these red states refused to expand Medicaid to improve the situation.\nTo remedy what has been happening in states with these abortion bans, we need a federal law guaranteeing the rights that the Supreme Court took away in Roe v. Wade and left to the states. Letting each state decide about women's health choices obviously is not working. Politicians are not doctors and should stay out of the examination rooms.\nThis mess culminated in the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision in which the court held that the U.S. Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. Donald Trump who installed three very conservative justices on the Supreme Court proudly takes responsibility for the Dobbs decision. He would assuredly veto any federal Roe bill that shifted control from the states to federal law, while a Democratic president would champion a federal Roe bill. Only electing a Democratic president in the fall can change the outcome for pregnant women.\nLena Gill is a resident of Easton and is a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prolonged exposure to extreme heat can lead to severe health issues, such as heat exhaustion, heat stroke and dehydration.Certain populations are at a higher risk of heat-related illnesses:\nOlder adults: As people age, their ability to regulate body temperature diminishes. Chronic medical conditions and medications can further impair this ability, making seniors particularly susceptible to heat stress.Infants and young children: Children's bodies heat up faster than adults, and they are less likely to recognize and communicate their discomfort or need for hydration.People with chronic medical conditions: Conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and respiratory disorders can reduce the body's ability to handle heat.Athletes and outdoor workers: Those who engage in strenuous physical activities outdoors are at higher risk due to increased body heat and fluid loss through sweat.Low-income households and individuals: Limited access to air conditioning and other cooling resources can make it difficult for individuals to escape the heat.\nThe health department advises people to drink plenty of water throughout the day, even if they don't feel thirsty. They also say to avoid alcohol and caffeine, as these can lead to dehydration.\nWearing lightweight, loose-fitting and light-colored clothing can help people stay cool, as can staying indoors during the hottest parts of the day (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.).\nThe health department recommends spending time public places like libraries, malls or community centers if people don't have access to air conditioning at home. Fans can also help, especially when used with a damp cloth to create a cooling effect, the health department said.\nTaking cool showers and baths can help lower body temperature quickly.\nBy understanding the dangers of high heat and taking these precautionary measures, people can better protect themselves and those who are most vulnerable during the summer months, the health department said.\nCaroline County Cooling Centers\nThese centers will provide a safe environment and relief from the heat during their regular hours. Those seeking to use a cooling center are asked to call ahead to confirm hours and availability.\nDenton Library — 100 Market Street, Denton — 410-479-1343.Federalsburg Library — 123 Morris Avenue, Federalsburg — 410-754-8397.Greensboro Library — 101 Cedar Lane, Greensboro — 410-482-2173.Caroline County Senior Center — 403 South 7th Street, Denton — 410-479-8065.Federalsburg Senior Center — 118 North Main Street, Federalsburg — 410-754-9754. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I am alive today, at age 74, because in 1950, doctors were unafraid to do something they fear to do today: provide life-saving care to a patient experiencing a miscarriage.My mother, Pearl, was pregnant. She was bleeding a little and waiting for her husband to come home before seeking help. Her best friend, Alice, came over. Alice was a retired nurse and immediately declared, \"Pearl! You are going to the hospital now!\"\nThe ER doctors immediately admitted my mother to the hospital, giving her confinement with hips elevated for two weeks. She was, therefore, able to carry me to term, her only child.\nWhat they did then would not now be illegal, but in many states, ER doctors will no longer treat a miscarrying woman and her baby because of the anti-abortion laws. Babies who might be saved by medical intervention, and their mothers, are denied medical care because doctors are afraid of being accused, arrested and possibly imprisoned if the baby dies. If that happened under their care, they could be accused of assisting or performing an abortion.\nThe result of \"well-intentioned\" anti-abortion legislation is that miscarrying couples, (please remember that fathers and husbands are part of the ongoing tragedy) are refused care. Then the miscarriage happens outside a medical setting, with no help or sterile conditions and with all the blood, pain and loss. Babies that might be saved by intervention are lost. It could have been me.\nThe intervention of the medical profession saves lives. Get the good intentions out of the way. Let the doctors, the mothers and God do their work.\nDawn Miller\nMillington \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Shortly after, he founded the nonprofit to educate people about the disease.\nSince 2000, he has been devoted full time to the foundation. Prior to the pandemic, over 1,700 schools were using the lessons. As a member of the Rotary Club of Peabody, Massachusetts, in 2022, Fine expanded outreach to U.S. and Canadian Rotary Clubs in the Eastern and Atlantic time zones.\nHe uses the technology of virtual lessons to reach those who he would not otherwise be able to meet.\nFine received his doctorate in chemistry from Northeastern University, continuing his postdoctoral research at Lehigh University.

Controlling the connection between the human brain and the brain of the computer has helped researchers in their studies.\nTransmitting information between the two brains has helped expose conscious and unconscious mental activity. Fields explained how cognitive performance can be improved by manipulating brainwaves.\nFields has authored his latest book, \"Electric Brain,\" which discusses the history, current research and future of brainwaves in monitoring and manipulating brain function. As a neuroscientist, he has written over 150 papers on scientific research as well as numerous books and magazine articles.\nA fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, he has received the Mensa Foundation Award for outstanding research in intelligence and creativity. Fields joined the National Institutes of Health in 1987, retiring as chief of the Nervous System Development and Plasticity Section in 2023.\nA resident of Taylor's Island in Dorchester County, Doug has such hobbies as wine making, guitar building and mountain climbing.\nFollowing his talk with the rotarians, he was inducted into the Rotary Club of Cambridge by past President Amanda Hailey with his sponsor, Pat Neild, by his side. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Part of our mission is to support people of the Talbot County. We do a lot of work in the local community,\" Gunsallus said.\nHe met with the hospital foundation and then presented the idea to the governing body of the church.\n\"We unanimously agreed to give the hospital a million dollars. On behalf of all of St. Marks, I can say we are exceptionally pleased that we can support this much needed medical center that will serve our community for decades to come,\" Gunsallus said.\nThe mission of St. Mark's United Methodist Church ties closely with service and caring for humanity's most basic needs, including health care.\n\"Our vision is to inspire people of all ages through love and service,\" said the Rev. Meredith West, the pastor of the church, in a press release. \"This gift aligns perfectly with loving and serving our community.\"\nConstruction of the new medical center, located at 10000 Longwoods Road in Easton, will begin later this month, according to the release from Shore Regional.\n\"We are incredibly excited and grateful for what this new hospital means for residents of the region,\" said Ken Kozel, president and CEO of Shore Regional. \"We are deeply grateful to the St. Mark's community of parishioners for this transformative gift.\"\nThe regional medical center will cost about $539.5 million to construct. $333 million has been funded by debt financing. Wes Moore proposed allocating $20 million a year for three years and adding $30 million allocation for fiscal year 2028.\nThe remaining cash flow is $39 million from operations, $50 million is philanthropic gifts and approximately $18 million in investment earnings on bond proceeds.\n\"Locally, we are committed to raising $50 million through fundraising efforts,\" said Trena Williamson, Shore Regional's regional director of marketing and communications. \"We are currently in the silent phase of our capital campaign and are grateful to have already received a number of lead gifts from community supporters. We will be sharing more about these key partnerships in the near future.\"\nFor information about making a gift, contact 667-343-5509 or rebecca.bair@umm.edu. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In May of this year he advocated and successfully got signed into law the \"So Everybody Can Move Act of Maryland.\" This law will require insurance companies to approve essential prosthetic devices for amputees come Jan. 1, 2025.\nAccording to Health, prior to this law, if Maryland residents were to become amputees, insurance companies were only required to provide one prosthetic for everyday use.\n\"Think of shoes, you would not use dancing shoes for running or cowboy boots for weightlifting,\" Health said. \"It is the same concept for prosthetics and the importance of health and wellness for an amputee.\"\nSince the passing of the bill, Health said he is working on the expansion of accessibility and fairness in health and wellness for Maryland residents with disabilities.\nAs founder of The Adaptive Athletics Foundation of Maryland, he is working with gyms across Maryland to turn them adaptive by providing equipment and certifying coaches in active coaching, giving them knowledge to coach members that have disabilities.\nHealth said he will be turning 10 gyms adaptive and certifying 30 coaches by the end of the year. Ironclad Crossfit in Easton is the central hub for these efforts on the Eastern Shore.\nDressel said the mission of Ironclad Crossfit is to develop individuals, regardless of their athletic abilities, to their fullest potential through fitness, nutrition, mindset and community.\nOn Aug. 24, Health and Danielle Dressel, owner of Ironclad Crossfit, are hosting an outreach event to bring together members of the disabled community. They hope to show that \"every body deserves to move,\" according to Dressel.\nIn partnering with Heath, Ironclad Crossfit is able to raise awareness and educate the community on the center's capabilities, from adaptive equipment and techniques to the Adaptive and Inclusive certification of the gym's trainers.\n\"We want to open our doors to everyone and anyone who is willing to give CrossFit a shot — able-bodied or not,\" Dressel said. \"Our work is critically important to the general population, as it is imperative that people on the outside understand that we are able to meet anyone where they're at.\"\nHealth stressed the importance of this upcoming event. To keep these efforts going, donations are essential, he said. But he knows it may be difficult for people to sympathize with the cause unless they are directly affected.\n\"I just truly need people to feel what change they're going to make by making donations and by giving us a seat at the table,\" Health said. \"I'm not asking for handouts. I'm asking for a seat at the table, and I can truly represent and speak for the disabled community in such a positive manner.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Access to good medical care is a top priority when choosing where to live.Unfortunately many of us are forced to travel across the bridge to either obtain good care or obtain an appointment in this century.\nAs a local I fondly remember the Memorial Hospital which served many of us from cradle to grave. We had the advantage of being able follow up with the practitioner who had seen us during a hospital stay. The current practice of using hospitalists sends us scrambling for post hospital care (an interesting concept which is contrary to the Joint Commission's mandate of continuity of care to ensure good patient outcomes.)\nIt appears we are in a health care crisis — not just doctors but nurses, techs, support staff. Do we, here on the Shore, offer competitive salaries? Does our community offer desirable amenities (affordable housing, good schools) to entice potential medical staff to our area?\nI don't have those answers, but I do know this, a new hospital is just a building, unless like a Lego set it comes peopled with the staff needed to run it.\nSHARON HARRINGTON\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Panelists, made up of women from across the Eastern Shore, spoke on their successes, failures and their hopes for the future. Throughout the morning, attendees had the chance to ask questions, network and create connections with one another.\nThe panel was moderated by Lesa Lee-Mulcahy, chief clinical officer at For All Seasons, and the speakers included Stefanie DeFiglia, owner of Two Tree Integrative Health; Keasha Haythe, president and CEO of Foundation of Hope; Candace Henry, director of the disability resource center adjunct faculty at the College of Health and Human Services Salisbury University; and Kelly Simonsen, marketing and communications manager at Easton Utilities.\n\"You may be doing something that you may not like right now, but get around some people and mentors and not be afraid to try new things, so that you may find your passion,\" Haythe said. \"... we all get stuck, but I think taking that time to get away is very, very important so that you can get unstuck.\"\nThroughout the morning, speakers offered encouragement and insight to the attendees and to each other. DeFiglia provided advice for attendees to take time for themselves. In the midst of their busy schedules of being professionals, mothers and wives, DeFiglia said it is basically required for women to take some time in silence to better understand themselves.\n\"When I separate myself. … It's really easy to get still and to hear what your body is telling you, what your life is telling you,\" DeFiglia said. \"It's not so easy to do that when your kids are screaming. I think we create these situations for ourselves when we're holding the world on our shoulders, and then we're expecting to hear what the universe is telling us. And I think that we have to create that space and that quiet and that silence for ourselves to be able to do that.\"\nKristi English, director of marketing and events at APG Media of Chesapeake, led the event and provided opportunities for attendees to ask questions and network with other speakers on the panel.\nAttendees met in small groups to to have group discussions with each speaker. During conversations, topics of health, relationships, faith and advocating for each other were brought up with each person leaning forward to listen to each other better and soak in the advice being given.\nAttendee Eileen Gillette said she loved the event because it gathered like-minded people who provided tools and resources for encouraging each other and growing.\n\"I loved that it was about women empowering all people and to follow your dreams, enact boundaries and to have faith and trust in yourself,\" Gillette said, \"and not to wait for things to fall into your lap but to go after what you want and need.\"\nAs the event came to a close, all the attendees and speakers posed for a photo then began exchanging contact information in hopes to continue the connections outside of the event. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Because freedom, when exercised without restraint, is no longer freedom but license, ultimately replacing order with chaos.Incorporating abortion into the Maryland Constitution through the Reproductive Freedom Amendment will make it impossible for lawmakers to attempt to put limits on abortion, allowing for the continuation of the gruesome practice of late-term abortion in our state. It will also allow the government to bypass parental rights to make medical decisions for minor children where birth control, pregnancy and abortion are concerned.\nThe new amendment may also prevent parents from making medical decisions for their children in the case of transgender surgery and puberty blockers. Such a matter transcends political parties for it threatens the freedoms of all of our families.\nAccording to the Maryland Right to Life website:\n\"The Maryland General Assembly has passed a bill that seeks to amend the Maryland Constitution and create a state fundamental right to 'reproductive freedom.' The state will ask voters to approve the amendment language on the fall 2024 general election ballot. While the term 'reproductive freedom' is yet undefined, there is no question that the amendment would be used to create a fundamental right to late-term abortion for any reason and to suppress pro-life speech and action across Maryland. … It is important to note that while the term \"reproductive freedom\" is not defined in Maryland law, the bill sponsors say it would include new rights broader than abortion rights. Some of these new rights may include commercial uses of human embryos and the use of puberty blocking drugs and surgical mutilation of reproductive anatomy — even among children without their parents' consent.\"\nPlease vote against the new amendment.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There were bikers, school buses, fire trucks and tractor trailers.\nThe whole point was to ride by and put a smile on Shaw's face.\nShaw has struggled with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, a neurodegenerative disease that causes him to have seizures. His mother, Maschell Hines, said he has been recently put in to hospice care and that this could be his last fall season.\n\"He is out of meds. There are no other meds they can give him. It is come and go. All we can do is change his diet and pray,\" said Jeremiah's father Chris Shaw.\n\"The condition is pretty hard. He has been dealing with it since he was two years old. We didn't find a diagnosis until he was five. The hospital is like our second home. Hospice has been very hands-on. Very sweet. We started about a month ago. They work well with him. He has all types of seizures and runs a sudden risk of death,\" said Maschell.\nHis father says Jeremiah struggles with memory. Pictures may be all he remembers of this parade in his mind, so they shot the whole thing with their phones.\n\"He loves bikes, motorcycles, fire trucks and ambulances,\" Hines said. \"This is his thing.\"\nHappy with the huge turnout, Hines looked at all the fire trucks coming to her normally quiet neighborhood.\nOne man jumped out of his truck and handed the boy a crisp $100 bill. The Cambridge Fire Rescue Company stopped and gave him a stuffed dalmation and an authentic fireman's helmet.\nJeremiah Shaw gave the bent-arm trucker's salute to get them to blare their horns.\nTowards the end, the Dorchester County Sheriff's K-9 unit pulled out a dog for him to pet.\n\"Thank you for everybody that came out to support him and show him love. It is really appreciated,\" Hines said.\nChris Shaw said, \"I definitely appreciate the turnout. It has definitely been amazing. Especially the community and the people you don't know. The main thing is his condition. A lot of people think it is just his birthday, but it might be his last birthday.\"\nAfter about half an hour, all the sirens, horns and waving people had run their course, and Foxtail Drive got quiet. In front of his house was a pile of presents for Jeremiah Shaw to open. His new fireman's helmet was there too.\nSeeing all that fanfare, Jeremiah said, \"I am happy.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Their nursing certification allows them to become licensed to serve as nurses in Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania.\n\"Our nursing graduates continue to distinguish our program with their accomplishments as clinicians and educators and through contributions to nursing research. We are honored to educate and train future nurses for our community,\" said Nancy Norman-Marzella, Cecil College's Dean of Health, Human and Business Sciences.\nAccredited by the Maryland Board of Nursing and the Accreditation for Education in Nursing, the program is considered a \"timely response\" to a report from the US Department of Health and Human Services warning of a national shortfall of 78,000 RNs by 2025.\n\"Cecil College's initiative to accelerate the training of new nurses is a strategic move to mitigate this issue and support the region's needs for nursing,\" the college stated Tuesday. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Democratic Women's Club hosts meeting on Reproductive Freedom Referendum\n\n August 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 561\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On Tuesday evening, dozens of people attended a dinner meant to inform community members on the Reproductive Freedom Referendum, a proposed amendment to Maryland's constitution ensuring the right to abortion access and birth control.The referendum will be on the ballot in the upcoming November election.\nErin Bradley, board chair of Freedom in Reproductive Maryland, led the event, which was hosted by the Talbot Democratic Women's Club at The Ivy in Easton.\nAccording to Bradley, The Maryland General Assembly passed legislation in 2023 that created the ballot referendum to \"allow Marylanders to make their voices heard\" by codifying the right to abortion and access to birth control in the state Constitution.\n\"This is the highest protection we can give in the state of Maryland for reproductive freedom,\" Bradley said.\nAccording to Lynne McGrath, a member of the Talbot Democratic Women's Club, a flyer shared by Health Not Harm MD, a statewide conservative political organization, has been opposing the Reproductive Freedom Referendum.\n\"I bet very few people know what that amendment is, what it's doing, what it won't do, and how we can help make sure that amendment gets passed,\" McGrath said.\nDeborah Brocato, chair of Health Not Harm MD, said her organization is meant to oppose the Reproductive Freedom Referendum. According to Brocato, the two-page amendment is too vague and could, down the line, lead to future legislative changes when it comes to reproductive health.\n\"(This amendment) creates a brand new right to this ambiguous term of reproductive freedom,\" Brocato said in an interview with the Star Democrat.\nBradley stated, during the dinner, that the proposed amendment does not change what is already established in Maryland law, which defines reproductive freedom as the right to birth control, to access abortion and to continue a pregnancy.\n\"What I will say is (the amendment) doesn't change parents' freedom or liberty,\" Bradley said. \"It changes nothing about the practice of health care, established regulations or laws about the provision of health care in this state or the United States.\"\nFurther on in the event, the topic of out-of-state visits for reproductive healthcare came up. Bradley said there has been a dramatic increase in out-of-state visits coming from Florida and West Virginia, states where stricter restrictions on abortion are in place.\nAccording to Bradley, Planned Parenthoods in Maryland are able to address the influx of patients through tools like telehealth to help limit in-patient capacity.\n\"Right now, Maryland is in the top 10 of reproductive freedom states in this country,\" said Lauren Harton, an obstetrics and gynecology nurse practitioner. \"... So to maintain our awesomeness, we have to make it a part of the Constitution, because if it's a part of the Constitution, then nobody can change it unless it goes back to all the people to vote again.\"\nThroughout the evening, attendees discussed how to combat misinformation, how to maintain Maryland as a safe state for abortions and the importance of encouraging friends to go out and vote.\nToward the end of the event, Bradley went on to encourage attendees to vote for candidates that will protect the rights outlined in the referendum.\n\"So while I implore you all to come out and vote yes on question one, I also implore you all to vote for your senator, to vote for your congressman, and if this is your issue and this is your thing, make sure that the people you are electing align with that,\" Bradley said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Republicans shoot themselves in foot over IVF\n\n August 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 720\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In 2022, a miracle happened to 91,771 families in the U.S. They succeeded in having an in vitro fertilization baby. These babies constituted 2.5% of all babies born in the U.S. that year.IVF or in vitro fertilization means the joining of a woman's egg and a man's sperm in a laboratory dish. The fertilized egg or embryo is then implanted in a woman's uterus. If it sticks, this results in a pregnancy. For patients under 30 years of age the success rate is about 50%. For patients older than 42 years of age the success rate is only 7%. There is a 30% chance of a twin pregnancy with IVF.\nThe reasons for using IVF varies. Infertility is the most common reason. For some couples it allows them to delay when to have children — the freedom to decide over their own bodies and families. Some wait until they are on a firm financial footing and can afford IVF, others wait until they have achieved some career goal. It also allows singles to create a family by using donated eggs or sperm. A gay man must use a surrogate woman to produce the live birth. All these family issues are probably as common with Republicans as Democrats.\nIVF is costly. 11 states partially contribute to the cost, if infertility is the reason for attempting IVF. Infertility is considered a disability in these states. Medicaid may meet some of the cost. A few large insurance companies may cover some of the cost of IVF treatment, if the employers have signed up for it.\nIn Maryland, the cost for one cycle is between $11,000 and $17,000 after the benefit has been applied. Since the beginning of 2021 there is no marriage requirement to obtain the partial benefit, but there is a limit of three IVF cycles attempting to produce a live birth with a cap of $100,000. Most couples go through two to three cycles before a pregnancy occurs.\nIn June of this year, U.S. Senate Democrats introduced The Right to IVF Act that would protect IVF access and lower cost nationwide. Nearly every Republican senator voted against it. Sen. Josh Hawley said that this act was really part of an abortion agenda. I consider this statement preposterous, as IVF creates new life.\nSen. J.D. Vance, the Republican party's candidate for vice president, also voted against this act, despite selling himself as the protector of families.\nThe same month, the Southern Baptist Convention with 13 million members adopted a resolution denouncing IVF. Again, it is difficult to understand why a pro-life religious movement is against creating new life. The answer is that the political right has proclaimed that personhood now starts with the embryo even before it is implanted in a woman's uterus.\nThis February, we saw where this belief can lead. Alabama's state supreme court declared that all frozen embryos are children and, therefore, protected under The Wrongful Death of a Minor Act. As many embryos are created at the same time in a laboratory dish, excess ones are frozen and kept to be implanted at a later date or perhaps never used if the desired pregnancies are successful. If so, they are usually intentionally destroyed. The lab technicians or doctors working in the lab could now be accused of murder.\nIt resulted in the shutdown of all IVF clinics in Alabama.\nWhile Republicans are doing all they can to stop IVF in its tracks, there are other fertility treatments available to those who want to create a family. We do not know if the Republicans consider all fertility treatments a threat to their control over women's bodies. Tim Walz, the Democratic Party's candidate for vice president, expresses his and his wife Gwen's extraordinary happiness with their first child's birth in 2001 after seven years of fertility treatments. They named her Hope, which is what they had lots of all through those years.\nFive years later they had a son, called Gus, also conceived through fertility treatments. Michelle Obama mentioned in her Tuesday speech at the Democratic Convention that one of her children was an IVF birth.\nThe mounting public backlash against Republicans for the threat to IVF has now prompted both Trump and JD Vance to scurry to appear sympathetic to IVF. It won't wash.\nLena Gill is a resident of Easton and a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I'm writing to relay my recent firsthand experience with our local health care system.On Aug. 17, I experienced symptoms of a stroke and called 911. The ambulance arrived within minutes, and the EMT assessed my symptoms as a suspected stroke. They asked me if I had a preference of where they took me, and I asked their recommendation. Based on the severity of my symptoms they suggested University of Maryland Medical System Chester River Hospital. The EMT remained vigilant through the entire trip.\nDr. Lukas met us in the vestibule at Chester River Hospital to evaluate my condition and determine whether I should stay or go to another facility for more intense care. It was recommended I remain at Chester River for continued evaluation. Nurse Agnes provided constant monitoring. Dr. Lukas checked back every few minutes to make sure I was stable. The staff welcomed my husband and daughters who remained at my bedside.\nDr. Lukas said I would be transferred to a more acute-care facility and asked for my preference. They found me a bed in Easton hospital.\nBest Care Ambulance transported me to Easton promptly the next morning. The EMT who rode with me had extensive military and over 25 years professional EMT experience. Our driver was a retired Black Hawk helicopter pilot. I knew I was in great hands.\nThe nurses, doctors and staff at Easton Hospital were exceptional, highly skilled professionals with a pleasant, caring attitude.\nI was not a likely candidate for a stroke. I exercise regularly, eat right and have no pre-existing health conditions. Easton hospitalist Dr. Devkota and neurologist Valentin knew this and ordered extensive tests to find the cause of my stroke. They found I have a rare genetic blood disorder that causes blood clots, hence the stroke.\nTo all the naysayers and critics I say, acute care doesn't get better than the experience I just had. I often get asked by real estate buyers, \"How is your local health care\"? Now I have firsthand experience to tell them; it's excellent.\nThanks to all who helped with my care and recovery.\nCINDY GENTHER\nRock Hall \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is a community of supportive and wonderful people who measure success, not by weight, but by emotional progress made in and outside the gym.Dressel said she opened Ironclad Crossfit to fill a void in Easton that prioritized encouragement and body positivity in the Crossfit community because, in her eyes, \"CrossFit is functional fitness.\"\n\"Life's most basic functions, squatting, properly, pressing properly, picking things up properly,\" Dressel said \"…essentially, that's what we teach you here, how to lift things properly, how to brace, how to get up when you get down, and then how to do it efficiently, faster, better, stronger, but always with good form.\"\nOn Aug. 24, Dressel teamed up with John-Edward Health to turn Ironclad Crossfit adaptive to better assist the disabled community.\nDressel hosted an adaptive fitness event to encourage \"every body,\" no matter the size or ability, to exercise and get stronger.\nHealth, a Paralympic and adaptive athlete, veteran and founder of The Adaptive Athletics Foundation of Maryland, said the event was to encourage members of the disabled community in the Eastern Shore to get out and exercise at a gym that has taken into account their needs.\n\"We're educating abled-body people on what it is to be a disabled athlete, but then we're also educating the disabled community that there are ways for them to do this in a community-based environment with knowledgeable people,\" Health said.\nDressel said she tries her hardest to meet people where they are in their fitness journey, which is why she is hosting a free weeklong trial program from Sept. 9 to 15. Dressel said she is working hard to help as many people as she can.\n\"Everybody has to fight their own fight,\" Dressel said. \"Everybody has you're trying to do better than you did last time and everyday is different. … It's really just helping people self regulate themselves to make good choices. Because we are in this for the long haul.\"\nAngel Nagel, the gym's general manager and a former customer of Ironclad Crossfit, said Dressel has been one of the best mentors she has ever had. For Nagel, Crossfit was not just a workout but was a way for her to establish community and grow mentally.\n\"You think a gym is just for fitness, but it's helped me mentally, physically, with my nutrition and eating,\" Nagel said. \"Your overall outlook on life just kind of changes within the four walls of Ironclad between the community, the friendship, the coaches. It's just a good place to be.\"\nThe term \"progress\" for Dressel has changed over the years to fit into the success she sees with all her customers. Weight loss is not in the center of the success she has seen. Rather, it has been more emotional growth especially when it comes to her customers' relationships with anxiety.\nThe more people she can help through community workouts the better.\n\"Everybody talks about the emotional impact, the emotional growth of the community,\" Dressel said. \"People come for fitness, but they stay for the community. Everybody comes in... But then they don't stay just because of the workouts. They stay because of the people and what we do here as a group.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Recovery in Motion lights candles for victims of addiction\n\n September 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 709\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Saturday evening, over 50 people gathered at Fountain Park for Recovery in Motion's annual candle lighting event to recognize International Overdose Awareness Day, Aug. 31.This now annual event ushers in Recovery Month, a month where Kent Goes Purple raises awareness through purple banners and signs spread around the county.\nSpeakers that night encouraged attendees who suffer from addiction to find their higher power.\nSteve Hafferman told the audience he struggled with drugs and alcohol most of his life. Even after he overdosed, he didn't change his ways. He was homeless until he found that higher power. He said he attended a church once where most of those gathered were former addicts.\n\"For the first time, I realized I wasn't alone,\" Hafferman said.\nThat support helped him, going through the steps to recovery, experiencing something dramatically different from his family background.\nHis new faith was life-altering, but then he got into a motorcycle accident by no fault of his own.\nWhile riding in Easton on March 26 last year, a vehicle ran a light, affording him no time to stop. It was a devastating collision, his bike in shambles, his body mangled. Nineteen hours of surgery resulted in his leg being taken.\nAfter the accident, he was angry at God for allowing this to happen.\n\"I lost my gratitude,\" Hafferman said, remembering being in pain every day.\nFeeling powerless, like he couldn't even play with his kids, after five years of sobriety, he wanted to end his life. Drugs seemed to be the most effective method, he thought. He took enough cocaine to stop his heart, yet, miraculously it didn't.\nHe realized then God was not done with him.\nHafferman said, \"Failure's not when you fall, it's when you stay down.\"\nThe next speaker, Recovery in Motion peer support Bobbie Sutton, didn't stay down either.\nHer loving, musically talented older brother William Sutton IV died of a heroin overdose. Narcan, an effective medication used to treat overdoses, was not ready available as it is now, Sutton shared.\n\"He was always a such a good brother and great friend. He never treated me like a bratty sister,\" she reflected.\nIn 2009, his disappearance had sparked a year-long investigation to the dumping of his body, which furthered her pain, hurt and confusion.\nThe great loss and nature of the case threw Sutton into addiction as well, and after 11 years in that cycle, she wound up in prison for four years in Buncombe County, North Carolina.\nWith support from her mother, Phyllis Harrington, a nurse at the A.F. Whitsitt Center, and others, Sutton found her higher power in Christ and went through the steps. Subsequently, she followed in her mother's footsteps as well, helping people as a peer recovery specialist.\nShe said she's in awe of the change.\n\"I thought I would never be someone to carry titles and make a decent living. It's amazing that women come in and want to speak to me now for help,\" Sutton said.\n\"I've been able to come back home,\" she said, grateful of the people in her life, now three years clean.\nWhile others lit candles, Sutton joined her mother beside a photograph of her brother, holding the flame close, remembering his personality, his talent and his band, The Big Hurt Band.\nDirector of Community Addiction Services Jennifer McCready and Peer Supervisor Brett Forrest thanked all those in attendance. McCready mentioned for anybody who needs help for opioids or stimulants, the center has crisis beds available.\nShe gestured to the table, where cards contain the phone number of dedicated peers committed 24/7 to answering questions.\nAnd during this month, besides the purple shirts and signs, McCready noted, if you see laundry baskets placed in various sections throughout town, it's a part of the program \"2 Sheets for Recovery,\" collecting twin-sized bedding for people going into recovery housing.\nThese are all events that correspond with the theme, Kent Goes Purple, an initiative of the Kent County Sheriff's Office and the Chestertown Rotary Club.\nSheriff Dennis Hickman was also in attendance, inviting the public to join them for their 5K Color Fun Run/Walk Sunday, Sept. 8.\nHe provided a message as well during this month of reflecting and commemorating those lost to addiction as well as enforcing prevention methods. \"Law enforcement are partners in this journey to combat addiction. We're here to help in any way we can,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

You can see the front porches lit in purple to highlight concern about substance abuse disorder glowing through the night. This drug prevention program's main focus is prescription drugs laced with fentanyl.Knock-off prescription drugs like Adderall or Xanax that are purchased on the internet or other places can be laced with fentanyl, which makes them lethal.\n\"What people need to really understand is the Talbot Goes Purple is a prevention initiative. So we focus on kids 11 to 17. The goal is to delay or prevent onset of use,\" said Kelley Callaghan of Talbot Goes Purple. \"Kids need to know that they are putting fentanyl in these pills. The DEA has a campaign 'one pill can kill.' Seven out of 10 pills that they seize have fentanyl in them,\" she said.\nKids can order these pills online, but they are not the same as what a doctor prescribes.\n\"If it is not coming from your doctor, there is a good chance that it is fake,\" she said.\nOrganizers of the effort hold events in September to increase awareness of the cause.\n\"We had our event this past weekend for Overdose Awareness Day and also for our kickoff on Saturday, fourth annual Festival of Hope. This is our eighth year. It was at Anchor Church. The food vendors sold out. So we provided 300 meals and 500 snow cones,\" Callaghan said.\nThere was a dunking booth with the sheriff and free face painting. There was a bounce house.\n\"We have all the fun stuff, but at 7:30 we have a memorial piece. Aug. 31 is International Overdose Awareness Day, so places across the globe come together to remember those we have lost. We put out luminaria bags and pictures,\" Callaghan said.\nLinda Webb, director of Talbot County Department of Social Services, said, \"Talbot County DSS is a supporter of the 'Talbot Goes Purple' substance use awareness and prevention initiative. Talbot Goes Purple promotes the safety and well-being in our community, and we're proud to partner in their mission.\"\nNaloxone, or Narcan, is a nasal mist that counteracts opioids. Businesses, churches and civic organizations can have the medicine mounted to their wall. Around 60% of overdoses occur in the home, so Callaghan recommends getting the lighter sized antidote on your key chain.\n\"Many of our staff have been trained on the administration of Naloxone, an opioid overdose response medication. We are a Talbot Goes Purple Operation Save a Life partner and have overdose response kits installed in both our DSS office and the Children's Advocacy Center,\" Webb said.\nTalbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble was focused on this epidemic early.\n\"2016 was when he started talking to me about Talbot Goes Purple. He was an early adopter of all things having to do with Narcan. He was getting it out to his deputies and going and giving talks about it,\" Callaghan said.\nLaw enforcement is trying to increase the face-to-face contact with people who want help.\n\"The good Samaritan law is really important. If someone overdoses, and this includes alcohol and minors, call 911 and don't leave. The law protects people from six misdemeanors including possession of alcohol or drugs,\" Callaghan said.\nPeople up and down Talbot County are going purple.\nExecutive Director of the Oxford Community Center Liza Ledford lights up their boat.\n\"As a tradition we turn the lights on purple on that Yankee Peddler boat that we have out front. That is how we acknowledge our partnership and show the world that we care about the epidemic that is a crisis. We have a great return your unused medicine program at the police station down here,\" Ledford said.\nCallaghan said that Talbot County is a leader for other states and counties that are starting their own Purple programs.\nFor more more information email talbotgoespurple@gmail.com \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When someone calls for help, she is there with viable options.Thompson works for the Sante Group, a behavioral health service that focuses on crisis services and treatment. She is based out of the Caroline County Sheriff's Department and rotates through the county's municipalities, offering a certain number of hours a week in each when individuals struggling with drug addiction can come in seeking her services.\nThompson helps them navigate available recovery options.\n\"I get to reach people and show them the other side of recovery. It is possible to get through the storm. I can help them walk through it, if they are willing to do the work. People with addictions can be functioning again and can be put back in society. They can have something to offer the community,\" she said.\nThompson said the need for these services is growing in Caroline County.\n\"Last month I had five new people, and I had six follow-ups from the previous months,\" Thompson said.\nThere are lots of possible routes to recovery based on what the individual thinks they can do. There is outpatient, intensive outpatient and support groups. Mental health services can go hand-in-hand with recovery.\n\"I do an assessment of their experience level with substances. From there I figure out what the plan is for recovery. I want to rebuild them. Usually it is inpatient- that is what the safe station is for,\" Thompson said.\nCaroline County Sheriff's Office Lt. Richard Baker said that there is a private room designated for this work.\n\"We would love to have more people to use it. They want to receive treatment. They want to receive help, and we are in partnership with the Sante Group. I use Narcan once or twice a month. We get a chance to save a life. If you feel you need help, come to this office. You are getting help and not getting arrested,\" said Baker.\nThere is still a stigma that needs to be broken around seeking help for addiction, the lieutenant said. There is a law called the good samaritan law, and it makes it safe to bring someone into a hospital or a police station who has overdosed. Under this law, neither the person experiencing the overdose nor the person who is bringing them in for help will be charged, Thompson said, but often people in the community do not know this.\n\"It saves lives. Before a lot of people were leaving their friends to die out of fear and stigma,\" she said. \"Fentanyl is laced into a lot of drugs, and it is lethal.\"\nThere is another new drug stirring concern in the county, Tompson said.\nInjectable intoxicant is xylazine, which veterinarians use to tranquilize horses, is often called \"tranq\" and causes open flesh sores.\n\"Their arms are decaying, and still they are injecting these drugs,\" Thompson said. \"Right now they have been more opioid-related. Or stimulant and opioid. We have been encountering Xylazine mixed with fentanyl, and it has been dangerous.\"\n\"... The drugs are cheaper and more easily accessed than they were five years ago. The problem is getting worse and no one is talking about it,\" she said. \"When people have money problems or are coping with the recession, the using behavior increases.\"\nThompson thinks there need to be more peers like herself to meet the needs of the county.\n\"Even if just one person is helped, that is good for me,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Everybody has skeletons in their closet.\"\nRaley's contract with St. Mary's County government was terminated on July 23.\n\"Ensuring the safety and well-being of our patients is our top priority,\" Jennifer Utz, emergency services department director, said. \"We are evaluating and updating our internal processes and will continue working closely with the state medical director, jurisdictional medical director and local health officer to address this issue and protect our community.\"\nIn mid-August, she said in an interview with Southern Maryland News that emergency services were using the non-narcotic ketamine for pain management.\n\"Right now we still have the ability to treat pain, we just don't have the option for both right now,\" Utz said. \"We will be restricted on how much [fentanyl] we can order.\"\nA total of 18 patients received fentanyl around that time and emergency services staff is trying to contact each of them, and is reimbursing them for the emergency calls.\nQuestions regarding public health concerns about the case should be directed to the Department of Emergency Services. Representatives from the department contacted any individual whose care may have been impacted by this incident. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Around 40 people started at the James Wright Memorial Park and either ran or walked the course.Catherine Bowrey is the chair of the Caroline Goes Purple Color Run.\n\"I am glad to see everyone out here having a good time. We have to get aware of the drug epidemic, which is a big thing. The stigma is terrible. So this way they can come out and get aware of what is going on in their communities,\" Bowrey said.\nCaroline Goes Purple is organized by the Denton nonprofit Drug Free Caroline, a substance abuse disorder prevention and awareness program. Caroline Goes Purple is a community effort during the month of September to prevent drug use, heighten awareness and reduce the stigma around substance abuse disorder.\nJessica Tuel is the director of behavioral health for the Caroline County Health Department as well as the local addiction authority for Caroline County. She stood in front of a public health table filled with information, stress balls and pens.\n\"We do a lot of services in the schools both for substance use and mental health. We have full time clinicians in the north county schools and we have the Mobile Treatment Unit,\" Tuel said.\nHer work is data-led.\n\"The statistics say that the earlier people start using, the longer and higher risk their use is later. Today we are bringing awareness to substance abuse in our county. We have a lot of vendors that are going to give education and services for those who need them. It is important to all these peers here, who are in a state of recovery. That is what all of the Caroline Goes Purple events are for,\" she said.\nAs a public health expert she wants both education and anti stigma to get across.\n\"Stigma is multifaceted. So it is stigma of the community against those who use. It is stigma of those that don't want treatment because they fear they will be judged. It is 'We don't have this problem in Caroline County,'\" Tuel said.\nThe remedy to stigma is education and bringing statistics to the community, she said.\nAngel Perez, the former Caroline Goes Purple Chair, was at this year's event as a volunteer.\n\"This event is important because we can raise awareness about substance abuse prevention and what is going on in our communities. We created this event last year to raise awareness in a fun way. Everybody can enjoy, but also get the information. We want to make them aware of what is going on in our community with substance abuse,\" Perez said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

These artworks are not only aesthetically pleasing but also carry messages of hope, resilience and empowerment.\n\"We believe that a positive and welcoming school environment can significantly affect students' mental and emotional well-being,\" said Kirsten Hurley, a Youth Action Council adviser. \"This project is a testament to the power of community collaboration and the importance of providing our youth with opportunities to contribute meaningfully to their surroundings.\"\n\"Having the opportunity to prepare and collaborate with the Youth Action Council group in partnership with Dorchester County Health Department and DCA was such a wonderful way to continue the artistic support of our community's ongoing beautification needs,\" artist Miriam Moran said. \"Being proactive in the mission of investing in and understanding the importance of encouraging our youth in these educational environments spaces is very critical to helping our youth unite, help and develop their confidence, their compassion, their mental wellbeing care with positive affirmations but most of all taking the time to show them by action example.\n\"I'm grateful to be one of the artists that was able to participate in the bathroom beautification collaboration not just because of the creativity purpose but because the very school that I chose to help bring this bathroom beautification project to life has played a big positive impact of my very own children's educational journey,\" she said. \"I'm truly proud to be a part of this amazing project and very proud to have collaborated with our amazing youth council members and mentors who are taking action and making a difference daily.\"\nOther participating artists were Robert Gladney and Cheryl Daringer of Wednesday Morning Artists and Griselda Jiménez.\nThe murals feature a variety of themes focused on bright and cheerful colors and images and positive affirmations for the age group. By integrating art into these everyday spaces, the Dorchester County Health Department and its partners hope to inspire students, boost their self-esteem and create a sense of belonging within the school community.\nArtwork was completed this summer in one boys and one girls bathroom in several elementary schools. The Youth Action Council hopes to tackle the middle and high schools next summer. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Students like Riaz are taking initiative to address these disparities and help close the medical disparity through the Rural Health Equity and Access Longitudinal Elective.\nThe students will be provided didactic and mentoring sessions as well as research and clinical experiences on the Eastern Shore.\nLeah Millstein, the program director and associate professor of medicine, said there's a real challenge for the population of the Eastern Shore in finding and accessing exemplary healthcare.\n\"There's a shortage in primary care doctors as well as specialties, and we often have students who are interested in rural medical care in their futures, but their exposure to it during medical school is limited,\" Millstein said. \"So this program seeks to fill those gaps, to really give the students an in depth exposure to rural health care, and give them the building blocks that allow them to feel like they'll be successful serving as physicians in those communities when they're done with their training.\"\nRiaz said her initial circumstances in Punjab made her realize the importance of one-to-one connection with patients and their medical providers.\n\"I personally faced the challenges of not discussing quality healthcare due (to a) shortage of physicians,\" Riaz said. \"Individuals of my village have to go to far off places to get necessary healthcare.\"\nThe program is designed to train and place incoming medical students in Eastern Shore healthcare practices. About $1.4 million has been secured in state funding and from the University of Maryland, Baltimore; University of Maryland Eastern Shore; the Rural Maryland Council and many donors.\nMillstein said three of the six students accepted into the program were awarded full-tuition scholarships with a commitment to working on the Eastern Shore for four years after completing residency training. The long-term goal is to support 10 students interested in rural health in this elective program each year.\nKen Kozel, president and CEO of University of Maryland Shore Regional Health, said this program will help draw new providers to the Eastern Shore.\n\"Strengthening our provider workforce is a top priority at UM SRH, and programs like R-HEALE will help us attract providers who want to practice in rural communities,\" Kozel said. \"We greatly appreciate our partnership with the School of Medicine toward enhancing access across the Shore.\"\nFor Riaz, she is happy for the opportunity to focus on improving rural areas and assisting caring for the people in rural areas.\n\"With this program, I'll be able to be involved in research projects that are deeply focused on improving population and community health, and also to deeply understand the social, economic or cultural factors that are rooted in the disparities of such communities,\" she said. \"I think this comprehensive training through our field will allow me to deliver more compassionate and patient centered care in the future.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "‘Long-held promise’: Shore Regional Health breaks ground on hospital project in Easton\n\n October 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 605\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Local officials and stakeholders joined together at the Talbot County Community Center on Monday afternoon to celebrate the groundbreaking of a long-awaited regional medical center, complete with a visit from Gov. Wes Moore (D).The University of Maryland Shore Regional Health's project is estimated to cost around $550 million. Moore said on Monday that since he was inaugurated, the state has committed $100 million toward the hospital.\nBefore breaking out the shovels, Moore spoke to hundreds of attendees on what the hospital will achieve for rural Marylanders in need of improved healthcare access.\n\"At a time when most things are leaning away from rural health, in Maryland, we're leaning in,\" Moore said. \"We're showing that you cannot have a growing and a thriving state if every part of the state is not seen and heard and recognized in that growth.\"\nMoore, Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) and other politicians emphasized the importance of bringing high quality healthcare to the Mid-Shore. The medical center is expected to attract doctors and other healthcare professionals to Easton's workforce, a point Moore hammered home Monday afternoon.\nMohan Suntha, president and CEO of the University of Maryland Medical System, thanked many partners for their commitments to the often-stalled project that has been discussed for more than a decade.\n\"We are delivering on a long-held promise,\" Suntha said. \"And the future is so bright for the Mid-Shore, for the medical system and the state of Maryland.\"\nShore Regional Health first applied for a certificate of need to relocate its Easton hospital on Sept. 7, 2012. Industry changes, fiscal concerns and shifting project plans delayed the timeline.\nThis January, the Maryland Health Care Commission finally approved the certificate of need application.\nFollowing Monday's welcome celebration, Moore told reporters he noticed the project was stalling when he began his term. He said it became a \"priority\" for his administration to remove \"the barriers and the regulatory red tape.\"\n\"It's too long that we've had people on the Eastern Shore who have been left behind,\" he said.\nThe hospital will be built on around 230 acres just north of the Easton Airport and across from the Talbot County Community Center. It is replacing the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center that is located downtown at 219 S Washington St.\nSite preparation construction is currently underway, with the bulk of construction beginning in the spring of 2025. The medical center is expected to be completed in the summer of 2028.\nThe campus will include a 325,000-square-foot, six-level main tower, complete with 122 licensed beds, seven operating rooms and a helipad. An adjacent building for offices and outpatient services will be 60,000 square feet.\nThe new hospital will serve as the primary inpatient hospital for Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties. Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) called it a \"transformative\" addition for the Eastern Shore.\n\"I plan to spend the rest of my life here. I think my children plan to spend the rest of their life here,\" Mautz said. \"And one critical factor is are we going to be able to get healthcare. I think with this new hospital, we're going to get it.\"\nMoore echoed Mautz's sentiments after Monday's celebration, adding that he is confident the medical center will attract quality doctors to the Eastern Shore and benefit residents for the foreseeable future.\n\"It's fundamentally unfair that if a person needs to see a specialist, that they somehow have to cross the bridge in order to do it,\" Moore said. \"It's not fair.\n\"And if you want to be able to recruit the top talent, you have to make sure that you have a world-class facility. And that's exactly what this investment is going to bring.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It takes courage to admit we need help.\"\nYarnall said the key is opening lines of communication.\n\"How often do you say to someone, 'Hey, how are you doing?' then [they answer] 'Pretty good,' then you move on?\" he asked. \"[A colleague told me] just ask the [expletive] question. A lot of times you might be surprised at the answer you get.\"\nA news release said the event \"is an important and meaningful moment to honor the experiences of veterans and their families by joining together, talking, listening and understanding.\"\n\"It's always going to be something that we just have to confront and make sure we're invested in,\" said Del. Brian Crosby (D-St. Mary's), who served 10 years in the U.S. Army, five of them active, and was deployed three times. \"We just need to make a little bit of a difference every day and try to get somebody to the next day.\"\nAccording to www.wefacethefight.org, more than 120,000 veterans have taken their own lives since 2001, and more than half of those did not have a known mental illness. Also, suicide is the second-leading cause of death among post 9/11 veterans, and the suicide rate for male veterans between the ages of 18-34 has nearly doubled since 2006.\nYarnall said one of the reasons for the high numbers — he added since 2001, more veterans have died by suicide than were killed in combat during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars — is accessibility to weapons.\n\"Weapons are 90% lethal ... so you don't get another chance,\" he said. \"We all talk about how we know how to operate a weapon safely. Yes, we do but when we go into crisis mode are we thinking about the safe operation of a weapon? No, you're not thinking rational in that 5- to 10-minute time period.\"\nAnother is the stigma associated with asking for help.\n\"If you are suffering from some sort of depression or mental health issue or suicidal thoughts, to come forward there's a stigma associated with that and I think people fear that, 'I might lose my clearance, I won't be able to do the job I want to do,' or other reprisals,\" U.S. Navy Capt. Matt Farr said. \"[They think] it's going to somehow negatively impact their career because a military career is everything; it's how you support your family and it's serving your country, so you don't want to put that on the line.\"\nFarr, who lives in Leonardtown, experienced a recent loss when his Leonardtown neighbor, a military veteran, took his own life earlier this month.\nThe issue also exists with first responders.\n\"I've seen tragedy just about any way, shape or form you can imagine,\" said Kim Davidson, who was an EMS in St. Mary's for 48 years and one of the county's original 10 medics who started the Advanced Life Support system. \"I've seen terrible things and I've seen how people react to them. It's not just, 'Oh, well put a Band-Aid on it.' It's a lot more than a Band-Aid and it goes a lot deeper than a Band-Aid can.\"\nDavidson said there is a fine line when offering assistance.\n\"There is that wonder of how far can I go and how far can I push myself onto somebody else before they really turn?\" he said. \"I know when it's time for me to shut up and just sit there and just be company for you, and if you want me to speak I'll speak.\"\n\"We need to make sure people understand they have a support network out there,\" Crosby said, \"and if they don't have one to help them find one because organizations like this provide them.\"\nFor more information, go to wefacethefight.org or robertirvinefoundation.org or www.militaryonesource.mil.\nTwitter: @MichaelSoMdNews \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Channel Marker adds 6 transitional living beds in Caroline County\n\n October 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 447\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Channel Marker had an open house at 2451 Willow Pond Road to show off its new six-bedroom house designed to safely accommodate people who suffer from mental illness.This is the organization's eighth such house across Dorchester, Caroline and Talbot counties. They named it Willow Pond House.\nCathy Cassell, CEO of Channel Marker, said, \"Today we are opening up our eighth residential group home. It will occupy six clients and one staff. It is a part of an expansion project that the state put into play, 40 residential rehabilitation beds across the state. We applied for six and got six.\"\nThe plan is to bring clients in around December.\n\"All the people referred to us have to have a serious and persistent mental health diagnosis. Referrals go through Mid-Shore Behavioral Health,\" Cassell said.\nShe described this as an affordable solution for some of her clients who are on fixed incomes. It offers an economical way for these people to have independent living. One of the Willow Pond's goals is to keep these clients out of higher level of care facilities like hospitals.\nThe house is very light, with oak floors, and there are a few dedicated hang-out spaces. One had big bean bags in it and a flat screen TV.\nOne innovation the house has is machines that distribute medications to the clients right in their bedrooms. This reduces mistakes and helps keep everyone in optimal health. It is like a vending machine.\nThe house has a van to help take clients get to their appointments.\n\"All their meals are communal. They live like a family. They take turns cooking dinner with staff,\" Cassell said.\nThe average stay is two to four years, and Cassell looks at this as transitional housing. Both men and women are welcome to be clients. The goal is teach clients skills to return to independent living.\nErin Hoxter is the adult services director of Channel Marker. She leads the Caroline County program. There are 12 other beds already in the county.\n\"We want them to learn how to cook and keep up with their ADLs (activities of daily living) like showering and toileting. The clients here are expected to do all of those things independently. When they do transition out they have learned these skills and can be successful in these areas,\" Hoxter said.\nOne big emphasis for Channel Marker is getting to know their neighbors and letting them know that this is safe.\n\"We try to do all the precautions we can. For example we have security systems all over this house,\" Cassell said.\nAlthough the state helped provide funding, Channel Marker is in an active capital campaign to provide for the construction and maintenance of this house. Donations can go to channelmarker.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Pumpkins — great for growing, decorating and eating\n\n October 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1271\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Surprisingly, the pumpkin is very healthy for you. They are low in fat, calories and sodium. Pumpkins are high in fiber and an excellent source of vitamin A, vitamin B, potassium, protein and iron. When we begin to whip up those delicious recipes is when the sugars and calories creep into the picture.We never grew pumpkins on our farm, but many other local farms did, so we got them from those farms. Mom went through the entire process of cutting up the pumpkin, cleaning out the seeds, chopping it into chunks to boil in the large pot.\nBut she also had cans of pumpkin in the closet to be used. She only cooked one or two pumpkins just to have some fresh pumpkin for certain recipes.\nI confess, I never cooked a pumpkin; Libby sells all the canned pumpkin I need.\nHowever, I do buy pumpkins from the local farmers to decorate outside. They make the most beautiful classic farm displays with some mums.\nToday we explore some pumpkin recipes. I include a few of my collection of recipes including my favorite pumpkin pie and a good homemade crust recipe to start.\nFOOL PROOF PIE CRUST4 cup flour, 1 3/4 cup shortening, 2 tsp salt, 1 tbsp sugar, 1 egg, 1 tbsp vinegar, 1/2 cup water.\nMix flour with shortening, salt and sugar. Set aside. Beat together egg, vinegar and water. Beat well and then begin sprinkling the dry and wet ingredients together. Turn ingredients together with a fork. Chill 15 minutes or longer in the refrigerator before working into pie crust. Remove from the refrigerator and break into portions. Work the dough on a floured surface until smooth and proceed to roll out into the appropriate size crust you need.\nPUMPKIN PIE2 cup pumpkin, 5 tbsp flour, 1/2 cup white sugar, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spices, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 3 cup milk, egg whites.\nMix pumpkin, flour, white sugar, brown sugar, salt, nutmeg, pumpkin pie spices and cinnamon. Add milk. Beat egg whites and fold into the mixture last. Pour into an unbaked pie shell and bake in a preheated 450-degree oven for the first 15 minutes, then 350 degrees until toothpick inserted comes out clean, maybe 20 to 25 minutes.\nOLD FASHIONED PUMPKIN BREAD3 1/2 cup flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp allspice, 2 2/3 cup sugar, 1 cup oil, 4 eggs, 1/3 cup water, 2 cup cooked pumpkin.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, baking soda and allspice in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, beat 2 2/3 cup sugar, 1 cup oil, 4 eggs, and 1/3 cup water. Beat in 2 cups of cooked pumpkin until smooth. Mix the dry and wet ingredients together, stirring until well blended. Pour into two greased loaf pans and bake in a 350-degree oven for 45 to 50 minutes. Cool ten minutes before serving.\nPUMPKIN LOAF CAKE4 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 4 tsp ground cloves, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 5 cup flour, 4 cup sugar, 1 cup oil, 2 eggs, 3 1/2 cup pumpkin, 2 cup chopped walnuts, 2 cup raisins, 1 cup candied fruit.\nMakes about four nice loaves that freeze well and make nice gifts. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Sift together baking soda, salt, cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir this into flour. In another bowl cream sugar, oil and eggs until smooth and add pumpkin. Add the flour mixture to the pumpkin mixture and then fold in chopped walnuts, raisins and candied fruit. Mix well, pour into four greased loaf pans and bake for 1 hour plus 10 or 15 minutes according to your oven. Insert pick or straw and it should come out clean.\nPUMPKIN SOUP1 (4-pound) pumpkin (kabocha squash is best if you can find at a local farmers market), 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil plus more for drizzling, 1 medium yellow onion (chopped), 1 tsp sea salt plus more for sprinkling, 3 garlic cloves (chopped), 1 tsp grated fresh ginger, 1 tsp ground cumin, ½ tsp ground coriander, ½ tsp turmeric, ½ tsp ground cardamom, 1 (14-ounce) can coconut milk, 2½ cups vegetable broth, 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, freshly ground black pepper.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut the pumpkin in half and scoop out the seeds. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place cut side down on the baking sheet. Roast for 40 to 60 minutes, or until very soft. When cool to the touch, peel away the skin and measure 4½ packed cups of the flesh. Heat the 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion, salt, and several grinds of pepper and sauté until soft, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and cardamom and stir for 30 seconds, or until the spices are aromatic. Add the cooked squash, coconut milk, and broth and stir to combine. Simmer for 20 minutes, then stir in the vinegar. Transfer to a blender, working in batches if necessary. Blend until smooth. Kabocha squash can vary in water content, so if your soup is too thick, add up to 1½ cups water (½ cup at a time) to reach your desired consistency. Season to taste. Pour into bowls and garnish with additional coconut milk, fresh black pepper, and microgreens, if desired.\nBROWN SUGAR PUMPKIN SEEDS2 cup raw pumpkin seeds fresh or from a bag, 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, 2 tbsp unsalted butter (melted), 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, pinch of kosher salt.\nPreheat the oven to 300 degrees. Place the pumpkin seeds in a colander and rinse away all the pulp and stringy stuff. Spread the seeds out on a rimmed baking sheet and roast until dried out, 30 to 45 minutes. Toss the pumpkin seeds with the sugar, butter, pumpkin pie spice and salt in a medium bowl until evenly coated. Return the seeds to the baking sheet, spread them out and roast until dry, about 35 minutes. Let cool, then break up into pieces before serving.\nPUMPKIN QUESO1 2-to-3-pound sugar pumpkin, 8 ounces dried chorizo (diced), 1 jalapeno pepper (chopped), 1 4-ounce can chopped green chiles, 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 3 tbsp all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth, 2 cup shredded mozzarella or Oaxaca cheese, 1 cup shredded monterey jack cheese, chopped fresh cilantro for topping.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees. Slice off the top 1 1/2 inches of the pumpkin and discard. Scoop out the seeds and stringy pulp. Heat the chorizo in a medium pot over medium-high heat until the fat begins to render, about 5 minutes. Add the jalapeno, green chiles, cumin and cayenne and cook, stirring, until the jalapeno softens, about 2 minutes. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, until the flour is slightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the cheeses. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cheese melts and the mixture is creamy, about 3 more minutes. Place the pumpkin in a small baking dish and fill the pumpkin with the cheese mixture. Add 1 inch of boiling water to the baking dish. Cover loosely with foil and bake until the pumpkin is tender, about 1 hour, 20 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until the cheese is golden and bubbly, 20 to 25 more minutes. Let cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve with tortilla chips. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "One year in, Centreville Y nears 7,000 members\n\n November 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DOUG BISHOP Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 497\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE — The Centreville YMCA opened in October 2023. A year later, according to the local Executive Director Brian Byrnes and Membership Director Laura Feller, it has grown to 6,692 members.According to Mid-Shore YMCA Director Robbie Gill, that doesn't count the 535 Active Aging Center members (who are 55 and older) or those \"people engaged in our free chronic disease programs; Rock Steady Boxing for Parkinsons, LiveStrong Cancer Survivor Program, Enhanced Fitness, and the dozens of our partnerships that are using the Y for programs.\n\"The Centreville Y is serving over 10,000 people,\" he said.\nGill, who was part of the planning for the new, much larger Centreville location more than a decade ago, added, \"It's exciting seeing the Queen Anne's County Family YMCA/Active Aging Center making a positive impact in the lives of over 10,000 community members.\"\nGill said he couldn't be more proud of the Y staff team, volunteers and the work of the Active Aging Center staff and volunteers.\nOne of the main goals of the Y is to make everyone feel like family.\nSince the beginning in Centreville, there has been a partnership between the Y and the Queen Anne's County Department of Community Services, Department of Aging, sponsoring the Active Agency Center within the Y building. The Active Aging Center is for all people 55 and over. Registration and participation is free.\nWithin the Active Aging Center, there is a wide and growing variety of free services for seniors. Monday through Friday, lunch is served, with a donation of $6.30 asked for those ages 55-59. For those 60 and over, a donation of $3 is asked.\nOne regular participant in the daily luncheons is Arden Weiss, 85, of Queen Anne. Weiss said, \"This is the healthiest food I've eaten in my entire life.\" Weiss comes to exercise each morning and enjoy the food with others each weekday.\nThe meals are catered by a contracted group. They provide the same service at the three county senior centers — Kent Island, Grasonville and Sudlersville each weekday.\nBethany Brennan is the Active Aging Center manager. She said, \"While the manager organizes some of the activities, we encourage members to start their own groups or clubs too. It doesn't have to be overwhelming — it could be as simple as a card-playing group that meets on a specific day or a history club for those who share that interest. In the coming year, members can look forward to seeing some familiar events along with a variety of new ones.\"\nEd Kaczmarczyk, 65, was elected this past year as president of the Site Council at the Active Aging Center in Centreville. Kaczmarczyk said, \"We meet monthly to discuss how the existing programs are going, and to make recommendations for changes and/or to organize different activities our seniors want to do.\" All Active Aging Center members are welcome to attend the Site Council meetings.\nThe Active Aging Center at the Y only exists at one other Y in the Mid-Shore area, located in St. Michaels in Talbot County. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Edwards, 34, of Baltimore, who was at the party.\nHowever, critics fear the broad language will allow lawmakers to apply unrelated concepts to the amendment, including gender-affirming surgeries, and widen the access minors have to abortions without parental consent.\nExisting state law requires parental notification of minors prior to an abortion, but does not require their consent. Parental notification can be subverted in cases of abuse, if the minor is believed to be mature enough to give informed consent, or if the notification would not be in their best interest.\nThe amendment follows a nationwide focus on reproductive rights after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Nine other states placed abortion-related constitutional amendments on their 2024 ballots.\nThe 2022 decision caused many voters to feel unprotected and fearful for their bodily autonomy. While state law already protected reproductive rights, voters raised concerns that laws could be repealed with changing leadership.\nThe Maryland General Assembly is able to repeal state law through legislative action, but constitutional amendments may only be passed following three-fifths passage in the General Assembly and a majority approval of state voters.\nMax Freeman, a high school senior from Bethesda, Md., has worked with the Angela Alsobrooks campaign since March and attended the Alsobrooks watch party.\n\"I do think it's important to codify [abortion rights], to enshrine it into the constitution, because it's such an important issue for so many people,\" said Freeman. \"It's really affected a lot of women these past few years … so we just want everybody to feel safe.\"\nOn the way to cast their votes, both supporters and opponents told Capital News Service that Question 1 was at the forefront of their minds.\nLorie Morey, 54, of Middletown, Md., said she voted for former President Donald Trump and other Republicans on the ballot Tuesday.\nHowever, Morey said she thinks the decision to get an abortion is up to the individual.\n\"I don't think anybody should tell a person what they can and can't do with their body,\" Morey said. \"I don't think the government should have any say. I don't think the state should have any say.\"\nKathryn Harrington, a volunteer for the Montgomery County Republican Party, said she spent several hours outside the Summit Hall Elementary School polling station in Gaithersburg, Md., educating voters on Republican candidates and their platforms.\nThis election cycle, she said, she has been particularly worried about Maryland's abortion referendum.\n\"This ballot question is a little nefarious because it would allow a child to go get abortions without any parental involvement,\" Harrington said.\nShe worries that this referendum will allow sex traffickers to take advantage of young people.\n\"I stop and think about a 16-year-old who could be a victim of sex trafficking, get pregnant, get an abortion, get pregnant, get an abortion,\" Harrington said. \"This amendment is pretty clear. [There is] no age, no limitation … I'm a mom with three kids and that scares me.\"\nThe Associated Press called the race not long after polls closed on Tuesday night. Other states showed a mix of results, with the Florida amendment to legalize abortion failing while the New York and Colorado amendments to enshrine abortion rights into their constitutions succeeded.\nSofia Appolonio, Katharine Wilson and Mennatalla Ibrahim contributed to this story. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Blake Blackston Post 77 brings vets together\n\n November 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: News \n \n 674\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Around a table in the Blake Blackston American Legion Post 77, five veterans of various histories talked about what brings them all together.The scars of war are sometimes obvious and sometimes hard to see, they said.\n\"We have been through situations where we have lost friends and lost part of ourselves. If you don't talk about your experience, you will never know someone else's. You never know what you have to say is going to help him out,\" said retired Chief Master Sergeant from the United States Air Force Victor Middleton. He served for 30 years in two combat wars.\nProviding support to fellow veterans is about \"family more than just camaraderie,\" Middleton said. It's been part of the VFW post's mission since its inception.\n\"The history of Blake Blackston Post 77 is named after two missing in action veterans that never came back. There names were Nelson Black from Unionville and John Blackston from Trappe. The original post was on The Hill. For 40 or 50 years this place has been packed,\" Staff Sergeant William E. Griffin said. Griffin is the commander of the post.\nSince, post members said, the VFW has served as a place where not only history is honored, but so are the struggles and issues that affect veterans today.\nGriffin said, \"We can't forget about the thousands and thousands of veterans here who are homeless. They didn't get the help that I got, or maybe they just don't know where to go.\n\"The American Legion is here to help these veterans out — those that suffer from PTSD, those that don't know how to retrieve their benefits. This is our job to support them. There are too many homeless veterans and their families who don't have it as good as we do here.\"\nArmy Staff Sergeant Noreen Wilson did eight years of active duty in the Army. She is the adjutant at Post 77, and remembers how veterans were treated when she was younger.\n\"I remember Vietnam Veterans being pushed to the side, and that bothers me,\" she said. \"People ignored them and didn't do much for them when they came home. If it wasn't for the American Legion, they wouldn't be taken care of as much as they are now.\"\nThrough tears, Middleton recounted losing friends, being wiped out by loss and having the resolve to keep going.\n\"Friends in Vietnam and Thailand. There are lot of things that happened in Thailand that had to do with the Vietnam War. When I do funeral services for our Legionaires, I can't help but cry. I have been the historian, chaplain, commander- first and vice. Of all of them, I have enjoyed the chaplain the most. My feeling is when we go, we deserve to go with dignity,\" Middleton said.\nThey are in this together.\nBut not all the bonding the happens at the VFW is over shared hardship, the five veterans said. Most look back fondly on their time of service.\n\"We got a chance to see the world and see people all over the world. I bet I know someone in every state. The military changed my life, made me a better person,\" said Michael Waller, who served three years in the Army and is the finance officer at Post 77.\nKirk Henson, who is on the board of American Legion Post 77, said being in the military put him ahead of his high school class who were looking for jobs.\n\"By the time I got out, I had seen a whole lot more that the people I would have graduated with. I had my high school diploma and boom, boom, boom, I got to see the world — Germany, Greece, and Fort Raleigh, Kansas,\" Henson said.\nWilson said, \"It is a whole different thing versus being in the regular civilian world. You just have this camaraderie. You look out for each other.\"\nThis camaraderie is what drives and bonds members of Post 77 to serve the military community and the Easton community as a whole.\nFor those looking to get involved, the veterans said, there is always a seat at the table. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mid-Shore groups raise awareness for mental health needs of veterans\n\n November 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 686\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Douglas Willey and Chuck Engh come from different military backgrounds, but they hold similar advice for how society should look at veterans struggling with mental health: \"Don't judge.\"Willey, a 22-year Marine Corps veteran and past commander of American Legion Post 70 in Easton, says the Legion's national branch is working to provide veterans with the care they need — whether they're suffering from PTSD, depression, battle fatigue or other struggles that stem from their time serving the country.\nAlong with the American Legion's growing initiatives, Willey and Engh believe younger generations of veterans and military members are more adept at accessing the help they need.\n\"Society's put a different face on it,\" Willey said. \"It's not a stigma anymore. It's just who you are, and it's part of you.\"\nEngh, Post 70's current commander who spent six years in the Navy as an aviation ordnanceman, said the American Legion encourages veterans in need to call the national 988 crisis line, attend Post 70 meetings with professional counselors or connect with fellow veterans.\n\"Go to somebody one-on-one who's been through it themselves, and they get in a conversation with one another,\" Engh said. \"They walk away, and they're like, 'I feel better. I got to talk to somebody that knows what I'm going through.'\"\nNationwide and in Maryland, veterans experience alarming rates of suicide. Lisa Short, adult population supervisor for Mid-Shore Behavioral Health, says around 17.5 veterans die by suicide each day and more than 71,000 died by suicide from 2011 to 2021.\nShort agrees that the stigma around mental health has lessened over time, but emphasizes the work to provide support is nowhere near complete, especially to the Eastern Shore's large veteran population.\n\"We do still see a barrier … in military and emergency response personnel,\" Short said. \"There's a stigma for them regarding their position. They're in roles that are seen to be the protector, the tough one.\"\nJ Howard, the organization's behavioral health coordinator for DEI and specialty programs, noted many behaviors that may be exhibited by veterans in need of help: nightmares, flashbacks, survivor's guilt, substance use, mood shifts and \"diminishing interest\" in activities previously enjoyed.\n\"Veterans are not as likely to share their trauma experiences,\" Howard said. \"Though they may not speak about it, it does not mean there are not persistent symptoms. … It's important to validate and be consistent when support is being given to the veteran population.\"\nWilley echoed the same, encouraging spouses, family members and friends to listen instead of judge. The need for outreach and someone to talk to only increases this time of year, he says.\n\"The national department and Post (70) are very proactive on buddy checks,\" Willey said, \"calling a veteran, especially during the holidays.\"\nSince July, Short noted that crisis response groups have seen upticks in calls from veterans. The Santé Group reported serving 10 veterans in this fiscal year's first quarter, compared to 25 the entire fiscal year 2024, Short said. The Eastern Shore Operation Center had 54 Mid-Shore veterans call the 988 hotline in fiscal year 2024, with 35 calling the hotline in just the first quarter of fiscal year 2025.\nShort and Howard highlighted the importance of hope for veterans and that resources are readily available, whether it's calling a crisis line or reaching local organizations like the Cambridge VA or Veteran & Military Support Alliance. Short recommended something as simple as putting the 988 crisis line on the refrigerator.\n\"We don't want them to give up,\" Howard said.\nIn October, Post 70, American Legion Post 77 and Mid-Shore Behavioral Health spoke to the Talbot County Council regarding Operation Green Light, an initiative to raise awareness about resources for veterans and their families.\nThe council passed an Operation Green Light proclamation unanimously, which encourages residents and businesses to display green lights in honor and recognition of veterans from Nov. 4 to Nov. 11.\nWilley hopes Post 70 and other organizations can continue to enhance that awareness around the importance of mental health for all veterans.\n\"The main thing is not to judge each other,\" Willey said. \"I'm not going to judge you, you're not going to judge me, if we want to get any progress.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Here's a good question: How's your mental health?\n\n November 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: CHRIS HOUSTON | Section: Columns \n \n 591\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Nobody would hesitate to explain that they missed hockey practice due to a broken leg. In some circles, scars are badges of honor. When I was a kid, students would gleefully sign their names in Sharpies on their friend's orthopedic cast.If you see a friend with a physical injury, you'll probably ask them about it, and likely they will tell you. \"How are you?\" is a ubiquitous greeting, and mostly people glibly give happy one-word answers like \"fine\" or \"great.\" I like to surprise friends who ask by giving them sincere answers. My better half cringes when I give brief but honest answers to strangers who enquire.\nI keep doing it though, because I think it's important to discuss how we are really doing. My sincere answers to \"how are you?\" sometimes catch people off guard. A question that I sometimes ask, however, has proven to be a real eye-opener. \"How's your mental health?\" never gets a glib answer. People don't expect that one. But often the question provokes really meaningful conversations.\nStill, I don't commonly ask people about their mental health. To some, it remains a deeply private topic. But maybe it shouldn't be. I wonder how things might be different if we were just as quick to comment on our anxiety or depression as we were our headaches. Normalizing these chats erodes the stigma.\nStigma inhibits conversation about mental health and I think we might have more comprehensive healthcare if we were all more comfortable talking about it.\nI've spoken in public and written about my mental health. I find that after I do so, people share their stories. Such stories are widespread. Years ago, I never thought much about mental health. During my recent short stint of local newspaper reporting, housing, poverty, substance use, and mental health were the most commonly discussed topics. They sometimes don't, but often do, overlap.\nI used to think that when people spoke about problems, they were looking for solutions. I'm older and wiser now and I know that sometimes people just need to talk. Talking about mental health is therapeutic for folks. And yet, starting conversations about mental health can be difficult. We're not used to it. Many avoid even learning about it.\nI like the BeThere.org website, which offers free lessons on how to support someone struggling with their mental health. The website offers golden rules on how to kick-start conversations: say what you see, show you care, and hear them out, know your role, and connect to help.\nIf you have a mental health issue, you are likely much less alone than you think. Regarding PTSD, a 2019 paper published in the Red Cross's academic journal notes that an \"estimated 50 percent of men and 60 percent of women experience at least one trauma during their lifetime. Around 8 percent of these men and 20 percent of these women develop PTSD. In a given year, 8 percent of the general population has a current diagnosis of PTSD.\" The paper extrapolates that around 26 million people in the United States live with PTSD. The fact that women experience trauma at a rate double digits higher than men, should not go unnoticed.\nAccording to data published by the National Institute of Mental Health 23.1 percent of U.S. adults lived with a mental illness in 2022. So, likely, you know people living with mental disorders. The sooner we all talk about it, the better it is. Practice it: \"How is your mental health?\" October 10 was World Mental Health Day.\nMental Health America operates a text/phone crisis line accessible via 988. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

These veterans need better access to behavioral health services to prevent suicide, Johnson said.\nJohnson said that more than financial support, he wants to restore the dignity for these men and women who have served but are not getting the help they need.\nAlso at the table were lobbyist Bruce Bereano the deputy director of Veteran and Military Support Alliance Lee Ellington.\nVAMSA is located in Queen Anne's County but wants to expand its efforts into Caroline County and across the Eastern Shore.\nJohnson said fighting with the bureaucracy to get disability services is really tough when a veteran is already sick. VAMSA, which was founded three years ago, is trying to make the system easier to navigate.\nHe also mentioned that a mentally challenged veteran creates a stress on their family, and he wants these collateral family members to get some help as well.\n\"If someone comes back from three tours in Afghanistan and has major PTSD issues, maybe some rage issues, and that is affecting their family, somebody has to take care of that family,\" Johnson said.\nHe is a veteran from the War in Afghanistan and has lost two siblings who served in the Air Force to suicide. Johnson says VAMSA has helped 20 different individuals avoid suicide 23 times.\n\"The number one thing that veterans can do is get involved with service to others. If we can get them to that point, those are the folks that seem to have the most resiliency and prevention of suicidal ideation in that population,\" Johnson said.\nJohnson said veterans on the western shore get better care than veterans on the Eastern Shore. He wants to change that.\nOne of the ideas that VAMSA has put across is providing computer access to their program on monitors in the Denton American Legion. Virtual accessibility could help with transportation issues, and several VAMSA services can be offered via Zoom.\nTravis Breeding, president of the Caroline County Commissioners, said, \"We have now lost more Iraq and Afghanistan veterans to suicide than we've lost in combat.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Also you don't know where people stand, so it is also just being respectful. Conversations about it don't need to be top of the list at the Thanksgiving table,\" said Kathryn Dilley, LCSW-C, the CEO of Mid-Shore Behavioral Health.\nAnother local behavioral health expert is Beth Anne Dorman, president and CEO of For All Seasons.\nWith Thanksgiving coming up with all kinds of political viewpoints, she offered a way to stay cool.\n\"Choose your election dialogue partners carefully — don't engage with friends and family who upset you,\" Dorman said.\n\"We may feel we are on opposite sides of the election issues with our family members, colleagues and neighbors. This creates stress and can compromise our mental health. The presidential election, in particular, affects so many aspects of our lives that it's no wonder we are all stressed about the outcome,\" she said.\nChange is tough, and there are big political transitions happening. Stress can affect personal relationships, weight changes and sleep patterns. Getting enough rest, eating healthy and investing in healthy relationships can all help.\nDilley oversees a five-county network of behavioral health support.\n\"988 the crisis and suicide prevention hotline — that nationally there have been last week an uptick overall. Calls coming in to that number are from a national perspective. Locally at our Eastern Shore Operations Center, we haven't seen a huge variance yet,\" Dilley said.\nShe emphasized having hopeful conversations and minimizing oversaturation of news feeds.\nDorman had a list of tips to help alleviate election stress.\n\"Watch your media diet and find the least stressful ways to stay informed without getting upset, ie: maybe switch to reading news and not watching TV,\" Dorman said.\nDorman also said to turn election stress into action — people should consider volunteering for a campaign or even running for office. The other mood enhancers she recommended were eating healthy, exercising, getting a good night's sleep and being out in nature. Those whose daily routines are being affected by this stress can seek an appointment at For All Seasons, which has a same-day mental health access policy.\nMichelle Boulden-Hammond, Ph.D., is an author and holistic practitioner and has concrete techniques to reduce stress.\n\"I am seeing a lot of increased anxiety and a lot of depressive states. Worrying about what is going to happen? How am I going to survive with the new administration?\" she said.\n\"I tell them to do journaling as an exercise. I give them some guided meditation. I always tell them to express their feelings. Don't hold it in. The holistic approach will reduce the symptoms. Connect with your higher power, it will never turn us wrong,\" she said.\nDilley said if stress is becoming unmanagable, there are places to get help.\n\"That is the message above all. If this situation post election has put anyone in a position where they don't feel they can manage how they are responding to it, I would strongly encourage them to seek help,\" Dilley said. \"There is the Eastern Shore Operations Center, which is our regional hotline to connect. It is 24/7 and can connect you to quick access to get into urgent care appointments in the region. That number is 888-407-8018.\"\nThis report has been updated from an earlier version to correct the spelling of a name. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Holidays pose risk for rape, abuse survivors, local experts say\n\n November 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 720\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The holiday season is here, and though it often brings family cheer and joyful events, it also comes with additional stressors for survivors of rape and domestic violence.It is during the holidays that experts in the field see an array of survivors seeking help throughout the Eastern Shore.\nThe stress is elevated by a variety of factors including family proximity, financial concerns and a lack of free time for survivors to prioritize their mental health and seek services.\nJeanne Yeager, executive director of Mid-Shore Council on Family Violence, said the holidays require that families are together more. Due to a variety of factors including kid's holiday vacation from school and partners' vacation from work, which often \"lends itself to more abusive behaviors.\"\n\"Domestic violence goes up because of the proximity of the abuser and victim in the home due to being off work during the holidays, but the victims are waiting until after the holidays to seek services, and that's what our data shows, and has shown for many years,\" Yeager said.\nAccording to Yeager, calls to the Mid-Shore Hotline show a dip in services during the holiday season and picks up immediately following the holidays. Yeager said it's important to understand that victims often stay longer in abusive relationships due to factors prioritized over their own well-being, mainly children and financial stability.\nYeager said leaving an abusive relationship is difficult and dangerous, which is why Mid-Shore provides crisis housing, legal assistance including help with protective orders, divorce and child custody, financial support and assistance in finding employment, child care and other long-term self-sufficiency resources.\nBut sometimes the most difficult factors have to do with putting others' feelings over their own.\n\"Christmas is a lot about the kids, and (survivors) don't want to disrupt the Christmas routine for the kids,\" Yeager said. \"I think from a victim perspective, that's where they're coming from, not thinking of self. I think they're thinking of their kids and saying, 'Every year we do this, and I'm just going to put up with it so the kids can get through the holidays and then I'll leave.'\"\nAlthough the holidays are a time of potential harm for survivors of domestic abuse, they also bring risk of new harm to vulnerable communities regardless of age.\nHoliday gatherings with family, friends, and coworkers can elevate the risk of harassment or sexual assault. According to a study by the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, 93% of children who suffer sexual abuse are familiar with their perpetrator and 34% are abused by a family member.\nKirsty Mirando, director of the Rape Crisis Center at For All Seasons, said not only can abuse survivors be triggered by past trauma but the likelihood of new abuse increases.\n\"During the holiday season, incidents of sexual assault and child sexual abuse may occur more frequently,\" Mirando said. \"The increased time spent with immediate and extended family, heightened emotions and potential alcohol consumption can create vulnerable situations for those at risk of abuse.\"\nLesa Mulcahy, chief clinical officer for For All Seasons, said she encourages survivors of abuse and parents to create a plan for the holidays that includes identifying potential triggers or stressful situations and having coping mechanisms ready, such as taking breaks, setting boundaries or having a \"mental health first aid kit\" with comforting items.\nAdditionally, Mulcahy said it's important to collaborate with supportive family members and friends to work together to make the holidays more manageable and create a positive experience for everyone.\nKatie Theeke, vice president of marketing and communication at For All Seasons, said that while abuse is not a topic that is easy to talk about, it's something that everyone can work on preventing. If people identify as part of a support network for survivors it is important for them to step up and provide care for the people in need.\n\"I think the most important thing we can do as we approach the holidays and regard to survivors of sexual assault and abuse is just to be supportive, to be a good listener, and to always approach every conversation without judgment,\" Theeke said. \"And we don't always have to have the perfect words to help them through what they're going through if they share something with us, but that we just have to make sure they know that we believe them and that we're there to support them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "That which brings us together at the library",
    "date": "2024-11-30",
    "author": "BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library",
    "content": "That which brings us together at the library\n\n November 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Life \n \n 889\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Back in September, I attended a lecture at the library given by Meg Daley Olmert, entitled \"Sit, Stay, Heal.\" Olmert is a writer who has worked on documentaries for Smithsonian World, National Geographic Explorer, and PBS, among others. In 1992 she was asked to join a research team studying the neurobiology of social bonding.Listening to Olmert speak, it became obvious that her work on that study changed her view of history; and I began to think it might change mine as well. So I picked up a copy of Olmert's book on the subject, \"Made for Each Other,\" rushed home and devoured it.\nI have referred to Jared Diamond's \"Guns, Germs, and Steel\" before in this column. That book's thesis, that geography rather than racial superiority gave Western Civilization a leg-up on the rest of the world, is now the lens through which I view and understand the past.\nBut if Diamond's book posits geography as history's fulcrum, Olmert's work places an even less obvious entity at that pivot point: a simple molecule, oxytocin.\nOxytocin is often referred to as the \"love hormone.\" All mammals produce it, and in all mammals it produces the same effects.\nWhen it's time to give birth, oxytocin brings on labor. When it's time to suckle our young, oxytocin brings on lactation. When animals groom one another — whether it's a ewe licking her lamb or a man helping his wife with a zipper — oxytocin is released and all concerned feel a rush of goodwill.\nOxytocin boosts trust, empathy, fidelity and nonverbal communication; it encourages and solidifies social bonding.\nAll of this is well known, but what Olmert's book makes clear is that these benefits are interspecific, that is: the effects are the same whether a woman is straightening her husband's tie or removing a thorn from her cat's paw. In both cases, their health improves and their bond is strengthened.\nFor years it has been received wisdom among archaeologists that humans created their first permanent settlements around 10,000 years ago, with the advent of agriculture. But recent discoveries have pushed that date back to a point 15,000 years before people began cultivating crops. Why then?\nWell, it turns out that the earlier date dovetails nicely with humanity's first successful domestication of a wild animal; the wolf became a dog, oxytocin was released, and the bond between man and man's best friend was created. People could now go to sleep in the same place night after night secure in the knowledge that their dogs would alert them if a saber-toothed cat or an enemy band approached their settlement.\nIf permanent settlement is the necessary first-step toward civilization, then we can thank Fido for Chartres Cathedral and the great pyramids. But before those piles could be erected, oxytocin still had more tasks to perform.\nWhen Homo sapiens first entered Europe, among the megafauna they encountered was a monster that stood six feet tall at the shoulder and sported eight-foot horns: the aurochs. When Caesar saw his first aurochs in Germany, he declared them too vicious to ever be tamed. The general would have been surprised to learn that the cattle marching placidly along in his army's wake were, in fact, descendants of the first domesticated aurochs.\nBut let's think for a moment about how that animal's vastly significant domestication first took place.\nImagine the courage it took for some Neolithic man or woman to approach a wild aurochs, corral it and slip a rope over its neck. Olmert makes the case that this person, whoever they were, was the test pilot of their day, that their one small step toward an aurochs represented a greater leap in world history than Neil Armstrong's. And it was successful, almost certainly, thanks to the oxytocin released in both man and beast.\nIf oxytocin helped create the bonds between people and animals that made civilization possible (think horses, camels, sheep, dogs, cattle, pigs, etc.), then Olmert's book closes with a cautionary note about what a deficit of oxytocin might mean for our modern world.\nSince the Industrial Revolution, people have been moving in ever greater numbers away from the animals that fueled civilization's development. Today, so few Americans still live on the land that the Census Bureau no longer lists farming as a career category to be checked off.\nAs we moved away from our farms and our farm animals, two particularly devastating mental disconnects blossomed among our children: autism and ADHD. Both conditions are characterized by low levels of oxytocin in the bloodstream. The severity of both has been found to be reduced by giving affected children the opportunity to care for a non-human animal.\nIn a study performed in 1995, oxytocin was found to protect adults against the modern world's leading cause of death. Among 369 victims of heart attack, dog ownership was found to be a better predictor of survival than regularity of heartbeat, absence of diabetes, or strength of the patient's heart. One year after their coronary, 20 of the 369 patients studied had died — only one of the 20 owned a dog.\nWhether or not you think the world would be a better place if we all spent more time stroking Fido or milking Clarabelle, Meg Daley Olmert's \"Made for Each Other\" will convince you there's more to both than meets the eye. You can find \"Made for Each Other\" at that hallmark of civilization: our local library. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Wellness takes a creative twist with music and art at the core\n\n December 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: NIAMBI DAVIS Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 751\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Twelve days after his 1984 graduation from Queen Anne's County High School, Darrin Pruitt joined the Navy.\"I still had my Ocean City sunburn,\" he recalled. After serving for six years, Pruitt lived in Washington State, working on quality control for nuclear fuel production.\nWhen his mother developed melanoma, along with other life changes, \"it seemed like a good time to come home.\"\nPruitt, a self-described serial entrepreneur, works for the Department of Labor Workforce Development Veterans Services during the day. His brainchild and \"sometimes beautiful disaster\" is Chesapeake Creative Wellness, a nonprofit organization operating under Chesapeake Charities.\nThe inspiration for Chesapeake Creative Wellness came from two very different directions. As a Navy vet who works with veterans, Pruitt sees PTSD and anxiety every day. Seven years ago, as a marketer for an Australian custom guitar company, he met Alice Cooper's Solid Rock Center members in Arizona. This group uses music and art to help at-risk teens. \"When I told them I wanted to bring that model back here to the East Coast they kind of patted me on the head with a patronizing 'yeah, keep us in the loop.'\"\nHe did. In 2023, Pruitt advised them of Chesapeake Creative Wellness' projected launch date for the second quarter of 2024. In August the organization held its first music session. In September they acquired a studio on Creamery Lane in Easton. \"I told our landlord I didn't want the walls or floors redone. I want people to paint on them. We're painting murals inside the studio. It has worked out well for us.\" Kristi Egnar, an Easton artist, is the Creative Wellness art director. Mike Elzey of Mike Elzey Studios and musician Quinn Parsley provide musical direction.\nPruitt describes the Chesapeake Wellness model as peer counseling with no set structure. Some participate regularly; others attend infrequently, while others come only to hang out and talk. \"And I didn't know it at first, but that approach turned out to be the best part; it's what we do really well. We want people to know that even if they don't want to ask for help they're not alone; there are people here who can help. It's a niche that needs filling in our community. We found the right time and the right way to fill it.\"\nRelationships with Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legions, and Patriot Point in Dorchester County support the work of Chesapeake Creative Wellness. The Queen Anne's County Centre for the Arts is a friend of the organization. \"At a veterans' job fair at Maryland Live Casino, I met the General Manager who is also a Marine,\" Pruitt recalled. \"I came asking for assistance but also looking for a way that we could help. The GM told me I was the first person who ever asked for assistance and followed up with an offer to help.\"\nToday Chesapeake Creative Wellness stocks the Maryland Live employees' break room with colored pens, pencils, and adult-level coloring books. In January the organization will host a monthly music program and comedy show at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. \"We're looking for other ways such as outreach to nursing homes and rehab centers with long-term patients,\" Pruitt announced.\nLocally, Chesapeake Creative Wellness hosts paint parties at local restaurants in Easton, Cambridge, and Centreville. Dates and times can be found on their Facebook page. Plans are in the works for a blog written by professional artists and musicians, including posts from contributors who have experienced similar challenges.\nIdeas fuel the engine of Chesapeake Creative Wellness. \"It's the busy people who get things done and our minds are always working,\" Pruitt says. \"If an idea pops up, we hold on to it. As soon as we're done with one, we start working on another.\" Their idea for Christmas 2024 is a 16-foot Christmas tree to stand outside the VFW in Easton. Chesapeake Creative Wellness will sell ornaments for purchase and decoration, similar to the concept of the Crab Basket Trees at Fisherman's in Grasonville. Each ornament is two-feet in diameter and sells for $50. Proceeds from the sale will be used to purchase supplies for the organization's operation.\nChesapeake Creative Wellness welcomes volunteers — from those with artistic talent to anyone with time to sit in the office and keep the doors open for the day. Above all, Pruitt extends this invitation to anyone in any walk of life, \"If you're having difficulty with PTSD or anxiety issues, we're here for you.\"\nVisit Chesapeake Creative Wellness at 31A Creamery Lane in Easton or call 410-340-6257. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She brings them back to life,\" Lewis said. \"They start singing, they start dancing, they remember all the words to each one of the songs. It's wonderful to see how she can interact. It's almost like a different way of communicating.\"\nAccording to Northwestern University, musical intervention has therapeutic benefits for people with dementia or Alzheimer's disease and has been proven to decrease a patient's agitation and improve communication.\nMegan Pinder, director of sales and marketing for HeartFields Assisting Living, said HeartFields had begun partnering with the Chesapeake Center about two years ago. The volunteer-led programs began with a bird club where volunteers come to the Heartfields and fill up the 41 bird feeders every week for the residents to enjoy.\nThen TiShawna, an active volunteer at the Chesapeake Center, began to come and play music for residents at HeartFields.\nAccording to Pinder, the first holiday concert was a resounding success, and TiShawna Jordan was presented with roses by the HeartFields Resident Ambassador because her playing had moved many attendees to tears.\nElsie Jordan, mother of TiShawna Jordan, said her daughter was always musically inclined. As a child she would play the keyboard, and Elsie Jordan said she would help her daughter learn new music through humming songs.\nDuring the concert, Elsie Jordan sat next to her daughter humming and singing along to classic Christmas songs such as \"White Christmas\" and \"Jingle Bell Rock.\" At some points they would both sing, encouraging the crowd of attendees to raise their voices and fully enjoy the memory of the holidays.\n\"God gave her that gift, and I want her to share her gift with other people,\" Elsie Jordan said. \"Because if it wasn't for God, she wouldn't have the gift she has. I feel like it's a gift and you shouldn't have to be paid for something you love doing. And she loves playing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

How about one with multiple benefits for our health, our planet and the animals? Eating more veggies, fruits, legumes, grains and nuts helps us stay healthier, reduce global warming and stop animal suffering. It requires no exertion or deprivation. And it saves money too.The abundant nutrients and vitamins in plant foods keep us in top health, while their fiber keeps us regular. Plant foods don't do drugs, antibiotics, hormones, cholesterol or saturated fats. Concerned about ultra-processed foods? Then you certainly don't want your food processed through an animal's digestive tract.\nBest of all, plant-based eating is supported by your local supermarket, which offers a rich variety of plant meats, cheeses and ice creams in their frozen food section, as well as a wide selection of nut and grain milks. Same goes for your favorite family restaurant and nearly every fast-food franchise.\nThere is more food for thought at:\nnytimes.com/2023/11/15/well/eat/plant-based-diet-nuts-beans-grains.html.forksoverknives.com.bitesizevegan.org\nBon appetit.\nDALEB STOKER\nCambridge \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mental Health experts offer tips for managing New Year's resolutions\n\n January 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 585\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The new year is here, and what comes with it, for many people, is a fresh start.New Year's resolutions are infamously tied to failure of goals, but mental health experts share that if people are seeking positive change in their lives, understanding mental health will allow people to not only accomplish their goals but to be kinder to themselves if they are unable to achieve their goals within an expected time frame.\nKatie Theeke, vice president of marketing and communications at For All Seasons, said the connection between mental health and New Year's resolutions are heavily tied together.\n\"Mental health is foundational to how we think, feel and act,\" Theeke said. \"When we care for our mental health we feel better, and people will often see their quality of life and relationships improve. Without awareness and care for our mental health, it's very difficult to have the motivation and commitment to fulfill our hopes and goals for the new year.\"\nAccording to Centerstone, a national nonprofit specializing in mental health and substance use disorder, there is an unspoken rule that resolutions should be all or nothing extremities. This mindset it often leads to difficult-to-accomplish resolutions and then ideas of self-sabotage and punishment if resolutions are not accomplished, Centerstone said.\nTheeke said it is great to think of goals, but what is more important is the little steps and systems that are put into place to steer people in the direction they want to go. Instead of focusing on a big goal like losing a significant amount of weight, she encourages people to try to set up a simple system to start getting healthy, such as walking with a friend each week.\nTheeke said it's the small attainable steps that start to build up. If one system doesn't work it's important to evaluate and change the system to something that works better for the individual.\nFor those who want to make resolutions around mental health, Theeke suggests considering activities that bring positive emotions, whether it be music, walking, exercising, feeding and watching birds, or spending time with friends and family. Prioritizing simple acts of joy, even if it requires carving time out to do so, can have big gains in mental health growth, she said.\nFor those who find themselves continuing to feel low for more than two weeks at a time, Theeke suggests considering reaching out to a mental health professional. Individuals need to take the time to invest in themselves and investing in mental health can have lasting gains.\nBut most importantly, Theeke encourages everyone to be kind to themselves regardless of success on their resolutions. If people are able to approach themselves with more kindness and understanding, it can help build the confidence needed to accomplish whatever goals that are made. But most importantly, kindness for self can make moving forward with everyday life easier and improve personal relationships.\n\"One of the nicest things you can do for yourself in the new year is change your internal dialogue,\" Theeke said. \"So many of us are criticizing ourselves throughout the day. Catch yourself if you are thinking something negative and try out some simple phrases like, 'I am focusing on progress, not perfection.' Or, 'I am getting a little stronger and healthier every day.' There are so many positive affirmations out there. Find a few that feel right for you and try them. Reach out to a trusted friend or a mental health professional if you continue to struggle. There are good people out there who are ready to help.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Since we are in the heart of the Flu Season this is somewhat expected. In fact, we are outpacing other regions and the state as a whole on this metric.\"\nViruses like this one are known to spread in settings such as households, health care settings, schools and child care centers, and during food preparation if hands have not been thoroughly washed with soap and water.\nSymptoms can be nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, low fever, headache, muscle aches, chills and tiredness, usually lasting 24 to 48 hours and go away without treatment.\nWebb highlighted the significant uptick in flu season but also noted a rise in gastrointestinal illnesses linked to the Norovirus in the area.\nThe Norovirus, commonly spread through fecal matter or vomit contact, contaminated food, or water, can cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fever.\nThe rates for Norovirus in Region IV have spiked, reaching a high of 160 per 100,000 residents, according to Maryland Department of Health data sourced from diverse surveillance methods including emergency visits, thermometer sales and the ESSENCE system. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That is, the reluctance of parents to have their children receive approved vaccines according to the recommended dose and schedule.When we were both young and in our training, diseases such as measles, mumps and chicken pox were common. Cases of smallpox were not unheard of, and some survivors of this disease were left with severe facial scarring. Polio epidemics, particularly in the 1950s, closed swimming pools in the summer and both of us had schoolmates who were affected. Fear of catching polio and being confined to an iron lung caused nightmares. For this disease, the picture rapidly changed with the advent of the Salk, and then Sabin, polio vaccines. Due to those vaccines, the scourge of polio has essentially disappeared from the United States.\nIn 1963 in the United States prior to the introduction of the measles vaccine, according to the CDC, 400 people died annually, 48,000 were hospitalized and 1,000 developed brain swelling from measles. Now for vaccinated children, the number is essentially zero.\nVaccines to protect against common childhood diseases have been one of the greatest advances in medical science, at least as important as the discovery of antibiotics. At the current time, vaccines protecting against over ten serious diseases including diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio, hepatitis A and B, pneumococcal pneumonia, rotavirus, chickenpox and influenza are available. There are also vaccines for COVID, respiratory syncytial virus, meningitis and human papilloma virus.\nUnfortunately, the dramatic decrease in incidence of those serious diseases secondary to the introduction of vaccines has been threatened by vaccine hesitancy. This hesitancy has been fueled in large part by dissemination of misinformation on social media.\nThe vaccines your medical care giver recommends for your child have been exhaustively tested for their efficacy, safety and scheduling. We beg for you to talk with your caregiver if you have questions about vaccines and not to rely on possible misinformation found on social media. Your caregivers have years of scientific education and experience behind them, so please trust that they are recommending appropriate vaccines with the appropriate schedules. Your child's life may depend on it.\nDR. BRIAN J. CORDON DR. JUDI GIESKI\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Morris said he has gone to tent camps around the Eastern Shore to share information about the point-in-time so those living there can have their voices heard.\n\"We have people in hotels that cost grant money, there's people that are living in their cars, living in the woods, and God, it's cold out,\" Morris said. \"We don't have the funds anymore. The only way to get the funding is to let them know what the situation is down here.\"\nFor more information, Morris encourages people to call him at 443-786-0699. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Advocates say budget cuts would harm Marylanders with disabilities\n\n January 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: EMMA TUFO Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 444\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Advocates for disabled people in Maryland are concerned about proposed cuts to their state programs, warning that the reductions could hit quality of care for some of the state's most vulnerable residents.During a hearing Thursday, advocates described the far-reaching consequences these cuts could have on the state's Developmental Disabilities Administration.\nMat Rice, executive director of People on the Go Maryland, urged state lawmakers to \"not turn back the clock on a marginalized community.\"\n\"Are we saying to my staff person that is here with two kids, that he might have to take a potential pay cut?\" Rice said. \"There is a human cost here.\"\nBut Helene Grady, secretary of the Department of Budget and Management, said the \"cost containment\" measures were intentionally designed to minimize disruption to essential services.\n\"There are many potential options within the DDA program that are not on the table, and very intentionally not on the table, because of the impact they would have to the services the state is providing,\" she said. \"The package that is on the table for cost containment was structured in a very targeted fashion to impact the areas and the flexibilities within the program.\"\nGov. Wes Moore has proposed $2 billion in cuts in his fiscal 2026 budget, as part of an overall attempt to address the state's looming $3 billion deficit. The DDA's spending has grown in recent years, agency officials said.\nMoore's proposed reductions to the current fiscal year budget would adjust wages for an overall savings to the state. One of those changes would eliminate geographic differential rates, which currently pay providers more if they work in areas with a higher cost of living.\nAnde Kolp, executive director of The Arc Maryland, argued the potential harm of these reductions. It would be hard for providers in high-cost areas like Montgomery and Prince George's Counties to survive the cuts, advocates say.\n\"The geographic differential is foundational to our rates,\" Kolp said. \"It amounts to kind of kicking the legs out from under these providers at this time.\"\n\"I'm not sure that they will survive,\" she said.\nAnother cut would target \"low intensity\" support services, designed to help people avoid more drastic intervention. They allow individuals and families to use funding for short-term in-home care, minor home modifications for accessibility, short-term respite care, adaptive equipment, summer camps and other needs.\nSen. Cory McCray told Grady that families benefiting from the program are already contacting him, expressing concern over its potential elimination. McCray, a Democrat from Baltimore City, asked why the program should be cut.\nGrady said it was a part of the cost-containment plan to ensure a sustainable budget model for the DDA going forward.\n\"We still have work to do,\" Grady said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'We are a big family here': Bringing joy and love to local seniors\n\n February 6, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Entertainment \n \n 955\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the year and a half since Colleen Upp became Activity Coordinator of the Amy Lynn Ferris Center at 200 Schauber Road, Chestertown, she has been having a blast, conducting new dance classes, art activities, crafts, and crazy games. Before she was there, the center had one exercise class and bingo twice a week, she said.That's changed under her watch. The parking lot there is filled, depending on what day and what fun activity, said board member Cathy Quesenberry.\n\"We are a big family here,\" Upp said with the youthful energy she exudes to anyone who walks through those doors.\nIt is a fun occupation, but it also is a very important job, requiring possessing a level of care ranging beyond the center, since the senior members she works with can be widowers, often live alone, and some may not have immediate family close by.\nSuch was the case with one member, 90-year-old Dean Wood. His wife passed away two years ago and since then, he has been religiously attending lunches there, amusing staff with his quirky mannerisms.\nBut one day last fall, Wood was not there — unusual for him. Upp noted that he did not miss many, if any, meals, and would ask for double helpings when he could, followed by a kind of catch phrase he adopted, \"Well, you know me!\"\nAdditionally that day, receptionist Cathy Smith told Upp and Shift Coordinator Michaela Wilson that the Meals-on-Wheels volunteer Joy Grace went by his house but he did not answer the door.\nUpp and Wilson decided to drive to Wood's home to check on him.\nUpp hollered for Wood, and after a while, she heard him through the window in his usual tone, a booming voice, hearing impaired.\n\"What? Who is that?\", he cried.\n\"Are you ok? Dean, it's Colleen,\" she responded.\nThe silences were too far in between and Upp knew something was wrong. She was ready to climb through the window, but Wilson was already on the phone with the police. When they arrived they had to break down the door where they found Wood laying in the hallway.\nHe had fallen, but maintaining that distinct personality, he looked at Upp while awaiting medical transport.\n\"Dean, I knew something was wrong when you didn't come to lunch,\" she said.\nNot missing a beat, his smile turned to a frown and said, \"You mean I missed baked potato day? You know me, I never miss a meal!\"\nWood's humorous response highlights the care, respect and appreciation, Upp, Wilson and the entire staff show towards their seniors.\nKnowing Wood's habits and routines enabled them to possibly save his life. If not for their concern, he may have been in that position all weekend since Meals on Wheels only delivers on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.\nWood, according to medical personnel, was likely dehydrated and malnourished leading to his fall — it could have been fatal.\nInstead, he spent five weeks recovering in the hospital, first in Christiana, then in Corsica Hills where he expressed discomfort of the beds there.\nWood is happy to be back home now.\nOn the day of this interview, it was lunch time on a Wednesday. They were serving up roasted pulled barbecue chicken, succotash, jasmine rice, fruit, milk and juice.\nWood showed up, back in his place, and sat down and wanted milk and juice with two straws, as is his usual custom.\nHis eyes shined when he saw Upp, and it was evident he looked forward to seeing some of his friends, chatting with them and other staff members.\nAll of the seniors who came in were greeted warmly showing that these gestures of kindness, and dignity, mean as much to seniors as the meals the center serves. Vanolia Brown, of food services, asked one member where they were at yesterday, playfully chiding them.\nIt was this kind of personal attention that protected Wood that day.\nUpp said, \"Every one of us know where the members are and we know when something is off. For instance, we know the day one of them might go to AquaFit, or have an appointment with the VA hospital, or are visiting their son every Wednesday. We see their routine.\"\nIt is a vital and often under appreciated responsibility that the whole staff share.\n\"We love them all. We see them everyday and interact and care for them. It is extremely rewarding work,\" Upp said. \"It takes all of us to do it.\"\nIt is this personal attention that keeps senior's minds and bodies active as well. The chance to do all the activities that Upp has planned is something they can look forward to each week.\nWhat love she gives, she gets back in full. On her wall, in her activity room, displaying exactly how much residents appreciate her — are memories from Colleen Appreciation Day on July 11, last year.\nHanging on a hook is a whip one of her residents made for her, to poke fun at her intensity leading her exercise routines. Dancing is a joy for her, tracing back to her mother, Arlene Blanke, a former Rockette in New York, who started a dance troupe called The Happy Hoofers,\" while in a senior center in Virginia. Upp's vibrance and energy come thorough when in conversation.\nThere are countless cards of appreciation on the wall but one card sums up the great impact she has made.\n\"Colleen's dedication, determination, imagination, ingenuity, and enthusiasm have all made the Amy Lynn Ferris Center more fun and has encouraged new people to participate.\"\nQuesenberry said, \"She has been wonderful. We're so lucky to have her.\"\nAnd what of Wood?\nHe is back, saying blunt things very loudly for all the tables to hear, and never passing up on a great meal.\nWell...you know Dean!\nFor information of the activities for the center call 410-778-2564. Their hours: Monday-Friday 8 a.m. to 3:00 p.m or go to: https://www.uppershoreaging.org/centers. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "‘Catastrophic:’ Eastern Shore advocates share impacts proposed disability cuts may bring\n\n February 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 631\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Advocates and service providers on the Eastern Shore are joining Maryland's disability community to call for rollbacks on projected cuts to funding for developmental disability services.Scott Evans, executive director of the Benedictine School in Ridgely, said the near $200 million in cuts to Developmental Disabilities Administration funding outlined in Gov. Wes Moore's proposed budget would be the worst he's seen in his 25-year career.\n\"Bottom line, these proposed cuts of close to $200 million in state funds would be catastrophic to the community service providers, as well as the people we support and our employees,\" Evans said. \"It would literally set us back years in funding.\"\nThe proposed cuts come as the state faces a near $3 billion deficit. Some advocates from the Eastern Shore note they could reduce the choices available for families and people with disabilities.\nJonathon Rondeau, president and CEO of The Arc Central Chesapeake Region, says families and people with developmental disabilities on the Eastern Shore already have a limited number of options.\n\"There are less agencies providing services for people with disabilities on the Shore,\" Rondeau said. \"So if there is instability in the system, it can potentially reduce choice for people with disabilities.\"\nEvans echoed the same sentiment, and added that the cuts could hurt Benedictine's ability to stay competitive when hiring employees. In recent years, the nonprofit school and service provider has raised wages in an attempt to attract quality employees.\n\"All that has been an investment we've made because of the funding that we have received,\" Evans said. \"Now to wipe that funding out basically overnight means that we're stuck in a holding pattern.\"\nTHE CUTSIn Moore's budget proposal, his office notes that in addition to the $1.3 billion set for the Developmental Disabilities Administration in fiscal year 2026, the state will \"better leverage federal funding and align Maryland's program more closely with federal guidance and practices across other states.\"\nEvans says it's not clear how DDA would implement the cuts, though his team at Benedictine team is working to crunch the numbers. Evans said it would cost the school hundreds of thousands of dollars of funding at the very least.\nSpecific cuts that worry advocates include reductions in \"dedicated hours\" funding for those in community living programs, as well as a $14.5 million blow to self-directed services funding.\n\"Someone who is in their late 60s and retired and chooses to stay home every day rather than going to a day program won't necessarily have that choice anymore,\" Rondeau said regarding the dedicated hours cuts. \"There won't be the funding available for that. It'll be difficult for providers such as The Arc to support someone who may have significant health issues and need to go to the doctors.\"\nKarenna Jones of Salisbury worries that cuts to self-directed services will impact the ability for her family to take care of her 26-year-old son, Kenneth, who has a traumatic brain injury and lives at home.\nJones says as long as she lives, she \"would never put (her) kid in a provider home.\" But large cuts in funding may leave her with no choice.\n\"We might be forced to do that,\" Jones said. \"It's not fair.\"\nRALLY IN ANNAPOLISWith the uncertainty swirling, hundreds packed Lawyers Mall in Annapolis Monday night, protesting for legislators to reject the proposed cuts. Leaders at the Benedictine School and The Arc Central Chesapeake Region attended, as did Jones.\n\"I'm always amazed at how quickly the folks within the disability community can rally around a cause, and a cause that means so much to them,\" Evans said. \"And also, to some extent, the positive response we've gotten from legislators about these cuts.\"\nJones said the rally — organized with just three days notice by a developmental disability coalition — was inspiring and beautiful.\n\"We were saying, 'Save our DDA services. Save it. Don't leave us behind,'\" Jones said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Local health officials have confirmed that Maryland is currently seeing an increase in hospitalizations, which have been linked to respiratory viruses like COVID-19, influenza and RSV.\"We are surging by greater than 20% volume on any given day,\" Dr. Maxwell Ginsburg, University of Maryland Charles Regional Medical Center's chairman of the emergency medicine department, told Southern Maryland News. \"This includes emergency medical services arrivals and patient walk-ins. We are also seeing an increase in acuity, which essentially means that we are not only seeing more patients, but also sicker patients.\"\nThe doctor continued, \"This results in more admissions and/or transfers, which in turn results in more resource utilization throughout the whole hospital. We are consistently focused on supporting the continued flow of patients and make every attempt to see everyone as soon as possible.\"\n\"Every hospital is struggling,\" said Larisa Goganzer, senior vice president for operations at CalvertHealth Medical Center, who explained the spike is something almost predictable and likely a result of traditional holiday socializing, which often involves travel and then is brought back home and into schools when the season ends.\n\"It should start to taper off in the next couple of weeks,\" Goganzer told Southern Maryland News last week.\n\"Influenza and norovirus have had an incredible surge this winter season,\" Ginsburg said. \"We are seeing an unprecedented number of patients with complaints consistent with one or the other viruses. With regards to norovirus, the good news is that most people just need some symptomatic treatment — for example, pain medicine, nausea medicine and some IV fluids — and they feel much better and go home. The majority of our patients with the flu require the same treatment, however, we are seeing that those who did not get a flu shot have much worse and significant symptoms, sometimes resulting in admissions for more acute long-term care.\"\nALERT CODESThere is communication and coordination among hospitals and emergency medical crews and the information is available to the public via the internet.\n\"We work on the flow of patients through the building,\" Goganzer said, adding that since Christmas, CalvertHealth has been between yellow and red codes.\nAccording to Maryland's Hospital Alert Tracking System, code yellow \"is initiated because the [hospital's] emergency department is experiencing a temporary, overwhelming overload\" which can compromise the safety of managing patients classified as priority 2 and priority 3.\nGoganzer said those patients in those priority areas \"may experience longer wait times.\"\nA code red means a hospital has no electrocardiogram-monitored beds available.\n\"Red is when all of our beds are in use, we are already at full capacity,\" Goganzer said. Regardless, \"Our emergency room is always open.\"\nThe code alert system, Goganzer said, \"helps ambulances know where to take patients.\"\n\"We have several emergency code names that are called overhead to alert staff and security that there is a threat, an emergency or incoming concern,\" Ginsburg said of the system used within the La Plata hospital. \"For example, 'code blue Room 2512\" would mean that there is a respiratory emergency in room 2512, or 'code SW,' which means there is severe weather incoming or 'code red,' which means there is a fire. Each code has a unique meaning and alerts the appropriate teams into action.\"\nIn a letter to a St. Mary's County resident from that county's health department, a copy of which was forwarded to Southern Maryland News by the letter-writer, department officials attempted to allay concerns about the information from the alert system.\n\"The hospital alert you referenced is intended for EMS crews,\" the health department letter stated. \"To our understanding, they are not intended to guide the general public in making a decision to use the emergency department as a walk-in. There are many factors that influence the hospital's status, including the availability of beds and staffing, as well as how the hospital may be receiving or sending patients from and to other hospitals in their system. These status levels and contributing factors may fluctuate throughout the day.\"\n{h2 style=\"text-align: center \"}GOING TO ER{/h2}\nThe Maryland Hospital Association advises citizens \"life-threatening or conditions requiring immediate attention are prioritized in emergency rooms.\"\nThose conditions include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, chest or upper belly pain or pressure lasting two minutes or more, fainting, sudden dizziness, weakness, changes in vision, confusion or changes in mental status, any sudden or severe pain, uncontrolled bleeding, severe or persistent vomiting or diarrhea, coughing or vomiting blood, suicidal or homicidal feelings, difficulty speaking, or numbness or weakness in any part of your body, unusual belly pain, poisoning, drug overdose, loss of consciousness, major burn, spinal cord, head, or brain injury, severe allergic reaction, a fast heartbeat (more than 120 to 150 beats per minute) at rest, especially if associated with shortness of breath or feeling faint, a broken bone with skin protruding through the skin and drowning.\nThe state hospital association advises for \"routine illnesses,\" individuals should go to their primary care provider or access \"tele-health.\"\nFor treatment of non-life-threatening injuries, individuals should visit an urgent care center.\n\"That's the place to go,\" Goganzer said of the urgent care centers located throughout the region. She added, however, that many of those facilities have experienced longer waits.\nTo visit the Maryland Hospital Association website, go to mhaonline.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Chestertown facility is a University of Maryland Shore Regional Health hospital, an organization of the University of Maryland Medical System.\"These new analyzers represent a significant technological advancement compared to our previous equipment,\" said Julianna Hospodor, Director of Laboratory Services. \"They provide overall faster processing and better cardiac readings, as well as some technologies we did not have before. We are so grateful to the foundation and its many donors for their generosity in making this new technology a reality for our hospital and our patients.\"\nInstalling the analyzers first required significant updates to the Chestertown laboratory facilities, which began in 2021. \"It was a lot of work to get the space ready,\" said Hospodor. \"Now that the new analyzers are installed and operational, this state-of-the art technology is consistent throughout our laboratory sites, and that consistency supports quality patient care.\"\n\"The Board of Directors of the Chester River Health Foundation recognized the significant need to update the hospital's laboratory equipment and we were happy to commit the necessary funding,\" said Libby Woolever, foundation chair. \"The lab team was a great partner in this project, working through the process with grace and commitment.

A brother and sister, neither of whom made it to their first birthday. Three-year-olds, 9-year-olds, 11-year olds. For most of human history, high rates of infant and childhood mortality was a fact of life.\nThere is one specific reason why we don't see tiny tombstones in modern cemeteries: vaccines.\nIn 1938, Max Theiler developed the first yellow fever vaccine. In 1939, Pearl Kendrick and Grace Eldering proved the effectiveness of the pertussis vaccine. In 1945, Jonas Salk developed the first influenza vaccine and then set his sights on polio in the 1950s.\nSalk tested his first polio vaccine on himself. In 1961, John Enders developed a measles vaccine that was 100% effective. In 1967, the World Health Organization began its campaign to eradicate smallpox. Smallpox was declared extinct in 1980.\nOver the last half century, vaccinations for 14 common childhood diseases have reduced global infant mortality by 40%. 154 million people, 101 million of whom were infants, are alive today thanks to safe, effective vaccines. The measles vaccine, alone, is responsible for 60% of those lives saved. By almost any measure, the advent of mass vaccinations is the single greatest public health victory in modern medicine.\nIn the 75 years prior to the development of the polio vaccine, nine children under the age of 13 were buried in the Christ Church Cemetery. In the 75 years after, there was only one.\nWe are entering a dangerous new era in public health as vaccine conspiracists use fear to deprive children of access to the most effective medical intervention ever created. In Texas, 22 children were infected with measles this month. In American Samoa, a 2019 outbreak left 61 children dead. The island ran out of child-sized coffins.\nThe elevation of prominent vaccine-denier Robert Kennedy Jr. to the highest public health office sets us on a dangerous path toward new epidemics of old diseases. We can't allow the voices of reason, hard-won experience, community and civic duty be drowned out by fear mongers. All you have to do is walk through any historic cemetery on the Eastern Shore to see that the truth about vaccines is written in stone.\nANDREW D.

    "content": "Green ribbon has an incredible story behind it\n\n February 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 628\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Next month is National Kidney Month.According to information posted on the National Kidney Foundation website, 37 million adults in America have chronic kidney disease.\nNinety percent don't know they have it.\nApproximately 750,000 individuals have irreversible kidney failure that requires regular dialysis or a kidney transplant just to survive.\nAlmost 100,000 of those critically ill individuals are on transplant waitlists.\nThe average wait times for a transplant range from three to seven years depending upon where the patient lives.\nFor some, that wait is ultimately futile.\nThe Kidney Foundation reports that only one in five on the waitlist receive a kidney transplant every year and every day an average of 10 people who need a kidney transplant die.\nUntil recently, I had no more than a vague awareness of the tremendous need for kidney donors.\nThe catalyst for learning more about this matter resulted from a chance encounter at a recent meet and greet event.\nWhile chatting with another event attendee, I noticed she was wearing one of the ubiquitous \"ribbon pins\" that are used by many to express support for countless causes.\nThe color of her ribbon was green.\nI had never seen that color before, so I asked her about it.\nShe smiled and said quietly, \"I'm an organ donor. I donated one of my kidneys.\"\nI told her I knew two individuals who were kidney transplant recipients, but never met a live-organ donor.\nI asked her if she donated it to an immediate family member, a relative, a close friend or someone she knew.\nHer unexpected reply shocked me.\nShe said, \" I have no idea who received it. I never asked, and they never told me. All I know is someone desperately needed lifesaving help, and I wanted to provide it.\"\nI finally recovered enough to state the obvious — her selfless actions were a wonderful thing for her to do.\nIt was much more than wonderful thing to do but at that time more appropriate words escaped me.\nI finally followed up with telling her I was glad I saw and asked about her ribbon.\nShe smiled again and said, ''I too am glad you saw it and asked about it. I don't wear it for recognition or compliments. I wear it as a way to raise awareness of how important it is to be a live organ donor and the wonderful lifelong feeling it provides on making a real difference in this world.\"\nBefore we went our separate ways, she said thank you for listening and learning more about this cause.\nI have not seen her or talked to her again, nor do I know who she is.\nI will never forget her and her story.\nI have since learned that green ribbons are not just for live kidney donors.\nThey can be worn by anyone as a symbol of support for those giving hope and sharing life through organ, eye and tissue donations.\nI realize now, the best way to honor the green ribbon wearer I met is to share her story in this commentary.\nI know recognizing her by name is not possible nor is it the proper thing to do.\nShe already told me she was not a seeking recognition or compliments for her compassion and extraordinary gift.\nThis commentary is not a call to action to become a live organ donor. I have no doubt I never will and respect all those who choose not to do so.\nMy hope is this commentary will help advance her goal of raising awareness on the need for live organ donors and the wonderful feeling it provided her in making a real difference in this world.\nAll of us can do that by simply remembering and perhaps even telling her story to others.\nWe can also watch for those wearing green ribbons.\nWhen we do see them, I suggest we take a minute to listen to their unique story, whatever it may be. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She did some research and found out about beef tallow.\n\"When you hear 'beef fat'; you think ewww,\" Cook said. However, after two days in the crock pot, it loses its pungent fragrance. Cook begins the whipping process, adding fragrances, castor oil, jojoba oil raw honey or beeswax depending on the recipe.\n\"I started by giving it to family and friends and then word got out,\" Cook said. She came up with \"Hallo Tallow\" to playfully give her product that 'come hither' persona.\n\"It was like, 'Where have you been all my life'?\" Cook said, laughing. Hallo Tallow has made her son's skin condition just about disappear.\nCook uses the dry rendering procedure to turn five pounds of beef fat — purchased from Rumbleway Farms in Conowingo — into four cups of body lotion or lip balm or other luxurious products. While she offers unscented lines, Cook said her new favorite scent is Orange Dreamsicle. There's rose, lavender, peppermint, frankincense and other scents, some of which change seasonally.\nJars of face and body balms are $20. Whipped jars are $25 and tubes of lip balm are $4 each.

    "content": "Maryland spent big on youth mental health — but then the budget crisis hit\n\n February 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SASHA ALLEN Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 1370\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Tthe new statewide youth mental health program supported behavioral health services for more than 58,000 students in its first eight months of operations from March through October 2024. Four out of every five of Maryland public schools received aid for mental health services under the state's effort.But as the General Assembly moved to balance Maryland's fiscal 2025 budget last spring, lawmakers cut funding for the state's fledgling youth mental health program from Gov. Wes Moore's recommended $110 million to $40 million.\nWith the state's fiscal problems deepening, Moore is recommending the state allocate $40 million annually through 2030 to a program he once suggested should get $130 million a year starting in fiscal 2026.\nMeagan Pantelis, a clinical social worker at Thrive Behavioral Health, said the proposed cuts would decimate services for students that, in many cases, are just getting off the ground.\n\"Whenever I found out about that proposed cut, the very first thing that came to mind is that Gov. Moore is wanting to balance a budget on the backs of our children,\" Pantelis said. \"I just find that to be just egregious. I mean, why are our children the population that we are targeting? Why are they not the population that we want to build up and support?\"\nMoore, however, has stressed the state must act to close a structural $3 billion budget gap driven in part by the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the 10-year, multibillion-dollar education reform plan that created the youth mental health program.\n\"We only have difficult decisions ahead,\" Moore said in his State of the State address in early February. \"We must close this $3 billion budget gap.\"\nThe mental health crisisDuring the 2022-23 school year, over a quarter of Maryland high school students reported their mental health was not good at most or all times, according to a Maryland Department of Health survey.\nThe percentage was only slightly lower for middle school students, with 22% reporting their mental health was not good at most or all times.\n\"We all know generally that there's a mental health crisis,\" said Lorianne Moss, the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission program manager. \"So as sort of the preamble to our first call for proposals, we laid out some data.\"\nThat data, from the Centers for Disease Control, showed 40% of high school students experience persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. Citing such statistics, the consortium urged mental health programs and nonprofits across the state to apply for funds.\nApplicants requested a total of $380 million in grants, said Mark Luckner, executive director of the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission, which oversees the consortium. That's more than three times what the consortium had to allocate.\nNevertheless, the state funded mental health service providers in every county.\nPreventing youth suicide is one of the consortium's key goals, said Dr. John Campo, director of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Sixteen of the consortium's 129 grants so far focus on suicide prevention.\nSuicide is the second-leading cause of death for people ages 10-14 and third for people ages 15-24, according to the most recent CDC data.\n\"Suicide kills more young people in that age group than cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory illnesses, infections of all kinds, meningitis, pneumonia, HIV, COVID — the whole nine yards,\" Campo said. \"Add them all together, suicide kills more people than all those things combined.\"\nIn Maryland, the teen suicide rate increased by more than a third from 2014 to 2022. Campo said the state's health care system has been ill-equipped to deal with that increase.\n\"Mental health crisis isn't a priority in most emergency departments,\" Campo said.\nCampo is one of the co-chairs of the consortium's best practices subcommittee, a group that developed a list of evidence-based mental health practices for grantees to implement.\nEach program targets a different facet of the mental health crisis. The responses are also tailored to the varying levels of severity of the mental health conditions different age groups experience.\nThe consortium found through surveys targeted at both students and parents that 90% of students and families were satisfied with the services.\n\"A lot of these practices have been tested,\" Campo said. \"If regional organizations adopt them and implement them with fidelity, we really do want to believe that there will be positive outcomes associated with it.\"\nFrom the city to the ShoreThe youth mental health crisis touches all of Maryland, and so does the state's response — but grants are tailored to the vast differences among Maryland's urban, suburban and rural communities.\nIn Baltimore City, the 11 grants the consortium issued take into account a stigma surrounding mental health services, said Jennifer Cox, director of the University of Maryland School Mental Health Program, which received a $970,000 grant to run a number of programs.\n\"We think in Baltimore City, we have to be a little bit more creative than just saying, 'Come get help,' \" Cox said. \"We know we have good things to offer, we just need to find a good way to offer it.\"\nWorking with trusted community organizations such as churches and youth centers, the program has been able to reach people who would otherwise not seek out mental health treatment, Cox said.\nServices range from in-school counseling from certified clinicians to parent and caregiver education programs.\nMeanwhile, the state's efforts on the largely rural Eastern Shore stress increasing access to treatment in a region that's short of professionals to respond to the youth mental health crisis.\nAccording to the October 2024 report, \"Investing in Maryland's Behavioral Health Talent,\" Maryland is nearly 50% short of the mental health workers it needs.\n\"There's a resounding message of 'we just need more,'\" said Beth Anne Dorman, CEO of For All Seasons, a behavioral health and rape crisis center that received a grant to expand its services in Kent County. \"We need more.\"\nCaroline County, where two organizations won grants to expand their mental health services, faces the same situation, said Derek Simmons, the county's superintendent of schools.\n\"We are a rural county that is less wealthy than a lot of parts of the state,\" said Simmons, co-chair of the consortium's best practices committee. \"So access to behavioral health is near and dear, and a real challenge where I'm at.\"\nAn uncertain future\nIf the General Assembly agrees with the funding levels suggested in the governor's budget, programs that just started last year may have to be eliminated, said Del. Eric Ebersole (D-Baltimore County, Howard).\n\"That group worked in good faith to bring providers online,\" said Ebersole, a consortium member. \"If the government loses them, can you get them back?\"\nDan Martin, senior director of public policy at the Mental Health Association of Maryland, said the proposed cut in planned funding comes at a time when youth mental health care is more important than ever.\n\"At a time when 18% of high school students and 24% of middle school students have seriously considered suicide in the past year, a reduction of this size in school mental health funding could prove disastrous,\" Martin said.\nIf the General Assembly approves Moore's budget proposal, the grants distributed by the program in fiscal years 2025 and 2026 combined will be cut 28% from the total amount distributed the prior two years.\nAsked for comment, Moore's office stressed the governor's proposed allocation for fiscal year 2026 and beyond is exactly what the General Assembly approved for 2025.\n\"Gov. Moore is maintaining the current level of funding for the Maryland Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports,\" wrote a spokesperson from the governor's office. \"The Governor strongly supports behavioral health treatment for Maryland's children, and maintaining current levels of funding during the state's budget crisis reflects that commitment.\"\nThe Mental Health Association of Maryland is urging action to try to persuade the General Assembly to restore funding to a higher level. The organization is circulating a fact sheet with information on the consortium, the work it's done and what a permanent cut in funding would do to students and schools.\n\"Use the above information and write an email to your legislators asking them to restore funding to the Community Supports Partnership Fund,\" the fact sheet said. \"Provide testimony (either written or oral or both) opposing the cut\" at General Assembly hearings.\nAnd under the \"why is funding needed\" section, the Mental Health Association fact sheet reads: \"Dramatic worsening of the behavioral health of children and youth over the last decade.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "5 game-changing wellness travel trends to watch in 2025 and beyond\n\n March 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Karen Kelly Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 928\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Global Wellness Summit predicts spending on wellness tourism to skyrocket from $830.2 billion in 2023 to more than $1.3 trillion in 2028. Clearly, healthy holistic travel is still a major interest and is growing among older generations. Whether consumers want a yoga retreat, a spa experience on a cruise or a sound bath in the woods, travel companies scramble to accommodate the ever-growing demand for the coming years.Current growing wellness travel trends are as multifaceted as each consumer. However, specific trends are emerging this year, and customers are all too eager to sign up for the experience.\nWellness travel in high demandThe wellness travel industry was a $792.35 billion business in 2023, according to a report from Zion Market Research, which covered markets in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. The estimated worth from 2024 through 2032 is expected to reach $1.84 trillion.\nThe same report states that North America will be the leading region during this period. The United States will contribute the most towards this trend due to its high disposable income, availability of multiple travel options, and the ease and availability of online booking. But which trends are consumers leaning towards the most?\nAccording to Conde Nast Traveler, the top five requested wellness travel trends are mental wellness retreats, women's health-focused programs and sleep-focused vacations. Also at the top of the list are digital detox retreats and personalized wellness experiences.\nMental wellnessAs stress grows, people seek out services to help stabilize their mental wellness. Popular wellness retreats that offer services such as neurofitness training and psychedelic-assisted feedback are in increasing demand. These neurofitness programs maximize clients' brain function, helping them reach peak mental performance.\nWomen's healthWomen feeling the pinch of stress and trauma or even more significant life changes also seek tailored programs that focus specifically on their needs, such as menopause, fertility and even postpartum care. According to a report from Finn Partners, sexual health for women is driving its fair share of this consumer market. Companies bring on gynecologists and hormone experts to guide women further down their road to better health.\nBella Bucchiotti at xoxoBella says, \"When I plan a wellness vacation, I'm looking for a place that lets me truly unwind — whether that's soaking in hot springs, indulging in delicious food or just having a moment of quiet away from the daily chaos. As a new mom and business owner, I don't want to come home from a trip feeling like I need a vacation from my vacation. Spending extra on wellness travel is 100% worth it because when you invest in feeling good, everything else in life benefits — your energy, creativity and patience.\"\nSleep healthConsumers are willing to pay premium prices for a good night's sleep when sleep comes at a premium. Sleep-focused vacations honor the importance of rest and offer services focused on combating insomnia and building better sleep habits. Consumers love using sleep tech gadgets such as trackers, smart beds, sleep pods, earbuds and goggles. However, over time, expected trends will likely evolve from gadgets to services such as circadian medicines and chronotherapies.\nDigital detox\nOne bad habit that consumers are increasingly looking to avoid, to the surprise of no one, is the digital habit. Digital detox retreats offer a reprieve from the increasing concerns over technology addiction. These vacations encourage guests to unplug and engage in mindful activities.\nCustomized retreatsBeyond those specific trends, people want customization. Personalized wellness programs and experiences offer highly specific wellness journeys where the entire experience is tailored specifically to the individual and their own health goals. With nomadism on the rise, consumers want to stay longer to reap the benefits of customized plans.\nDriving markets\nAccording to the same report from Finn Partners, \"wellness sabbaticals — described as people taking three weeks or more to focus on their health and wellness while staying connected with work through their smart devices are a growing segment of the overall market.\" The trend came on the heels of remote work and digital nomadism. Solo travel is likely to be a driving factor overall, according to Forbes. Many companies are training staff to accommodate single travelers and even go so far as to adjust menus and order odd numbers of chairs. This spills heavily into the wellness market as solo travelers also desire wellness journeys.\nAlex of Delish Knowledge says, \"When booking a cruise, I always look for the availability of healthy meals, preferably vegetarian or vegan options, whenever I travel. As a dietitian, I recommend that clients focus on high-fiber foods the first few days of travel to help offset any GI issues that can arise, especially when traveling overseas. As a bonus, I appreciate it when properties include fitness classes as part of their wellness package; yoga after a long plane flight is a must.\"\nJust relaxIn recent years, the shift in consumer demand towards wellness retreats and experiences has seen a significant boom, with the Global Wellness Summit also predicting wellness tourism to jump to over a trillion in 2028. Travelers increasingly seek experiences that offer relaxation and promote physical, mental and spiritual well-being. The growth in this market is encouraging rapid changes within the travel industry to accommodate the growing demand. Consumers want to rest, relax and return to better health. With this push, the industry will continue to evolve and accommodate wherever it is needed, which is likely to bring change that no one will mind seeing.\nKaren Kelly is a nationally syndicated freelance food and travel writer and the founder of Seasonal Cravings.

The organization provides a relaxing and safe environment for wounded, ill and injured military members, veterans and their families and caregivers.\nFor All Seasons will provide on-site mental health consulting at retreats that Patriot Point holds.\n\"We are working very closely with the Military Bowl Foundation,\" For All Seasons President and Chief Executive Officer Beth Anne Dorman said. \"The ultimate partnership is that we will be providing mental health services and support to Patriot Point.\"\nVeteran and Military Support Alliance will also will partner with Patriot Point to bring more of the same veterans and military members to participate in the retreat.\nFor All Seasons plans to help Patriot Point's retreaters in many different ways that will kick start veterans knowledge of what trauma they may be experiencing.\n\"We're also working in partnership with therapeutic yoga instructors, we are bringing in certified art therapists,\" Dorman said. \"The idea is to be able to create a safe space for veterans to have conversation, education, to bring in a mental health component, and also provide a beautiful scenery where veterans can connect in small groups and be able to receive wraparound support.\"\nIn addition to the mental health component offered by For All Seasons, Patriot Point offers many activities for retreaters to enjoy themselves, including fishing, hunting and a workout room with golf and hunting simulators.\nPatriot Point is run by veterans who have experience different forms of post traumatic stress disorder and other mental problems veterans and military members may experience.\nCo-General Managers of Patriot Point Will and Stephanie Moon experienced the retreat first-hand. They said Patriot Point helped them as a couple and as individuals.\nWill Moon, a Navy Seal veteran, was struggling with life as a civilian. The Moons' couples therapist recommended that he attend a retreat at Patriot Point in January of 2024.\nStephanie Moon, an experienced certified trauma-sensitive yoga instructor and a certified integrative restoration meditation teacher, received a call from the previous general managers of Patriot Point stating they were leaving and wanted someone to take over.\nWill and Stephanie drove all the way to Maryland from North Caroline to go see Patriot Point, during the time on the road, they researched many different things about Patriot Point to find out what they were getting themselves into.\n\"We gave up everything to be here,\" Will Moon said. \"I knew the moment that I drove through the gate, everyone needs some type of therapy in a way, and in this place, it's the peer-to-peer, it's the interactions that you're not alone that people realize, they come here for retreats and then they realize they need help.\"\nWill and Stephanie Moon have been Co-General Managers since Aug. 15.\n\"Patroit Point is 294 acres, but healing does occur here. Those six days really helped saved my life,\" Will Moon said.\nFor All Season and Patriot Point will conduct their first retreat together in late spring. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Amid funding challenges, Upper Shore Aging serves seniors in need\n\n March 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 750\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — As state and federal budget constraints trickle down, Upper Shore Aging is pushing forward with its mission to provide thousands of senior residents with crucial support, such as meals and senior center classes.Herb Cain, executive director of the nonprofit that spans Caroline, Kent and Talbot counties, says the financial outlook has become a \"lot bleaker\" in recent months.\n\"With everything that's going on in the Maryland state budget and the federal cuts, there's a lot of anxiety and concern,\" Cain said. \"So trying to stay within our budget so that we don't have to go back this fiscal year and ask for even more money for running out.\"\nWith senior need increasing, the pressure on organizations like Upper Shore Aging to fill those gaps intensifies. And it comes a time when food contracts have risen and funding from the American Rescue Plan Act is expiring.\nLast month, Upper Shore Aging asked the Talbot County Council for funding assistance as its fiscal year 2025 costs rose an unexpected $98,000. The county granted that request, providing $60,000 in additional funding.\n\"Talbot County Council's been very generous for taking care of their seniors,\" Cain said.\nAccording to census data, People 65-and-over accounts for 30% of Talbot County's total population. The county's average age was 50.9 in 2023 and has slightly increased each year since 2020. The national average is just under 39 years old.\nThe nonprofit's senior center in Easton — Brookletts Place — sees around 75 to 100 people stop in daily, according to center manager Childlene Brooks. The center has a variety of offerings, including exercise, dance and music programs, along with other recreational activities.\n\"We're an older community,\" Brooks said. \"And secondly, there are so many of the seniors that are by themselves, and it's not good staying home by yourself.\"\nBut the need isn't just in Talbot County, Upper Shore Aging leaders say. Kent County's average age was around 49.0 in 2023.\nCosts across Caroline, Kent and Talbot counties are up more than $200,000 for this year, Cain said. Upper Shore Aging's Meals on Wheels program gives out north of 25,000 meals in both Caroline and Kent counties.\nTIGHT FINANCES\nAs the Eastern Shore population grows older, financial challenges for seniors increase as well. Cain said when Upper Shore Aging assists senior residents with meals, it can help offset increased costs in other areas.\n\"The need is out there with the inflation, cost of medicine, heating, all those things,\" Cain said.\n\"With the cost of everything going up, goods and services, it's been really hard for some of our lower income folks to make the dollars stretch,\" said Carrie Ottey, director of senior services for the Talbot County Health Department.\nThe department is one of only two in the state to administer the senior care program, Ottey said. Working in conjunction with Upper Shore Aging, Ottey said Talbot County makes the extra effort to aid its senior population.\n\"We've definitely heard from clients who have either come from other counties and moved here and are amazed at some of the services they can receive here,\" Ottey said, \"or if they move out of this county, we sometimes hear back from them that they're no longer able to get what they were getting here.\"\nBut at the state and federal levels, funding holdups or potential cuts to programs or counties that contribute to efforts from health departments or Upper Shore Aging have significant impacts.\nCain says since Upper Shore Aging operates on a quarterly basis and pays food vendors for meals, funding delays cause \"tremendous hardship.\"\n\"When there are delays, federal delays and state delays, it puts us in a crunch,\" Cain said.\nDuring tough times, helping every single person in need may not be attainable. But a trip to Denton last fall helped Cain see that Upper Shore Aging is following through on its mission.\nThe organization's senior center in Denton was short on drivers to deliver meals, so Cain chipped in to drive a route through rural Caroline County.\n\"There were no stores for people to go out to. You were out in the country,\" Cain said. \"I went there and some of the houses that they lived in, I looked at them and all of a sudden I realized, this person we made a difference. We helped them.\"\n\"That trip did me some good because I realized, yeah, there's a lot of people that we can't help,\" he continued. \"There's a lot of people angry about that. But there are some out there that we are helping. And that, I think, is what keeps us grounded.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lawmakers seek to ban gender-affirming medication for those under 18\n\n March 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SAHSA ALLEN Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 839\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Lawmakers are considering a bill that would target transgender healthcare for minors — the first time bans on gender-affirming care have been introduced at the state level.The bill, Protect the Kids Act, would prohibit licensed medical professionals from prescribing cross-sex hormone therapy like hormones or hormone blockers. The penalty for both is a felony and imprisonment up to a life sentence.\n\"We don't let parents neuter their children,\" Del. Lauren Arikan, the primary bill sponsor, told Capital News Service. \"But essentially, that's what these procedures do. They're, in many cases, permanently taking away reproductive abilities of a minor child.\"\nArikan, who is a Republican representing Harford County, believes providing gender-affirming care to children is \"akin to child abuse.\"\nBut transgender rights activists think it is necessary to publicly oppose the bill.\n\"This was the first time that we've had a trans healthcare ban introduced in Maryland,\" Charlotte Persephone Hoffman, the policy director with Trans Maryland said in testimony at the bill hearing. \"It's our job to be there for the trans community.\"\nThere are an estimated 8,000 transgender youth ages 13-17 in the state of Maryland, according to the Williams Institute, a research institute based out of the UCLA School of Law.\nGender-affirming medications and surgeries for minors are currently banned in 25 states, with six states making it a felony for medical practitioners to violate the ban. Maryland is one of 14 states that has a safeguard law in place. The Trans Health Equity Act, passed in 2023, requires that Medicaid covers gender-affirming care.\nThis is not the first time Arikan has introduced a bill dealing with transgender rights. In 2024, she proposed a bill prohibiting health care providers from performing surgeries or engaging in practices on a minor without consent of a parent or guardian. If violated, medical practitioners would be guilty of a misdemeanor, subject to imprisonment between one and three years.\nWhile last year's bill stalled in committee, Arikan's bill this legislative session would ramp up both restrictions and the penalty for violation significantly, a decision made because of further research, said Arikan.\nThose who testified had been in the statehouse since Tuesday afternoon for the hearing initially scheduled at 1 pm. But the bill wasn't heard until after 9 pm, so numbers dwindled and those hoping to sit in on the hearing were comfortably scattered in the back of the room. Still, tensions were high and emotional testimony was given from both proponents and opponents of the bill.\nHenry Mosley, a physician epidemiologist and professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins University, testified for the bill, telling lawmakers the current state of research leaves too much room for concern about the long term effects of certain therapies.\nThere are studies proving the short-term relief that hormones can have on gender dysphoria and other mental health conditions, Mosley said.\n\"However, there are no long-term studies yet,\" Mosley said. \"We don't know what happens after five or 10 years.\"\nMosley said he also is worried about the personal consequences these decisions have on people.\n\"There are young adults that are now detransitioning,\" Mosley said. \"They are regretting decisions they made as a child and are making efforts to reverse their gender transition.\"\nThe bill also bans children from being put on puberty blockers, a medication that delays the effects of puberty on transgender individuals. If usage is stopped, puberty of the patient's sex assigned at birth will continue.\nWhile there was some bipartisan support with Del. Sheree Sample-Hughes, a Democrat representing Dorchester and Wicomico Counties co-sponsoring the bill, Arikan said she introduced this bill to begin talks in the legislature.\n\"I just wanted to start the conversation,\" Arikan said. \"I believe that in some period of time, maybe it's 15 years, maybe it's 25 years, we are going to be on the wrong side of history with this issue.\"\nBut transgender individuals and activists are adamantly against the bill. Chloe Celeste is 16 years old and said she is the \"exact person\" the bill targets.\n\"Since starting gender affirming hormone therapy with the guidance of my doctors and my parents over a year ago I have been more confident, self aware and overall happier than I have ever been in my life,\" Celeste said. \"Anyone who knew me pre-transition can vouch for that.\"\nCeleste referred to the bill as the \"so-called Protect the Kids Act\" that would force her and other transgender minors off their \"life saving medication.\"\nOthers testified in support as well. A public school teacher, Alexa Sciuto, discussed the detransitioning rates.\n\"There is no evidence of a high rate of regret,\" Sciuto said. \"In fact, there is a more demonstrably high rate of regret amongst heterosexual marriages, and we love those.\"\nAfter Arikan's less drastic bill on transgender care for minors stalled last year without getting a vote, there is little confidence the Protect the Kids Act will pass in the Democrat-dominated legislature.\nBut those against the bill were upset that it was even introduced in the state.\n\"I think we're definitely going to see more attacks on trans people in Maryland, especially as the second Trump administration progresses,\" Hoffman said. \"We're definitely seeing conservative voices emboldened.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Really tense time': Senior centers, Meals on Wheels facing lost funding from Trump's DOGE, potential shutdown\n\n March 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Belgrade News | Section: News \n \n 1295\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Lisa Beedy and Jim Marks are feeling the brunt of the Trump administration's DOGE austerity pushes, a possible federal shutdown and the cancellation of a long-standing federal law that has long funded programs for seniors.And they are bracing for more.\n\"We have definitely been affected,\" said Beedy, director of the Belgrade Senior Center. in Montana \"It looks like we are not probably going to receive our March contract payment.\"\nBeedy said she was notified by the Rocky Mountain Development Council earlier this month that the Belgrade and other senior centers in Montana might not be receiving monthly installments for meals and other programs for seniors.\nThe money in question originates with the federal government and filters through the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services.\nIn a March 4 letter to senior centers and other providers, Marks, who serves as RMCD program director, said Montana's Aging Services Bureau notified his group \"that the state is not able to meet the full March payment to\" local agencies.\n\"This means you should expect no or partial payment from Rocky Aging in March,\" Marks told the senior centers and other providers.\nMarks said the Montana state agency said it might provide state money and other available funds. Officials with the Montana agency have not yet responded to a request for comment.\nBeedy said the Belgrade Senior Center has an annual budget of approximately $400,000 with approximately $100,000 coming from federal sources.\n\"That will definitely leave a hole for us,\" said Beedy. \"That leaves us wondering what the future looks like for us.\nThe Belgrade center provides Meals on Wheels and congregate meals for local seniors. It also hosts holiday events as well as wellness and other classes. The center is part of the local municipal government and received some of its funding via the city of Belgrade.\nBeedy said her center is on track to provide as many as 18,000 meals to local seniors this fiscal year.\nShe noted that demand has grown with the impacts of inflation and the local area's population growth.\nBeedy said community support, via tax-deductible donations, has increased and the center has enough funds to make it through the fiscal year, which ends June 30.\n\"After that, we're not sure,\" she said.\nHer husband Dave Beedy, who runs the center's kitchen operations is already looking at the best and most economical ways forward.\n'A REALLY TENSE TIME'\nThe future for senior centers and Meals on Wheels food programs across the country could be impacted by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's DOGE austerity measures, a potential government shutdown and the uncertain reauthorization of the Older Americans Act.\nThe GOP-majority U.S. House of Representatives passed a temporary spending bill Tuesday, but the U.S. Senate must also pass the stop-gap plan by the end of day Friday to avoid a government shutdown.\nTrump and Republicans need some Democratic senators to help avoid a shutdown.\nThe administration and Congress will also need to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. The bill was enacted in 1965 and funds federal spending and programs for seniors. The GOP stalled a reauthorization effort in December before Trump took office.\nMarks said the federal money stoppage reference in his letter impacts 13 Montana senior centers and meals providers.\nHe said federal money through the state and his group can make up as much 50% of some Montana senior centers' budgets.\n\"We are kind of waiting to see what is happening with the shutdown,\" Marks said.\nBut even if the shutdown is avoided he is worried about Trump and Musk's DOGE cuts and Congress not reauthorizing the Older Americans Act.\n\"It's really a tense time cause we don't know what's going to happen,\" Marks said.\nThe nonprofit group's regional budget for Montana areas that include Gallatin and Park counties totals $2.8 million with 56% of that coming from the federal government.\nMarks said the monthly regional allotments total $120,000 and go to senior centers and other providers. He said those groups are often smaller community and nonprofit groups who have little financial leeway.\n\"If we lose (funding), we run the risk of our network collapsing,\" Marks said. The meals programs are aimed at home bound and lower income seniors.\nThat frustrates Marks.\n\"Taking food away from older Americans, it's beyond cruelty,\" he said.\nHe also worried about larger employment cuts at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services related to aging and Trump and Musk targeting Social Security, Medicaid (which offers public health service to poorer Americans).\nTrump and Musk argue their DOGE efforts aim to reduce government waste, bloated government bureaucracies and unnecessary spending.\nDOGE efforts have mirrored program cuts in the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 conservative policy blueprints. Project 2025 included some major overhauls of HHS, which oversees senior programs and funding.\nThey've pointed to the need to clean up Social Security databases, which include persons with very high ages .\nMartin O'Malley, who served as Social Security administrator in the Biden administration, said those database entries do not translate into benefits payments and worries DOGE cuts to staffing and offices could potentially jeopardize Social Security customer service and payments.\nWATCHING WITH CONCERN\nAcross the country in southwest Florida, Erin McLeod, CEO of Senior Friendship Centers Inc., is also worried about the fate of the Older Americans Act (OAA) and funding for meals deliveries to seniors and disabled persons.\n\"It funds our Meals on Wheels and nutrition programs,\" McLeod said, of the federal law.\nThe Florida nonprofit, which also operates senior centers and has educational programs for seniors, has a $20 million annual budget. McLeod said approximately $6.5 million of that comes from the federal government and is key to its meals programs.\n\"We are delivering 30,000 meals per month,\" McLeod said of the nonprofit's operations across Charlotte, Lee, Sarasota and DeSoto counties.\nLike other senior providers, McLeod is concerned about the potential length and impacts of a federal shutdown as well as DOGE efforts.\nFunding cuts or disruptions would result in SFC halting new enrollments in affected programs as higher prices continue to challenge seniors and other Floridians, McLeod said. Like other meals providers and food banks, SFC sees community needs for services still well above pre-pandemic levels\nMcLeod said private donations can help but they are not likely to be a long-term solution to lost government funding.\nShe said seniors are also watching, with some trepidation, the fate of Social Security under Trump and Musk's DOGE austerity pushes with concerns about potential staffing cuts and restructuring hurting claims and benefits processing.\n\"We are really watching Security,\" she said.\n'IMPOSSIBLE CHOICES'\nNationally, Meals on Wheels programs serve more than 250 million meals annually to an estimated 2 million seniors.\nFor some seniors, delivered meals or meals and events at senior centers are their only social interactions.\nSenior centers and meal providers have also reported increased demand with high post-pandemic inflation, including for food prices and items such as eggs.\nBreyana Franklin, external relations manager for Meals on Wheels America, worries about a government shutdown now or the next time the Trump administration and Congress face budgetary crossroads.\n\"We're coming up on the March 14 expiration of the current FY 2025 appropriations continuing resolution. If that expires without action, the government will shut down, and a shutdown for any considerable length of time could lead to a delay in federal funding reimbursements for meals and services delivered,\" said\n\"This would force Meals on Wheels providers to make near impossible choices such as suspending meal services, initiating or expanding waiting lists for meals, reducing the number of meals or delivery days or even closing their doors altogether.\"\nShe's also worried about the future of the OAA.\n\"We are deeply disappointed that the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act (OAA) has not yet happened despite it lapsing several months ago,\" Franklin said.\n\"This serves as a stark reminder that the needs of our nation's older adults do not receive the attention they deserve. It is crucial to not only reauthorize the OAA but also to increase funding for this vital legislation,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland lawmakers target tranquilizers behind overdose deaths\n\n March 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: PAUL KIEFER Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 968\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — A bipartisan group of lawmakers is attempting to push Maryland's Department of Health to restrict the distribution of two veterinary tranquilizers that play a growing role in the state's overdose crisis.The agency has thus far resisted pressure to add the tranquilizers to the state's list of scheduled drugs — unlike neighboring Delaware and Pennsylvania, where officials have recently scheduled the more common of the two drugs. Both MDH and some drug-user outreach groups argue the state should avoid taking steps that might prompt the illicit drug market to find new, untested substitutes.\nIn the eyes of some Maryland Republicans, however, MDH's reluctance is a concession to drug dealers. \"Their failure to act has cost lives,\" said Sen. William Folden, a Republican representing Frederick County.\nXylazine, the better-known of the two tranquilizers, has become a staple of the mid-Atlantic's illicit drug supply. According to data from the state's Office of Overdose Response, more than a quarter of the roughly 2,500 Marylanders who died from fatal overdoses in 2021 had xylazine in their system, compared to roughly 17 percent just a year earlier.\nLaw enforcement first detected the other tranquilizer, medetomidine, in a Maryland drug sample in 2022. In the last quarter of 2024, MDH testing detected medetomidine in just over 8 percent of samples collected.\nMany of Maryland's neighbors have reacted to these regional shifts by adding xylazine to their lists of scheduled substances. Scheduled drugs are subject to stricter distribution rules, creating hurdles for those diverting the drugs into the black market. Xylazine and medetomidine aren't classified as controlled substances under federal law. Maryland law delegates that authority to schedule drugs at the state level to MDH.\nMDH spokesperson Chase Cook told Capital News Service that, after reviewing the outcomes of scheduling xylazine in neighboring states, his agency determined that the restrictions could do more harm than good.\n\"Both Pennsylvania and Delaware scheduled xylazine through temporary orders and both are now seeing increases in opioid overdoses with medetomidine,\" he said. \"This follows the iron law of prohibition where, even with alcohol prohibition, more potent substitutes replace the prohibited substance in the illicit supply. Pennsylvania and Delaware are seeing this less than a year after scheduling xylazine.\"\nThough the proliferation of xylazine in Maryland began before the COVID-19 pandemic, this year marks the first time state lawmakers have attempted to restrict access to the drug.\nXylazine became a nearly unavoidable feature of the illicit drug supply during the pandemic, leaving drug users and healthcare providers alike scrambling to adapt. Unsuspecting users frequently lose consciousness, slumping over and losing circulation in their extremities. Frequent xylazine users often develop open sores on their limbs, increasing their risk of infection and amputation.\nWhile both xylazine and medetomidine often appear in powders and counterfeit pills in combination with fentanyl, the tranquilizers — commonly known as 'tranq' — aren't opioids. That means common opioid overdose-reversal drugs like naloxone can't treat a xylazine or medetomidine overdose, although public health agencies still advise administering naloxone to people displaying overdose symptoms as a precaution.\nSarah Laurel, founder and executive director of the Philadelphia harm reduction nonprofit Savage Sisters Recovery, has more experience than most with the grim consequences of xylazine's rise.\nBut Laurel is also a firm opponent of scheduling the drug.\n\"It incentivizes the criminal drug market to find more potent, potentially dangerous substances, and then we have to test the drug supply, find out what those substances are and what the negative consequences to users could potentially be,\" she told CNS.\nLike MDH, Laurel argues that the aftermath of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's decision to schedule xylazine at the state level in 2023 demonstrated the risks involved in playing cat-and-mouse with new street drugs.\n\"Now we see the introduction of new things such as very high amounts of lidocaine and tetracaine,\" she said.\nLaurel says her organization now encounters anesthetics like lidocaine when testing street drug vials from Philadelphia more frequently than it encounters xylazine or fentanyl. Samples containing medetomidine are also increasingly common. Once again, her team is rushing to catch up.\nBut Maryland lawmakers pushing to regulate xylazine and medetomidine argue the General Assembly is morally obligated to limit access to the drugs by whatever means possible.\nHouse Minority Whip Jesse Pippy, a Republican representing Frederick County, is the House sponsor of a bill intended to draw lawmakers' attention to the subject. While Frederick County isn't the epicenter of the state's overdose crisis, the county delegation's ties to law enforcement are a frequent source of legislative inspiration.\nThe bill would set civil fines for drug distributors who provide xylazine or medetomidine to customers who can't prove that the drugs are for legitimate veterinary uses — namely as a sedative for livestock. Revenues collected from those civil penalties would be spent on the state's overdose prevention programs.\n\"This is a midway step to where we can say, 'Look, you cannot, other than for veterinary purposes, be giving this stuff out right now,'\" he told fellow lawmakers. For now, he added, \"there are probably a million different ways to get it out on the street legally.\"\nFolden, the sponsor of a parallel bill in the state Senate and an officer with the Frederick Police Department, underscored that the proposed penalties wouldn't involve jail time. \"It is important to emphasize that this bill only creates civil penalties, not criminal,\" he said. \"You want to make them criminal [penalties]? I'm not going to fight that.\"\nThe proposals have the backing of the state attorney general's office and faced no vocal opposition in committee hearings. The American Veterinary Medical Association has previously supported scheduling xylazine at the federal level, though the association's Maryland branch did not immediately respond to inquiries about its position on the legislation before the General Assembly.\nFolden and other backers maintain that they would prefer to see MDH schedule xylazine and medetomidine. So far, the agency has not testified on this year's proposals. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Trump administration sets stage for new pandemic\n\n March 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 666\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n From new avian or bird flu outbreaks on the Eastern Shore to a new Ebola outbreak in Uganda, we need the World Health Organization to help mitigate pandemics and inform the world. We also need the medical detectives of the U.S. Agency for International Development to travel to an Ebola outbreak to do contact tracing to limit the exposure to the surrounding community and the world to this and other deadly diseases.None of this is possible today, as president Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from the WHO and virtually closed down the USAID.\nPulling out of the WHO creates a national security threat. For more than 75 years we have relied on it to protect us. It takes a year to withdraw, but many argue that China will probably try to step in and take it over. It is not clear if the president can withdraw from the WHO without congressional approval.\nPresident Trump also paused the transfer of U.S. funds to the WHO. The U.S. is the largest donor, contributing about 18% of its total funding. The U.S. membership fee of $264 million for year 2024/2025 will not be paid. This violates U.S. law and will certainly be challenged in court.\nIn addition to the fees, there are voluntary contributions from foundations and other U.S. sources earmarked by the donors for specific purposes such as HIV and AIDS. President George W. Bush's successful PEPFAR progam dating back to 2003 has saved 26 million adults from dying of AIDS, mainly in subSaharan Africa, and 8 million babies from being born with HIV.\nThe funding has been frozen until March 25. This is the largest global health program dedicated to a single disease.\nPolio, tuberculosis and malaria are still on the eradication list, and new viruses such as the Marburg virus, a deadly cousin of Ebola, and mpox have been declared public health emergencies in Africa. With a continuous stream of visitors to and from Africa, it seems impossible to keep any outbreak from not spreading. Viruses do not respect international borders.\nSince early January, four flocks of chickens on Maryland's Eastern Shore have tested positive for the avian or bird flu virus. These outbreaks can severely affect Maryland's important poultry industry. Avian flu is often spread by wild birds, so we should not encourage such birds to feed here. Wild, infected birds have been found in Caroline County.\nThe bird flu in Maryland is of the H5N1 type. In California a new type has been found called the H5N9. One girl in Canada died from the bird flu and 67 farmworkers, that we know of, have been infected around the U.S.\nBird flu has been found in cows milk in California. KFF Health News has just published a report that discusses how 875 herds of cows across 16 states have tested positive for bird flu. This infection in herds of cows started about a year ago, and the Department of Agriculture has been slow to react. It announced in December 2024 its intention to test milk for bird flu nationwide. The virus dries out milk production in dairy cows and the virus now spreads between cows.\nWe have seen a drop of about 20% in milk production since 2023. Veterinarians are trying to save the cows. Cow hands are being infected with the H5N1 virus but not tested for the virus, partly because the tests are not readily available and partly because the cow hands may be undocumented. A few mutations of the virus could mean that it could be spread between humans. The H5N1 virus can also spread to cats. One such death was reported in Anne Arundel County.\nIn all of the U.S. about 100 million egg-laying birds were culled since the bird flu started in 2022. No wonder eggs now cost around $5 per dozen on the Eastern Shore or cannot be found on the shelves. Considering the bird virus in milk scare and the 20% reduction in milk produced, the price of a gallon of milk is also expected to rise. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Doctors, nurses reflect on COVID-19 pandemic five years later\n\n March 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 774\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — For the first year and a half of the COVID-19 pandemic, University of Maryland Shore Regional Health infectious disease specialist Dr. Rosa Mateo took care of just about every COVID-19 patient brought to the Shore Medical Center at Easton.\"I lived in the hospital,\" said Mateo, who is also Shore Regional Health's medical director for infection prevention and control.\nMateo remembers working long hours, sitting in meetings to coordinate efforts and the constant communication as new information about the virus necessitated changes in practice. No one in the hospital had time to rest, she said.\n\"Physicians are trained to be on call all the time and not sleep,\" she said, laughing. \"But I would lie if I said that I didn't feel burned out.\"\nAs the only infectious disease specialist within Shore Regional Health, Mateo became the person at the hospital everyone was looking to for guidance. Suddenly everyone knew her name, she said.\nMateo said she always tried to look calm for patients and staff.\n\"Because how do I ask them to keep doing it if I can't do it?\" she asked.\nMateo said the nurses at the hospital in Easton were working even more hours than she was. She said they stepped up and \"learned to do everything.\"\nAnd it wasn't just nurses.\nDr. Peyman Otmishi, a pulmonologist, critical care specialist and president of medical staff with Shore Regional Health, said the pandemic affected everyone in the health care industry, from first responders to custodians.\n\"Work was treacherous,\" he said.\nFor Jess Caraker and Emma Zonetti, who were clinical coordinators in the intensive care and telemetry units, respectively, at the hospital in Easton, the pandemic meant they spent a lot more time on the floor helping and making sure their nurses had everything they needed to take care of patients.\nZonetti said she was often pulled where she was needed.\n\"And pulled to the ICU a lot too because I worked (the) night shift where there were minimal resources,\" she said.\nZonetti said the experience was stressful and intimidating.\n\"But I knew as a senior staff member that I needed to step up and be a role model for my unit and other members of the organization that were here to take care of our patients and do the best possible,\" she said.\nWith young children at home, both Zonetti and Caraker made decisions during the pandemic to separate from their families in order to protect them. For Zonetti, an incident that resulted in her exposure to the virus led her to separate from her family — including her 4-month-old — for two weeks.\nFor Caraker, after taking care of her first COVID-19 patient, she and her husband made the decision that she would temporarily live away from him and their three kids. This lasted for the first three months of the pandemic, she said.\n\"That was quite honestly the hardest thing I've ever done,\" she said.\nAlthough Shore Regional Health respiratory therapist Lisa Pierson had to remain distant from her family, her team at the hospital became her family. They checked in on each other, she said.\n\"We would look at each other walking down the hall and say, 'Are you OK? How are you doing?'\" Pierson recalled.\nPierson has noticed health care workers are still tired since the pandemic. She said there hasn't been any real downtime over the last five years.\n\"After COVID, we all needed a tropical vacation,\" she said.\nCurrently, the nation is experiencing a nursing shortage. According to the Maryland Hospital Association and GlobalData, which released projections in June 2022, the state is expected to meet just 80% of its demand for nurses by 2035.\nMateo said there was a nursing shortage before the COVID-19 pandemic and the pandemic exacerbated it.\n\"It was was just not a good combination,\" she said.\nOn the other side of the coin, Mateo considers telemedicine to be one good thing that has come out of the pandemic.\n\"And it is, I think, one of the best things that could have happened because even now you have patients in the nursing home that they cannot come to me because of transportation issues,\" she said. \"And I just put them through telemedicine. So for me, now there is no reason why I could not see a patient.\"\nMateo said that since the COVID-19 pandemic, there are still not many infectious disease specialists in hospitals. She attributes this to the many years of training it takes to become an infectious disease specialist.\n\"There are not a lot of people that go into infectious diseases, unfortunately,\" she said. \"During the pandemic, we suddenly became big.\"\nEven still, Mateo remains the only infectious disease specialist covering five counties in the Shore Regional Health system.\n\"And it's the same everywhere you go,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "From crisis to change: COVID-19’s enduring mark on the Eastern Shore\n\n March 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STAFF REPORT | Section: Local News \n \n 642\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic reached the Eastern Shore, its impact lingers in ways both visible and unseen. The empty streets, masked faces, and social distancing markers have faded, but the profound shifts in health care, worship, business and daily life remain.Emma Zonetti never expected the pandemic to reach her tight-knit community.\n\"I remember being in church, actually. My husband's mom told me that this was happening,\" said Zonetti, now a senior clinical nurse with University of Maryland Shore Regional Health. \"And I went, 'Oh, it's nothing to worry about. It's just another virus.' And then quickly did we learn that it was way more than that.\"\nZonetti, who was a clinical coordinator in the telemetry unit at the Shore Medical Center at Easton during the height of the crisis, recalled the stark reality that unfolded as cases surged.\n\"It certainly impacted us far larger than I could ever anticipate,\" she said.\nLate in January 2020, hospitals began screening for the virus as patients arrived in emergency rooms.\nBy March, State Superintendent of Schools Dr. Karen Salmon ordered a closure of schools — a temporary order that extended well into 2021, much longer than anyone anticipated.\nBeaches and boardwalks closed. And by April, the number of positive cases surged and mask orders ensued.\nCOMMUNITY BLINDSIDEDThe first confirmed case of COVID-19 on the Eastern Shore was reported in Talbot County on March 16, 2020. Since then, there have been 8,056 confirmed cases in the county and more than 40,000 across the Mid-Shore. The virus claimed the lives of 592 Mid-Shore residents.\nFor religious communities, the impact was swift and disruptive. Pastor Doug Morley of Greater Impact Church in Greensboro said the closure of worship spaces came at a critical time for his newly merged congregation.\n\"Building on the momentum of coming together for greater Kingdom impact in 2019 and gearing up for what would potentially be one of our highest attended worship experiences on Easter Sunday (April 12, 2020), we were definitely blindsided by the mandated closure of all religious gatherings,\" Morley said.\nChurch leaders scrambled to adapt, turning to Facebook Live for virtual worship and launching a \"drive-in\" service using a tractor-trailer bed as a stage and an FM transmitter to broadcast services to parked cars.\n\"It forced us to think outside the four walls of the church,\" Morley said. \"That shift in approach has remained with us.\"\nEven after indoor services resumed, Morley noted, worship attendance has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. While some members embraced online services, others simply fell out of the habit.\nLASTING LEGACYWhen Maryland lifted its COVID-19 state of emergency on July 1, 2021, many expected a swift return to normalcy. In some ways, that happened — travel resumed, restaurants filled and hugs replaced distanced greetings. But the pandemic left lasting imprints on the Eastern Shore.\nTelehealth became commonplace. Remote work grew. Businesses closed, moved or downsized. Schools and universities permanently integrated virtual options. Many delayed retirement. Awareness of mental health surged as loneliness and isolation persisted.\nThe pandemic reshaped our priorities, forcing people to rethink work, education and social connection. Some changes were temporary, but others — like digital access and hybrid work models — are likely here to stay.\nWhile it has taken a few years to get back to some semblance of normalcy, the impact of COVID-19 upon regular worship attendance is still evident.\n\"We have not returned to pre-pandemic numbers, and we still have individuals and families who choose to worship online rather than in-person,\" Morely said. \"A few who once attended regularly have gotten out of the habit and find it difficult to return on a consistent basis.\"\nAs the Eastern Shore reflects on the past five years, the region has found resilience in adversity. Communities innovated, businesses adapted and individuals discovered new ways to connect. The pandemic may have left its mark, but so, too, did the spirit of perseverance that defines the Shore. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Long COVID derails boy's life for three years\n\n March 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 783\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Keeping good grades — much less straight As — your freshman year of high school is an accomplishment for anyone.But when it comes to 15-year-old Dylan Smith, those good grades are a testament to Smith's perseverance.\nFor about three years, Dylan was too sick to attend school. After getting COVID-19 in January 2022, Smith developed long COVID.\nAt 12 years old, Dylan lost the ability to do anything for himself. Over time, he could no longer eat without a feeding tube or walk. He developed non-epileptic seizures, caused by trauma and pain.\n\"My pain got worse every day,\" he said. \"It kind of felt like my bones were breaking every second.\"\nThere were two months where he stopped talking.\n\"And it's not that he didn't want to talk,\" said his mom, Stacey Smith. \"He physically couldn't.\"\nAs his physical pain grew, Dylan struggled with his mental health. He said he was in a \"dark place.\"\n\"I'd felt so bad for my sickness, and I'd felt like I'd taken time away from my parents,\" he said. \"I kind of felt like it was my fault.\"\nStacey Smith said her son would have violent rages and would be in so much pain that his brain would \"disassociate from his body.\"\n\"There were times when he didn't want to live anymore,\" she said, adding that she and her husband, Michael Smith, weren't aware of those thoughts until later. \"But that was where his mindset was.\"\nInitially having COVID-19 for two weeks in 2022, Dylan started to feel better. But a few weeks later, he began getting cold symptoms that got progressively worse.\nAt first, doctors thought it might be pneumonia. But as Smith's symptoms continued, doctors started to consider the possibility that it was long COVID.\n\"The idea of long COVID was so new at that point that they didn't know if it could be (long COVID) or it was just a possibility since nothing else was working,\" Dylan said.\nWhen they went to a COVID clinic in Baltimore that June, the doctors knew it was long COVID, Stacey Smith said.\nThe Smith family tried everything to get Dylan back in good health, from medication to a monthlong rehabilitation program to natural supplements.\n\"And nothing worked,\" Stacey Smith said.\nAfter the rehabilitation program, Dylan was in an even worse state than when he entered the program, his mom said.\n\"It was just a feeling of hopelessness,\" said Michael Smith, Dylan's father. \"You just keep going from what seems to be the best idea to the next idea when that one's not the right one.\"\nUniversity of Maryland Shore Regional Health infectious disease specialist Dr. Rosa Mateo remembers patients coming to her at the beginning of the pandemic who had recently had COVID-19 and were presenting symptoms of cough, fatigue and brain fog. At the time, doctors didn't know it was long COVID.\n\"Of course this is five years ago,\" she said. \"We know more. But we don't know enough.\"\nIt wasn't until the Smiths traveled to the Spero Clinic in Arkansas for treatment last June that Dylan was able to get better. Stacey Smith said the clinic, which focuses on stimulating the vagus nerve to reset the nervous system, offers a variety of therapies that are not \"typical Western medicine.\"\nThe Smiths spent four months at the clinic. During a lunch break to Chick-fil-A their eighth week there, Dylan Smith gained back his ability to move his torso and chest. A minute later, while they were in the drive-thru, he was able to move his legs, he said.\n\"I said, 'Well, wait a minute, if I can move everything, why not just try and stand up?'\" he remembered asking. \"So I stood up in the van in the Chick-fil-A parking lot.\"\nStacey Smith remembers screaming out of excitement seeing her son walk again.\nWhen Dylan returned from the clinic in October in good health, it was straight to the books.\n\"Once I got better and we came home from Arkansas, I really did have to grind out school those couple months before getting back to really understand everything because I had been gone for three years,\" he said, adding that he had help from a retired teacher. \"It was mainly math. I really did (learn) three years of math in like three months.\"\nJan. 27 was Dylan Smith's first day back at school. Since going back to school, he's maintained good grades. Some of his favorite classes are English and world history.\nAs he sets his sights on the future, Dylan said he looks forward to taking drivers education this summer and playing on his school's soccer team next year.\nFor others experiencing long COVID, he advised they should not give up hope, even when things feel hopeless.\n\"There is a life worth living,\" he said. \"You will gain that life back.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Every dollar raised is leveraged to make $26 dollars of research funding and every dollar makes a difference, he said.\nReflecting on his first attempt last year, Catan noted even an avid cyclist with some distance riding experience, the initial thought of cycling across New York State seemed like a near insurmountable challenge, he said.\nBut as new and innovative treatments and cutting-edge research are being discovered through the funding raised by the ride, he knew the ride was the perfect opportunity to \"help shape the future of cancer research and treatment while honoring everyone affected by cancer, \" he said.\nTo prepare for such a long distance, Catan employs \"chunking\" or breaking riding into manageable segments between rest stops, 16 to 24 miles, he said.\n\"By focusing on these smaller goals, the journey felt less daunting,\" Catan said.\n\"Experienced cyclists know that long-distance riding is as much about mental fortitude as physical strength. It's crucial to maintain the right mindset, remember to hydrate, take in nutrition, manage gear, stay aware of those around you, and adapt to the terrain,\" he said.\nNow heading into his second trek, Catan feels more prepared in his training regiments and is more confident in his abilities as a cyclist.\nFor Catan, the Empire State Ride is as much about the journey as the destination, with new sites and challenges to experience as well as camaraderie to forge with fellow riders in addition to the end goal of fundraising.\nAs Catan prepares for his monumental week-long ride, he invites everyone to visit his fundraising page to learn more about his personal connection to cancer and join in supporting the noble cause.\n\"Together, we can pedal for a cause, advancing cancer research, and bringing hope to those who need it most, he said.\nCatan's official fund raising page is available at https://bit.ly/4ieOmNq.\nMore information about the Empire State Ride can be found at https://empirestateride.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Senior care leaders warn cuts could be ‘drastic’ for Talbot County seniors\n\n March 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 446\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Senior care experts warned the Talbot County Council Tuesday that state cuts could impact senior services not only in fiscal year 2026, but in the final quarter of the current fiscal year as well.Carrie Ottey, director of senior services for the Talbot County Health Department, said initial proposals from the state put $2.5 million in funding for senior care programs statewide at risk. After the Maryland Department of Aging calculated how those may be allocated to counties, Talbot faced the potential of losing $24,000 in funding this year, Ottey noted.\n\"Since we're already pretty much spent through quarter three, that would be really drastic cuts in quarter four of this year,\" Ottey said. \" … We'd have to cut off almost all of our services to our seniors in the last quarter of this year if these cuts were to go through.\"\nOttey said that state legislators are pushing for a reduction in total cuts, potentially from the $2.5 million mark to around $900,000. The trimming comes as the state is faced with an over $3 billion deficit.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher said senior care is the \"wrong place to find those savings.\"\nCouncil member Lynn Mielke denounced the potential cuts and noted Talbot County's higher-than-average age makes such funding even more crucial.\nAccording to census data, people 65-and-over accounts for 30% of Talbot County's total population. The county's average age was 50.9 in 2023 and has slightly increased each year since 2020. The national average is just under 39 years old.\n\"I think it's disgraceful what this state has done in this regard, and find it to be really ageist,\" Mielke said.\n\"Hopefully the state legislature will wake up and do the right thing by its senior citizens, who have supported them all these years,\" she later added.\nOttey said the county's senior care program has served 214 clients this year already, up from 207 last year. \"People are needing us now more than ever,\" she said.\nJennifer Marchi, vice chair of Talbot County's commission on aging, said depending on how the cuts shake out, they may return to the council at a future date with a request for up to $24,000 in contingency funding.\nTuesday, the County Council voted 4-0 to write a letter of support for senior care program funding. Council members thanked Ottey and Marchi, along with senior care leaders and workers in attendance, for their work.\n\"You've done a fabulous job at providing services,\" Mielke said.\n\"And we also know that there are senior homeless issues that are going to have to be addressed,\" she continued. \"And how are they going to be addressed if they cut back our funding for what we're already providing? It's a tragic situation.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

While the virus disrupted lives, it also accelerated innovations and exposed critical gaps in infrastructure, healthcare and social support systems.\nThe digital divide, long a silent challenge for rural communities, suddenly became a lifeline during lockdowns. Broadband expansion, once a slow-moving initiative, gained momentum as remote work, telehealth and online education became necessities rather than conveniences.\nMental health emerged as another critical frontier. The isolation, uncertainty and collective trauma of the pandemic laid bare the state of community mental wellness.\nThe federal government's response came in the form of the American Rescue Plan Act, a massive injection of funds designed to support communities struggling in the pandemic's wake. These funds became a lifeline for local governments, schools and healthcare systems, offering a temporary reprieve and an opportunity for strategic reinvestment.\nThe pandemic forced communities to reimagine infrastructure, healthcare delivery, education and social connectivity. Each challenge became an opportunity for innovation, each obstacle a chance to rebuild more resiliently.\nIn this section, we'll explore these lasting impacts — how broadband expansion bridged critical access gaps, how mental health challenges surfaced and began to be addressed, and how ARPA funds were deployed to support communities during their most vulnerable moment. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "COVID changed the way people view mental health\n\n March 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 689\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Before COVID-19, mental health might have been the least of many peoples priorities for people living on the Eastern Shore. COVID helped bring more awareness to a topic that needed to be more focused on, experts say.\"So I think what COVID did was it brought to light that we all experience mental health symptoms,\" said For All Seasons President and CEO Beth Anne Dorman.\nOn March 13, 2020, the first Trump Administration declared a nationwide emergency. The world stopped for what many thought would only be two weeks. It turned out to be much longer.\nAt schools, some seniors didn't get the chance to walk the stage or have their senior prom, which caused mental health officials in schools to be proactive on making sure students were in good spirits.\n\"In that first early wave, we did not have behavioral health providers working for us at Choptank,\" said Chrissy Bartz, PA-C director of Community Based Programs at Choptank Community Health System.\n\"The therapists that were already working in the schools, they connected with those students at home as soon as they could. Fortunately with COVID came virtual and telehealth opportunities that we had never seen before in care.\"\nStudents experienced many different mental health problems. Some students were forced to be at home every day in situations that were unhealthy. Some lost the fresh meals they received at school.\nMental health officials were forced to be proactive in student care outside of school.\n\"We made really conscious efforts to reach out to students that we had been seeing in the schools because for a lot of them, we're the only resource that they have,\" Bartz said.\nWhen students started to return to school, mental health officials discovered students were having a hard time getting reacquainted with daily routines and interacting with other students.\n\"I think one of the things that happened right away when we got back into schools, we started to identify some of the behaviors that came with them feeling socially isolated or not having normal routines,\" Bartz said. \"We had a lot of kids come back really anxious because they hadn't been in a setting like this before. They had been out of it and now needed to reacclimatized themselves.\"\nFor adults, the shutdown meant multiple different things. According to Dorman, some patients experienced different trauma and needed more care than others. That's why staying open was a priority for For All Seasons, she said.\n\"We knew that mental health was not an option to shut down,\" Dorman said. \"We are very much a part of the first responder healthcare line. Our major pieces were how do we keep things like the rape crisis center still moving? How do we make sure that we never closed fully? We had 25-30% of our staff in person all the time.\"\n\"... Loneliness, grief, anxiety, depression, were all up,\" Doorman said. \"I think the impact was heavy on families when the time started ticking. Our brains are not programmed for unknowns. Our brains are programmed for beginnings and ends. COVID brought a lot of uncertainty.\"\nAccording to Dorman, adults struggled adapting to regular daily routines as restrictions began to lift.\nThe numbers for adults seeking mental health services continued to rise because now people were aware of some mental health issues they had not been before, Dorman said.\n\"What we saw was that there were for the first time maybe folks were starting to recognize that they were struggling,\" she said. \"That as they're starting to put one foot back in front of the other, maybe they were feeling more anxiety than they'd ever felt before because now they had to step out of their home which had been comfortable in this time.\"\nAccording to Dorman, COVID showed that people all experience mental health in a different way.\n\"What I think COVID did was it helped us view connection differently,\" she said. \"It helped us to be able to bring language to some of the things that we were all experiencing. I think in some terms it talks about like leveling the playing field for mental health. Leveling the playing field in a way that we had language to put to what people were feeling.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

To free up money in the household so that they don't have to spend all of their money on food.\"\nMidShore Meals til Monday is a nonprofit that provides food for food-insecure children and families in Dorchester County. The organization provides students with bags of food to take home on the weekends and offers food giveaways to families. The program also provides emergency food to people in need via appointment.\nAllen said providing food to families in the community allows those families to put $20 or $40 dollars toward other necessities, like paying bills or getting new clothes for their children.\n\"Whatever else they need,\" Allen said. \"It's just freeing up some money in that household so that they can provide the other things that they need.\"\nThe ribbon-cutting with the Dorchester Chamber of Commerce celebrated Meals til Monday's new digs on Race Street, which the nonprofit moved into at the end of August, as well as its new refrigerated truck.\nMeals til Monday Founder Leslie Bishop said the new truck will allow the nonprofit to expand it's mission to bring perishable food to children and families in need.\nLast summer, Preston Automotive Group loaned the nonprofit a truck to provide summer meals to children in partnership with Dorchester County Public Schools and Caroline County Public Schools. Allen said with their very own truck this year — which was purchased using grants from a variety of organizations, including Preston Automotive Group — the organization will be able to continue that service this summer.\nDuring the ribbon-cutting event, community members shared support and hopes for the continued growth of the nonprofit.\n\"I just think it's terrific and hope it will continue for many years,\" Dorchester County Register of Wills Terry Wheatley said.\nIn her speech, Bishop talked about the growth of Meals til Monday so far. She shared how she started Meals til Monday out of her kitchen eight years ago.\nAt that time, the nonprofit was packing bags for 25 Vienna Elementary School students. \"Now it's 1,000 bags a week going home to hungry kids in Dorchester County Public Schools,\" she said.\nMeals til Monday volunteer Merrill Schuetz remembers helping to pack about 150 meal bags per week at the Judy Center about seven years ago. When she started volunteering, the nonprofit wasn't yet offering the food giveaways to families.\n\"So that has expanded exponentially,\" she said.\nSchuetz finds the organization's growth exciting. Unlike when she started volunteering, the program now has many organizations that come in to volunteer, she said.\n\"The word is out there now, and I think it's so refreshing to know that there are so many people that want to help, that are interested in donating their time and their energy for this type of program,\" she said. \"It's exciting.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A steady stream of cars pulled up at the Food Bank's Glasgow warehouse to drop off food donations that were then unloaded by legislators and other volunteers.\nInside, 25 volunteers helped sort and pack food.\n\"Tonight has been so heartwarming to just stand here and watch all the legislators that have come out to support, and all the people that are coming with food,\" Kanefsky said.\nFood banks across the country were left reeling last week when the Trump administration abruptly paused $500 million in funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Emergency Food Assistance Program.\nFor the Food Bank of Delaware, from April to June alone, the canceled shipments equate to 750,000 pounds of food or 900,000 meals that would have directly benefited residents across the state.\nState Rep. Eric Morrison, who has been a regular Food Bank volunteer for 20 years, organized Tuesday's food drive.\n\"When I learned that they are going to be losing about 50 percent of their food, everybody felt frustrated and I thought I have to do something. Somebody has to do something,\" Morrison said. \"Tonight, we can bring in a lot of food, but we can also bring in awareness, which is really important.\"\nOne in seven Delawareans, including one in five children, are food insecure, he added.\n\"I think some people may have certain prejudices or misconceptions about who uses the Food Bank, but we're talking about your grandparents, your children, your next door neighbor with a disability. It's a lot of people,\" he said.\nMorrison added that in Dover, there are ongoing discussions about how much the state will have to step in to make up for lost funding to the Food Bank and other programs affected by federal cuts.\n\"It's very hard right now, because with the federal administration, everything is just very day-by-day,\" he said. \"Every day, we're waking up to something new.\"\nResidents can visit fbd.org to learn how they can help the Food Bank.\n\"We're facing some interesting times, and we've all got to take care of each other,\" Morrison said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Willow was the inspiration for Emma. However, after a certain age, Queen creates a new life for Emma, which she hopes will be Willow's future.\nEmma finds her own success in school and the world in spite of her struggles. Queen said Willow is starting down that same path.\n\"She's definitely learning,\" Queen said of her daughter who is now obsessed with a velcro-styled matching game that has taught her colors, letters and numbers. \"She will be able to learn things as she gets older.\"\nWhat Queen doesn't know yet --but hopes for — is how independent Willow could become. So she wrote out those hopes and dreams through Emma.\n\"My big worry for her is not being able to take care of herself,\" she said. It's the same for many parents of autistic children in Cecil County.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 36 children in the United States is diagnosed as autistic. Maryland's Department of Health reports some 47% of 8-year-old children in the state have been diagnosed.\nApril is Autism Awareness Month. It's a neurological disorder that affects how children learn and interact with the world. It manifests itself differently in each child. With recent changes in how autism is diagnosed it has led to some adults now learning they are autistic.\nMany autistic children display repetitive movements. They expect the world to be the same around them every day and any change to that schedule causes them to be afraid or even angry.\nQueen said those who read her book will perhaps get a better understanding and be less judgmental and more empathetic.\n\"Maybe people will be a little more open to the possibility that there's something different, not wrong with that child,\" she said, adding, \"That it's not a typical temper tantrum.\"\nQueen suggests people learn about the disorder especially if there is someone in your family or circle of friends that is affected.\n\"If you don't know how to interact ask, research, learn,\" she said.\nBeyond the Silence is available on Amazon in paperback and ebook formats. Queen is looking forward to holding book signing events while, at the same time, working on her next book.\n\"I'm hosting a giveaway through Facebook,\" she said. \"I'm giving away four copies.\"\nMeanwhile, \"Willow's Walk For Autism\" is set for April 19 at Meadow Park in Elkton from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. All proceeds will benefit Thomson Estates Elementary School.\nShe can be reached through email at: haleyqueen64@gmail.com \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Youth mental health initiatives see minimal cuts\n\n April 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SASHA ALLEN Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 771\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Maryland mental health advocates and providers are relieved coming out of this year's legislative session, where state lawmakers decided against a drastic cut in funding to the state's year-old, big-money program aimed at improving the mental health of its young people.The Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports, created under the state's ambitious and expensive education reform plan called the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, will receive $70 million from the state's fiscal year 2026 budget to award mental health providers in its second round of grants. That's up from the $40 million Gov. Wes Moore originally suggested spending.\nBut with some money left over from funding this past fiscal year, the consortium plans to allocate closer to $98 million in grants. Legislators previously allocated $119.7 million over two years to set up the consortium and issued its first $111 million of grants in February 2024.\nPartly as a result of those grants, more than 80% of Maryland public schools now have some sort of mental health service available for students. And mental health advocates said the additional funding means the state's effort will continue to reach a large percentage of the state's children.\n\"This is a critical investment that's ensuring students in every corner of our state have the resources and support necessary to learn and thrive,\" said Dan Martin, senior director of public policy at the Mental Health Association of Maryland. \"We couldn't be happier.\"\nThe consortium provides mental health funding for dozens of services, including in-school counseling, substance abuse treatment and peer support groups for families and students.\nBut at the beginning of this year's difficult legislative session where the General Assembly would have to fill a $3 billion budget hole, Moore proposed a spending plan that allocated only $40 million to the youth mental health effort — even though he once proposed the program should receive $130 million for fiscal year 2026.\nThe General Assembly, however, passed a bill on the last day of the legislative session that added $30 million to the youth mental health budget on top of what Moore had proposed, leaving many relieved for the future of the program.\nSen. Katie Fry Hester, a Democrat representing Montgomery and Howard counties, said this decision was crucial for the future of the consortium and the youth mental health programs it funds.\n\"I think when you're trying to address the mental health needs of the entire state, you can't really do it piecemeal,\" Hester said.\nIf funding for the consortium had been limited to the amount suggested in Moore's budget, \"you would have to redo the entire program,\" Hester added.\nThe consortium's grant allocations are designed around a \"hub and spoke\" model that aims to include community organizations in the program. The hubs, or organizations already established in Maryland's counties, including churches and community centers, help promote and run the services of the spokes, or mental health programs. Both are funded through consortium grants.\n\"The hub and spoke model would not have worked at $40 million,\" Hester said.\nWhile the community organizations are in different stages of operation in each county, Mark Luckner, executive director of the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission, said the funding provided will allow for the program to move closer to full implementation this upcoming year.\nLuckner said a good number of active service providers have applied for the second round of funding, which the consortium is expected to issue by June 30.\nThe initial 127 grants were projected to serve about 150,000 people, \"and they're well on their way to do that globally,\" Luckner said at Thursday's consortium meeting.\nLuckner said he believes within two years, as many as 22 of the state's 24 jurisdictions will either have a fully operational or almost fully operational youth mental health hub.\n\"We should just take a moment and celebrate that accomplishment that the consortium is achieving,\" Luckner said.\nService providers agree. Jan Guszynski is the project manager for Prosper, an app that, under Uneo Health, provides mental health check ins-for adolescents. The app received $1.4 million grants to provide services in Prince George's, Frederick and Calvert counties.\nBefore the legislation was passed confirming $70 million in consortium funding for fiscal year 2026, Guszynski said she was worried for the future of not only mental health services but for the students using them.\n\"I really, really hope that we do not see these resources shuttered or too heavily impacted as time goes on,\" Guszynski said. \"Because it's hugely important.\"\nThose resources won't likely get shuttered or too heavily impacted if the General Assembly sticks with the outline it set in the budget it just passed, which projects $100 million in youth mental health funding in fiscal year 2027 and $100 million annually after that. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But Fahmi isn't looking for a complete overhaul.\n\"If it's not broken, I'm not going to fix it,\" he said.\nFahmi, formerly the department's deputy medical health officer, will oversee public health initiatives and community programs in his new role. He says his early goals are to close gaps in areas such as senior services and children's vision offerings.\nTalbot County's average age was 50.9 in 2023 and has slightly increased each year since 2020, per census data, a trend Fahmi recognizes. The department is already working to address senior needs, he said. For instance, staff members team up with emergency responders to bring a mobile integrated health program and in-home health care to seniors who have repeated ER visits.\nCarrie Ottey, director of senior services, says Fahmi isn't just an intelligent and knowledgeable physician, but also a down to earth and invested member of the community.\n\"Dr. Fahmi's been really open to listening to some new ideas about how we can better serve the senior population, and especially those that are in the outlying rural areas,\" Ottey added.\nFahmi noted challenges Talbot County faces to provide quality health care, such as transportation and housing. \"Being in a rural area is sweet and sour,\" he said.\nA recent trip to Tilghman Island showed Fahmi that many areas are without reliable internet, which can serve as an additional barrier to health care for some.\n\"Even though it's challenging, it's exciting because it makes me think about solutions,\" Fahmi said.\nThe new health officer says the pandemic \"exposed weaknesses in the whole system.\"\nJosh Weber, the health department's public information officer, said health officials \"tend to go back into the shadows\" following periods such as the coronavirus pandemic, during which they were on the front lines. He and Fahmi hope the department can increase its community presence.\n\"Hopefully with Dr. Fahmi coming into play and creating more of a strategic plan going forward for the next three to 10 years, we want to be more visible consistently,\" Weber said. \"We want to make sure that we are embedded in this community, that everyone knows we are here to serve. Not just in times of crisis, but all the time.\"\nFor Fahmi, his goals of closing senior service gaps and building rapport with residents begin with the health department's employees. In just a handful of weeks on the job, Fahmi says he's noticed their selflessness and dedication to serving the public.\n\"I am so lucky,\" Fahmi said. \"Even if I imagine a group of people that I would handpick, I wouldn't come as close (to) the ones that I have currently in the health department.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "At Easton YMCA, community fights Parkinson's and builds a family\n\n April 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 738\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Two years ago, Roy Weedon was diagnosed with a severe form of Parkinson's, a progressive neurological disease that often causes tremors and slowed movement.Roy's wife, Zoulika, said the decline in his health was clear. But while there is no cure, the couple learned exercise is often recommended to prevent symptoms from accelerating.\nSo Roy, now 80, began taking exercise classes at the Easton YMCA dedicated for those with Parkinson's or related diseases. It's been a life-changer, his wife said, and not only for the health benefits.\n\"The fact that he's able to walk, to talk, to have a social life, to get dressed and all that kind of thing is important,\" Zoulika Weedon said.\nThe YMCA's exercise classes boost quality of life and level off physical and mental health declines for many seniors with Parkinson's. Zoulika Weedon said much of the credit goes to Wendy Palmer, whom she calls the \"driving force\" behind the classes and the community that's been built within them.\nPalmer, director of chronic disease and prevention programs at the YMCA of the Chesapeake, leads a group of over 60 people at the Easton YMCA in a five-day-a-week program. There are two days of Rock Steady Boxing classes, two days of cycling courses and one day in the water swimming.\nThe classes are neuroprotective, Palmer said, and help improve flexibility, agility, range of motion, strength and balance.\nAnd the group of people she trains with daily aren't patients, or simply participants. They're truly athletes, Palmer said.\n\"With a diagnosis that can be very scary and don't know your future, you need somebody that's going to say 'Let's do this together, you're not alone,' Palmer said. \"And that's what the Y always hopes to provide.\"\nLEVELING THE DECLINE\nMike Simpson has been in the Easton YMCA's Rock Steady Boxing program for three years. He has progressive supranuclear palsy, or PSP, a disease that shares some symptoms with Parkinson's.\nPSP has unique effects, such as eye movement challenges and backward falls. Simpson said since he began the YMCA classes, \"it's made a big difference\" in leveling off his health declines.\nWhile Simpson has a Parkinson's \"offshoot\" as he calls it, many of the Rock Steady boxers have direct Parkinson's diagnoses.\nAccording to the Parkinson's Foundation, nearly one million Americans have the disease, more than all other neurodegenerative diseases aside from Alzheimer's. That number is only expected to rise in the coming years, the foundation states.\nApril is Parkinson's Awareness Month, as nationwide and local organizations aim to raise awareness about the disease. Palmer and Rock Steady athletes were honored earlier this month by the Town of Easton with a proclamation.\nPalmer said when the YMCA of the Chesapeake picked up Rock Steady Boxing, local experts took notice.\n\"Neurologists were like, 'Wow this is really helping. We're going to refer more people to you,'\" Palmer recalled.\nPalmer describes the boxing movements as a dance, pushing participants to develop balance and pattern recognition. On a Thursday afternoon this month, Palmer pushed the group to give it their all, even during the workout's final minutes.\n\"What we tell our boxers is you can do anything,\" Palmer said. \"You can do anything for three minutes. That's a round, right?\"\nThe Parkinson's exercise program started in 2018 with just four athletes and the boxing classes but has quickly grown to include multiple activities and 175 participants across the YMCA of the Chesapeake.\nIn Easton, class athletes, coaches and volunteers are creating a family just as much as they're battling Parkinson's.\n'ALWAYS CONNECTED'\nSimpson said he often encourages others to join the Easton YMCA's Parkinson's group.\n\"It's fun, a good group of people to work with. Gives you something to do when you're retired,\" Simpson said.\nBetween group texts and monthly lunches at the Chili's in town, the Easton YMCA has cultivated a community of Parkinson's athletes and family members.\nWhen volunteers or residents with Parkinson's inquire about joining, Palmer tells them they're \"about to meet the best people.\" It's a welcoming and encouraging community, one Palmer said is \"always connected.\"\n\"It's a joy for me to be a part of this program. It has changed my life,\" Palmer said.\nAnd for the athletes, the classes are a rewarding but challenging venture. Palmer acknowledges that progressive decline is a part of Parkinson's disease, but she and the other coaches at the YMCA ensure pessimism doesn't take over.\n\"It's something that can be scary,\" Palmer said. \"But again, we're not here to say you can't do anything. We're going to find a way for you to do it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Diving into Maryland’s cannabis data\n\n April 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKAYLA ROBERTS Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 430\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Now that marijuana is legal in Maryland, some lesser-known effects of its use are coming to light. Since 2022, the Maryland Cannabis Administration has conducted an annual survey, the Maryland Medical Cannabis Patient Survey, to collect data on these adverse effects.According to the latest survey released last month, over 4,400 respondents met the criteria for cannabis use disorder, or CUD — with more than half being women.\n\"There's always a fine line between misuse and abuse. So when you get into the abuse, you run the risk of meeting criteria for cannabis use disorder,\" said Dr. Bernard Ravitz, an addiction medicine specialist.\nThe criteria for CUD, according to Ravitz, includes the inability to cut down or control use despite the effects of the drug causing interpersonal, physical or psychological problems. Another major criteria is a significant amount of time spent in getting, using or recovering from cannabis — which usually results in failing to fulfill personal obligations.\n\"The key is for everyone in the healthcare arena to really try to educate our communities. We do a lot of outreach. We have programs through our hospitals that refer people to treatment programs,\" Ravitz said.\nIn some cases, marijuana use can lead to cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, a condition marked by episodic vomiting and abdominal pain due to prolonged use of high doses. Although the majority of respondents said they had never experienced CHS, just over 200 Marylanders, about 2% of those surveyed, reported that they had experienced the condition.\n\"We have many frequent visitors that have been diagnosed with cannabis hyperemesis syndrome that present in our emergency department, and they are treated symptomatically, usually with IV fluids and, if needed, some antiemetics that reduce the nausea and vomiting,\" Ravitz described.\nOther than the lesser known health effects, there's a more pressing matter regarding the drug, according to Ravitz.\n\"The problem right now is with kids and the manufacturing of the synthetics that look like candy, and we're seeing an increase of overdose poisoning in children because of children getting a hold of the gummy looking cannabis medications that are now legally sold in the state of Maryland,\" Ravitz said.\nThe MCA's Maryland Cannabis Use Biannual Study, also released last month, details the number of cannabis-related calls to poison control has decreased for the first time in seven years — with nearly 80 fewer calls last year than 2023. However, from 2023 to 2024, calls involving infants aged five and under increased by almost 35%. And while cannabis use among minors is down 0.6%, there is still concern of the drug's effect on the developing brain of this vulnerable group. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But that's going to change in the next couple of years, and the possibility here is going to explode,\" Slaughter said. \"So we're trying to look at what those things can do for the state. Everything from public sector things, health initiatives, law enforcement, fire, emergency medical services, but then commercial opportunities as well, deliveries, infrastructure inspections, agriculture, a lot of different things have to be done.\"\nThe current project has drones flying over long distances within the state.\n\"Seems easy, sounds easy, isn't easy,\" Slaughter said. \"Technically, it's challenging, but regulatory, really challenging. So, getting the right equipment is huge for this, but, you know, that is costly, and that's what it's up to.\"\nSlaughter believes this will bring Southern Maryland \"up on the national stage.\"\n\"It's going to be a unique capability to go out into the field, set up a laboratory in the open air, and do work that can't be really done very easily on the ground,\" Slaughter said.\n\"This is something that is coming sooner rather than later, and what we want to do is help the state of Maryland be prepared for when the regulations evolve to support these type of operations in the long term,\" Ben Griffith, Chesapeake UAS Route Network Project Manager, said.\nGriffith said that his staff wants to take the work that's being done in other states and bring it here to leverage ideas.\nA final test flight that will fly over the bay from Southern Maryland, go to Crisfield, go over to Smith Island and come back is planned for around mid-September. That would be roughly 60 miles of travel for the aircraft — the same ones planned to be used in Southern Maryland. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The annual award honors members of the community who have made contributions toward understanding and addressing women and girls' needs.\nDeoudes, who retired in 2010 after spending seven years as a legislative aide for former Sen. E.J. Pipkin, currently serves as chair of the University of Maryland Shore Regional Health Board of Directors.\nIn her speech, Deoudes thanked her friends, family and colleagues for their support.\n\"And then to everyone else in this room, your philanthropy, your volunteerism and your compassion is what provides a safety net for members of our community who need it all the time or some of the time,\" she said. \"And for that, I am very grateful.\"\nFor All Seasons President and CEO Beth Anne Dorman was presented with the Sheryl V. Kerr Award. Given in memory of Kerr, the award recognizes individuals or programs that are significant to women, according to the Women and Girls Fund.\nIn her speech, Dorman said mental health matters and spoke about how important it is that women remember to prioritize self care.\n\"To know that it's OK if you need support, its OK to reach out and that sometimes the people that are leading and the people that are smiling and holding things need to be checked in on too,\" she said.\nThe Women and Girls Fund, which uses pooled resources to improve the lives of women and girls on the Mid-Shore, aims to support programs and initiatives geared toward women and girls and facilitate collaboration and partnership among organizations.\nDuring the luncheon, a total of $64,970 in grants were distributed among 18 organizations.\nWomen and Girls Fund President Beth Spurry said the organizations recognized at the luncheon are ones that invest in young girls' ability and right to \"soar.\"\n\"They will be the leaders of tomorrow,\" she said. \"So a prom dress or a 5K race on its own doesn't save a life, but being told that you are valued, that you deserve the spotlight too and that you are strong and can do hard things, may just give these girls — who will be women — the raw material to move beyond the barriers imposed on them from the circumstances of their lives.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge nursing facility faces complaints about care\n\n May 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 1614\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — When Dorchester County native Danny Frazier lived at Mallard Bay Nursing and Rehab in Cambridge, he loved having visitors.From high school buddies to family members, Frazier — who moved into Mallard Bay in his mid-60s after receiving an ALS diagnosis — treasured those visits, his sister Debbie Linthicum said.\nThose visits were among the only reasons Frazier stayed at Mallard Bay from June 2023 until his death in May 2024.\n\"We talked a few times about moving him to another facility because we were so dissatisfied,\" Linthicum said. \"And his biggest concern was, he said, 'I really love when people come to see me, and I'm afraid if I'm in Easton, it's a little bit of a further drive, they may not come.'\"\nLinthicum said when Frazier lived at Mallard Bay, he experienced inadequate care from staff, particularly when it came to food. She said when Frazier was no longer able to feed himself, there were instances when staff would bring his food but not feed it to him.\nThey are not alone in their experience with Mallard Bay.\nFrom a lack of care for residents to staffing problems, residents, their family members and former staff members say they have tried to advocate for the residents of Mallard Bay but have not seen change. On top of that, it has been 2½ years since the last federal inspection of the facility, and the state agency responsible for overseeing nursing homes faces a lawsuit alleging it has failed to inspect nursing facilities and allowed complaints against facilities to pile up.\nFormer Mallard Bay geriatric nursing assistant Deanna States-Meninger said she spoke with Dorchester County State's Attorney Amanda Leonard about the facility and filed a complaint against the facility with the Maryland Office of Health Care Quality.\nStates-Meninger said that when she worked at Mallard Bay, management wouldn't do anything in response to her complaints.\n\"I would go down the chain, and it seemed like it just got pushed off,\" she said.\nIn an April interview with The Star Democrat, Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) confirmed Mallard Bay had been reported to the state. He said the Office of Health Care Quality, which is within the Maryland Department of Health, was looking into the complaint.\nKey Health, which manages Mallard Bay, originally agreed to an interview and was sent a list of questions from The Star Democrat. However, the company later canceled the interview and sent a statement sharing its goals.\n\"Since Key Health began managing the facility in November 2022, we've worked hard to build a warm, supportive environment where residents feel valued and staff feel proud,\" the statement said. \"... Like in any healthcare setting, we may occasionally hear concerns, but we always take them seriously. However, the voices of those with positive experiences — of recovery, comfort, and dignity are vast.\"\nThe statement said Key Health remains \"fully transparent with regulators,\" accountable to its standards and committed to \"every person who calls Mallard Bay home.\"\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, reviews for Mallard Bay are middling.\nSTEPHEN'S STORY\nAfter a swimming accident this past summer left Stephen Nowlan, 54, paralyzed from the torso down, he spent three months in Mallard Bay's rehabilitation program.\nAlthough he was excited to go there after hearing about \"how incredible it was,\" he said it ended up being nothing like he expected.\nNowlan said there were not enough staff for the number of residents, and he would often wait a long time to receive help or care.\nOn his first day at the facility, Nowlan spent a long time waiting for his medication in pain. He said when he finally received his medication, the staff member who brought it didn't administer it.\n\"She put my pills on my table,\" he said. \"But I can't move. … She put them on the table and left.\"\nNowlan said that when he shared his concerns with the higher-ups at Mallard Bay, they gave him \"all kinds of excuses.\"\n\"I mean there's no excuse,\" Nowlan said.\nAlthough Nowlan said he had good physical therapists and a few good aides, he often found himself waiting for care or simply not getting enough of it.\nNowlan said there were occasions when he spent physical therapy sessions getting a shower from the physical therapists because the care staff hadn't given him a shower.\nHe left Mallard Bay in December after three months because his insurance stopped covering his stay.\nAbout eight months after his accident, Nowlan said he is able to move again but is considered quadriplegic because he has altered sensation in every part of his body. He attends physical therapy three times a week and expects to walk again one day.\nBRITTANY'S STORY\nBrittany Fletcher's father Michael Prager, 76, has lived at Mallard Bay since September.\nFletcher said her father had brain surgery for normal pressure hydrocephalus in early April and his doctors asked him to go on the Mediterranean diet for his brain health. According to the Cleveland Clinic, the Mediterranean diet \"emphasizes plant-based foods and healthy fats.\"\nThat is not what Prager is being served at Mallard Bay, Fletcher said.\n\"They are giving him sugar drinks and cake, and the meals are very starchy,\" she said.\nFletcher said her father is learning to walk again. She said Mallard Bay left him alone in the shower, even though he is a fall risk.\nAnd Fletcher said she has not had a great experience when it comes to communicating her concerns to Mallard Bay and its management.\nFletcher said she has thought about moving her father to a different nursing home, but funds are limited, which makes that harder to do.\n\"And I'm assuming anywhere is better than this at this point,\" she said. \"But I don't know.\"\nDEANNA'S STORY\nDeanna States-Meninger said that after six weeks working as a geriatric nursing assistant at Mallard Bay early this year, she quit her job.\nStates-Meninger said she made the decision due to a culture of neglect and lack of care, consistent understaffing, overworking and unresponsive management.\nAccording to the Code of Maryland Regulations, the ratio of nursing service personnel on duty providing care to residents of a nursing home may not be less than one to 15. States-Meninger said there was one night when she was left to care for an entire floor of 45 patients by herself for four hours.\n\"It made me feel like I was a failure,\" she said, \"like I couldn't answer all the bells and help the people when they needed it.\"\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the nursing staff turnover in a given year at Mallard Bay averages 71.2% compared to the 41.6% state average and the 47.5% national average.\nStates-Meninger called her job at Mallard Bay an \"awful\" one.\n\"I can't tell you how many nights I left in tears,\" she said.\nDEFICIENCIES FOUND\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Mallard Bay has an overall three-star rating, scoring \"above average\" (four stars) for health inspections, \"much below average\" (one star) for staffing and \"below average\" (two stars) for quality measures.\nConcerns with the 160-bed facility pre-date Key Health taking over in November 2022.\nIn August 2022, seven deficiencies were found during a federal inspection, including failure to report incidents of alleged abuse to law enforcement, failure to serve meals as requested by residents and failure to provide treatment or services to prevent or heal pressure ulcers.\nIn an email April 30, Maryland Department of Health Director of Communications Chase Cook confirmed the 2022 federal inspection report is the most recent inspection report. This means there have not been any federal inspections since Key Health took over management.\nIn Maryland, the Office of Health Care Quality within the state's Department of Health is responsible for the oversight of nursing homes, which includes licensure, certification and investigation of complaints.\nLast year, a lawsuit was filed against the Maryland Department of Health alleging the department has allowed more than 100 nursing facilities to go without an annual inspection for more than four years and allowed thousands of un-investigated complaints against nursing facilities to pile up.\nAccording to the class action complaint, the plaintiffs argue that when the department fails to complete its oversight responsibilities, \"dangerously poor-quality care within nursing facilities goes undetected and uncorrected.\"\nThe Department of Health has not responded to questions from The Star Democrat about Mallard Bay, the department's process for addressing complaints against nursing homes and how it ensures nursing homes in Maryland are safe for its residents.\nIn 2018, the Maryland General Assembly passed the Maryland Nursing Home Resident Protection Act to ensure complaints are addressed in a timely manner.\nSpecifically, the bill requires the Maryland Department of Health conduct a full inspection of each licensed nursing home in the state at least once a year and initiate investigations into complaints alleging actual harm within 10 business days of receiving the complaint.\nThe bill states the department shall receive 50 new full-time positions within the Office of Health Care Quality over a five-year period. These hirings were supposed to begin in fiscal year 2020, months before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the country.\nSen. Stephen Hershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline), who was a sponsor of the 2018 bill, said in an email that this is an issue he still has concerns about. He mentioned a bill passed by the Maryland Senate this year — which he also sponsored — that requires the Department of Health to report inspection data to General Assembly committees.\n\"We've been extremely concerned with the lack of responsiveness from the Department of Health's efforts to ensure residents and families that nursing homes can provide safe, high-quality care,\" he said.\nHershey said consistent oversight is important when it comes to determining whether nursing facilities are providing high-quality care.\n\"Regulatory agencies must work collaboratively to ensure bad actors cannot operate unchecked and that residents receive safe, quality care,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mid-Shore Behavioral Health answers questions from County Commissioners\n\n May 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 626\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — At their Tuesday meeting, the Caroline County Commissioners talked about homelessness, housing, budget and community interaction with Katie Dilley, chief executive officer, and Ann Simpers, behavioral health coordinator at Mid Shore Behavioral Health.Dilley and Simpers presented organization accomplishments, partnerships and budgets for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 to the commissioners. The presentation was part of an effort by the organization to secure the renewal of its agreement to serve at the county's core service agency.\nCommissioners noticed a $5 million increase in funding paid out by Mid-Shore Behavioral Health to partner organizations from fiscal year 2024 to fiscal year 2025.\nFor fiscal year 2026, federal and state funding to Mid Shore Behavioral Health jumps to $25 million from $21 million. But Dilley and Simpers warned that there could be modifications to the organization's budget with decreases coming from the federal government.\nCommission Vice President Larry Porter questioned Dilley and Simpers on exactly how the funding is distributed among partner organizations.\n\"I'm just trying to wrap my head around all of these different organizations, and how it all comes together and how we make sure that we're not duplicating money that goes somewhere else,\" Porter said.\nAccording to Commissioners President Travis Breeding, the commissioners wanted to ensure county funds were not allocated to efforts already funded by Mid Shore Behavioral Health.\nBreeding said in an interview that state and federal agencies have better abilities to make sure the funds are being appropriately used by the organizations than the county does.\nDilley assured the commissioners of Mid Shore Behavioral Health's \"stringent\" funding process.\n\"Each program that we specifically monitor and procure dollars through, we have a very stringent contracting process, deliverable process statement of work that we agree to uphold to the state,\" Dilley said. \"So, we monitor, report monthly, quarterly, we get financials, we get their financial auditing, we go out and do site visits. If there's a concern anywhere along the way of data showing that things are moving in the wrong direction, we're like, 'Hold up, we've got to regroup here.'\"\nThe commissioners also asked specifically about the Point-In-Time count conducted by Mid Shore Behavioral Health in January.\nThe count is an annual survey that measures homelessness across the U.S. This year, Mid Shore Behavioral Health's Continuum of Care team contributed by gathering data from individuals in encampments, shelters and temporary housing in Talbot, Kent, Dorchester, Caroline and Queen Anne's counties.\nAccording to the count, the total number of people experiencing homelessness on the Mid-Shore sits at 195, with 179 people in sheltered locations and 16 in unsheltered locations.\n\"Are the people that you come across in your data with the homeless population, like is there a percentage to say, 'Hey is this affordability process, or is it a mental health or social issues that that impacted my life.' That's the data that we would like to know, and we just don't seem to get that,\" Commissioner Frank Bartz said.\nAccording to Dilley, the Department of Housing and Urban Development determines the funding that communities receive with an annual cost of living check.\n\"So, depending on where you fall in the region, they have a different allocation for what resources they'll give to our organization to make sure that we can appropriately house individuals that we have funding for. We have an ear-marked amount of funding and slots for individuals to be placed in housing.\n\"So, that dollar shifts based on what the trends in the market are showing, and obviously that's going up, but I think what one thing we're also seeing that the number one thing that our community members have identified as a concern is the cost of living. And that's for individuals that are housed, not housed.\"\nCommissioners said the core service agency agreement will be added to next weeks action agenda for approval. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Lucas was veteran of the U.S. Army, he deployed twice with the Army Reserves, both times at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.He then went on to serve as a Corporal with the Caroline County Sheriff's Office and as a school resource officer at Colonel Richardson High School.\nNagel died of suicide in 2022, but his family continued his legacy through the Lucas Nagel Foundation.\nThe Lucas Nagel Foundation, established in 2023, was created to bring awareness to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder that first responders and veterans experience throughout their lives.\nNagel's father, Milton Nagel, said the idea of starting the foundation came from family and friends in the community.\n\"When you experience a loss like we did, you can have two different reactions,\" Milton Nagel said. \"You can become an introvert and just go off and mourn on your own, or you can use it as a catalyst to take action and to try to do what you can.\n\"We needed to come up with a website and start to get the word out and bring help to increase awareness to the issue and try to raise money to provide resources for first responders, veterans and families that need it, and to break the stigma and be part of the ever increasing movement to create change on how they are treated and dealt with when they are exposed to traumatic events and when they need help.\"\nWhile the foundation is still in the stages of raising money, it offers multiple resources that people can use if they experience PTSD.\n\"What we ultimately want to do is to be able to financially support peer support teams, critical incident response teams that that come in and it's peer to peer and they deep brief first responders after traumatic events.\"\nThe foundation does work for first responders, they recommended multiple partner organizations for veterans and their families to receive help at. One of these is Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors.\nTAPS is a national nonprofit that specializes in helping veterans and family member of military veterans.\nBonnie Carroll established TAPS in 1994. She was motivated by the death of her husband, Brigadier General Tom Carroll, in a 1992 Army plane crash.\nLike Milton Nagel, Carroll transformed her loss into a mission.\nAccording to Carroll, what matters to TAPS when supporting families is reminding theses families that it \"doesn't matter how, or where or why the person died. What matters is that their life included service.\n\"We honor and care for all those who are grieving the loss. So, really is very broad support to honor lives lived in service. We come right alongside what the military provides in rendering final honors, providing a final resting place and administering benefits to those who are eligible and then we expect expand that as a private organization all at no cost to the family.\"\nTAPS provides peer-based emotional support groups that helps families cope with their loss. The nonprofit also provides a 24/7 helpline for suicide loss survivors and hosts many in-person functions.\nCarroll described the programs they provide as \"wonderful.\" She said the programs give people a chance to meet others who have experienced similar losses. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The campaign highlights recognition of the PTSD stress disorder, veteran suicide and the need for veterans' treatment courts which are the backstop for the first two issues as we try to \"catch them before they fall.\"Thank you to Sens. Steve Hersey and Johnny Mautz, Dels. Chris Adams, Thomas Hutchinson and Steven Arentz and the District 3 Public Defender Attorney, Tamara Stofa, for participating in June 2025 National PTSD Awareness campaign.\nSens. Hersey and Mautz and Dels. Adams, Arentz and Hutchinson presented General Assembly citations promoting PTSD awareness to Ms. Stofa from the District Public Defenders Office for District 3. A huge thank you to administrative judge for District 3 courts, John E. Nunn, for allowing us to present our interest in exploring the possibility of prompting the creation of a Regional Veterans District 3 Court venue.\nA Regional Veterans Treatment Court would have served the veterans living in Cecil, Caroline, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties. We also are grateful for the support for developing a Veterans Treatment Court over the last year from the following: state Sens. Gallion, Mautz, Hersey and Del. Christopher Adams, The Military Order of the Purple Heart Chapter of the Delmarva, The Veterans of Foreign Wars District 4, Queen Anne's County VAMSA Center, The American Red Cross of the Delmarva Peninsula, United Way of Kent and Caroline Counties; National Alliance on Mental Illness (\"NAMI\") of Columbia, Maryland, and Easter Seals of MD/DC/VA.\nIn addition, huge thanks to the county councils in Cecil, Caroline, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties; the states Attorney's Offices of Cecil and Caroline and Queen Anne's counties; the county sheriffs of Cecil, Caroline, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot, and the Maryland Sheriffs Association membership for supporting the proposals for expanding the Maryland Veterans Treatment Court program in Maryland.\nUnfortunately, the current \"financial landscape\" in Maryland has hampered the grant funding needed to prompt the creation of new Regional Veterans Treatment Courts in District 3, District 4 (southern Maryland) and District 12 (western Maryland) that we had advocated for.\nWe can keep this in the limelight by supporting PTSD awareness and our afflicted veterans.\nJOSHUA MARKS\nMount Airy \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "White House doctors failed in caring for Biden\n\n May 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: GLENN MOLLETTE | Section: Columns \n \n 615\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The recent announcement about former President Joe Biden having terminal prostate cancer is mind-blowing. It was announced that the cancer is in his bones, so yes, it's terminal. He might live a couple of years depending on how far it has progressed.This week, I have been wondering if the cancer is already in his brain and if it has been there for a while. How long will it be before we know the truth? Will we ever know the complete truth?\nBiden having Stage 4 prostate cancer is just crazy. We recently heard on national news that it has been 14 years since Biden had his last PSA test, which is typically done every year on any man who has a physical. If the doctor doesn't order a PSA test on any man over 50 then he should have his medical license revoked.\nWe are talking about the president of the United States who supposedly has access to the finest medical care in the world. In reality he must have had an idiot looking out for him. Or did Joe know he had cancer early in his term as president and everyone agreed to keep it quiet?\nBiden's condition grew worse throughout his presidency. He wasn't great when he was doing all his campaigning from the basement. In his last two years, he became increasingly difficult to understand, and he couldn't answer questions on the spot. He had to be given questions in advance. We saw it all play out on national television. Let's please pray for Biden. He is a very sick man.\nShame on the White House medical team for not taking care of the President. Shame on Jill Biden. Why would a wife allow her husband to try to keep doing what he was not able to do. Shame on Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders and every Democrat who tried to fool the American public. They did not fool anyone.\nProstate cancer can be treated and cured if caught early. A PSA test each year will identify a rising PSA number. Typically, any number over 4 will warrant a prostate biopsy. Biopsies are not fun but they are much better than terminal cancer.\nA biopsy will determine if there is any malignancy in the prostate. If a malignancy is found early on then there will be choices to make. There are various treatments such as radiation seed implants, cyber knife, proton therapy, radiation therapy, freezing the cancer or surgery to remove the prostate.\nHowever, if you wait and delay treatment then the cancer will eventually escape the prostate and end up in your bones and other parts of your body. Then it is just a matter of time before you die.\nAn oncologist may do hormone injections and radiation to buy you some time. That's what \"managing\" the cancer is, buying you a little time, very little time.\nAgain, pray for Joe Biden.\nAlso men, get your PSA test every year. Even if you are over 75, insist on it. A dear friend of mine, died from prostate cancer at age 80. He was diagnosed at age 77. His doctor was passive and kept saying, \"We'll watch it.\" They watched it for sure. They watched it kill my friend. If they had done PSA tests earlier, they could have caught it and treated the cancer.\nIf your doctor says, \"We don't do tests like that after 70 or 75, then find a different doctor. What's the point of going to the doctor at age 70 or 80 if their attitude is \"You're too old to treat. We will just let you die.\"\nBe proactive. Don't settle for a doctor like the White House doctor who allowed the President to become terminal. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mental Health Awareness is bigger than May, expert says\n\n May 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 418\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Throughout the world, Mental Health Awareness Month is observed in May. But Beth Anne Dorman, president and CEO of For All Seasons, believes it is important to observe and be aware of mental health year-round.\"While paying attention to it in the month of May is important, it's a 365-day-a-year issue, and continuing to create safe spaces for people to say, 'I'm not doing okay,' for us as individuals to reach out and be able to say, 'I'm not doing okay.' We will be a stronger community if everyone has access to service,\" she said.\nBeing aware of mental health goes way deeper than just knowing mental health issues exist, Dorman said. Being able to identify mental health issues and being able to help point friends and family in the right direction if they may be experiencing a mental health episode are vital.\nSigns can be someone showing up differently, someone being more stressed, or someone who is typically outgoing being more introverted. According to Dorman, it is important to realize mental health issues show up in different ways for different people.\n\"When we think about mental health with grief, when you think about mental health as it's related to substance abuse and everyday stressors that we are going through, it impacts everyone differently,\" Dorman said.\nAccording to Dorman, after identifying a mental health issue, the next step that can be taken is identifying what support or help a person may need.\n\"The first thing is to offer support, showing that you care and that you're there to listen without judgment and offer words of encouragement,\" Dorman said. \"Sometimes somebody just needs someone to listen. Other times, it's going to be when you're listening, there may be additional health that's needed.\"\nThere could be some instances when the person may not want to receive help just yet or doesn't think they need help. According to Dorman, there are resources available for helping an individual who may not think they need service.\n\"It's important to remember that if someone is not ready to seek services, it may be going back and revisiting the conversation several times over,\" Dorman said. \"What we have to remember is that it is an individual's decision to seek help and we have to create a safe space for ourselves to kind of put some boundaries and parameters around I've done as much as I can.\"\nAnyone experiencing a mental health episode can call 988, the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.\nFor more information on services provided by For All Seasons, visit forallseasonsinc.org/. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Well, it's big, can't deny that, and it's a bill, which we'll all end up paying, but as for beautiful, that's in the eye of the beholder.Let's start with Medicaid, which needs more funding rather than less, at this moment when the administration is doing its best to make the lives of poor, disabled and elderly people miserable. This bill is a frank handout to billionaires, short and simple, and it's squarely on the backs of middle- and working class people to add insult to injury.\nGive money to billionaires — take it from rural hospitals. Take it from kids' school lunches. Take it from seniors in nursing homes. Take it from people who need medical care the most. I retired from running a clinic that provided free care to previously hospitalized Medicaid recipients, among others, and I'm sickened to think what will happen to them.\nAnd my congressman, Mr Harris? He voted \"present\" because, from his antediluvian point of view, the bill didn't go far enough in taking from the neediest. He doesn't like the $2.3 trillion, with a T, the bill will add to our deficit over the next decade, but his solution would be to take more from people who have nothing.\nTo give to billionaires? Oh, please.\nRICHARD BEARMAN\nCambridge \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Fishing trip gets disabled veterans out on the Bay\n\n June 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: News \n \n 464\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TRAPPE — There wasn't a single cloud in the sky as disabled veterans from Pleasant Day Medical Adult Day Care took turns reeling in lines on Wednesday morning.It was a fruitful day on the water, and spirits were high. \"Trust me, fishing isn't always like this,\" said Captain Shannon Pinkens as he threw the 10th fish in the cooler.\nThe event was organized by the Easton Elks 1622 Veterans Affair Committee as an opportunity for the veterans to relax and enjoy the gorgeous day.\nFishing and hunting have been shown to help combat post-traumatic stress disorder and help foster community for veterans.\nA study conducted by scholars Jessie Bennet, Jennifer Piatt and Marieke Van Puymbroeck for Springer Nature found fly-fishing significantly reduced symptoms of post-traumatic stress, depression and functional impairments while increasing overall self determination and leisure satisfaction.\nThe United States has more veterans than any other nation in the world, and often those returning from oversees struggle to get the help they need. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs news, 22% of the 16.5 million veterans in 2020 were homeless and 15,000 of those individuals lived completely without shelter.\nThere are currently no Veteran Affairs hospitals on the Eastern Shore, but there is a clinic located in Cambridge. The closest VA hospital that provides full services is located in Baltimore.\nThe Easton Elks 1622 Veterans Affair Committee works to ensure these individuals, particularly disabled veterans, get the resources they need and then some.\nThe committee raises funds, hosts events and works with community organizations like Pleasant Day to ensure the best quality of life for veterans on the Eastern Shore, who are often far away from other resources.\nBefore leaving the dock Wednesday, Easton Elks 1622 Veterans Affair Chairman Michael Feehly presented Captain Pinkens with a certificate of appreciation for serving disabled veterans. Pinkens sheepishly accepted, and the crew set sail.\nOnce out far enough into the Bay, Pinkens and Feehly began live-baiting the lines with small shad, keeping three lines in the water at all times. As soon as there was a tug, it was on.\nThe rockfish were out in full force Wednesday morning. Also known as the striped bass, the rockfish is the official state fish of Maryland. Due to conservation concerns, fishers can keep one fish per person if they're between 19 and 24 inches long. Anything longer or shorter must be returned to the Bay.\nExecutive Director of Pleasant Day Erin Windsor aided each veteran as they reeled in the large specimen. Windsor made sure everyone got a chance to catch a fish.\nThe boat reached its maximum people-to-fish capacity an hour before the day was done. To wish the group farewell, a group of porpoises jumped in and out of the Bay.\n\"The only thing that would make this better would be a beer,\" said veteran Mike. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2025-06-09",

    "content": "Construction is afoot for Easton's new hospital\n\n June 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 692\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — As the summer heats up, so does construction on Easton's long-awaited, 385,000-square-foot hospital.Construction teams are in the early stages of building the University of Maryland Shore Regional Medical Center on Longwoods Road just off of U.S. Route 50. And in a matter of weeks, passersby will see vertical progress on what will be the hospital's six-story main tower.\n\"As part of the vertical construction, probably one of the first things that people would see from the road is the cranes,\" said LuAnn Brady, University of Maryland Shore Regional Health vice president and chief operating officer.\nThe landmark project took two major steps forward last month — on May 1 the Town of Easton granted the hospital a building permit, and two weeks later, Route 662 (or Longwoods Road) reopened for traffic after it was rerouted due to where the medical center will sit. Those advancements allowed building construction to begin on time.\nProject leaders and politicians alike have touted the hospital as a significant milestone that will improve the quality of health care for Eastern Shore residents. Brady and Shore Regional Health communications marketing director Trena Williamson said the new space will improve efficiency for patients and staff.\nThe new center will replace Shore Regional Health's current one, a 244,000-square-foot facility in downtown Easton.\n\"We've been working in a space that has been retrofitted,\" Williamson said. \"Health care changes so quickly, and our current space has grown and morphed around those changes, and part of what has made this project necessary is that we're stuck.\"\nCONSTRUCTION TIMELINE\nProject leaders expect the hospital to open in the summer of 2028. Constructing the building is likely to take much less time than the events leading up to the hospital's ground breaking.\nIn 2012, Shore Regional Health first applied for a certificate of need to relocate the hospital. Industry changes, fiscal concerns and shifting project plans delayed the timeline. But in January 2024, the Maryland Health Care Commission finally approved the certificate of need application.\n\"There was a little bit of 'we'll believe it when we see it,'\" Brady said of how employees viewed the pending move. But when the commission gave the OK, the project hit the ground running.\nBrady said construction will start on the east wing of the main hospital and then go to the west wing. Then workers will tackle the 60,000-square-foot medical services and outpatient services building.\nBy the end of this year, Brady said the east wing will be standing and there will be progress on the west end.\n\"A year from now, in May of 2026, both the east and the west wings will be built, and you'll see all six stories of the building,\" Brady said.\nWhiting-Turner is leading construction.\nWHAT WILL CHANGE\nThe project will increase the hospital's space for storage, education, meetings and parking, according to Shore Regional Health leaders, who also noted that hospital staff had significant input over the past years into where departments are located, what rooms look like and more.\nThere will be 122 licensed inpatient beds — a slight increase from the current 118. Bed counts are dictated by the state through the certificate of need, Williamson said. The number of total beds will be 147, nearly even with the hospital's current makeup.\nWhile the hospital's bed number isn't significantly rising, the location of 25 additional observation beds will no longer significantly interfere with the emergency department space. Observation patients will be placed beside the emergency center.\n\"The dedicated observation beds will allow us to be able to be more efficient with those observation patients in terms of not taking up space in the emergency department,\" Brady said.\nAnd as for the operating rooms, Williamson says space and scheduling limitations at the South Washington Street location will be improved with the new medical center. Since the downtown hospital was built before robotic surgery, most operating rooms don't have space for the robotic equipment.\n\"They didn't think about robotic surgery,\" Williamson said of when the operating rooms were first built. \"Well, now we have robotic surgery, and that needs specific things. They need to have a larger space for that to operate in.\"\n\"There's a bit of liberation,\" Williamson said of the space the new medical center will provide. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "As young Americans struggle with mental health, online support surges\n\n June 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAX SCHAEFFER Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 1705\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Adolescents across the country have increasingly suffered from anxiety and depression over the last 10 years, and school officials in Prince George's County noticed the same trend locally.So when the county's public school system needed to support its struggling students, it did what schools and young people across the nation are doing — it turned to an online service.\nFunded by the statewide effort to bolster youth mental health, the county partnered with Hazel Health, which specializes in providing online counseling to school-age children.\n\"I think accessibility is huge,\" Emily Pasco, the school district's mental health coordinator, said of the partnership. \"That's historically been a barrier for mental health services — transportation is an issue.\"\nSupporters of online mental health services argue that they offer a convenient option in an era when providers are in short supply. According to a 2024 federal study, more than a third of the nation's residents live in an area where there aren't enough mental health professionals.\nEnter online services such as Hazel, Gaggle, Counslr and Cope Notes.\n\"We are not a silver bullet; we are not going to solve everyone's problems, but we can be a great gap-fill,\" said Andrew Post, Hazel's president.\nOnline mental health services surged in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic when most in-person options were shut down, and it has remained popular in the years since.\nWith the online medium evolving every day, there is no consensus about it among psychological researchers, but various studies have shown online interventions can do some good.\nFor example, a 2024 study from the National Institutes of Health found there were \"promising results regarding the effectiveness of online interventions in young people, especially for symptoms of anxiety and depression and for training of social functioning.\"\nMegan Taylor, an independent licensed clinical psychologist from Northern Virginia with online and in-person therapy experience, said online therapy can sometimes feel safer to patients than seeing a therapist in person.\nYet the online medium makes it easier for unlicensed or unreliable providers to provide services they aren't qualified to provide, said Taylor, who has extensive experience with youngsters with autism.\n\"I feel really passionate about the fact that there are many therapists, who advertise themselves as being neurodiversity affirming or specializing in autism, but really haven't had that training,\" Taylor said.\nDespite such concerns, online therapy is expected to grow as an option for troubled young people nationwide. Zion Market Research projects the global market for online therapy for teens to more than triple from 2023 through 2032.\nThat being the case, here's a closer look at several online mental health care options available to young people today:\nHazel\nHazel was one of the big winners in the state's first round of grants from its new youth mental health program, receiving $2.75 million in Prince George's County, $1.5 million in Baltimore City and smaller grants in Charles and St. Mary's counties.\nStudents in Prince George's County and elsewhere access Hazel's counselors through video conference, either at school or home. Post said the medium offers limitations as well as benefits for the students who access it.\n\"We are raising a generation of children who are very comfortable, for better or worse, with technology,\" Post said. \"This construct of, 'I'm going to drop you off at this office and I'll pick you up in an hour,' is a little jarring, compared to, 'I'm going to hand you this iPad and you're going to see this person and talk to them.'\"\nDespite being a proponent of telehealth therapy, Post acknowledged for severe cases, in-person treatment always has to be an option for young people.\nPrince George's County — like Miami-Dade County, Florida, where Post taught and served as an administrator — is a majority-minority community where over half of the student population qualifies for free and reduced lunch. This comes with additional mental health challenges for students to navigate.\nIn 2024, Prince George's County saw 113 homicides.\n\"Gun violence is a significant issue,\" Pasco said. \"Students being affected by either witnessing gun violence, or being affected by someone that they know being a victim of gun violence.\"\nThe top two most common reasons for referral, according to Pasco, are depression and anxiety, consistent with national trends.\nOne way Hazel looks to serve the unique needs of communities like Prince George's County is to only use providers who are licensed in the state.\n\"Number two is making sure that our population group truly reflects the population that we serve,\" Post said.\nTwo out of every five Hazel therapists fluently speak a language other than English, according to Post.\nGaggle\nLike Hazel, Gaggle — which began in 1999 as an early email communication system between teachers and students in schools — provides online therapy. The company has evolved over the last 25 years, first into an online safety management platform and now a provider of teletherapy.\nGaggle's safety management operation is still the primary service it provides to school districts, with over 1,500 districts using it. Just over 100 school districts use its telehealth service, although no Maryland school district uses it.\nGrowing the company's telehealth operation is a company priority, said Heather Durkac, Gaggle's chief innovation officer.\n\"Gaggle started and is involved with protecting those 'digital hallways' — what kids were emailing, sending, sharing, uploading, everything that was on district-provided devices or accounts,\" she said.\nIncreasing concerns about mental health and self-harm — which company officials noted through its safety monitoring service — inspired the company to offer teletherapy as well.\n\"I used to talk about [during training with school districts] if students would send something like a suicide note or share suicidal thoughts,\" Durkac said. \"Now I talk about it in a position of when students are sharing those suicidal thoughts or a suicide note. That really just compelled us to do something more.\"\nThe company made 20,000 phone calls to school districts for situations their safety analysts deemed an imminent threat for a student, and over 400,000 emails to school districts for concerns of a lower level, according to Durkac.\nDurkac shared a story of Gaggle's intervention when a student wrote a suicide note on a Google Doc on his school-issued Gmail account, which school officials saw because Gaggle's safety management system gave them access to it. Gaggle contacted the school, and officials there got the student's family and police involved. The student was found at the local train tracks and taken to a hospital.\nWith a combination of Gaggle's services, a school district could continue to work with the student to help prevent a similar situation.\n\"If it is one of those districts that has both services, they can choose to move them right into our Gaggle therapy services. If not, they have other resources,\" Durkac said.\nIf one decides to access Gaggle's therapy services, the company employs a team of licensed therapists that mostly do part-time work online while working with their own practice or serving as a supervisor somewhere else.\nCounslr\nAnother of the most widespread online counseling providers is Counslr, a service that partners with large companies, schools and communities. Counslr is partnered with school districts across 11 states but not Maryland — although it works with Child Trends, a Rockville-based nonprofit that researches child well-being.\nCounslr offers text-based mental health support with a licensed mental health professional at any hour of the day. Students complete a basic intake form and are matched with a professional who is supposed to best fit their needs.\n\"We are particularly effective at what we call 'reaching the traditionally unreachable,'\" Counslr co-founder and CEO Josh Liss said.\nHe said Counslr's text-based method helps people avoid typical hurdles like cost, inconvenience or negative stigma around getting help.\n\"The majority of the sessions on our platform deal with relationship issues,\" Liss said. \"Very challenging to have a video session, when the person you want to talk about is lying in the bed next to you.\"\nCounslr is free for the students or members of its partner school districts or organizations. That entity pays Counslr for its services to be accessible to its students or members.\nLiss said he is confident in Counslr's ability to help its users, but recognizes its limits.\n\"We very intentionally do not provide therapy,\" Liss said. \"Our counselors don't diagnose, they don't treat and they don't prescribe medication.\"\nWhen someone requires a more intensive form of care, like therapy, the company works with the school counseling office to facilitate that, Liss said.\nCope Notes\nCope Notes founder Johnny Crowder said he grew up with \"severe mental illness\" and had always resisted seeking treatment.\nOnce he got older and began to study psychology and neuroscience, that aversion turned to a curiosity and passion for helping people.\n\"I started texting people health education content from my phone,\" Crowder said, \"and eventually started building it into something more nuanced.\"\nThis is how Crowder developed Cope Notes, a subscription-based service that sends users a text at a random point in the day.\nThe texts are written by a peer, or someone with experience with whatever challenge their text references, then reviewed by Cope Notes' clinical oversight panel of mental health professionals before being sent out.\nOne of the biggest challenges is finding a text that will be general enough to apply to a range of subscribers but specific enough to help. The service is anonymous, so the providers aren't aware of who they're texting.\n\"We're serving people, let's say one of them is a rural teenager with bipolar and one person is like an urban senior with no mental health conditions,\" Crowder said. \"How the heck do you craft a content library that is applicable across all of those demographics, if you don't have that information?\"\nAnswering this question has become a big part of the company's content review process.\nNo two people ever get the same text at once, and the text comes through at a random time, although the company is working on features that will allow people to personalize their experience, according to Crowder.\nThe current Cope Notes pricing model allows someone to purchase an individual subscription for an annual cost of just over $100. Cope Notes also offers group subscriptions for companies or schools.\nCrowder recognizes Cope Notes is not a replacement for therapy. He said he feels Cope Notes is a resource that can be used to get someone ready for treatment in therapy, or help someone who has finished their therapy have some consistent support.\n\"I would say it's a great step up or step down [from therapy],\" Crowder said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Coursey and his wife, Missy, of Ray's Painting LLC were credited with more than just establishing a house for adults with developmental disabilities to live in but creating a home in which to thrive.\nCoursey said with the state the house was in before the project began, it should have been torn down, but instead was gutted and renovated completely to stand as something completely new.\n\"It can be done,\" he said, noting it was rewarding to see the finished project and the impact it has to those who truly need it.\n\"It takes a village,\" Chesterwye CEO Micheal Yates said. He noted projects such as this one are made possible with local support, and Queen Anne's County stands above any other community he's seen before.\nThe county was happy to provide the help, County Administrator Todd Mohn said.\nWhile the project saw its share of challenges along the way, according to Yates, the Chesterwye Center will be able to apply aspects learned to support future endeavors.\nAccording to Chesterwye board member Diane McComb, when developing new client homes, an important ask for Chesterwye is, \"Would I live here?\" and looking over the newly refurbished home, she said, \"This certainly meets it.\"\nChesterwye is committed to improving the lives of individuals and making homes more inviting as well as the environment of its homes and is continually updating, growing and expanding, Yates said.\n\"You don't receive more referrals without a good reputation,\" McComb noted.\nThe work that Chesterwye does is imperative, former Chesterwye Foundation Chair Wheeler Baker noted, as services for adults with developmental disabilities, otherwise end after the age of 21.\nThrough the Chesterwye programs, clients are busy with activities, field trips and connections for happy, productive lives.\nFamily member Jeannie Jordan, of Centreville, marveled as she looked over the new home for her nephew Micheal Huddleston, 40.\n\"It's such a blessing,\" she said, \"Chesterwye provides anything and everything they need.\"\nThrough Chesterwye, Jordan said she knows Huddleston is always safe and engaging in activities he wouldn't otherwise.\n\"Micheal is the happiest child filled with joy, and part of that is his surroundings,\" she said.\nCongratulating Chesterwye on the completion of the home to provide supportive independent living, an official citation from the Maryland General Assembly was presented by Del. Steve Arentz (R-Caroline, Cecil, Kent, Queen Anne's). Renovation of the Chesterwye Center's second residential group home, the Nash House, is expected to begin by July.\nThe Chesterwye Center has been supporting the Queen Anne's County community since 1967 through day and residential programs.\nMore information about The Chesterwye Center can be found at chesterwye.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Man completes Eagleman after non-Hodgkins lymphoma\n\n June 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: News \n \n 389\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — For Craig Casterella, mind over matter is more of a lifestyle than a saying. This was especially true on Sunday, when Casterella finished the Ironman 70.3 Eagleman in six and a half hours.The triathlon, held in Cambridge, consisted of a 1.2-mile swim, a 56-mile bike ride and a 13.1-mile run.\n\"I cried at the end. I was ecstatic. I couldn't hold my emotions in, and it truly just goes to show that with determination, consistency and resilience, you can do so much in any facet of life,\" Casterella said.\nThe 31-year-old was inspired to train for the Eagleman in 2024 after a yearlong battle with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a blood cancer most commonly found in older adults. Casterella said only 22,000 people a year get diagnosed with the disease, so it's important to create and spread awareness.\nWhen Casterella was diagnosed in October of 2023, his perspective on life changed.\n\"Your life flashes before you. You start thinking about your past, you start thinking about your present and then about your future,\" he said. \"And when younger people get diagnosed with a serious illness that is life or death, your future becomes so important, and you think about what you can accomplish and what you can possibly do before ending up in a coffin or six feet under. You start thinking about those things.\"\nWhile going through chemotherapy, Casterella found a community on social media.\n\"Social media was my outlet to find others who were going through disease and illness, but also attacking life while going through disease and illness,\" he said. Online, Casterella fostered relationships with people who he now considers mentors.\nSince going into remission, he uses social media to inspire others to \"attack life,\" even when facing adversity.\nCasterella said endurance sports are like going through a disease or illness. He had to endure a lot of things he didn't want to while going through treatment, but he saw it as a way to challenge himself mentally and physically, just like the triathlon.\n\"For me, coming out of this weekend, realizing that truly anything we set our minds to, dedicate, commit to, you can do anything. Don't just dream it. The things you wish you could do, just set goals will do it. I promise, it's never too late to start,\" he said.\nCasterella plans on racing in another Eagleman in the near future. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Activities Director Abigail Gearhart said that once a week they get the residents out to do many activities.\n\"Some people don't have family, so our job is to give them the best quality of life with what we can,\" she said.\nGregory, has been fishing his whole life and enjoys when they do activities. \"Oh, it's lovely,\" Gregory said. \"I wish I could get out this chair and fish, I've been fishing most all my life. I love the fish.\"\nGregory is a father of one and has two grandchildren. The outing Friday gave him an opportunity to celebrate fatherhood and reflect on what it has meant for his life. He, along with other participants in the fishing trip, said being a father makes him feel really happy.\nHoward, a father of two, enjoyed Christmas mornings the most with his sons. His advice to new fathers is to \"spend as much time as possible because it goes by awfully fast.\"\nGearhart understands how some residents reminisce on activities they could do daily before being in the facility, she hopes activities like fishing bring back those memories.\n\"I'm very happy and excited for them, and it's very uplifting just for their day-to-day living,\" Gearhart said. \"Being able to come out and do something that they used to be able to do whenever they wanted, the goal is just to make them as happy as we can.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Goodall brings to the role a distinctive blend of medical, psychological and theological expertise, shaped by years of hands-on work as a physician and counselor.Her deep commitment to holistic care uniquely equips her to lead the Shelter Alliance in its mission to serve Kent County's unhoused population.\nRaised in Kingston, Jamaica, Goodall briefly resided in Baltimore, where she attended Baltimore Polytechnic Institute. She later returned to Jamaica to complete the International Baccalaureate program at Hillel Academy in Kingston. She earned a Bachelor of Pure Sciences and a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) from the University of the West Indies.\nAfter graduating from medical school in 2018, Goodall served more than six years as a physician at both the University Hospital of the West Indies and the Constant Spring Medical Center in Kingston.\nDuring her medical practice, she developed a deep passion for addressing the psychological and emotional needs of vulnerable populations. This led her to pursue a Master of Arts in counseling psychology at the Caribbean Graduate School of Theology, where she graduated with honors in 2024. As part of her graduate training, she completed a clinical practicum at the A.F. Whitsitt Center in Maryland, working directly with individuals facing substance use challenges and housing instability.\nGoodall's academic and clinical background includes trauma-informed care, crisis intervention and multicultural competency, equipping her to serve individuals from diverse cultural, socioeconomic and psychological backgrounds with both insight and empathy.\nHer approach is shaped not only by professional experience but also by personal experience, including a period of housing insecurity. That lived experience fuels her passion for providing holistic, dignified and compassionate care, and deepens her understanding of the complex barriers faced by those without stable housing.\nFounded in September 2024, the Shelter Alliance aspires to establish and operate a year-round, 24/7 shelter in Kent County. Since its inception, the organization has provided emergency accommodations in local motels, offering temporary shelter to those in need. To date, it has provided 97 bed nights to 38 individuals and has helped three clients secure permanent housing through partnerships with Deep Roots in Earleville, the Maryland Rural Development Corporation in Chestertown, and Corsica River Mental Health Services in Centreville.\nWith a full-time shelter, the Shelter Alliance aims to expand its impact and help more residents transition from crisis to stability.\nThe Shelter Alliance welcomes public support.

Highs are expected to remain in the 90s later in the week across Caroline, Dorchester and Talbot counties.\nThe Dorchester County Health Department is encouraging people stay out of the sun when temperatures peak in the late mornings and early afternoons.\nA press release from the department noted the following groups should take added precautions: babies, young children, pregnant women, older adults, outside workers and those without air conditioning.\nLocal health officials recommend regularly hydrating, limiting time outdoors and monitoring for signs of heat exhaustion — heavy sweating, cold skin, cramps, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, etc.\nThe Maryland Department of Health said in a press release this week that Maryland saw 26 heat-related deaths last year. The state department added that parents and guardians should never leave children in cars.\n\"Remember to check on those who are particularly vulnerable to heat, including young children, senior citizens, and people with chronic diseases — and confirm that they have the resources they need to stay safe during the hottest months,\" said Maryland Secretary of Health Dr. Meena Seshamani in the release.\nEASTON FIRE PREPARES\nAs temperatures heat up, volunteer fire departments across the Mid-Shore remain on call. Due to the physically intensive work of firefighting and the heavy gear that must be worn, some departments are asking for water donations from the community.\nEaston Volunteer Fire Department Chief J.R. Dobson says his department has received enough cases of water from thoughtful community residents and businesses to get through next week's heat wave. Dobson is encouraging residents to contribute to other fire departments in need in Talbot County.\nWhether it's lending bottled waters or assisting with manpower on a call, Dobson says local fire departments work together well.\n\"The other fire chiefs talk a lot, and we're always here to help one another,\" Dobson said.\nThe fire chief noted that as farmers in the area start to cut their wheat, field fires could pop up, a risk fire officials are keeping their eyes on.\nWeather projections are accurate as of Friday afternoon. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Main St., behind the spiral staircase and Little Free Library, the pantry operates on a \"take what you need, give what you can\" basis and is open 24/7. It provides nonperishable food, dry goods, feminine care products and diapers for Kent County residents and visitors.\nOriginally installed in 2021, the pantry was inspired by the grassroots \"Blessing Box\" movement that began in Arkansas in 2016 to help combat food insecurity without barriers or judgment.\nAshleigh Rogers, who installed the original pantry at her home, said the concept was also inspired by the philanthropy of chef José Andrés and the World Central Kitchen following the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.\n\"Sadly, the elements took their toll, and it was falling apart, so I applied for the grant from No Child Goes Hungry, and she had it on the way here within a day,\" Rogers said. \"I don't monitor it, so I'm not sure if needs have increased, but I do know it is used several times a day. The community has been so generous and has kept it stocked.\"\nCommunity members responded with donations during the \"Pack the Pantry\" drive held June 19–22 to help restock the upgraded pantry.\nFor more information, visit facebook.com/littlefreelibraryandpantryonmainstreet. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland's new standards on worker safety bring added protection amid heat wave\n\n June 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 571\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — With a major heat wave in full swing, Maryland's new heat safety standards for workers are being put to the test, including in Easton.Dustin Otto, construction division manager for the Town of Easton, helped create a health safety and prevention plan for Easton's public works employees. It outlines the steps the town will take to protect its outdoor workers during periods of extreme heat, incorporating the state's new standards.\nOtto says whether it's the use of 32-ounce water bottles, additional breaks or monitoring heat indices more, the added layers of protection work toward a common goal.\n\"It's all about safety,\" he said.\nLast September, new heat stress rules from Maryland Occupational Safety and Health, which operates under the Department of Labor, went into effect for all workplaces with a heat index of 80 degrees or higher.\nStatewide discussion of heat safety peaked last summer when Baltimore Department of Public Works employee Ronald Silver died from heat illness on the job.\nThe new state standards require employers to develop heat-related illness prevention and management plans. Those plans must detail how employers will protect workers in 80 degree heat or higher and how employees will receive proper training and preventative measures.\nDepartment of Labor Secretary Portia Wu said the new regulations stem from legislation passed by the General Assembly a couple years ago.\n\"These are common sense. They rely on tools we all know about,\" Wu said. \"But having a written plan and making sure you're training everyone on it is really important.\"\nIn addition to shade and hydration requirements, the following rules are in effect for outdoor workers:\nIn a heat index above 90 degrees and below 100 degrees, workers must rest at least 10 minutes every two hours.\nIn a heat index above 100 degrees, workers must rest at least 15 minutes every hour.\nEaston officials say they're used to observing best practices regarding hydration, shaded areas and rest times.\n\"We've always had that in place,\" Otto said.\nBut the town's new heat illness safety plan spells it out more clearly and makes sure employees receive the proper training and education on working in the heat.\nThe town builds on the state standards by requiring the 15-minutes-per-hour rest at at heat index of 98 degrees or higher, along with providing water to employees.\nOtto emphasized that the town's public works and construction employees perform work critical for Easton residents. He noted the toughest days come when asphalt paving happens and that the department leaders take extra precautions on those days to protect staff.\nThe state standards also place an emphasis on acclimating employees not previously exposed to heat, or those who spent a period of time away from working in high temperatures.\nEmployers must monitor acclimating employees through regular checks as well as create a schedule of \"gradual introduction and alternative cooling\" measures.\n\"You really need to ramp up people's exposure to heat,\" Wu said.\nWu added that the state is providing guidance to industry leaders with specific questions for areas of work that may be unique. The MOSH rules don't apply to \"emergency operations and essential services.\"\nWu said the state also provides a template of a plan for businesses, especially helpful to smaller operations who may not have dedicated staff to put together the required heat illness prevention plan.\n\"I think businesses want to do the right thing. Hopefully it's helpful to them to have these tools now,\" Wu said. \" ... We thought giving really concrete guidelines actually makes it easier to know what to do.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Summer snacking\n\n June 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: News \n \n 1108\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n School is out, and summer fun is just beginning. Get those sweets and treats ready because the \"I'm hungry\" crowd has arrived.Ever wonder how kids can sit in school six hours a day with only lunch but when school is closed the \"I'm hungry\" cry is every two to three hours? It is easier to have snacks prepared and ready to hand out.\nBuy a large economy size box of zipper snack bags and fill assorted crackers and chips. Fill another batch with assorted raisins, nuts, dried banana chips and gummy bears. Have small, flavored water bottles ready to simply hand out. I remember those summer shopping carts when I bought the little Kool-Aid flavored drink mixes in as many flavors as possible.\nIt seems I bought mostly grape and orange flavors. Homemade lemonade and sweet tea were saved for dinner time. At one point in the early '70s, with enough package points, you could order the plastic Kool-Aid pitcher with matching drinking cups for free. The Kool-Aid emblem was on the side of the cups.\nSometimes I would mix a package of Kool-Aid and pour in the ice cube trays, freeze and add to the glass of Kool-Aid for fun. This could also be tasty with a mixture of different flavors with the drink and ice cubes.\nMaking lunch sandwiches could be fun by using large cookie cutters to cut the bread. Place the cut-out sandwich on a plate and lay chips and pickles on the side. Use toothpicks to push into small chunks of cheese for added fun and nutrition.\nFROZEN BANANA BITES\n1 cup peanut butter, 4 bananas (sliced into 1-inch rounds), 8 (1 oz) squares semisweet chocolate, 1 tbsp shortening, ⅓ cup toffee baking bits.\nCover a baking sheet with waxed paper. Spoon a thin layer of peanut butter on top of each banana slice. Insert a toothpick through the peanut butter layer into the banana. Place banana bites onto the prepared baking sheet; freeze for 30 minutes to overnight. Melt chocolate and shortening in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Cover another baking sheet with waxed paper. Remove 2 to 4 banana bites from the freezer at a time; coat each bite with chocolate mixture. Place coated banana bites on the second baking sheet; sprinkle each with toffee bits. Repeat until all the bites are coated. Return banana bites to the freezer until set, at least 1 hour. Allow bites to sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes before serving.\nICE CREAM SANDWICH POPS\n6 ice cream sandwiches, 2 bottles chocolate shell topping (such as Magic Shell), 12 popsicle sticks, assorted toppings (such as sprinkles, crushed cookies, nuts, crushed candy bars. We love Oreo cookies.)\nCut ice cream sandwiches in half crosswise. Insert a popsicle stick through up through the center of each cut end. Remove the caps and seals from the shell topping. Place in the microwave and cook for 8 seconds. Pour each bottle shell topping into a glass measuring cup. Dip each pop into shell topping until completely covered, allowing excess to drip off. Dip the top ends in desired toppings and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Freeze pops at least 1 hour before serving.\nCLASSIC PUDDING POPS\nOne of my son John's favorite snacks as a kid was pudding pops. You don't really see them in the stores too often anymore. Here is a homemade recipe for that nostalgic sweet treat.\n2 cups milk, ½ cup evaporated milk, 1 (3.5 oz) package instant chocolate pudding mix, ¼ cup white sugar.\nBeat milk, evaporated milk, instant pudding and sugar in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Pour into ice pop molds and freeze until firm, about 3 hours. Also for this recipe if you are diabetic or making you can prepare it this way. Use zero sugar pistachio pudding, substitute liquid Splenda for the sugar (1/2 tsp) and they are wonderful.\nS'MORES POPSICLES\n2 cups cold milk, 1 package instant chocolate pudding mix, 2 whole graham crackers (crushed), 1 ½ cups vanilla ice cream (softened).\nBeat milk and pudding mix together in a bowl using an electric mixer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Measure 1 1/2 cup pudding and set remaining pudding aside for another use. Sprinkle graham cracker crumbs into the bottom of each ice pop mold; add about 1/4 cup ice cream. Sprinkle another layer of graham cracker crumbs and top with about 1/4 cup pudding. Add a final layer of graham cracker crumbs. Freeze until completely frozen, about 3 hours.\nTROPICAL FRUIT ICICLES\n½ cups low-fat vanilla yogurt, 1 cup sliced mango, 1 (8 oz) can pineapple chunks (undrained), 1 small banana, 1 orange (juiced).\nBlend yogurt, mango, pineapple chunks with juice, banana, and orange juice in a blender until smooth. Pour into ice pop molds; freeze until set, 4 to 6 hours.\nPEANUT BUTTER BANANA\nICE CREAM\n4 ripe bananas cut into 1-inch slices, ¼ cup peanut butter.\nArrange banana slices on a baking sheet and freeze, 8 hours to overnight. Process frozen bananas in a food processor until evenly chopped; add peanut butter and process until thick and creamy.\nSTRAWBERRY LEMONADE\n1 lb. strawberries plus more to garnish, 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, 2 cups fresh lemon juice (strained and divided), ice, lemon slices to garnish.\nHull and quarter the strawberries. Place the strawberries in a large bowl, stir in the sugar and ¼ cup lemon juice. Allow to sit, covered for 30 minutes. In a countertop blender, blend the strawberry mixture until pureed. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve to get the seeds out. In a large bowl, combine the strawberry puree with the remaining 1 ¾ cups of lemon juice and 4 cups of water. Add up to 1 additional cup of water to taste if the mixture is too sweet or strong. To serve, stir the lemonade and pour it over ice. Garnish with sliced lemon and strawberries.\nHOMEMADE FRUIT POPSICLES\nStrawberries, blueberries, raspberries, pineapple and mango are just a few of the fruits you can use here. For this one we will use 2 cups fresh blueberries, raspberries, strawberries and sliced bananas (mixed); 2 cups plain or vanilla yogurt, ¼ cup white sugar, 8 small paper cups, 8 popsicle sticks.\nPlace the mixed blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, sliced bananas, yogurt, and sugar into a blender. Cover, and blend until the fruit is chunky or smooth, as desired. Fill paper cups 3/4 full with fruit mixture. Cover the top of each cup with a strip of aluminum foil. Poke a popsicle stick through the center of the foil on each cup. Place the cups in the freezer for at least 5 hours. To serve, remove foil and peel off the paper cup. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

As I said Tuesday, this is about Meals til Monday as a whole, but it really felt good to be honored.\"\nAllen began working volunteering for Meals til Monday during the pandemic. She then obtained her community health worker certificate to help people access services like Medicare and Medicaid. Allen said this naturally aligned with her work at Meals til Monday.\nHer recognition comes after a yearlong process of filing for grants, receiving donations and working with community organization partners to buy a refrigerated van, which allows Meals til Monday's summer program to reach more children in Dorchester County and expands the program's capabilities.\n\"It's not necessarily about how many more kids that we're reaching as much as it's about what else we can give the kids,\" Allen said. With the van, Allen said they are able to pick up large bins, also known as gaylords, of produce and frozen foods that would otherwise go bad.\nSummer is identified by Food Action and Research Center as the hungriest time for kids because they lose access to free school meals. In Dorchester County, students are provided free daily breakfast and lunch through a federally funded program called the Community Eligibility Provision.\nThis provision is available if 25% or more of the student population participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations or Medicaid, according to the United States Department of Agriculture's website.\n\"We have partnered with Dorchester County Public Schools and we are delivering two meals for seven days to anyone that registers for children 18 and under,\" Allen said.\nAllen said Meals til Monday is still providing regular weekend meal bags for anyone who needs them, and emergency food services are available with options for pick-up or delivery by appointment.\nAllen encourages anyone who wants to volunteer to sign up on the website. \"One of the things that we're trying to do as we continue to grow as an organization is to have the appropriate policies and waivers and things like that for our volunteers.\" Those can be found at midshoremealstilmonday.org.\n\"It feels absolutely wonderful. I am just so honored,\" Allen said about receiving recognition from No Kid Hungry. \"Our primary mission is to feed children.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "We may have lost the National Institute of Health\n\n June 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LARRY PIFER | Section: Columns \n \n 462\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The National Institute of Health, begun by President Franklin Roosevelt in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1940, is now the world's largest public source of funds for bio-medical research. 171 scientists who received Nobel prizes were supported by NIH.Yet the Trump Administration has cut in just 40 days $1.81 billion in current NIH research grants, 30% of which were to reimburse funds already spent. Judges blocked even deeper cuts in current programs.\nNow Trump's budget proposal for next year would cut the NIH budget by 40%. This will dramatically affect their personnel, research, and will slow, if not stop, the progress that is being made in numerous health-related issues. Such research, trials and testing saved us from COVID-19, as just one example of this vital work.\nI am personally affected by this disastrously shortsighted and ridiculous decision. I have glaucoma, and the vision in my left eye is virtually gone. The Wilmer Eye Institute of Johns Hopkins University, the preeminent institute of its kind is presently researching and has made considerable progress in a method of restoring the optic nerve. The institute has lost millions in funding for this and other vital projects, which impact me and the entire world.\nOther Marylanders are especially threatened by these cuts as NIH is still based in Bethesda, and Johns Hopkins is the largest recipient of NIH funding of any medical college in America. These cuts will put added pressure on our state legislature as good jobs and the resulting tax revenues diminish.\nAll other Americans will also suffer. The CEO and chief scientific officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges recently stated:\n\"The administration's announcement that it plans to cut federal support of biomedical research by drastically reducing reimbursement of research costs related to peer-reviewed grants from NIH will diminish the nation's capacity, slowing scientific progress and depriving patients, families and communities across the country of new treatments, diagnostics and preventative interventions.\n\"Every American has benefitted from NIH–supported research, conducted at medical schools, academic health systems and teaching hospitals nationwide. Every American will be harmed by the undermining of the long standing partnership between academic institutions and the federal government.\n\"The government's support of facilities and administrative costs allows medical research to happen. These real and documented research expenses include physical lab operations and maintenance, security, data processing and storage, and daily operations of critical research infrastructure. Make no mistake. The announcement will mean less research. Lights in labs nationwide will go out. Researchers and staff will lose their jobs.\"\n\"As a result, Americans will wait longer for cures and our country will cede scientific breakthroughs to foreign competitors. These are real consequences — slower scientific progress, longer waits for cures, fewer jobs.\"\nI can't imagine that this is what anyone voted for. Why would anyone support it? I most certainly do not. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Talbot County woman gives record $25M to new Easton hospital\n\n July 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 417\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A Talbot County woman and her family made a record $25 million gift toward Easton's in-construction medical center, University of Maryland Shore Regional Health announced Tuesday.It's the largest private donation in Shore Regional Health history and one of the largest ever across the statewide University of Maryland Medical System.\nThe woman, who has requested to remain anonymous, was born over 90 years ago at the former Memorial Hospital in Easton. Shore Regional Health President Ken Kozel said in an interview that he was \"utterly amazed\" at the family's generosity when he learned of the pledge.\n\"I see a woman and a family who just have the kindest heart and the biggest spirit for other people, the health and wellbeing of other people,\" Kozel said.\nThe $25 million will go toward Shore Regional Health's new medical center, a near $550 million endeavor which is under construction on Longwoods Road. It is expected to open in 2028, replacing the current hospital on South Washington Street.\nRebecca Bair, vice president of philanthropy for Shore Regional Health, and members of her team made the donation possible. Kozel said it has been a yearlong process.\nWhen Kozel spoke to the donor, they discussed how rural Americans often struggle accessing quality health care.\n\"Rural hospitals are closing all around the country,\" Kozel said. \"And those that haven't closed yet are at risk for closure because of mainly financial challenges.\"\nEaston's new hospital has been touted as a game-changer for Eastern Shore residents. It will be over 100,000 square feet larger than the town's current hospital, improve efficiency within the medical center's different departments and increase accessibility with its proximity to Route 50.\nDuring early stages of planning the new medical center, Kozel said $25 million was the first \"concept of a goal\" leaders had for a fundraising mark. That \"seemed like an incredible challenge\" years ago, he said, but now they're hoping to quadruple that number.\nAccording to Shore Regional Health leaders, the recent $25 million gift has allowed the organization to expand its capital fundraising campaign from $50 million to $100 million. So far, $62.5 million has been donated, which has all been during the \"silent phase\" of fundraising, Kozel said.\nThe $100 million campaign aims to bring funds not just to facilitate the construction of the new hospital, but what comes after as well, Kozel said. This includes recruitment and retention efforts, technology improvements and advancements to clinical services such as women's health.\n\"Her gift has been the catalyst and the catapult,\" Kozel said of the Talbot County donor. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Aaron Moulden, but Aaron's Place has turned into more than she could ever imagine.\"My father had just passed away, and I couldn't think of any other way to honor him in and his legacy than to honor the work that he did in Baltimore City,\" Beulah said. \"He ran a food pantry and a soup kitchen in Baltimore City. So, I wanted to honor him, and as I tell everyone, I wanted to honor not only my earthly father but honor my heavenly father in doing God's work and serving the communities.\"\nIn 2012, Beulah and her husband, Howard, joined Living Waters Assembly in Denton. Beulah wanted to provide service, so she joined the food pantry at the church and helped elevate the group to serve 300 food boxes per month.\nAfter serving for six years, Beulah began to look for a location to run her own food pantry. She stumbled across a building on the property of Denton Church of Free Seventh-Day Adventist.\nAaron's Place opened its doors in 2019.\nThe food pantry now serves thousands of families in any given month. To get to this point, Beulah credits engaging with the community on their needs and reaching out to other companies for help.\n\"I believe in strong collaboration because I don't think one person can do it by themselves,\" Beulah said. \"I believe in pulling out for support. Since we deal with health-related issues, the person may need assistance with the local health departments, mental health agencies, whatever the case may be.\"\nAaron's Place receives extensions from mental health agencies and the University of Maryland health network.\nAaron's Place receives food from Food Lion in Denton, Food Lion in Federalsburg, Dollar General in Denton, Dollar General in Greensboro, two Dollar Generals in Federalsburg, Aldi's and Walmart. The food pantry also picks up from Save-A-Lot in Greensboro.\nAlong with food, Aaron's Place provides other services and items for anybody in need.\n\"Think of what you need from your head to the toes, so does a person that's experiencing food insecurity,\" Beulah said. \"They're going to need clothing. They need shoes, they need deodorants, they need non-food products, they need personal care products, personal hygiene products, and you can get enough of that.\"\nAaron's Place has purchased a new 140,000 location in Denton where they plan to partner with His Hope Ministries to provide a year-round homeless shelter and multiple different classes, additions and food storage locations.\nWhen Beulah thinks about honoring her father, she gets very emotional.\n\"I just cry,\" Beulah said. \"I still wish he was with me and I know he's with me in my heart. But I just feel blessed to be able to carry on his legacy.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Medicaid covers the cost of giving birth for 40 percent of births in the state, provides help for 1 in 3 persons with disabilities and also covers care for 5 out of 8 nursing home residents. The proposed cuts to Medicaid would result in loss of health coverage for 229,000 Marylanders.\nThere are also proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which would result in 200K recipients losing some or all of their benefits.\nIn addition, some 190,000 Marylanders enrolled in the state's health care marketplace will likely lose their health insurance coverage if tax credits on insurance premiums are not extended.\nI read that Republicans think too many people are enrolled in Medicaid, so they want to cut $625 billion from Medicaid and $300 billion from SNAP.\nPeople who benefit from Medicaid and supplemental food and nutrition programs are the most vulnerable people — mostly children and the elderly — among us. So when you cut Medicaid because too many are enrolled, who's the decider? Who decides who gets kicked out? Without health care and food assistance where do these people go? They don't just disappear. They'll still be there. I suspect hospital emergency rooms will become the obvious health care option. If you're hungry and poor, what are your options? When you distress a population, is it possible that crime will rise too?\nWhat's really behind these cuts? We hear that the most impoverished are being asked to pay this price so that billionaires and the very wealthy can reap the benefits of tax cuts. Billionaires who can buy their own hospitals are going to pay less in taxes. The poor get poorer (and hungrier and sicker) and the rich get richer.\nSo, Dear Andy Harris, how is this OK?\nSen. Mitch McConnell says about these cuts, \"They'll get over it.\" I don't think \"they\" will get over it, but I think we will remember.\nMARION O.

This was about learning how to do what we do better.\"\nThe program included one-on-one mentorship, monthly virtual leadership meetings and three in-person sessions, including a two-day intensive leadership training. Participants also completed a collaborative project addressing a specific health care issue or topic.\nDanielle Wilson, senior vice president and chief nursing officer of Shore Regional Health, championed the program internally and encouraged her managers to apply.\n\"Investing in nursing leadership is investing in patient care,\" Wilson said. \"Nurse leaders have the opportunity and responsibility to continue to innovate and advance standards of care. We are grateful that three of our nurse managers had the opportunity to engage in this transformative initiative.\"\nFor more information on the Nurse Leadership Institute, visit umshoreregional.org/nli. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Just imagine, right?\"\nDrive organizers began collecting box fans and smaller air conditioning unites to donate to neighbors in need.\n\"If you're saying, 'Oh, it ain't that bad outside' cut your AC off. Cut it off. And then you know exactly how hot it is and how desperate people may be to have an air conditioner to cool their home off,\" Chester said.\nSo far, 12 air conditioners have been distributed, along with many more fans, thanks to overwhelming community support.\nA grant from the City of Cambridge funded 10 air conditioners, which must be distributed within city limits.\n\"What I want to say is that the community has overwhelmingly stepped up and has done a very good job with donating fans and ACs. It makes me want to cry,\" Chester said.\nWhile the drive is open to all residents, Chester wants to ensure those taking advantage of the program truly need it. Because of this, the elderly, critically ill individuals, and families with young children take priority when it comes to receiving an air conditioning unit.\nHowever, they are not as strict when it comes to who receives fans because the fans are cheaper to purchase. An air conditioning unit can range from $139 to $150 and Chester said they are not picky about the brand, but the units have to be new.\n\"The air conditioners are so expensive that we can't afford to give them to everyone who needs it, so we're trying to give it to at least the people who needs it the most,\" she said.\nNew box fans and small air conditioners can be brought from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday to Friday to the Dorchester County Health Department at 627 Race St. in Cambridge, according to a press release from the Health Department.\nAccording to Chester, the Cambridge Walmart no longer has A/C units, so people are ordering them online and having them delivered to the Health Department.\n\"Well, I always say, if you want to donate a fan, just go on Amazon and order it and have it delivered here. That way you don't have to leave the comfort of your home. You can stay home in your air conditioning,\" Chester said. \"If you want to donate an air conditioner, same thing.\"\nMonetary donations are also accepted and can be made out to Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Inc. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "From signs to survival: a family’s kidney campaign\n\n August 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 883\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n POTOMAC, Md. — Melanie Flamenbaum and her family are on a life-saving mission to find kidney donors for her sister and brother-in-law, Dana and Andrew Goldstein of Lewes, Del.Her husband, Ed Goldstein, and their sons, Ranan and Brooks, have been posting signs linking to the National Kidney Registry website. They've placed the signs in storefront windows, near a soybean field at the Inn at Huntingfield Creek, and even at a Boston Red Sox–Washington Nationals game.\nLast weekend, they brought the campaign to Kent County while picking up Brooks from camp at Echo Hill. The family stayed in Rock Hall, enjoying the peaceful surroundings while continuing to spread awareness.\nThroughout High Street in Chestertown and surrounding areas, signs share information about Dana and Andrew's circumstances and promote awareness of organ donation.\nFlamenbaum said she overcame any shyness to give her sister and brother-in-law a chance to live and witness future milestones — including those of their daughter, Jelena Goldstein, who recently earned a master's degree from the University of Delaware.\nDana and Andrew's story is deeply personal and heart-wrenching.\nBoth in their 50s, Dana and Andrew have lived with Type 1 diabetes most of their lives, Flamenbaum told Kent County News.\nAndrew was diagnosed in infancy. He underwent radiation treatments that left him with one functioning kidney and a pancreas that never fully recovered.\nDana was diagnosed at age 8 and has been taking insulin ever since.\nOriginally from New York, the couple met while attending Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. Andrew studied biomedical engineering, and they bonded over their shared experiences managing diabetes. They fell in love, got married and later welcomed Jelena.\nDespite their medical challenges, the couple thrived for years. Andrew built a career in the biomedical field, and Dana held various jobs before focusing on raising their daughter.\nBut toward the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, their lives changed dramatically.\nDana was rushed to the emergency room with breathing difficulties and tested positive for COVID-19. She spent two weeks on a ventilator in the ICU and faced a long recovery once discharged.\nEven after the couple relocated to Lewes in 2022, Dana continued to struggle. Climbing stairs became difficult, and weakness persisted. At a routine checkup, her blood and kidney levels raised concern. Soon after, she began dialysis treatment.\nDana initially underwent hemodialysis three days a week, where blood is drained through a chest port, cleaned, and returned to the body. The process was exhausting and consumed much of her energy.\nEventually, she transitioned to peritoneal dialysis at home. Using a port in her abdomen, a cleansing solution flows into the body and is later drained through a hose into the shower. While more convenient than hospital visits, the daily process was just as draining. At first, she performed treatments four times a day. Now, she undergoes dialysis overnight for eight hours while sleeping.\nAndrew was by her side through it all, specially trained to help administer treatment. But soon, his own health began to decline.\nAfter attending a social event, Andrew contracted pneumonia and began experiencing kidney failure. Like his wife, he started with hemodialysis and now performs peritoneal dialysis at home.\nFlamenbaum said that while he is still able to work from home, it is not sustainable long term.\n\"Diabetes and dialysis have taken over their life,\" she said.\nEveryday tasks have become increasingly difficult. Boxes of dialysis solution are stacked in the living room — a constant reminder of their new reality.\n\"Activities we take for granted, like a routine trip for a cup of coffee, are a draining affair for them,\" Flamenbaum said. \"It takes a force of will to just do something natural.\"\nThat's why the family is being proactive — raising awareness, reaching out to as many people as possible, and dispelling fears and misconceptions about kidney donation.\nWith her loved ones' lives on the line, Flamenbaum has become well-versed in the process.\nShe explained that through the National Kidney Registry's voucher program, finding a compatible donor is now easier and more efficient than ever. Donors undergo a comprehensive medical exam, speak with doctors and counselors, and can opt out at any time with no pressure.\nWhile kidney donation is still a major procedure, Flamenbaum said it is one of the safest surgeries with a relatively short recovery time.\n\"Someone who receives an organ from a live donor can generally go back to work immediately,\" she said — something Dana and Andrew hope to be able to do again.\nReceiving a kidney from a living donor also means a lower chance of rejection, fewer anti-rejection medications, and fewer long-term complications.\nFor donors, she said the risk is minimal.\n\"I've talked to people who have donated,\" she said. \"One told me, 'If not for a small scar, I wouldn't even know I did this.'\"\nBut the emotional and spiritual reward, she said, is immense.\n\"They feel really good, emotionally and spiritually, because they've given someone their quality of life back,\" Flamenbaum said.\nThat's the outcome Dana and Andrew are fighting for as they continue their campaign across Maryland and surrounding states. If successful, they plan to have their transplant surgeries at the MedStar Georgetown Transplant Institute, one of the country's highest-volume organ transplant programs.\nFor more information or to begin the donor screening process, visit: nkr.org/TDE863 for Dana or nkr.org/TKZ944 for Andrew.\n\"We want to spread our message as broadly as possible,\" Flamenbaum said. \"We take our signs everywhere we go — and we're not stopping.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Working with Cecil College, Union Hospital has been offering Camp Scrubs since 2014 (pandemic notwithstanding). Hunter said the program has gained popularity with a waiting list for next year. Middle school aged students attend Camp Scrubs in June, with the high school cohort in August.\n\"We had two camps last year and this year,\" Hunter said. \"There will be three next year.\"\nTuition is $315 and eight scholarships are made available each year.\nOn Friday, Camp Scrubs was learning CPR and how to use a mechanized and an inflatable lift — a hover jack and a hover bed respectively — for easier and safer patient transfer. As one group took turns learning the different transfer methods, another was run through the paces of treating a patient in cardiac arrest.\nFor Brionna Iraca-Reeves and Simone Akehurst, Camp Scrubs is an introduction into what each hopes will be a career in medicine.\n\"I've wanted to be a trauma surgeon for as long as I can remember,\" Iraca-Reeves, 16, from Oxford, Pa. said. \"I didn't have a Plan B.\"\nAkehurst, 16, from Bear, Del. also plans to be a trauma surgeon.\n\"We learned a lot in the OR,\" Akehurst said of their visit to an operating room at the hospital on Bow Street in Elkton. \"We saw a total hip replacement and a tonsillectomy.\n\"I also got to hold a gall bladder in the (pathology) lab,\" Akehurst said.\nAlong with getting introduced to the many aspects of a hospital the teens also got to talk with some of its professionals, which Akehurst called valuable.\n\"This morning I got to talk to a general surgeon,\" said the trauma surgeon hopeful. \"He told me trauma surgeon is more medical than surgical. I want the opportunity to do more surgery. General surgery is a very broad skillset.\"\n\"A lot of it is mentoring in the field you want to pursue,\" Iraca-Reeves said.\nIraca-Reeves said any student with health care aspirations should consider attending Camp Scrubs. She credits Hunter with making the program valuable, informative but also engaging.\n\"She's all wrapped up in giving people the best experience,\" Iraca-Reeves said. \"I think it's really important to recognize Katie and all she's done.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The camp hopes to welcome the first session of campers in May 2026.\nFounded in 1988 by Paul Newman, The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp provides a different kind of healing to thousands of children with serious illnesses and family members annually, free of charge.\nRenovations are underway to transform the property's former Aspen Institute buildings into camp-friendly spaces.\nInclusion and accessibility and intention are key components of the camp as it seeks to provide the whole camp experience to all children regardless of illness, according to Hilary Axtmayer, chief program officer.\nFeatures of the developing facility include complete ADA compliant ramps, temperature controlled swimming pool, and bringing vibrant fun colors to all corners of the campus.\nAs a medical camp, a state-of-the art infirmary will serve all camper care on-site.\nBuilding off the success of its original Ashford, Connecticut location, the Hole in the Wall in Queenstown will provide transformative camp experience for Mid-Atlantic children with serious illnesses including rare diseases, and their families.\nLike the original Connecticut location, the Queenstown camp will serve as a place of joy, connection, healing and respite, designed to support not only the child with serious illness but their entire family.\nFor many of these campers and their families, Hole in the Wall provides camp experiences they would not otherwise have opportunity for, Axtmayer said.\nYears in the making, officials are more than excited to expand the camp's reach and bring the medical specialty camp to the area.\nThe Hole in the Wall Gang Camp is always adapting and improving to meet the unique and varied needs of campers and their families, Axtmayer said.\nThe Eastern Shore's centralized location close to Baltimore and Washington D.C is ideal for the camp's extensive hospital outreach program, she said.\nExpanding The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp experience to the Eastern Shore, the future Queenstown campground will soon be a place where children with serious illnesses will have the chance to simply be kids, and, as Newman famously said, \"raise a little hell.\"\nThe camp expects to welcome about 15 families per weekend during its first phase family program sessions opening in May 2026. A second phase to provide independent-camper opportunities is expected further down the line.\nOfficials have begun connecting with hospitals and organizations specializing in rare diseases to help recruit eligible campers.\n\"We can't wait to welcome families,\" Axtmayer said.\nMore information about Hole in the wall can be found at www.holeinthewallgang.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We fret over not enough money or worry about what we will do if we have too much money. Most of us don't have the latter problem.\nWe fret over not enough space or how we care for too much space. We accumulate and store up in our barns and build bigger barns to store up more stuff. We then don't know what we will do with all the stuff.\nHow much does it take to bring you peace and make you happy? Can you be happy in a one-room dwelling place? Does it take a 25-room house to make you feel good? How many cars do you need to make you feel satisfied? Or is satisfaction only a remotely impossible concept? Many years ago, one popular song lamented, \"I can't get no satisfaction.\"\nSatisfaction and happiness may be claimed for a season. Possibly you are satisfied with your vocation, athletic accomplishments, family life, parenting success, fulfillment of life goals and ambitions? Often, we are but then those seasons pass. Careers end, athletic contests become history, retirement comes with memories that fade farther and farther into the past.\nToo often most of us can look back and wonder, \"what if?\" we may say. The problem with \"what if?\" is that it doesn't change anything. If it is in the past, you can't relive it or change it regardless of how great you were or how bad you were.\nAll we have for certain, is today. Even today is iffy. Since today is all we really have then it's best to not mess it up by constantly looking over our shoulders. You can't go forward always looking back.\nIn the Bible there was a man named Lot. He and his wife were told not to look back at Sodom and Gomera. She did and turned into a pillar of salt. Looking back has a way of doing that to all us as we become immobilized in time.\nWhat does it take to make you happy? Someone to love and someone who loves you? A few family members to care for who also care for you? Enough money to pay the light bill and keep food on the table? Something to do during the day that you enjoy? The only person who can answer these questions is you because only you know what it really takes to make you happy.\nHappiness is very much happenstance. Things change every day. Health, sickness, the stock market, families, jobs and hobbies. Friends and loved ones move away or die. Lie is always changing.\nGod never changes. Happiness may vary throughout the day or week, but your joy and peace that comes with faith in God and focusing on Him is something the world cannot give or take away.\nKeep this verse in mind this day regardless of whether you feel happy or if you are down and blue.\n\"You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in you.\" Isaiah 26:3. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "My aging body: 'I feel like I'm being evicted'\n\n August 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ROBERT C. KOEHLER | Section: Columns \n \n 768\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I thought I knew myself pretty well, but then this old-age thing hit ... hard. Both physically and psychologically.I'm still in Appleton, Wisconsin as I write, awaiting my second cataract surgery, right eye, tomorrow. The first one went well. I'm not concerned about No. 2, at least not in and of itself. But I've felt myself plunging into a sense of deeper stress, feeling, with increasing regularity – as I stay here with my loving family – like a shrug of nobody.\nOnly minimally am I a participant in the basics of life. Yeah, things are essentially taken care of for me, which is great – it's why I'm here – but nonetheless it leaves me feeling like a spectator of my own life. And it hurts to get up. Achy thighs, wobbly knees. Plus I don't hear well, don't see well (yet), and am good at pummeling myself into a state of uselessness: what I call I-don't-matterness.\nAs Leonard Cohen said shortly before he died, speaking of his body, \"I feel like I'm being evicted.\"\nAnd that state intensifies the aches and wobbles. Prior to standing up, for instance, I know the pain is coming and psychologically start cringing and grimacing, feeling the pain before it even starts. I'm just an old fart and this is what I get. This is what I deserve. Ouch!\nBut then something happened. This was just a few days ago, as I stood up from the kitchen table. A sense of awareness clicked – I'm not sure why – and my looming pain was not the focus. Instead, I just stood up ... oooh, ahhh ... and it simply was what it was. What I felt wasn't the pain, it was the effort. What? The feeling was there, but I didn't torture myself with it. It wasn't pain, it was simply reality. And my legs pushed against it. They did their job. I was up. Life goes on. I had a smile on my face.\nI'm not saying all is good, all of a sudden. I'm still this old guy and my life is full of challenges. But this click of awareness at the kitchen table has reverberated. Think positive – my God, that's just a cliché. But I don't know how else to put it. It doesn't push away life's difficulties or make life pain-free. It just clears away some of the psychology – the shame and anger, the fear and despair. You know, all those emotions that intensify the hurt.\nOK. Life goes on. But loosening the psychological impact pain had on me seemed to matter. I don't mean in a full-blown way. with life now problem-free. I simply found myself, much to my astonishment, letting myself focus beyond my depression and self-annoyance. There was a bit of a sparkle in me, a sense of self-caring, a sense of ... yes, yes, self-respect, which I had angrily snorted out of my mind.\nI was, and am, staying at my sister's part of the house, which she shares with her daughter and family. One day when she was off somewhere, and I was alone, instead of simply losing myself on my computer and staying invisible – unwanted – I called my niece and asked if her husband was interested in doing a drawing with me, as he had once mentioned to her. It was Sunday, so they weren't working, so this might be a good time, maybe even the only time. She asked him and his answer was yes.\nSo I went over there, and we sat together for an hour, maybe more. We danced with drafting pens and colored pencils and magic markers, and I felt a gleeful fullness in me. I wasn't just \"the guy they were taking care of\" but a participant in their lives. When I came back to Sue's place she was there. She looked and me and said, \"You're in pretty good spirits.\"\nAnd the words stuck. I was. I had reclaimed a sense of agency. I wasn't just living a shrugged-off life of I-don't-matter. I could stand and I could connect. I felt the return of a forgotten self, an abandoned self. And a couple days later, Sue and I went to visit a nearby retirement community – just to look, y'know. Just in case I decided to leave Chicago and move up here.\nThe place had a slogan: Strength. Purpose. Belonging.\nIt was also pretty costly, so I probably won't be moving there. But the words pulled something huge together for me, and still do, as I continue to absorb them. They're all of us, standing up together at the kitchen table. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "‘The most vulnerable’: Rural, inner city communities brace for impacts of Trump's Medicaid cuts\n\n August 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Adams MultiMedia | Section: News \n \n 1323\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Hospitals and medical providers serving rural and lower-income communities are on edge after President Donald Trump's mega bill passed by Congress includes looming Medicaid cuts.Some of them are on the financial edge, literally — and fear the worst.\nTrump's Big Beautiful Bill (BBB) will cut close to $1 trillion from Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\nThe government programs offer medical services to low-income Americans. Close to 78.4 million Americans are enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP, 23% of the U.S. population. BBB cuts aim to reduce Medicaid and CHIP roles by 10.5 million people by 2034 via tougher eligibility rules and work requirements\n\"Everyone's panicked,\" said Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association.\nShe worries about the Medicaid cuts prompting layoffs, hiring freezes, reduced staffing, missed payrolls and hospital closures.\nMedicaid reimbursements accounted for 19% of all U.S. spending at hospitals in 2023. That totals $283 billion of the $1.5 trillion Americans spent on hospital care, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\"Rural hospitals were already in dire straits,\" Mensik Kennedy said of the financial situation and short financial reserves already facing some small-town hospitals.\nNew work requirements require adult Medicaid recipients without exemptions for disabilities to work 80 hours per month. The BBB also institutes copays of up to $35 for Medicaid-related doctor appointments. Work requirements go into place in 2027, while the federal funding changes and copays go into effect in 2028, according to an analysis of the BBB's Medicaid impacts by the Hirija & Chau LLP, a Los Angeles-based law firm.\nMORE THAN HOSPITALSRural and inner-city hospitals in lower-income areas will feel the brunt of the Medicaid and CHIP cuts, according to health care industry experts and executives.\n\"They're the most vulnerable,\" said Peter Kowey, chair of cardiovascular research and a professor of medicine and clinical pharmacology at Thomas Jefferson University.\n\"They don't have the high-end stuff like cardiovascular surgeries or neurology or orthopedic surgeries that generate a lot of revenue,\" said Kowey, who has authored a new book, \"Failure to Treat: How a Broken Healthcare System Puts Patients and Practitioners at Risk.\"\nKowey said hospitals have already been struggling since the pandemic and those overly reliant on Medicaid are facing \"very fragile\" operating margins.\nA report by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform found that as many 700 rural U.S. hospitals are financially struggling and 300 are at risk of more immediate closure.\nDavid Navazio, CEO of Gentell, Corp. a Philadelphia-based medical company specializing in wound care, said rural hospitals don't have the population or revenue bases to give them financial resilience.\nSome hospitals \"never recovered\" financially from the pandemic when other procedures, appointments and surgeries were canceled or not pursued, he said.\nNavazio said the U.S. health system needs more preventive care and more community and other health clinics to serve communities.\n\"Maybe we have too many hospitals,\" he said. \"There's so much more to health care than hospitals.\"\nBut he also worries about how Medicaid cuts will impact health centers in rural and underserved communities with significant Medicaid patient populations..\n\"Those clinics are the ones who are the most vulnerable to closure,\" Navazio said.\nHe called the BBB cuts \"short-sighted\" and cautioned that the result will be more uninsured Americans putting off health needs until they are more serious, then showing up at emergency rooms.\nNavazio said the American health care system still struggles to provide medical services to the uninsured, who are often workers in lower paying sectors or for smaller businesses whose health care plans are not affordable.\n\"The uninsured are really the working poor,\" he said.\nAccording to federal data, 27.2 million Americans were uninsured in 2024. That accounts for 8.2% of the U.S. population and is up from 25 million in 2023, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. The CBO estimates the Medicaid pullbacks could increase the number of uninsured persons by 10 million.\nMensik Kennedy and others worry about the creation of more health care deserts with patients having to potentially drive long distances to deliver babies or for more specialized care.\n\"You are going to see nurses and providers leave,\" Mensik Kennedy said of the Medicaid cuts' potential impacts on rural and other underserved communities.\n\"Once they leave those communities, they aren't coming back,\" she said.\nStruggling hospitals could go toward an emergency room-centric model in order to survive, dispatching other practice areas because of the financing challenges.\nDEBT CRISISConservative backers of the Medicaid cuts say they are needed to cut out waste and fraud and help curtail federal spending and debt loads.\nMedicaid spending will total $873 billion this year, according to federal projections.\nIn 2023, the federal government accounted for 69% of total Medicaid spending and states 31%.\nMedicaid accounts for 18% of total U.S. health care spending (compared to 30% for private insurance, 21% of Medicare and 10% for out–of–pocket payments), according to federal data.\nConservatives favor the Medicaid changes saying they are needed to root out waste and fraud to help better control federal debt, which now totals $37 trillion.\n\"Along with Medicare, Medicaid is the main reason the federal government is hurtling toward a debt crisis. A debt crisis would trigger significant economic hardship and require drastic cuts to both programs,\" the conservative Cato Institute said in an analysis.\nCato said U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports found $31 billion in improper Medicaid payments in 2023 and $500 billion over the last decade.\nCritics of the Trump bill say tax cuts in the measure will magnify federal debt and shift money from the poor via cuts to Medicaid and food stamps to the wealthy via tax reductions.\n'A DIRTY WORD'There have already been efforts from congressional Republicans to recoup some of the Medicaid cuts and help vulnerable hospitals.\nA $50 billion fund was created to help rural hospitals — though skeptics say that falls short of the cuts Medicaid providers will face.\nU.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, wants to double that fund to $100 billion and has introduced a measure to block future Medicaid cuts.\nStates, who accounted for 31% of Medicaid spending in 2023, could try to fill the void of federal cuts. But that is not easy with state balanced budget requirements and a hesitancy even in Democratic states to raise taxes, including on the wealthy.\n\"Raising taxes is a dirty word,\" Navazio said.\nChristoph Dankert, chief network officer at Carrum Health (a San Francisco-based health care technology firm), said hospitals and other providers poised to be impacted need to start forging paths forward well before the BBB cuts commence.\n\"They are going to have a shortfall of funds,\" Dankert said. \"You have to make it somewhere.\"\nHe said a drop in Medicare revenue from hospitals and the potential increase in more uninsured, uncompensated care will put upward pressures on private insurance rates.\n\"It's going to create upward pressure on employer rates,\" Dankert said.\nThe American Hospital Association opposes the Medicaid cuts, saying they will reduce access to care and adversely impact \"the most vulnerable populations\" such kids and those with disabilities.\n'COST CONTROLS'\nThe Medicaid cuts will propel more health care industry efforts to control costs, said Nate Favini, chief medical officer with Pair Team, a California-based digital health company focused on Medicaid.\n\"Controlling costs is a major priority, and there's recognition that the system has significant inefficiencies in how care is delivered,\" Favini said.\nHe said there will also be efforts to help Medicaid patients stay eligible once the work and other eligibility requirements begin.\nBut financially strained hospitals don't have a lot of wiggle room to take more hits, said Eddie Qureshi, CEO and founder of Rainfall Health, an artificial intelligence-focused health technology firm.\nQuareshi said some hospitals have less than 30 days' cash on hand.\n\"We are going to see some hospitals close because they aren't able to keep up with the changes,\" he said.\nBoth Qureshi and Favini say Medicaid and other changes with health care — including a Trump administration's push for more data sharing of medical records and other information — will propel more technology, including AI.\n\"Our most forward-thinking health system partners recognize they can't continue with business as usual,\" Favini said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The county only has about $677,000 available in funding, and all the projects outlined total over $1 million, according to County Administrator Todd Mohn.\nQueen Anne's County Public Schools Opioid Education Partnership will utilize $209,025 of the opioid restitution funds in preventing youth opioid misuse through a school-based program and student-led awareness campaigns. It also aims to educate the broader community through public events, and distributing data-rich materials.\nQueen Anne's County Department of Health Educational Support programs will be provided $89,251 to strengthen overdose education, prevention, and response.\nThis project also includes a re-entry program for individuals released from the detention center and an expansion to the court-assisted recovery program to provide alternatives to incarceration.\nThe commissioners reached a consensus to reconsider other programs at a future time as additional resources and partnerships become available.\nCounties were awarded Maryland's opioid restitution funds to have autonomy to create plans on how to address avoiding addiction in communities, according to County Health Officer Brice Strang.\nPrograms that were traditionally funded have been denied funding this year, including the public school program, he said.\nStrang is now recommending the Board of Health create a county evidence-based mechanism to support current programming and showcase how it is working in the community, such as the school based programing. Strang recommended using the funding to backfill the programs, and \"wait and see\" on federal and state funding.\nA constant messaging to youth in particular is important, he said, and the commissioners praised the works of the Drug Free Coalition, the Student Ambassadors, and county partnerships.\n\"One of the things we already know is prevention is cheaper than treatment,\" Strang said.\nRemembering when programs initially began, Commission President Chris Corchiarino noted just how far the community has come in regard to opioid awareness and preventing overdoses.\nTo continually keep overdose numbers down, Corchiarino said, new initiatives are always needed to keep awareness moving forward and make sure preventive programs stay at the forefront.\n\"And that forefront is in our schools, for sure,\" Commissioner Phil Dumenil said.\nMore information about Queen Anne's County Drug Free Coalition can be found at qacgoespurple.org.\nIn other business it was noted, phase three of the South Island Trail extension project took one step closer as a construction and paving bid was awarded to David A. Bramble Inc. in the amount of $593,030.\nThis approximately 3,500 feet portion of the project faced time constraints due to its wooded and wildlife areas and is set to begin Sept. 1.\nWith a grant through the Maryland Office of Tourism Development, Queen Anne's County Economic and Tourism Development will be taking the show on the road with a mobile visitors center trailer to be purchased from Advantage Trailers for $91,778.\nThe trailer will serve to elevate tourism throughout the county by strategically placing it in high traffic areas and events. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Mobile crisis teams align with the national Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration practices.\nGoals of the mobile crisis teams include providing in-person care and deploying in real time to the location of the person in crisis to begin the process of assessment and treatment, Loewe said.\n\"We really felt with our expertise, in both urban and rural areas, that coming into Southern Maryland could be a really great support for the community,\" Sam Richberg, chief of programs for Santé, said.\nPhone counselors determine if a person's situation can be deescalated on the phone and be connected with appropriate resources or if a team of a clinician and peer support specialist needs to visit them, Richberg said.\nDuring visits, the team identifies what triggered the call, who is involved and next steps. Peer support specialists use their shared experience to make a connection, Richberg said, and they determine which resources to provide to keep someone from going to the hospital or criminal justice system.\nThe team follows up the next day, whether it be in-person or over tele-health, Tina-Marie Brown, a director with Santé, said. At the minimum, the team will visit the client once every seven days for two weeks.\n\"What's great about crisis response services … is the immediacy of the support you get,\" Richberg said. \"You have somebody who then can support you in getting connected to more of that long-term care.\"\nIt could be a child acting out and the parent does not know what to do or talking someone out of suicide, Brown said. Santé can also offer support to law enforcement and the community after a tragedy.\nCommunity outreach is key, Richberg said. Letting people know Santé is available is important, but so is making connections with local resources. They have an agreement to start working in Charles County, too.\nMaryland has just half of the therapists they need, Brown said. The mobile crisis is a stop gap, meaning they can support individuals until they get help or until help becomes available.\n\"If we're doing our job well, we should be connecting that person to community resources,\" Brown said. \"The more support someone has, the more successful they're going to be.\"\nThe workforce for behavioral health is a statewide concern, Loewe said. St. Mary's County worked with St. Mary's College of Maryland and College of Southern Maryland to promote behavioral health degrees.\nAs Santé continues to grow in Southern Maryland, they hope to offer suicide prevention work, Brown said.\n\"It takes a special person for crisis,\" Brown said. \"Not everybody likes it. It's very fast-paced. You never know what you're going to have from one day to the next.\"\nCall the Maryland Crisis Hotline at 988 to connect with crisis teams and resources. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Gamble said the program has since changed to reflect the evolving drug trends in the county.\nGamble said he created Talbot Goes Purple to start a conversation the county wasn't having. He said he was speaking at a fundraiser when he had this realization.\n\"I stood up and I said, 'raise your hand if you talk to your kids about drinking and driving,' and all 400 hands went up. And I said, 'raise your hands if you talk to your kids, your grandkids, about seatbelt use,' and 400 hands went up. And then I said, 'Raise your hand if you talk to your kids about prescription painkillers,' and only 11 hands went up,\" Gamble said.\nFor Gamble, these were conversations that parents, guardians and community members needed to be having with their children to give them the proper tools to handle situations involving drugs.\n\"In my world of policing, 80% of what we deal with is connected to some form of substance abuse,\" Gamble said.\nMaryland has tracked much fewer overdose deaths for the past two years. According to Gamble, there has only been one overdose in Talbot County this year.\nHowever, fentanyl is still a major concern, he said. \"We're not seeing any heroin in Talbot County, Maryland that doesn't have fentanyl in it,\" Gamble said. \"We're seeing a lot of cocaine in Talbot County, Maryland that has fentanyl in it.\"\nEducational efforts through September will be extensive, Goes Purple organizers said, and they will address fentanyl along with other substances.\nTalbot Goes Purple Coordinator Kelley Callaghan said the broadening of the program's focus to include education on marijuana is more important than ever with a potential dispensary coming to Easton, and Gamble agrees.\n\"Youth are being hospitalized for marijuana use,\" Gamble said. \"I want parents to understand, you know, the weed they smoked when they were in college 30 years ago is not the same weed today.\"\nCallaghan highlighted alcohol as one of the commonly abused drugs by youth.\nThere will be posters around Talbot County schools of a real prescription pill next to a fake one, showing how difficult it is to tell the difference.\nTeaching the youth about the Good Samaritan Law, which protects individuals from prosecution for minor drug or alcohol offenses when calling 911 for a medical emergency, is a critical part of the prevention tactics, Goes Purple organizers said.\nIn addition, Talbot Goes Purple provides Narcan trainings and has installed Narcan boxes at several business and trained the employees how to use them. Narcan, or Naloxone, is a medication used during opioid overdoses to reverse or reduce the effects of the drug.\nThere is also a comprehensive toolkit on the Goes Purple website to help families navigate recovery services and find help regardless of insurance status.\nFor resources regarding substance use, visit talbotgoespurple.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "QAC Goes Purple 2025: standing stronger than ever\n\n September 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 709\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n QUEEN ANNE'S COUNTY — QAC Goes Purple is once again rallying the community this season to stand against substance abuse, as county leaders note progress but stress that education must continue.The countywide initiative, launched in 2017, is a collaboration of the Queen Anne's County Office of the Sheriff and the Queen Anne's County Drug-Free Coalition, in partnership with the Opioid Intervention Team and Health Department, Queen Anne's County Public Schools, the county commissioners, the Mid-Shore Community Foundation and other agencies. Its mission is to raise awareness of substance abuse and opioid overdose prevention.\nOne of the program's first actions was to place six opioid signs across the county, updated weekly to show overdose data. At the time, opioid misuse was on the rise.\nIn 2018, Queen Anne's County reported 122 overdoses and 16 overdose-related deaths. By 2024, those numbers had dropped to 18 overdoses and four deaths.\nSo far in 2025, the county has recorded eight overdoses — and no overdose deaths — an encouraging sign, officials said. But they stressed that continued education and prevention efforts are needed to keep the numbers low.\n\"Even one death due to opioids is too many, and work must continue,\" coalition members said.\nEducation, Prevention and Treatment\nThrough awareness campaigns, free Narcan distribution by the county Health Department, a standard reporting system developed by Queen Anne's County Emergency Services, and the QAC Data Dashboard, local leaders say the effort is showing results.\nIn 2025, the initiative expanded its banners across the county to more than 100, all carrying the slogan: \"Taking a stand against substance abuse.\"\nProgress is being seen \"across the board,\" said Warren Wright of QAC Goes Purple. He credited strict penalties for drug sellers, enforcement against tobacco and liquor outlets that sell to minors, and the strong work of the county's Drug Court.\nAlso contributing are Prevention Services, Peer Support Workers and the Local Management Board, which is conducting an asset-mapping project. The county Board of Education has added Bodkin life skills programs for younger students. The commissioners are working with neighboring counties to expand treatment services for residents at the Whitsitt Center.\nYouth Involvement\nRecognizing that most young people make choices about alcohol, tobacco and drug use during middle school, QAC Goes Purple has focused on youth outreach.\nA Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that more than 13% of Queen Anne's County high school students reported taking a prescription drug not prescribed to them — a troubling trend that highlights the need for early conversations at home and in schools, officials said.\nTo reach peers directly, the QAC Drug-Free Student Ambassador Program includes students from public and private schools who design posters, lead team-building events and stage award-winning activities.\n\"We believe that involvement is key to prevention for our students,\" Wright said. \"Join a team, try a club, and discover your passion. After-school programs and activities are offered through schools, the YMCA and the Giving the Edge Foundation.\"\nChanging Perceptions\nQAC Goes Purple emphasizes that substance use disorder is not a choice but a disease that affects the brain. Understanding the science of addiction, officials say, can reduce stigma and encourage compassion.\nSeptember is recognized as National Recovery Month, followed by Substance Use Prevention Month in October. International Overdose Awareness Day is marked every year on Aug. 31 to honor those lost and support families affected by substance use disorders.\n\"We can all make a difference,\" said Emily Keller, Maryland's special secretary of overdose response. \"Hundreds of lives are saved every year from bystanders who had naloxone and knew what to do in the event of an overdose. We have to make sure that anyone who wants naloxone can access it wherever they are and whenever they need it.\"\nFree naloxone is available at the Nielsen Center, 205 N. Liberty St., Centreville.\nUpcoming Event\nThe sixth annual Going Purple Together event will be held Sept. 27 at Church Hill Park from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The family-friendly gathering will feature live music, food trucks, face painting, dunk tanks and raffle prizes, while celebrating recovery and raising awareness.\nThe community is also invited to complete the QAC Goes Purple Marijuana Survey, available at the county Health Department website under the Behavioral Health tab.\n\"Everyone in Queen Anne's County can keep fighting by knowing the facts, discussing them with loved ones, colleagues and friends,\" Wright said.\nMore information is available at qacgoespurple.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The photos of Ellie Griffin, Norah Smith, Harrison Bonovitch, Arthur Schaefer and Josiah Gross were selected from more than 2,600 entries in the society's call for photos.\nEllie, Norah and Arthur are from St. Mary's County and Harrison and Josiah are from Calvert County. Their photos will be displayed on two screens in Times Square above Dos Caminos restaurant in Father Duffy Square.\nEllie is 5 and was diagnosed with Down syndrome when she was born, Jessica Griffin, Ellie's mom, said. Ellie was also selected to be in the video in 2022, but this is the first time the family is going to New York to see it.\n\"I can't wait to see her reaction,\" Griffin said before the event. \"Hopefully she realizes what's happening.\"\nWhile Ellie might not understand everything that's happening, her 8-year-old brother is excited and \"thinks she's famous,\" the mother said.\nOutside of the national society, the family participates with other Down syndrome organizations, Griffin said. They do fundraisers with the Down Syndrome Diagnosis Network and have raised over $20,000 to connect families who are new to the condition, in which a person is born with an extra chromosome causing mild to moderate cognitive disability, developmental delays and physical challenges.\n\"It's amazing the support that we get through our community,\" Griffin said.\nGriffin is also a parent volunteer with Jack's Baskets, which hand delivers baskets with gifts and resources for families to celebrate babies with Down syndrome.\nThe Times Square video presentation kicks off the New York City Buddy Walk. The walk has taken place in New York City since 1995 as part of the National Buddy Walk Program.\nThe National Down Syndrome Society video allows Ellie and the other Southern Maryland residents to advocate the message of inclusion, Griffin said. The photos were taken by 21FIVE Photography by Teresa Tucker, a resident in Southern Maryland who did free photoshoots for the kids to submit to the society.\n\"Everyone's goal is to support their kids and help them be the best versions of themselves,\" Griffin said.\nEllie does not have a lot of words, but she is a huge Taylor Swift fan, Griffin said. When Swift plays Ellie screams \"Tay Tay\" and starts dancing and singing.\n\"She's been hitting a lot of the words to the songs,\" Griffen said. \"We think it's actually helped improve her language and speech skills.\"\nThe presentation was slated to be live-streamed on the National Down Syndrome Society Facebook page from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. on Sept. 6. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge man urges water caution after 'flesh-eating bacteria' infection\n\n September 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 942\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Facing a life-altering bacterial infection from the local river, a local couple is urging the community to be more informed swimmers.A typical day at the shore turned a couple's lives upside down after a sharp step opened a wound on a man's leg and exposed him to bacteria in the Chester River last summer.\nFor over a year, Kyle \"Slade\" Register, of Cambridge has been fighting Vibrio, a \"flesh-eating\" bacteria found in local rivers.\nRegister and Audra Williamson were swimming in the Chester River on Aug. 16, 2024 when Register stepped on what they presume was a sharp oyster shell and cut a small, deep gash on the inside of Register's left foot. The couple quickly went to work cleaning the wound with peroxide and rubbing alcohol and scrubbed it with antibacterial soap before wrapping it.\nGoing to bed as normal, \"We never dreamt we would wake up the next morning to his foot being the size of a bowling pin with a red streak starting up his leg,\" Williamson said.\nRegister spent a week at the hospital in Easton before being transferred to University of Maryland Shock Trauma, where he stayed for the following month. While there, Register had four surgeries to save his leg.\n\"It's been a year, and he is still going to wound care twice a week,\" Williamson said.\nRegister is unable to work full-time with the wound, as the two-inch gash ended in the entire inside of his left calf and the inside of his left foot being cut out, with a wound vac attached for months.\nThe couple went from having a \"pretty normal life,\" to losing work and having their lives turned upside down, Williamson said.\nNow beginning to get back on their feet, the two are sharing their story as a precautionary tale to others taking a dip.\n\"We just want to prevent this from happening to others,\" Williamson said.\nAccording to the U.S Environmental Protection Agency, Vibrio are naturally occurring bacteria found in brackish environments like the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, such as the Chester River. In rare cases, swimmers can develop illnesses or infections if an open wound is exposed to polluted water.\nA \"tough construction worker type,\" who never thought twice about what was hidden in waterways, Register said his entire view of the water changed after that incident.\nA \"fish,\" all his life, Register now looks at the water with \"abject sadness.\"\nTaking it one day at a time, the Cambridge couple still drive around the Chesapeake Bay, estuaries, and areas like Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge to look at the water \"but I don't go in,\" Register said.\nLooking back on the treatment and recovery he has faced and the journey still to come, \"I don't want a parent to feel that pain,\" Register said and seeks to share his story with others.\nNot to scare people, but to help them understand the possibilities, Register said. \"The public needs to be more educated about this,\" he said.\nWilliamson encouraged checking out the local environmental organizations information and the EPA website before swimming or boating.\nRegister welcomes the opportunities to share his story and can be reached at sladeregister81@gmail.com.\nAccording to Shorerivers' Swimmable ShoreRivers Bacteria Monitoring Program Report, \"Is it safe to swim in the river?\" is one of the most common questions Riverkeepers hear from community members. There are inherent risks with coming in contact with water in a living estuary, and ShoreRivers works to understand the bacterial levels associated with enterococci, an EPA recommended indicator for human health risks.\nEnterococci includes more than 17 species of fecal bacteria and is found in the intestines of warm-blooded animals. High levels of enterococci can indicate elevated risks for human contact with pathogens and other bacteria, such as E-coli. While there are natural bacteria levels in local rivers due to wildlife and decomposition, there are also pollution sources such as failing septic systems and faulty sewer lines, pet waste, mishandling of boat waste, and some organic fertilizers that can pose threats to human health.\n\"There are additional risks with open water swimming that we do not regularly monitor, including vibrio, toxic algal blooms, and other biological and chemical toxins,\" according to the report.\nShoreRivers' seasonal bacteria monitoring program regularly monitors nearly 50 sites where people frequently come in contact with water, including popular swimming locations, marinas, yacht clubs, and towns. Swim Tester volunteers collect water samples every Thursday morning from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Riverkeepers then analyze the samples and distribute data on bacteria levels in the river, aiming to provide the public with the information needed to make educated decisions about their contact with the water.\nThe Swimmable ShoreRivers program utilizes the standardized EPA criteria for recreational swimming of 104 Colony Forming Units (CFU)/100ml for analyzing a single bacteria sample. Anything equal to or higher than 104 CFU is a failing sample, and anything below 104 CFU is a passing sample. Not all test sites are designated swimming areas.\nAccording to Shore Rivers, bacteria levels can change, particularly as a result of significant rain events.\nShoreRivers always recommends following best practices when recreating in local waterways including rinsing off after swimming, avoiding swimming for 24–48 hours after a rain event, and staying out of the water with open cuts or wounds to minimize exposure to potentially harmful bacteria.\nAs part of its ongoing work to protect and restore local rivers and creeks, ShoreRivers weekly bacteria monitoring reports are posted every Friday from Memorial Day to Labor Day at www.shorerivers.org/swim.\nThough the seasonal Swimmable ShoreRivers testing has wrapped up for this year, a full report on each regularly monitored site is expected in October.\nInformation on how to prevent and respond to possible infections, can be found in the Maryland Department of the Environment. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'It's rewarding and motivating': Eastern Shore resident speaks on recovery\n\n September 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Local News \n \n 573\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Norm Townsend spent his entire life on the Eastern Shore, growing up in Easton and spending half of his life in Cambridge. Since starting his sobriety journey in 2017, he said his \"life has gotten 100% better.\"For Townsend, recovery is a daily practice. He participates in Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, has a sponsor, sponsors four others and has worked and re-worked the 12 steps over and over.\n\"We never complete it because once we finish the steps, we just go through them over again, and every time we go through them again, there's something else that we work on,\" Townsend said.\nTownsend frames recovery as a lifelong lifestyle rooted in spiritual principles. He believes choosing the right peers in the 12-step rooms are critical. \"Vigilance is the key to success,\" Townsend said.\nHe's been in and out of recovery since May of 2017, relapsing for a few years following his first time getting sober. He now works as a peer support specialist at Grace Street Recovery in Easton and has adopted the philosophy of recovery as a lifestyle.\nAs a peer support specialist, Townsend connects individuals with housing or treatment options. \"It's rewarding and motivating seeing people still stuck out there in a spot that I was at,\" he said.\nThough he finds the work rewarding, it's also difficult. \"It's kind of like a double-edged sword. You get attached to people and try to help, you know, and some of them don't make it,\" Townsend said.\nHe described addiction as a disease where drugs or alcohol are a symptom of an underlying issue, saying it's like having a hole that needs to be filled.\n\"You have to make sure you're filling that hole with the right things, which is like spiritual principles, the program, being honest,\" he said. \"Because the disease can show up in other ways.\"\nFor Townsend, acceptance really came with the fourth of the 12 steps, which is when he wrote down an inventory of his life. He said he no longer feels guilt or shame because he's no longer the person on that piece of paper anymore.\nHe's stopped doing the things that once caused him shame.\n\"I'm a totally different person than that. And that's the blessing of this is our message, is hope. Our promise is freedom from active addiction,\" Townsend said.\nIn his sobriety, Townsend takes pride in having stability at work and being an improved parent to his two kids and partner to his girlfriend.\nTownsend also expressed his gratitude toward Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble for the work he does for the recovery community.\n\"I mean, he's a huge resource and a huge asset to the recovery community here in Talbot County,\" Townsend said. \"You know, he does a lot of behind the scenes stuff that people don't know about. He really cares and that's that's a plus.\"\nHe is also appreciative of the Talbot Goes Purple initiative, which was spearheaded by Gamble to raise awareness about substance abuse and prevention. Townsend said it allows him to remember those he's lost to the disease and to think about how far he has come.\nHis advice for people who are seeking to get sober but may not know how is to not be afraid to ask for help.\n\"The best thing you can do is just ask for help, man. There are plenty of resources out there and people that would do anything for you to help you get on the path that they're on,\" Townsend said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That number hiked to about 300 walkers last year, they reported.\nOn Thursday, marking a gigantic leap, 535 people participated in the Suicide Prevention Walk on the medical center campus, including VA employees — leadership, clinicians, staff — and VA volunteers. Military veterans, their families and community members also walked the route during the event.\nIn addition to raising awareness about the help available to prevent suicide, the walk helps reduce the stigma associated with suicide and mental health challenges.\nAlong the path of the walk, with a route that started outside the chapel and ran through sections of the campus, stations were set up and they offered activities like drumming, painting rocks, creating hope boxes, and petting ponies from one of the VA's community partners, Chesapeake Therapeutic Riding in Harford County.\nIn addition to the walk, there was a Health & Resource Fair for veterans in the gym.\nEach year, there is a unique, commemorative T-shirt featuring artwork by one of the veteran patients.\nU.S. Army Veteran Nicole Spencer (Army 82nd Airborne) created the artwork on the T-shirts that were given to the people who participated in Thursday's event, according to a VA spokeswoman, who commented, \"Nicole began exploring her creative talents in recent years, through multiple tough health challenges, and says it helped her get through some long stays in the hospital.\"\nThe slogan for this year's event was \"Hope Through Connections.\"\nVeterans can sign up for VA health care at V-A-gov and ANY Veteran in crisis can call 988 and press 1 for free, 24/7, confidential help.\nAmong other activities the VA Maryland Health Care System has planned for Suicide Prevention month is a Tree of Life/Day of Remembrance ceremony on September 29. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In addition, local health departments will host listening sessions to understand community needs and solicit ideas and recommendations. Feedback on the program will close on Sept. 30.\nThe program will provide $50 billion to 50 states over the course of five years. Maryland is projected to see $100 million of those funds. However, the state still needs to apply for the program in order to receive the money.\nHalf of those funds will be distributed based on rurality, quality of the application and state policy, while the other half will be distributed equally among all states upon approved applications, according to Maryland Department of Health's website. Once applications are approved, funds will be distributed from 2026 to 2030.\nThe strategic goals of the program are prevention and management of chronic disease, behavioral health, sustainable access, workforce development, innovative care and tech innovation.\nThe dates of the listening sessions can be found at health.maryland.gov, and questions regarding the process or feedback on the program can be sent to mdh.transformruralhealth@maryland.gov.

The rain did nothing to stop walkers and runners of all ages from participating in the 2025 5K Color Fun Run/Walk, benefiting Kent Goes Purple.Kent Goes Purple is a substance abuse awareness and prevention initiative of the Kent County Sheriff's Office and Chestertown Rotary Club, engaging the community and youth to stand up against substance abuse.\nNow into its seventh year, the race began bright and early at Wilmer Park, extended down South Cross Street, turned at John Brown Road then returned to the park for a finish.\nIt kicked off with purple foam bubbles shooting courtesy of Willy Woo Woo Productions and a burst of blue paint at the finish line coating everybody. People scattered playfully away, ducking under the police tape heading for the road.\nAlong the route, participants, if they asked for it, were doused in more paint by over-eager students. Roadside, the Chestertown Elks Club provided water and encouragement. Police did a great job ensuring participants were safe from traffic as mothers walked their children in strollers, friends ran beside each other and dads jogged with their daughters.\nAfter the race, the Purple Jamboree was held at the park. Kids danced and played in the foam machine of Willy Woo Woo, who provided some sports games, popcorn, cotton candy and snow cones.\nPaul Gunther's Catering offered cheeseburgers and grilled chicken sandwiches.\nAlong the walkway toward the water, Shore Community Outreach Team were on-hand to administer health advice and blood pressure checks, the Elks informed people of their kids Drug Awareness Program handing out Frisbees, coloring books and other items. Recovery in Motion and the The AF Whitsitt Center offered assistance and information about their programs.\nAndy Meehan Chestertown Rotary Club member said, \"We had a very enthusiastic turnout.

    "content": "Local testicular cancer survivor shoots for a hole in one\n\n September 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Amelia Blades Steward | Section: Events \n \n 867\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n According to Johns Hopkins Brady Urological Institute, testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers in young men, with nearly 10,000 new diagnoses each year in the United States. It is highly curable when it first develops but can quickly spread if not treated promptly.Andrew Dorbin of Preston is a husband, father and testicular cancer survivor who hopes to educate men about the risks and symptoms of testicular cancer at the \"Putts Fore! Nuts\" miniature golf tournament on Oct. 18 from 11:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Embers Island Mini-Golf in Ocean City. The rain date will be Oct. 25.\nDorbin was diagnosed with late-stage testicular cancer (Choriocarcinoma) in the spring of 2023. It then metastasized to his lungs and abdomen.\nWhile undergoing multiple rounds of chemotherapy, he was overwhelmed by the generosity of his family, friends and community, who rallied to support him and his family through his diagnosis and treatment. That experience of compassion and care lit a fire in him.\n\"During my longest inpatient stay at Johns Hopkins Hospital, I witnessed other patients facing their battle alone without the same support system I had. That was hard for me to stomach. It made me realize that I wanted to give back when I was able and build something that could offer strength, resources and connection to others navigating their fight against testicular cancer,\" Dorbin said.\n\"Honestly, I'm not particularly good at regular golf — I'm only there for my friend's comic relief — but I've always enjoyed miniature golf and came up with this funny tournament name on one of the sickest days of my treatment,\" he said.\nThe idea eventually grew, and Dorbin founded the Wayfinders Testicular Health Fund, a component fund of Chesapeake Charities Inc., a Maryland-based nonprofit. The fund is focused on raising awareness, providing education and building a supportive community fighting this disease.\nHe is committed to making testicular health a topic that young men are not afraid to talk about and ensuring that no one faces cancer without a community standing beside them. The tournament is the first step to accomplishing that.\n\"I chose an amazing partner in Chesapeake Charities to help make my dream a reality. The money that was used to found this venture came from what was left over from my personal GoFundMe campaign, making this essentially a 100% community-funded initiative,\" Dorbin said.\nThe fund's fundraising efforts will go toward community networking opportunities and mental health and wellness programs to ensure no one feels like they are facing the testicular cancer fight alone. Dorbin hopes his educational outreach will encourage young men to challenge the stigmas and pay attention to their health.\n\"We are encouraging our communities of young men, ages 14 to 35, to be aware of their bodies and to take action when something doesn't feel right,\" he said.\nDorbin reflects on his journey, sharing, \"My journey almost ended before it started. When I found the lump, I almost didn't act. It seems petty now, but I was worried about the cost of my health insurance deductible and thought it was nothing serious. Through the encouragement of a friend who was a nurse, I decided to get it checked out. If I had not acted as quickly as I did, I'm not sure I would be sitting here today.\"\nHe said that, like him, men in their early 20s and 30s feel they are invincible and that they will not develop any major medical issues.\n\"No one wants to go to the doctor when they are young. Also, I had never been shown how to correctly check myself for abnormalities in my testicles. Self-examination is key to early detection,\" he said.\nDorbin hopes that teens and adults will participate in the tournament while learning more about the disease and how to protect themselves and their loved ones. He shares that the event will also create community connection — helping people learn who the disease is affecting, what support people need and connecting people to resources in the community.\n\"This event is going to be a blast. Participants can expect to play two rounds of mini-golf, all while challenging their knowledge, luck, and putting skills. Hole Hecklers — professional comedians will set up a mock sports casting both at one of the miniature golf holes and roast participants as they putt. We also have a variety of prizes and awards that will make the event enjoyable for everyone. For me, the best part is that you don't have to be standing on the podium to walk away a winner,\" Dorbin said.\nIn the future, Dorbin hopes that the Wayfinders Testicular Health Fund can support outings for survivors of testicular cancer and help build a community of survivors, since many men still suffer in silence with the stigma attached to the disease.\n\"This launch would not be possible without the incredible generosity of my friends, family, and neighbors here on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Their belief in this mission, and in me, has carried me through the toughest years of my life,\" he adds.\nSponsorships are still available for the event. Registration information and sponsorship opportunities are available at wayfindersthf.org. Participants are limited, and registration will be available online on Sept. 18. Registration is non-refundable.\nFor further information, contact Andrew Dorbin at wayfindersthf@gmail.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Caroline County officials share why substance use awareness is bigger than just a month\n\n September 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 793\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — While all Caroline County substance use awareness programs acknowledge the importance of \"Caroline Goes Purple\" in September, they know the work is done all year-round.The Caroline County Health Department credits this work for a dramatic reduction in overdoses.\nAccording to Health Department officials, in 2023, Caroline County experienced 19 overdoses. In 2024, the number was less than 11 overdoses, and that trend seems to be continuing this year.\nWhen number is under 11, the county is not allowed to share the exact number due to state regulations, officials said.\nThe efforts to reduce overdoses are celebrated during the month of September, when the county holds multiple substance use awareness events to connect residents to services the county provides. Jessica Tuel, director of Caroline County Behavioral Health and director for Caroline Goes Purple, said all these events are designed to show residents they're not alone.\n\"I think that people need to understand that a lot of these events are obviously to bring education and prevention services, but it's also to provide connection to those who are experiencing substance use,\" Tuel said. \"We have a motto here. It is 'the opposite of addiction is not sobriety, it is human connection.' So, by bringing these things to the community, number one, it gives a level of education and prevention services, but it also helps those who have been through it or going through it know that they're not alone.\"\nThis is a goal stakeholders in Caroline County try to meet outside of September.\nMonthly, the county and several municipalities hold joint meeting, called the Drug Free Caroline Group, to close gaps in service so the county can be strong year-round.\n\"We have a local drug and alcohol council meeting once a month to discuss trends that's happening,\" said Sloane Franklin, Caroline County state's attorney. \"It has the law enforcement, courts, mental health, and substance abuse counselors, clergy, county behavioral health or substance abuse programs… We talk about grants that might be available to our partners to go out, and I seek those grants so they can continue to provide services to these people.\"\nThese services include a \"safe station\" located at the Caroline County Sheriff's Office.\nThe safe station allows an individual to come into the Sheriff's Office and say, \"I need help.\" An off-duty officer will then search the person and confiscate any paraphernalia without charging the person.\nThe Sheriff's Office also has an on-site peer, Kristie Thompson, five days a week in partnership with the Sante Group. Thompson goes into the community and makes residents aware of options available.\nThompson said the goal is to get the individual experiencing substance-related difficulties into inpatient treatment.\n\"Our partnership and relationship with Sante Group is is definitely a high point for the county as far as being able to provide this service to citizens of Caroline County,\" Caroline County Sheriff Donnie Baker said. \"As far as working out of this building, having one of their employees here being able to people who are in distress needing support services or wanting to get off controlled dangerous substances, I think that is definitely a high point when you can take somebody and give them the services they need.\"\nThe Health Department is another community partner that helps residents be aware of the dangers of substance use and their options. Tuel highlighted some of the services the Behavioral Health extension offers.\n\"We have a level one outpatient mental health and substance use program,\" Tuel said. \"We serve a lot of different people throughout various stages of substance use. We provide medication-assisted treatment, as well and we have clinicians in the schools. We do mobile treatment for adults and for kids at the both high schools, and we're expanding into the middle schools. We try to offer as many services as we are able to as a public health system.\"\nTuel said the key to reducing overdoes in the county has been including peers who have lived the experience to help others still struggling.\n\"I think that in the last couple of years, we've done a really great job of including peers,\" Tuel said. \"Peers are those who have lived experience and are on the other side of it. They've really given us a great perspective and hope that we're doing the right thing and that there is success in this.\n\"I think that sometimes as first responders, and sometimes people in our field, what happens is we get very discouraged because we don't see the hope at the end. Having peers embedded in a lot of these services, like at the sheriff's department and in our services at the Health Department and throughout the community, it really even gives us hope that we're doing the right thing and that we're on the right path and that people can heal and they can get better.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "We need each other to sharpen conversation skills\n\n September 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MELINDA BURRELL | Section: Columns \n \n 516\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n September, and \"back to school,\" is a great time to sharpen skills. When life feels as complicated and fast-changing as it seems right now, it's particularly good to build our communication skills.Better communication gives us stronger relationships, and stronger relationships help us navigate challenging times.\nA few insights from neuroscience are especially helpful.\nHumans evolved to survive in groups. Because of that, we worry about how well we're fitting in with our group. We're constantly looking for clues about what others think about us.\nIf someone belittles us, shuts us out, or treats us unfairly, our Spidey sense goes off. We fear it means we're not part of the group, which is dangerous for our survival. We sense a social threat, and social threats are so urgent for us that they activate the same brain circuits as physical threats.\nManagement guru David Rock developed the SCARF model to describe these key social situations in which we can either feel socially threatened or rewarded.\nEssentially, we're hardwired to crave five things: status (being valued by others), certainty (having information to predict the future), autonomy (having some control over our lives), relatedness (feeling connected to others) and fairness (being treated reasonably).\nIf we get those five things, we relax. Our defenses come down, and we can talk openly and creatively with others. Sounds like a basis for a rich conversation, right?\nHowever, if we don't get those things, we feel threatened. We tend to shut down and lose our ability to think rationally. A Case Western Reserve University study showed that being rejected immediately lowers people's IQ by 25% and their reasoning ability by 30%, while also making them more aggressive. Sounds like a basis for a fight.\nSo how do we build our skills to create positive SCARF conditions in our interactions and avoid creating negative ones?\nFirst, think about how often you do the following, in both team and family settings. Give yourself a \"SCARF score.\" Then brainstorm ways you can increase your SCARF score.\nAffirm others' status: Go out of your way to acknowledge other people, especially when they contribute something to a team or family situation. Listen and ask questions that show you're interested. Don't publicly give negative feedback or compare people, especially family or team members.Provide certainty: Share information that helps others to plan, such as expectations or constraints for an event or a family vacation. Explain decisions. Don't unexpectedly change plans or forget to follow through on promises.Offer autonomy: Delegate decisions and tasks where you can, so that others share control over joint projects, whether job-related events or family routines. Offer options for people to choose between. Don't always be the problem-solver, but instead encourage others to resolve issues.Foster relatedness: Deliberately and regularly create time to be together, including meals (without devices!). Don't exclude members of your team or family from shared events.Uphold fairness: Apply rules consistently to everyone and offer everyone a voice in decisions. Don't be silent when you've made a mistake or been unfair.\nSeptember temperatures are cooling. Let's help tempers cool as well! Build your SCARF skills and enjoy richer, more fulfilling conversations and connections.\nWe need each other. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Trump Administration's public health decisions, in particular those of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., appear to be based more on the results of a political calculus than established medical facts and experience.Indeed, we recognize that medicine is not free of erroneous practices. For centuries, blood-letting was considered a necessary adjunct to the treatment of serious illness. George Washington was bled multiple times on his death bed without success. Up until recently, we recommended that all families have syrup of Ipecac on hand to give to a child who had ingested a possible poison. This was found to be counterproductive and the practice discontinued.\nPossibly the most important pediatric issue that RFK has questioned has been with regard to vaccines.\nStarting over 100 years ago, vaccines began to be an essential part of childhood health management. The result has been a dramatic increase in the survival of children. Before widespread vaccine use, death from infectious diseases in childhood was common. It is estimated that more than one in five children in the United States died before five years of age of infection in the early 1900s. Of the eight most common infections, seven are now prevented by vaccination, and the death rate from these diseases has almost vanished.\nIn many cases, increasingly so at the present time, vaccines are approved only after study in the laboratory and with live patients. Longitudinal study is a further safeguard. An oral vaccine against the diarrheal illness cause by rotovirus is a good example where a rare adverse event was observed in practice and the vaccine was withdrawn, reformulated and reintroduced. The currently approved vaccine is considered to be much safer than the original formulation.\nVaccines are incredibly safe. RFK mis-uses data from the Vaccine Adverse Reporting System to scare parents into believing that there have been multiple childhood deaths caused by vaccines. With our 80 years of experience, neither of us has seen a vaccine-related event that caused pediatric death. Furthermore, he has continued to contend that vaccines, in spite of multiple studies to the contrary, cause autism.\nThe question can be raised as to why does RFK carry forth this program of mis-medicine?\nAs a very public person, we can look to his own life for possible answers. It is known that at some time in the past, RFK Jr. harbored a parasite in his brain. This has apparently been shown to be inactive. However, he retains evidence that his brain contains a cyst with calcification. In addition, he suffers from a disability called spasmodic dysphonia. It should be noted that this rare disability is not due to a local vocal cord dysfunction but is the result of a central neurologic, i.e. brain, abnormality. Finally, he has reported that he had evidence of heavy metal (mercury) poisoning that required medical treatment. Mercury poisoning is a serious problem and can cause neurologic damage as the people of Minamata, Japan, can attest.\nIs it not reasonable to ask whether a person who has almost dictatorial power with regards to our children's health has compromised neurologic function? The problem here, as we mentioned above, is that any discussion of RFK and his bizarre behavior and decisions is deflected by the underlying political ramifications of such questioning. We ask, in all due deference, should our children's health and even survival be determined not by science, but by a single person's political beliefs.\nDR. BRIAN J. CORDEN\nDR. JUDITH P.

Because of recovery Whitby learned to surrender and make amends to rebuild relationships. Whitby was able to be the mother that her children deserved and be the person she wanted to be.\nKnowing there were others out in the community with their own similar experiences helped shape Whitby and she was eager to pay that forward to inspire others and be part of that journey.\n\"Today I chose to live,\" Whitby said.\nComprehensive support services\nUnderstanding the many avenues that go hand in hand with recovery, organizations connected the community with the tools for support including behavioral and mental health, social services, gambling help, out and inpatient services, as well as resources for loved ones of those facing diseases of addiction.\nMid Shore Behavioral Health, is proud to continually work closely with community and county health departments and administration to erase stigma and further advocacy said Alisha Saulsbury, forensic mental health program manager.\nSeeing people smile proud of themselves on their recovery journey makes it all worthwhile, Saulsbury said.\nMore information about Mid Shore Behavioral Health can be found at midshorebehavioralhealth.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Notice a copperhead? Leave it alone\n\n October 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Ilana Williams iwilliams@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 732\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Steve Irwin was Brittani Long's idol growing up. Too bad the copperhead snake that bit her foot didn't get the joke.Long, a resident in Mechanicsville, got bit by the snake when she checked on her chicken and ducks after work one evening in July, she said. It was too dark to see the copperhead snake in her path, which was between a shed and her back deck stairs.\n\"I knew they existed,\" Long said. \"But I never would have expected to see one.\"\nWhen the first paramedic arrived, Long received epinephrine and Benadryl, she said. At the hospital, she was given an IV and morphine, but not CroFab, a type of antivenom.\nCopperhead snakes are one of two venomous snakes in Maryland, Beth Schlimm, Maryland state herpetologist, said. The other is the timber rattlesnake, which is primarily in the western part of the state.\nCopperheads are tan or a light bright with darker blotches being an hourglass or a Hershey's Kiss shape.\nThe active season for most snakes, including copperheads, is April through October, Schlimm said. During the fall, snakes look for places to spend the winter.\nMedStar Health in St. Mary's County treated 18 people for snake bites so far this year.\nSwelling can progress quickly, which affects the doctor's decision to give antivenom, Dr. Maria Lawrynowicz, emergency department doctor at Medstar Health in St. Mary's County, said.\nIf bitten, it's recommended to take off jewelry and immobilize the joint to slow the venom. Doctors will mark where there is redness and swelling and do measurements on the area that was bitten to see how fast swelling progresses.\nIf the doctor decides to administer CroFab, they start with four vials, Lawrynowicz said. Each vial can cost between $3,000 to $6,000. A repeat dose is given every six hours depending on the swelling, blood count and ability to clot blood, which is tested every few hours.\n\"This isn't something we give to everyone because it's extremely expensive,\" Lawrynowicz said.\nAnyone who receives antivenom goes to the intensive care unit for 24 hours to monitor swelling, blood pressure and dizziness, the doctor said. If patients are seen for a small copperhead bite and they don't receive antivenom they usually can go home after six to eight hours with measurement marks.\nThere will be local symptoms around the bite like puncture marks, redness, pain, swelling and bruising, Lawrynowicz said. Around a quarter of copperhead bites are dry bites, meaning the snake gives a warning shot and does not release any venom.\n\"If you're going to get bit by a [poisonous] snake, a copperhead is one to get bit by,\" Lawrynowicz said.\nMore severe bites can affect the whole body over the course of hours, she said. These symptoms include dizziness, low blood pressure, local tissue destruction and bleeding and oozing from the site.\n\"I was terrified,\" Long said. \"I kept it elevated the whole time to keep the main swelling away from my foot.\"\nLong experienced swelling up her leg to her thigh, she said. Once the swelling went down, her leg was bruised for three or four weeks.\nUniversity of Maryland Charles Regional Medical Center treated three people since the start of 2025 for copperhead bites, Dr. Maxwell Ginsburg, medical director and chairman of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the center, said. Each of them required the use of CroFab.\n\"Copperhead bites are not something the medical center sees often, but it is something they are aware of and always have the antidote for,\" Ginsburg said. \"The sooner you get started, the better the outcome will be.\"\nFor any snake bite, do not suck out the venom, cut into the wound, apply a tourniquet, shock the area or apply ice to the area, Lawrynowicz said. After getting bit, immobilize the joint then go to the emergency room.\n\"Don't mess with snakes,\" Lawrynowicz said. \"If you're hiking, stick to the trails … if you do get bit don't try to get the snake.\"\nCopperheads are often found in spots with lots of leaf litter or wood and rock piles, Schlimm said.\nIt's best to keep yards maintained and clean. If homeowners have bird feeders or cat food outside, keep them away from the house. During the summer and at night, wear closed-toed shoes during yard work, don't reach into dark areas, wear garden gloves and try to use a rake to pull debris.\n\"It's not something to be afraid of,\" Schlimm said. \"It's just a species to be aware of and to be cautious around.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'To save lives, break the silence': Speakers share suicide prevention experiences\n\n October 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARTY MADDEN mmadden@somdnews.com | Section: State News \n \n 662\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The aim of the day was pretty basic — \"to save lives, break the silence and remind every person that hope is within reach.\"The Southern Maryland Suicide Prevention Summit, a four-hour session, was a way to share strategies to stop someone from ending his or her life.\nHosted by Unstoppable You Ministries Inc., the event was held Sept. 27 at University System of Maryland's Southern Maryland location in California.\nThe ministry's founder, Jennifer Foxworthy, said her organization provides services to deal with the impacts of homelessness, human trafficking and domestic violence, noting that \"suicide\" is a looming demon in all of those adverse situations.\nTo the attendees of the event, which was free to the public, Foxworthy warned \"some parts of the presentation may be heavy.\"\nThe event's two keynote speakers, in fact, articulated the gravity of the issue in their brief presentations.\nKim Klump's story was about her son, Jesse, a senior at Snow Hill High School on Maryland's Eastern Shore who died by his own hand in 2009. Klump noted Jesse was an athlete, scholar and student leader.\n\"This is not someone you would expect would take his life,\" she said.\nKlump admitted that \"in hindsight\" she saw signs that her son was consumed with \"depression.\"\n\"He gave precious possessions away,\" Klump recalled.\nHer son also kept a journal, which was found later and revealed some of his anxieties of the present and future.\nSince her son was an avid kayaker and had worked at The Pocomoke Canoe Company, Klump and others organized a fundraiser called \"Jesse's Paddle,\" which raises funds for scholarships in his memory.\nKlump said that while the fundraiser is a good way to keep her son's memory alive, she decided it wasn't enough. That's when she decided to start a prevention program in schools.\nIn addition to teaching coping skills, the Jesse Klump Suicide and Awareness Program started an open conversation.\n\"Every conversation has the power to make a difference,\" Klump said.\nLast school year the awareness program visited four high schools and saw nearly 1,500 school students. This past summer the program hosted a \"summer eco-therapy camp,\" which included such challenging activities as kayaking, canoeing and rope-climbing.\nKlump said the organization uses grant funding to fund its programs.\nPressures of serving the nation\nThe summit's second keynoter, Navy Capt. Byron Lee, began his talk on a light-hearted note, passing a beach ball to attendees and engaging them in a game of \"bump, bump, catch.\"\n\"We all react to things differently,\" Lee told the audience, adding that things that bring stress into people's lives aren't much different than the things that make people happy.\nLee's jovial demeanor turned emotional when he revealed that at one point in his 28-year armed forces career he had considered taking his own life.\n\"Nothing looked positive, nobody knew,\" Lee said.\nHe was able to get help on the base he was assigned to from a mental health expert.\nLee said that with its pressures to be ready to react and serve as a protector, while dealing with the pressures of assignment moves, raising a family and maintaining personal health, members of the military are emotionally vulnerable.\n\"All of those things were weighing on me,\" he said.\nLee provided 2023 statistics from the U.S. Department of Defense (now the Department of War) that showed that year there were 523 suicides in the nation's military, which was 9% higher than the previous year. The data also showed firearms were the primary method for carrying out a suicide.\nIn noting her own prior experience in the armed forces, Foxworthy said, \"We may look big and strong but we often suffer in silence. It's important to know your resources.\"\nNearly 20 vendors participated in the summit, including the health departments of all three Southern Maryland counties, the Maryland Department of Health Behavioral Health Administration, service members, veterans and their families, as well as the Charles County Center for Children and Community Crisis Services Inc.\nFor more information about Unstoppable You Ministries, go to www.unstoppableyouministries.org.\nFor immediate, confidential mental health support, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Wellness center offers support for mothers on the Shore\n\n October 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Local News \n \n 661\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Village Maternal Holistic Wellness Center opened its doors last October to provide women on the Eastern Shore with a single, trusted source for various services.Samantha Basham Loza was inspired to create a space like this after having her first child in the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. She was astounded by the lack of resources, education and community she had during this time.\n\"I was so blindsided by the entire experience, and it was really frustrating because I consider myself a highly educated person that works hard to find the right resources,\" Loza said. \"And the fact that I couldn't even find what I needed to help me at each stage of this process was just completely shocking.\"\nThe entire process of giving birth was scary for Loza. She was at a hospital in Anne Arundel County and was given an epidural that made her completely numb from her neck down, which she said caused her to have a panic attack.\nLoza said her daughter was immediately transferred to the NICU after delivery.\nBecause she was was numb from the epidural, the baby was crowning without Loza realizing or feeling it, and none of the doctors or nurses noticed. This caused Loza's daughter to have meconium aspiration syndrome. According to John's Hopkins Medicine, meconium aspiration syndrome occurs in 5 to 10% of births.\n\"I was reflecting on that entire experience thinking like, 'How is this the standard?'\" Loza said.\nWith her first child, Loza said she didn't have the knowledge base on the process of giving birth, breastfeeding or managing hormonal changes. She described the experience as isolating.\n\"We don't talk about pregnancy often enough, and how isolating it can be, and all the changes and all the sacrifices. We don't talk about fertility issues often enough. We don't talk about miscarriages enough. We don't teach any of it,\" Loza said.\nShe said her goal with the wellness center is to start these conversations and create community while doing so.\nThe center offers an array of classes and playgroups for children. There are courses for pregnant women and new moms, and the University of Maryland's obstetrics practice comes in to talk about fertility and prenatal care quarterly.\nIn addition, the wellness center has birth doulas, massage therapists, lactation consultants, a speech language pathologist, a pediatric nurse practitioner and a craniosacral therapist, who will be starting in November.\n\"A really big misconception about the name of the business, The Village Maternal Holistic Wellness Center, is that holistic means crunchy and it doesn't,\" Loza said. \"It just means we're considering you as a whole person.\"\nLoza defined a doula as a non-medical support person who provides educational, physical and emotional support during pregnancy, birth and postpartum and also helps connect clients with resources.\nThe center recently received a grant from the Talbot County Health Department to fund the training of 18 new doulas, four of whom are bilingual and two of which whom exclusively speak Spanish. The grant is also assisting the doulas with Medicaid credentialing.\nWhen Loza got pregnant with her second child, she decided to have a home birth midwife, one of the first contacts she made when looking into starting her business.\nLoza said her pregnancy and birth with her son was a completely different experience than with her daughter.\n\"It was so personal. She knew exactly where I was coming from. She knew exactly what was happening with my mental state, and what I was eating and all the things. And she always had a recommendation for a book to read, or YouTube videos to watch or things like that,\" Loza said.\n\"Though she planned to deliver at home, she was transferred to the Easton Hospital because her son's heart rate was low. Her midwife stayed by her side and advocated for her throughout the process.\nAfter having two very different birthing experiences, Loza has become passionate about educating pregnant women about the entirety of the process. She hopes to expand the centers services by opening a nonprofit arm in the near future. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Between the forum and the Washington Society of Landscape Painters, nearly 60 works of art were on display and for sale. More than 20 sold, Sass said.\nSome pieces were full of pink or pink-adjacent colors, while others sported a small speck or dot of pink.\n\"Our mission this weekend is not only to raise money, but to educate everybody about the symptoms, treatments and support of those facing breast cancer,\" Sass said in opening remarks on Oct. 3.\nThe Clark Comprehensive Breast Center, located near Route 50 and off of Idlewild Avenue, delivers professional treatment and support to women with breast cancer and other breast diseases.\nDr. Kathryn Kelley, the center's director, said 2025 \"has been a year of transition and really positive growth\" for the center.\nThe team has made 137 new breast cancer diagnoses and completed over 12,000 imaging studies for women on the Mid-Shore, Kelley said.\n\"You can tell how hard our team is working to care for our patients in our five-county area,\" Kelley said, referring to Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties.\nOn Friday, the center's former director, Dr. Roberta Lilly, was honored for her longtime leadership. Lilly retired first in 2020 after 13 years as director and again in June after serving a stint as interim director.\nDr. Chris Levey, a radiologist with Shore Regional Health, credited Lilly with having the initial vision to create the Clark Comprehensive Breast Center.\n\"What truly defines her is the way she made her patients feel,\" Levey said. \"Across every platform, she earned consistent five-star ratings, praised not only for her surgical skill, but also for listening, explaining and treating each patient as an individual.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Leading up to Thanksgiving, \"Turkey Tags\" can be picked up at local churches, businesses and schools to help provide food for families in need.\nCurrently serving residents from Kent Island to Centreville, Feed A Family hopes to expand north into Sudlersville with additional support, Bell said.\nThe Kent Island Giving Circle, established in 2022, meets twice a year to support local organizations that serve community needs. The group recently celebrated its 50th member.\nMore information is available at kentislandgivingcircle.org \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She credits her doctor, Audrey Drummey, for saving her life.\nDrummey is a doctor in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Maryland Shore Medical Group in Easton. During the event, Drummey highlighted the importance of proactive genetic evaluation and early detection, especially if the disease runs in the family.\nShe emphasized the importance of access to genetic testing in health care and leveraging available resources.\nDrummy said routine mammograms should start at age 40 unless there is a family history of breast cancer in which earlier screening may be recommended and potentially covered by health insurance.\nIn addition, she said a healthy diet, regular exercise, intaking less than seven alcoholic drinks a week and breastfeeding are good preventative measures.\nFor Townsend who said she doesn't like to be vulnerable, it was important to reframe her vulnerability as a strength. As she told her story, she was nervous and emotional while recounting her experience as a breast cancer survivor.\nShe encouraged attendees to check in on their friends post-treatment saying that community is incredibly important because a diagnoses like this can instill fear and change your perspective entirely.\n\"People think that we go through this experience, and when it's over, that we're OK. And we are OK, we survived, but for your mental health it's still something where every little thing that goes wrong, there's still that fear,\" Townsend said.\nTownsend does not want others to live in fear, which is why she encourages other women — like her two sisters — to do self breast exams and early screenings. UM Shore Regional Community Health outreach specialist Catalina Billings encourages self examinations because \"no one knows your body like you do.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
