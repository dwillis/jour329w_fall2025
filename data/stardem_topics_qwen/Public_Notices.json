She is quiet and independent.She likes to be in the same room as her people and get petted, but she is not a lap cat.She wants affection on her terms and space when she isn't in the mood - don't we all?.Because of her Manx genes, Nellie has a cute little stub tail, but unfortunately has Manx syndrome and does not always use the litter box. It isn't her fault though, she just can't always tell when she has to go potty.Nellie does fine with other cats, but we do not recommend a home with children since she isn't afraid to give someone a little smack if they don't respect her space. Can you give Queen Nellie the purrfect home? Fill out an adoption application on Chesapeake Cats and Dogs website, chesapeakecatsanddogs.org. Call 410-643-9955 for an appointment to meet this cat. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Jake has been waiting since March. This adorable boy is a Jack Russell mix, about 30 pounds. Even though he is 9-years-old you would never know it. He has lots of play in him but also loves to just spend time chilling too. He would be the perfect companion for someone looking for a medium-size dog they can take everywhere. Jake knows lots of commands and is great on a leash. We do suggest no cats for Jake though; he likes them a little too much. For more information call the Caroline Humane Society at 410-822-1600 or email info@carolinehumane.org. The shelter is open Tuesday to Saturday. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The project is located at 22470 Hog Creek Road, Preston, Caroline County, Maryland.The wells are between 50 feet and 57 feet deep. Impacts to the resource and nearby users were evaluated using aquifer data from geologic reports available to the Administration. In making the evaluation, the withdrawal was modeled as being pumped continuously for 60 days at the maximum rate with no recharge to the aquifer. Pumping during periods of maximum use may lower the water table less than 3.6 feet at a distance of 910 feet (estimated nearest user). Changes in water levels decrease over greater distances. No unreasonable impacts to the Columbia aquifer or other users of the Columbia aquifer are expected.3030711 TR 8/9/2023TRUSTEE's SALE Trustee's Sale of valuable fee simple property improved by premises known as 14595 Foxchase Circle, Ridgely, MD 21660.

In addition, notification is also given of an amendment to the Recovery Housing Program.The Consolidated Plan is a planning document required by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and is prepared by the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD). It covers a five-year period and is designed to coordinate Federal, and to a lesser extent State, resources to provide decent housing, economic opportunities, and an acceptable living environment for Maryland's citizens. The Plan is updated every year during the five-year period through an Annual Action Plan and includes a series of one year goals toward meeting the overall five year goals of the Plan.Maryland's Consolidated Plan covers the State's non-entitlement jurisdictions.

Telephone: (410) 537-3590.Caroline County CO2022G002/01 - Schmick Farms, LLC, 3321 Choptank Road, Preston, Maryland, has applied to appropriate and use an annual average of 116,000 gallons of groundwater per day (gpd) and an average during the month of maximum use of 617,000 gpd for crop irrigation. Water will be withdrawn from one new well and one existing well in the Columbia aquifer. The project is located within 0.3 mile south of the junction of Poplar Neck and Dover Bridge Roads, Preston, Caroline County, Maryland.The wells will be about 90 feet deep. Impacts to the resource and nearby users were evaluated using aquifer data from geologic reports available to the Administration. Pumping during periods of maximum use may lower the water table less than 2.4 feet at a distance of 800 feet (estimated nearest well). Changes in water levels decreased at greater distances. In making the evaluation, the withdrawal was modeled as being pumped continuously for 60 days at the maximum rate with no recharge to the aquifer. No unreasonable impacts to the Columbia aquifer or other users of the Columbia aquifer are expected.3031972 TR 8/23/2023NOTICE OF APPOINTMENT NOTICE TO CREDITORS NOTICE TO UNKNOWN HEIRS Estate No. 11139 TO ALL PERSONS INTERESTED IN THE ESTATE OF MARK E.

Impacts to the resource and nearby users were evaluated using aquifer data from geologic reports available to the Administration. In making the evaluation, the withdrawal was modeled as being pumped continuously for 60 days at the maximum rate with no recharge to the aquifer. Pumping during periods of maximum use may lower the water table less than one foot at the closest domestic well approximately 2,500 feet away. No unreasonable impacts to the aquifer or other users of the aquifer are anticipated.3034393 SD 9/22/2023TOWN OF OXFORD NOTICE OF CHARTER AMENDMENT RESOLUTION Please take notice that on Tuesday, September 12, 2023, the Commissioners of Oxford enacted the following resolution: RESOLUTION NO. 2309 - A RESOLUTION OF THE COMMISSIONERS OF OXFORD TO AMEND SECTION C5-2 OF THE OXFORD TOWN CHARTER TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS SERVING ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF ELECTIONS Resolution No. 2309 amends Section C5-2 of the Oxford Town Charter to increase the number of members serving on the Board of Supervisors of Elections from three to six and to begin the two-year term of those members on the date of their appointment rather than on the first Monday of April.A complete and exact copy of the Resolution is posted at the Town Office located at 101 Market Street, Oxford Maryland 21654 and is also posted on the Town's website at www.oxfordmd.net.

Telephone: (410) 537-3590.Dorchester County DO2023G002/01 - Hilmar Helgason, 5435 Cokesbury Road, Rhodesdale, Maryland has applied to appropriate and use an annual average of 29,900 gallons of groundwater per day (gpd) and an average during the month of maximum use of 195,300 gpd. The water will be used for crop irrigation. Water will be withdrawn from one well in the Columbia aquifer. The project is located at 6554 Eldorado Road, Federalsburg, Dorchester County, Maryland.The irrigation well is constructed to a depth of 80 feet. Impacts to the resource and nearby users were evaluated using aquifer data from geologic reports available to the Administration. In making the evaluation, the withdrawal was modeled as being pumped continuously for 60 days at the maximum rate with no recharge to the aquifer. Pumping during periods of maximum use may lower the water table less than 1.5 feet at a distance of 200 feet from the nearest property line. Changes in water levels decrease at greater distances. No unreasonable impacts to the Columbia aquifer or other users of the Columbia aquifer are expected.3036217 SD 10/13/2023 \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Washington St., Suite 14 Easton, MD 21601 3039461 SD 11/15,11/22,11/29/202Final Notice and Public Explanation of a Proposed Activity in a Wetland To: All interested Agencies, Groups and Individuals This is to give notice that HUD, under 24 CFR Part 50, has conducted an evaluation as required by Executive Order 11990, in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR 55.20 Subpart C Procedures for Making Determinations on Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands, to determine the potential affect that its activity in the wetland will have on the human environment.The project is under a Community Planning and Development - Community Project Funding grant and the proposed activity consists of constructing a 24,000 square-foot community space which will provide greater access to services and resources and create opportunities for people to live, work, and connect throughout the community. The project is located at 480 Port Street in Easton, Maryland, southeast of the intersection of Port Street and Meadow Drive. The project aims to serve a need for the community and the proposed structure will include a community hub, behavioral health suite, office and training spaces, and affordable housing to those most vulnerable to rising living costs in Maryland.Approximately 4,899.4 square feet (sf) of the wetland will be impacted by the construction of the new facility and associated parking area. Activities impacting the wetland include excavation, removal of vegetation, filling, and grading. The project was designed to leave pockets of wetlands undisturbed on-site.HUD has considered the following alternatives and mitigation measures to be taken to minimize adverse impacts and to restore and preserve natural and beneficial values: Three alternatives were investigated including two alternative sites and the \"no action\" alternative. The subject property was chosen because the area is part of the Port Street Redevelopment Plan and is in proximity to downtown Easton, the waterfront area, and has access to recreation areas such as the rail trail and nearby parks.Permits for this work include a Nontidal Wetlands and Waterways permit from the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) as well as a Maryland State Programmatic General Permit-6 (MDSPGP-6) from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Authorization Number: 22-NT-2038/202260713. The MDSPGP-6 permit allows for the construction of the new building, associated parking areas, stormwater management, and other features. The project will be designed and permitted to comply with all federal, state, and local codes and regulations.HUD has reevaluated the alternatives to building in the wetland and has determined that it has no practicable alternative. Environmental files that document compliance with steps 3 through 6 of Executive Order 11990, are available for public inspection, review and copying upon request at the times and location delineated in the last paragraph of this notice for receipt of comments.There are three primary purposes for this notice. First, people who may be affected by activities in wetlands and those who have an interest in the protection of the natural environment should be given an opportunity to express their concerns and provide information about these areas. Second, an adequate public notice program can be an important public educational tool. The dissemination of information about wetlands can facilitate and enhance Federal efforts to reduce the risks associated with the occupancy and modification of these special areas. Third, as a matter of fairness, when the Federal government determines it will participate in actions taking place in a wetland, it must inform those who may be put at greater or continued risk.Written comments must be received by HUD no later than November 29, 2023. They should be addressed to Mr. Kerry Johnson, Field Environmental Officer, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Region III, 600 E. Broad Street, Richmond, VA 23219-1800, (800) 842-2610 ext. 4803 or (804) 822-4803.

It's being done out of necessity.\"The letter states that this decision was made due to staffing shortages as well as \"an increase in incidents at the Cambridge branch.\"While Henningsen said in the interview that she could not go into detail on the increase in incidents at the Cambridge branch, she said that it's been all age groups and both inside and outside the library.\"Ultimately, what it really is, is some of the things that we're seeing within the community as it's experiencing its challenges, has now filtered their way into the library,\" she said.In response to these incidents, the library's Board of Trustees voting unanimously to adopt the temporary 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. schedule in Cambridge.The library is taking steps to ensure patron safety and will be installing a new security system at the Cambridge branch in mid-December, Henningsen said. She will be meeting with Cambridge Police Chief Justin Todd to talk about a possible partnership, as well.Henningsen said she is interested to see how opening at 9 a.m., rather than 10 a.m., goes.\"We're going to use that to the patron's advantage and try to see if that public service hour makes a big difference,\" she said.At the end of her letter, Henningsen said the library hopes to begin discussing operational hours \"that best meet the community's changing needs\" at the beginning of the new year.In the interview, she said she hopes that, by February, the library will be able to return to some of its original hours.\"We want to go back to providing at least one evening per week,\" she said. \"But there are just some measures we have to have into place before we can do that.\"Henningsen said that the main thing she would like to stress is that this change is temporary.\"We are hoping that we can change this before spring,\" she said. \"We don't want to keep it this way.\" \n \n Caption: The Cambridge branch of the Dorchester County Public Library on Nov. 30.

    "date": "2024-04-21",
    "author": "REBECCA SNYDER Maryland Delaware DC Press Association",
    "content": "Pending legislation could decimate newspapers\n\n April 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: REBECCA SNYDER Maryland Delaware DC Press Association | Section: Columns \n \n 726\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The members of the Maryland Delaware DC Press Association (MDDC) are deeply concerned about the potential consequences of HB1258 on local journalism. This bill, which is on the governor's desk now, would upend the longstanding practice of publishing public notices in local newspapers and their associated websites, threatening the vitality of Maryland's communities and the essential role of the press in fostering civic engagement and accountability.We believe that HB 1258 will create a seismic change in the local media landscape that will decimate and potentially prompt the closure of local news outlets.\nFor decades, local news media has been at the core of their communities, providing critical information, facilitating public discourse, and holding power to account. Although digital formats now supplement print publications, the watchdog role of news media has remained constant. Public notices, a cornerstone of transparency and accountability in government through independent publication and a deep reach into local communities, have been a fundamental part of this ecosystem.\nHowever, HB1258 seeks to centralize estate notices on a government-operated website alone, effectively pulling critical information for creditors and heirs into a subject specific website that requires a user to have reliable internet access and to know where to look for the information. It also will remove a vital revenue stream for local newspapers, jeopardizing the future of journalism in our state.\nThe ramifications of this legislation extend far beyond the newsroom. By undermining the financial viability of local newspapers, HB1258 threatens the livelihoods of countless journalists, editors, and other media professionals who work tirelessly to keep our communities informed. Moreover, it potentially deprives readers of access to vital information about government proceedings and community events, thereby undermining civic engagement and transparency.\nCataclysmic change sounds dramatic. Local news, however, is on the precipice.\nHB 1258 will abandon a system of public notice that has worked well for decades and eliminate a significant number of jobs in Maryland. Local news will go away if communities, governments and others do not support it. Studies show that when a community loses its source of local news, it experiences decreased voter turnout and civic engagement; increased municipal borrowing costs that lead to higher taxes; and decreased transparency among government and business officials, leading to increased waste, fraud, and abuse.\nProponents of HB1258 argue that centralizing public notices on a government website will increase accessibility and efficiency for the state Register of Wills offices. However, this overlooks the reality that many residents, particularly in underserved communities, lack reliable internet access or the technological literacy to navigate online platforms effectively. Many pandemic-era subsidies that made broadband access affordable for Marylanders have been discontinued. Websites are hacked regularly and government is not immune. The print publication is a tangible, permanent record that is archived by publications and libraries, containing the records of an entire community.\nHaving these notices appear only on a court website diminishes the independence of notice as the agency placing the notice is the one that is publishing the notice. News media is in the business of audience development and dissemination of information, and the traffic to both member websites and the MDDCNews.com aggregated site dwarfs a state website. Having notices in the context of other news and information the public searches for make notices more visible. That will not happen under this bill.\nHB1258 was drafted without input from the very stakeholders it stands to impact most profoundly: local newspapers and the communities they serve. The absence of robust debate and meaningful consultation during the legislative process is a disservice to the principles of democracy and good governance. At its core, HB1258 represents a shortsighted approach to policymaking that prioritizes convenience over the public interest. By hastily dismantling a system that has served our communities well for decades, this bill threatens to irreparably harm the fabric of local journalism and the democratic values it upholds.\nOur member publications are committed to their communities, employing local journalists and other professionals, occupying office space, contributing to the community and often serving as media sponsors and supporters of community events. All this will be drastically affected if HB 1258 becomes law. Those jobs won't come back; some publications will not be able to stay in business. Sustaining a $1.7 million hit industrywide will surely mean smaller newsrooms and shoestring operations.\nGovernor Moore, please stand for local news and veto HB 1258.\nRebecca Snyder is the Executive Director of the MDDC Press Association. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
