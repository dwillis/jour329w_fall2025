Yet when compared to other advanced industrialized countries, it fares dismally in national laws and policies affecting workers.This is a major claim of a recent cross-national study sponsored by the humanitarian organization Oxfam America, a report that offers a powerful lens for understanding the major strike activity now underway in the U.S.The study notes how political choices create environments that favor or undermine working people - choices that in the U.S. have largely been to the detriment of workers.In light of the current strikes (e.g., writers, actors, hotel workers, Amazon delivery drivers), the study reminds one that, whatever the political environment may be, it's the workers themselves - and the unions that represent them - that must continue to assert the leadership needed to bring about a more just and equitable society.Perhaps the disadvantaging of U.S. workers is no more readily apparent than in policies setting the minimum wage.Unlike 80 other countries that mandate an annual review of a national minimum wage, the U.S. requires no such review, and Congress has failed to raise the hourly wage from $7.25 since 2014, and failed as well to raise the tipped minimum wage (from $2.13) since 1991.Many states and localities have set their minimum wage above the national standard, from $8.75 per hour in West Virginia to $16.50 in the District of Columbia.But these numbers only begin to become meaningful when you factor in the cost of housing. According to latest figures from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, workers in this country must earn on average $28.58 an hour for a \"modest two-bedroom rental home\" and $23.67 for a \"modest one-bedroom rental home.\" In California, where housing costs are the highest in the nation, a working person must earn $42.25 an hour for a two-bedroom rental.For hotel housekeepers in Los Angeles, who currently make on average only $20-25 an hour, the only way to survive financially is to take on two or three jobs - or to commute two or three hours a day from distant, less expensive locations.So these workers, represented by Unite Here Local 11, opted to take collective action. Once contracts with 61 Southern California hotels expired on June 30, they began a series of rolling strikes, walking off the job at selected groups of hotels to make clear to employers their critical role to the industry. The strikes continue to this day.As hurtful as the rent and wage disparity is, it's still part of a much bigger picture of policy failures. The U.S. is almost alone among advanced industrialized nations in tying health insurance to employment.Without universal, taxbased health insurance, many workers risk losing their insurance as a result of work-related issues and changes.As the current SAG-AFTRA strike has made clear, many actors are at risk of losing their insurance if they're not able to work a minimum number of days per year or reach a minimum earnings threshold.Some 86 percent of the union's 160,000 members do not earn enough to qualify for health insurance.And health care is only one of the comparative indices with which to measure a nation's commitment to the well-being of its workers and their families.The U.S. stands alone among advanced nations in lacking a federal mandate to provide paid leave. By way of contrast, consider Spain's mandate of 16 weeks of paid maternity leave and 16 weeks of paid paternity leave for new parents.As challenging as the current strikes are for workers in a wide range of sectors, it's even more challenging for workers to begin organizing unions and securing fair contracts.In a nation where union busting is a major industry, and where penalties against companies for labor violations are relatively minor, it's not difficult for large corporations like Amazon or Starbucks to stonewall efforts at collective bargaining.Though Starbucks workers have voted to unionize at more than 340 stores since the first successful vote in 2021, the company has failed to negotiate a single contract with workers at any of the stores.Once again, a contrast with other nations is instructive, particularly in countries like Austria, where sectoral bargaining allows panels of workers to bargain with employers across an entire industry, rather than company by company.Workers and unions do need allies in government and in the community. They can't change laws and policy without strong support.And current strikes demonstrate how such support can be manifested in many ways - from open letters to employers, to legislative initiatives, to direct participation in worker-led actions, including civil disobedience.But ultimately the initiative, the perseverance, and the courage lie with the workers themselves - seeking dignity and a better life for themselves and their families. It is out of this leadership that a more equitable society must, in the final analysis, emerge for us all.Andrew Moss, syndicated by PeaceVoice, writes on labor and immigration from Los Angeles.He is an emeritus professor from the California State University. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nStriking writers and actors take part in a \"Bastille Day: Let Them Eat Croissants\" rally outside Sony Pictures studio in Culver City, Calif. on Friday, July 14.

    "content": "Broadband impacts home buying decisions\n\n August 4, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 15 | Section: News \n \n 903\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Broadband can be as fundamental as water and electricity when it comes to buying a home, noted Megan Rosendale, president of Mid-Shore Board of Realtors, especially for those who work out of their house.Per Mary Mabry, associate broker with Keller Williams Realty Delmarva North in Cambridge, \"As a result of COVID, many employees are still working from home whether part-or full-time. When I discuss a client's criteria for a new home the internet service seems to be the driving factor as to the location.\" This was the case for Rosendale, when one of her clients' dream home did not have reliable internet service. The client wanted to move forward with the purchase of the house, but because she works remotely, she had to pass and purchased another home.\"I have seen homes sit on the market because they do not have solid internet coverage,\" Rosendale said.Gov. Wes Moore recently launched the Maryland Act Now campaign in partnership with Education Superhighway, they are working to close the digital divide by extending broadband internet access to all Marylanders and making it more affordable.$267 million in federal funding will be used to support Maryland's broadband infrastructure.\"Access to the internet is no longer optional - it is essential, and nobody should be locked out of the internet because of their income or where they live,\" Moore said. \"When it comes to getting folks online, our administration is very clear: we will not rest until every single Marylander has access to affordable and reliable internet.The discounts offered under this program and the investments we are making have the power to expand opportunities for Marylanders across the state. Leaving no one behind means getting everyone online.\" Broadband on the Mid-Shore has greatly improved, but it wasn't always so. Properties away from town centers were lacking in reliable coverage and the last mile, to connect to farms, homes and businesses, is expensive.Easton Utilities marketing and communications manager Kelly Simonsen noted Easton Utilities understood that providing broadband access to residents and businesses with insufficient service in Talbot County would positively impact numerous qualities of life issues including employment, health care, education and social connections, all of which help drive economic prosperity. This was heightened in March 2020 when the pandemic arrived, and schools entered a virtual teaching environment while homes turned into workplaces with employees working remotely. Providing a network to improve the quality and availability of high-speed data services to as many businesses and residents as possible became critical, and as a community-owned, not-for-profit organization, Easton Utilities was the ideal solution.Easton Utilities is making significant progress installing and providing broadband service to significant portions of Talbot County. Since receiving the initial award from the United Stated Department of Agriculture in July 2020, additional locations have been added to the project as well as various grant funding sources totaling over $30M. In total, the project will provide access to 4,400 locations and is estimated to cost $40 million. As of July 2023, Easton Utilities has completed over 50% of the construction offering access to 1,400 locations. Currently, 800 of these locations have already subscribed to service and are enjoying the numerous benefits internet service offers.As the project continues to evolve and additional funding sources have been confirmed, the scope and timeline of the Connect Talbot project has grown. This is reflected via a real-time interactive map which can be found at Easton-Velocity.com/ConnectTalbot.The progress and pace of the Connect Talbot project is on track for completion in advance of the grant requirement deadline of Dec. 31, 2026.Bay Country Communications out of Cambridge and Choptank Electric Cooperative in Denton entered a 10-year partnership to bring fiber-based, high-speed broadband services to at least 3,000 new locations annually. Choptank Electric's V.P. of Technical Services Affairs Tim McGaha said Choptank Fiber (a Choptank Electric fiber broadband subsidiary) to his knowledge is the only ISP that has held educational townhall forums, informing citizens in many counties as to when they can expect to be hooked up.Choptank Fiber held two educational community meetings at Colonel Richardson and North Caroline high schools in late 2022 for residents of Caroline County.The well-attended meetings covered the specific information and answered residents' questions regarding the high-speed internet buildout in the county. Through a partnership with the Caroline County government, the majority of the unserved will have access to fiber internet in Caroline County by the end of 2023. For additional information, check out the website Choptankfiber.com where you can find maps of service areas for Caroline and Dorchester counties, https://choptankfiber.com/latest-news and https://choptankfiber.com/service-locations The Connect Talbot project highlights a successful partnership between federal, state, and local agencies working together in the best interests of the community, Simonsen said.Broadband access not only provides the opportunity for underserved communities to thrive, but it is also a factor that is needed to expand our economy, and create jobs, McGaha said.Realtors have supported policies, locally, at the state level and nationally that will increase access for Americans everywhere to an affordable, highspeed, world-class communications infrastructure.It is encouraging to see positive steps taken by the Choptank Fiber and Easton Utilities as well as the Federal Communications Commission to help local communications networks handle the increased demand for broadband.The Mid-Shore Board of Realtors mission is to advocate for its members and the public to preserve the right to own, transfer and use real property.For more news and information check out the website www.midshoreboardofrealtors.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

More get-togethers?Whatever it is, determine what you will do differently this year.CRASH SAVE Once each week put $20 - or an amount you find appropriate - into an envelope.Label and seal the envelope.Make a note in your calendar so you don't forget where you put it.GROUP CRAFTING Spend an evening with three or four friends making holiday decorations. Each person brings an idea plus all the materials and supplies needed for that project. By the end of a very fun evening, everyone goes home with three or four new items.FAMILY COOKBOOK One year a friend got the best gift. Her mother is an excellent cook and often cooks without a recipe. Her sister spent hours with Mom in the kitchen and painstakingly recorded the exact ingredients and measurements of the family's favorite dishes. She then developed them into a recipe book and gave it to her sister, my friend, for Christmas. Over the years it has become even more special - not only because her sister made it for her, but also because the recipes are now recorded for both of them to pass on and to always remember their mother.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book Debt-Proof Living. \n \n Caption: EVERYDAY CHEAPSKATE\n \nMARY HUNT \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But he did. And with horrific injuries. One leg was completely severed, the other left hanging by a thread - and he suffered third-degree burns all over his back.What followed were 26 surgeries, a second amputation of the leg that could not be saved, unspeakable depression, fear and uncertainty.In the blink of an eye, Scott's life changed from one with a bright college career ahead to one of unbearable challenges, dashed dreams and poverty.What kind of 18-wheeler has run you off the road of life?

    "content": "Crabs 'sky-high' - watermen explain why - There are not as many crabs as there used to\n\n August 9, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Will Bontrager | Page: 5 | Section: News \n \n 1002\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ROCK HALL - Most Marylanders would say the joys of living on the Chesapeake Bay are the crabs.Steamed up, with Old Bay, beer, ready to pick using a mallet or butter knife. Just as common as the joys of eating them, are complaints about their cost. They go hand in hand.At Ford's Seafood in Rock Hall, a bushel of number one's is $260.At Chester River Seafood they're $290.Prices are about the same everywhere you look.Those who hear these complaints often are watermen, dropping crabs off at the restaurants.This blend of unique men, born and raised on the water, get up before sunrise. They labor against waves, the sun, sea nettles, eels, the wind, queasy journalists and boat maintenance.As a crabber of over 40 years, Robert Ingledue, put it, there once was a time crabbing was a way to make good money. He remembers the boom period. Every line in the water he pulled up, could possibly yield a bushel - about 60 large crabs.Not now.On July 31, he had 36 lines in the water at Rock Hall. He pulls up 12 a day. He doesn't usually get a bushel these days off one line.\"I'll settle for half of that right now,\" he said.These watermen are not getting rich off crabs right now. That much is evident.Ingledue explained why that is.There are less crabs out there.There's less space to run lines.There are invasive species eating them. Blue catfish in abundance.And in Ingledue's opinion, regulations in place to ensure that money can't be made from the crabs out there. He pointed out that there are even more limitations near the fall, when the cooler water brings out the crabs.And retailers charge double of what comes off the boat, and can be particular about what they pick.Add inflation to the mix, and you've got a set up for not so good economic conditions for many watermen.Ingledue's boat, Rambling Rose, cost him $25,000, he's had had to have a fuel pump and fuel lines and other repairs, which cost him another $25,000. Annual boat maintenance typically runs another $1,000.Ingledue doesn't trot line; he works with pots. With 25 on a line - the ends are either red or green markers for north and south - he controls a reeling apparatus, a winder, lifting the pots up, saving time and effort from leaning over. The winder costs roughly another $1,600, and at $100 a spool and 1,000 feet of line, it's easy to see how overhead adds up.That's not including fuel.His son, Robert Ingledue II was on the boat, too. He's experienced in the water, owning his first boat at age 13, his father said.Ingledue II had a lot to say about the price of the bait they use, the pots, the lines and the crabs themselves.This is not a 9 to 5 job, Ingledue II said. The pots, the lines, and the markers, all have to be cleaned routinely.A majority of the time in the business is spent cleaning, he said.It's a black growth that sticks to the pots. They both pointed toward the Bay Bridge, toward a big wastewater plant indicating that's a big part of the problem.To keep their cages from piling up with murky growth eating away at their material and eventually their wallets, they bought a superheated furnace. Ingledue explained it's what lobstermen use in New England. It heats a vat of water and the pots get pushed in after being emptied of crabs, fish, sea nettles or whatever else latches on the cages.Not many crabbers have the furnace around here, they said, and it's saved them money.It gets hotter than an exhaust pipe, they both warned, in the middle of the boat, sloshing around, but they're used to maneuvering around it.On the starboard side of the boat, the bait is lined up.They use three types: clams, shrimp heads and fish. The younger Ingledue pointed out they aren't sure what kind of bait the crabs prefer on a particular day.Of course, he said, with inflation, and the way \"these sellers all get in agreement,\" prices of bait have doubled.A bushel of clams is $80, and since they can only be used live, you have two days to use them.Once the crabs find a bait they like, they get stuck in the pots, swimming upwards, Ingledue II said.The cages are subject to all the corrosive elements of the water, so it's no wonder, he spent an entire winter making pots instead of buying them.From the cages, the crabs get tossed into the bushel baskets. Ingledue separates them for retail - picking through the crabs, throwing them in the appropriate bushel baskets, using a measuring tool. He explained the pricing as they went.Off the boat, a bushel of number one's is $150. Number two's and females they get about $40.This discrepancy hurts the crabbers, because, as Ingledue said, it isn't less work getting number two's. They're just as delicious too.\"I ain't going to complain.I know the retailers need to keep the crabs refrigerated, and in these hot days, there's lots of dead ones they have to sort through. But we're making nothing unless we get a bushel and a half a day.\" The crabbers move fluidly and swiftly because each moment out there, fuel is being burned. There's no wasted movement.And after father and son battle with sea nettles, enduring long days, short nights, and way too much preparation, they hear comments about the high prices.Ingledue has a permit which allows him to catch anything from catfish, to crabs, to even turtles.So why crab then?\"I like it. You work for yourself. There's rewards to that. Although it's a pain at times,\" he said with a grin.He's hoping things pick up. \n \n Caption: WILL BONTRAGER\n \nLeft, Robert Ingledue and his son Robert Ingledue II, commercial crabbers, check one of their 36 lines.\n \nWILL BONTRAGER\n \nNearest is the container where all the fresh catches come in, and beside it is a vat of superheated water the pots go in to clean them. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bible study apps seek new ways to make scripture accessible to busy believers\n\n August 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Joe George; Wealth Of Geeks | Page: 8A | Section: News \n \n 984\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Makers of the popular Logos Bible Study app want to get back to basics. On July 7, Logos's parent company Faithlife announced plans to do away with its church management services. These included Faithlife Giving, a tool for collecting tithes and donations from congregants, and Faithlife Ministry Tracker, used to schedule volunteers for church functions.In their place, Faithlife will turn attention to its core set of Bible study tools, as found in the Logos Bible Study app and the Logos software suite. In a statement released to Religion News Service, Head of Product Phil Gons said, \"While we're proud of what we've accomplished in the church management space, it's time to return to what we've always done best - continuing to develop a robust slate of Bible study applications and content.\" Although Logos will be receiving most of the attention, Faithlife still offers other products. The company will continue to support Proclaim church presentation software, the Catholic study suite Verbum, and Lexham Press, publisher of books on church history, theology, and Christian living, as well as books for children.FEWER AMERICANS READING THE BIBLEFaithlife's pivot comes when disciples want more efficient ways to study scripture.A 2022 survey by the American Bible Society found that just 39% of Americans read the Bible on their own multiple times per year. That's down from 50% of Americans who reported reading the Bible in 2021.The American Bible Society attributes the decline to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"There can be little doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has seriously disrupted Americans' behaviors, including their relationships with church communities, which are the epicenter of these behaviors for most American Christians,\" declared the group's 2022 State of the Bible address.However, the pandemic is just the latest in an ongoing series of trends that have distracted even the most faithful from regular Scripture reading. The Religious Landscape Study by the Pew Research Center found that only 63% of Evangelical Protestants, 61% of Historically Black Protestants, 30% of Mainline Protestants, and 25% of Catholics read the Bible at least once a week.BIBLE READING AND TECHNOLOGYWhen Logos launched in 1992, its creators hoped to make Scripture more accessible.Founded by former Microsoft employees Kiernon Reiniger and Bob Pritchett and Bob's father Dale Pritchett, Logos brought the Bible to Windows computers. The company launched an iPhone app in 2009 and an Android app in 2012.Since then, Logos has expanded to include not only multiple translations of the Bible but also devotionals and commentaries.Bible study apps include programs for various subsets of Christianity, such as Anglicans, Catholics, Baptists, and Lutherans.Users can access sermons, ministry sources, and other materials for free and for purchase.As useful as these materials certainly are, they may distract from Logos's core goals.According to the Faithlife website, the company is \"committed to increasing biblical literacy and accessibility for every Christian around the world.\" But phones and other portable devices can be a distraction, even for those who use their devices for reading. The many options available to readers draw users away from the text and toward other things. From alerts and texts to definitions and quotations, readers struggle to finish a sentence without getting pulled away.Thus, the Logos Bible Study App may undermine its core goal instead of reinforcing it.For example, a user reading John 3:16 in the English Standard Version Bible available through the app features four individual hyperlinks with cross-references. Highlighting the passage brings up options for comparisons across translations, a passage guide with multiple commentaries, and an exegetical guide that examines the verse in its original Greek. These options come in addition to books, audio guides, reading plans, and courses that users can access through the app.THE CHALLENGE OF BIBLE READING IN THE 21ST CENTURYTraditionally, Bible reading has been a quiet and thoughtful process. Joshua 1:8 commands, \"Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it\" (NIV).Through the years, believers have followed this teaching by committing to memorizing verses or journaling. The faithful have learned to perform daily devotions, which require setting aside distractions and focusing on the Bible itself.But as external pressures take away time and attention, Bible apps have been an attractive option for stressed worshipers.With scripture and reading guides in one app, users can quickly find verses and squeeze in devotional time whenever available.Developers have been quick to offer their own Bible apps. The iPhone app store alone features dozens of options, ranging from kid-friendly apps with simplistic translations to apps devoted to a single version of scripture.The Logos Bible App has stood out from this crowded group by emphasizing a wealth of options. In addition to the free apps, Faithlife sells packages that feature further resources within the latest edition of its software, Logos 10. On the lowest end, Logos 10 Fundamentals includes multiple commentaries and Bible translation for $49.99. On the highest end, the Logos 10 Collector's Edition includes more than 8150 digital books, sermon preparation software, and more, retailing at $10,799.99.DIFFERENT BIBLE APPS TO MEET DIFFERENT NEEDSAs this wide range of price points suggests, the full Logos 10 package isn't for everyone. As user Jeffery Kranz puts it in his review, Logos 10 is \"an industry-grade tool,\" one that makes the most sense for in-depth and scholarly examination, not everyday Bible study for lay people.But by committing itself to its main Logos app and software package, Faithlife has the opportunity to expand the already-impressive reach of its products. If all goes well, these products can help even the busiest believer continue their spiritual journey.This article was produced and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n \n Caption: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/NYC WANDERER KEVIN ENG\n \nA surviving copy of the Gutenberg Bible (which was originally printed in the 1450s) housed at the New York City Public Library. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I have a friend who set up a fund for her family. In order to access the money in the family fund, you have to have a goal and a plan. You get to withdraw funds if you are committed to growing your life and making the best out of your circumstances.She set specific criteria that family members must fulfill. Because there were guidelines, the transaction was no longer personal, and everyone had a goal to reach.Consider setting up an account where you put the money you can share.

    "content": "Government's sugar policy could leave a sour taste\n\n August 11, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: George F. Will | Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 772\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHICAGO - Carl Sandburg's hog butcher, wheat stacker, city of the big shoulders - was once America's candy capital, catering to the nation's sweet tooth.Today it is less so because the federal government interferes with candy's most important ingredient.With Halloween on the horizon and Christmas close behind, sugar import quotas might produce shortages of candy corn and candy canes.Herewith another story of industrial policy gone sour.The Wall Street Journal - headline: \"Candy Makers Wrestle With Sugar Shortage\" - reports that Spangler Candy of Bryan, Ohio, has had to decline some Halloween candy orders and might be unable to produce its usual 250 million candy canes.An executive of Atkinson Candy in Lufkin, Texas, says that had his company not found a 12th supplier (importing from Colombia) after 11 had said their sugar supplies for this year were exhausted, \"We would've been going to Costco\" for sugar. For tons of it?To the surprise of no realist, the government's central planners are probably surprised by this. Sugar supplies are tight and prices are high worldwide, but matters are made worse for U.S. manufacturers and consumers by import restrictions.Limiting sugar imports transfers wealth from 335 million Americans who consume sugar and products containing it, to, primarily, about 4,000 producers of beet and cane sugar.The quotas are a residue of \"temporary\" commodity supports instituted during the Great Depression. Not even the New Deal's measures that were intended to end the Depression could make that calamity last forever, so it ended. Some purportedly ameliorative measures did not.Federal policy essentially guarantees 85 percent of the U.S. sugar market to domestic producers, and minimum prices for beet and cane sugar.And import quotas make the U.S. price of sugar two to three times the world market price, a boon to U.S. confectioners' foreign competitors.The Cato Institute's Scott Lincicome adds a you-can't make-this-stuff-up detail about the government's sugar nonsense: The Agriculture Department can also prop up U.S. sugar prices by buying domestically produced sugar, thereby keeping it off the market.The department \"then sells this sugar to U.S. ethanol (of course) producers, often at a big loss (of course).\" The survival - the probable immortality - of sugar import quotas is a crystalline illustration of the phenomenon that explains much of what the federal government does, but especially the protectionism component of industrial policy. The phenomenon is: dispersed costs and concentrated benefits.Suppose, very conservatively, that the cost of import quotas to consumers (estimated to range from $2.4 to $4 billion) is $3 billion.Divide $3 billion by those 335 million U.S. sugar consumers: The cost per person is about $9, which is barely noticeable. But divide $3 billion by the approximately 4,000 sugar producers, and the windfall per grower is $750,000, a powerful incentive for the growers to cultivate Congress as assiduously as they cultivate their crops.A 2006 Commerce Department study concluded that for every job in sugar production that was saved by protectionism, nearly three jobs were lost in the confectionary industry.And the cost to the economy of each sugar production job saved was $826,000 in 2002 dollars ($1.4 million today).Bad politics? No. In \"The Individualists: Radicals, Reactionaries, and the Struggle for the Soul of Libertarianism,\" a survey of libertarianism published in April, John Tomasi and Matt Zwolinski cite economist David Friedman's explanation of the political efficacy of the government's redistributionist money-shuffles: \"A hundred people sit in a circle, each with his pocket full of pennies. A politician walks around the outside of the circle, taking a penny from each person. No one minds; who cares about a penny? When he has gotten all the way around the circle, the politician throws fifty cents down in front of one person, who is overjoyed at the unexpected windfall. The process is repeated, ending with a different person. After a hundred rounds everyone is a hundred cents poorer, fifty cents richer, and happy.\" Chicago factories that made Brach's, Fannie May and Mars candies have been shuttered.Canada, however, can celebrate U.S. sugar irrationality.Since 1967, Life Savers were made in Michigan - 70 million pounds of them in 2001.The following year, production decamped to Canada, where sugar (99 percent of Life Savers) can be bought at the world price. Mars Inc. and Tootsie Roll Industries Inc. also have Canadian operations.The Necco candy factory building in Thibodaux, Louisiana, is empty: The company has gone bust.The Cato Institute's Gabriella Beaumont-Smith notes that the hollow building sits between two sugar refineries that are protected - subsidized - by the sugar segment of federal industrial policy.George Will's email address is georgewill@washpost.com. \n \n Caption: GEORGE F.

Donald Ghogomu thinks he has found the way to do just that and he presented his new invention Saturday at the Lexington Park Library.The Lexington Park resident held an unveiling of a prototype of his \"Omni Electric Generator,\" or OEG, prototype - a news release said it is the first of its kind in the U.S and perhaps the world - which would power a vehicle or a home continuously.\"I'm very excited because I know this product is going to help solve the insatiable quest for energy,\" Ghogomu said. \"I know a product of this nature would help recharge and help solve most of the energy problems we have.\" His invention would mean that drivers would no longer need to leave roadways for fuel and homes would never again lose power.There was no independent review of the invention provided as to whether it does what Ghogomu claimed.\"I thought it was quite amazing,\" said Justine Rowland of Prince Frederick, who knows Ghogomu through church. \"He's excited about it, and we didn't really know anything about it and my husband was a bit skeptical, like is it possible [to build something like this] and is it something that's real?\" I find it very interesting,\" said Jonathan Long, who made the hourplus drive from Virginia to support his friend. \"He's taking kinetic energy from one place to another and then bringing it back to keep producing.If what everything he said is true, it's definitely interesting. I'm curious to see what he does next with it.\" Ghogomu, who said he is an inventor and scientist with a background in the aviation and aircraft business, graduated from Oklahoma's Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology.\"It's my hope that the government will take notice and get it to use because it will help the population,\" he said. \"The problem we have with energy supplies, power shortages and the global warming issue this will solve the majority of those problems.\" During his hour-long presentation he said his invention will \"revolutionize the energy sector/industry for green energy globally.\" Ghogomu, who said he lost several jobs and was even homeless for a point, said he was depressed, traumatized and suffering from anxiety during his fruitless job search.But all that changed one night when he had a revelation while living in his car and observing the workings of his wind-up flashlight.\"I observed that mechanical energy was used to produce electricity,\" said Ghogomu, who has a degree in applied sciences from the for-profit institution. \"The Lord revealed in my spirit to explore the fact that if mechanical energy is used to produce electricity, therefore the process is reversible.\" He said the OEG was completed Sept. 22, 2022, in the living room of his Lexington Park home and \"functions under the principle of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy, and then reversing the process of electrical power in a complete energy cycle.\" During his presentation, Ghogomu showed some videos of him working on the 400-pound generator as well as troubleshooting it. He said he spent $5,000 to $6,000 constructing it.\"I would be very interested is seeing how other scientists challenge it,\" said Rowland, who is a project manager. \"For me, risk management is key to any project and I think it's prudent to run it through and make sure it's rigorous.

    "content": "Retailer gift cards: Use 'em or lose 'em\n\n August 15, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mary Hunt | Page: A9 | Section: News \n \n 304\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n With worsening economic conditions, consumers should think twice about retailer-issued gift cards. Store-issued cards are not as good a deal as you'd think because of the danger of bankruptcy and/or some other court-approved reorganization.When Sharper Image filed for bankruptcy reorganization in 2008, immediately the courts decided the retailer would no longer accept its cards. An estimated $20 million in gift cards and gift certificates went unredeemed. Consider these ways to use a soon-tobe-bankrupt gift card: NO. 1: BUY SOMETHING.Sure, it may not be enough to buy what you would really enjoy, or it's a store you are not that fond of.That's the way it is.NO. 2: BUY A GIFT. Use your gift card to start your Christmas shopping early or pre-buy gifts for graduation, weddings, birthdays and other gift-giving occasions on the horizon.NO. 3: BUY ITEMS TO DONATE. Use your gift card to buy essential items for your office, church or school.NO. 4: BUY THINGS TO SELL. Instead of using the gift card for personal purchases, look for items you can sell online or at a garage sale.NO. 5: LOOK FOR OFFERS FROM COMPETITORS.After Sharper Image filed for bankruptcy and stopped accepting gift cards, Brookstone, one of its competitors, came up with a generous offer for consumers.They gave a 25% discount on any purchase with any Sharper Image gift card.If you've become a habitual gift card giver, rather than looking to gift cards as your gift of choice, move to purchasing authentic gifts for your friends and relatives.Here's an idea: Skip the gift cards altogether and give your recipients the cash.When it comes to gift cards, the message is clear: It's time for all of us to adopt a use-it-or-lose-it attitude.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book Debt-Proof Living. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

An infusion of disparity grant funding also benefited the county.\"Our income tax revenues are actually up this year, so far, to 8% to 10%. So we're kind of keeping up with the rate of inflation,\" Breeding said. Barkin said the rate of inflation was \"less than eight to 10%.\" Porter credited Bowden \"and all of our staff\" for doing \"an incredible job\" getting Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES) and American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to businesses.Among the topics brought up for discussion were the challenges of workforce development, lack of public transportation, smart growth, and housing with its attendant water and sewer or septic needs balanced against state environmental mandates.Breeding asked Barkin, \"How much of the inflation do you think is due to the labor market, and how much is due to the influx of money into the economy?\" Barkin defined inflation as \"too much demand meets too little supply,\" and sketched the economic climate that included the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\"While we've gotten much better, you still have a situation of too few workers for the jobs you need,\" he said. \"You still can get very slow service in a restaurant, hospitals are still massively short of nurses. Truck drivers are short.Construction and manufacturing folks are short.\" \"In this county, you're manufacturing.You have agriculture, I'm not sure those are the sort of sectors at high risk right now,\" Barkin said.\"We're not in a recession today,\" he said. \"I think we're going to slow for the back half of the year.\" \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/TIMES-RECORD\n \nTom Barkin, chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, met with the Caroline County Commissioners Aug. 15. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If you go out to eat every workday and spend, on average, $10 per meal, it comes out to $2,500 a year even with two weeks off for vacation. Making your own lunch will cost half of that, at the most, and much less should you get creative.It's easy to start with a $10 salad once a day and end up with $30,000 in credit card debt so fast it'll make your head spin. In fact, it's becoming common.The solution is not hard to figure out. Taking your lunch to work or school could easily recover $2,500 per year for savings, if we consider at least 2.5 lunch-eating people per household. And every time you are strategic with using last night's leftovers to make today's lunch, you'll be saving even more.The biggest hurdle for many of us may well be more psychological than practical.No one wants to look like a nerd at the office. And not everyone is intuitively creative with loading up a brown bag with something that will be close to appealing come lunchtime. It does require a bit of planning and then a solid commitment to the plan.The secret is to make it a rigid behavior long enough until it becomes a habit - a habit that will increase your bottom line.Need more proof that taking your lunch to work will pay off big? The Brown Bag Lunch Money Savings Calculator will do just that.Check it out.

I've been quietly growing an investment of nonperishable food for some time.I will admit to having stayed up late at night watching the National Geographic Channel, learning the many ways the world as we know it may soon end - from a global economic collapse to unfathomable horrors from outer space.Dear Readers, this is nothing new. There have always been gloom-and-doomers.When I was a kid, the doom du jour was communism.That led families to construct underground bomb shelters stocked with food and water. Then there was the Cuban missile crisis, which I was certain we would not survive. I find it entertaining but certainly not realistic or reasonable. The other extreme is to not be prepared at all, however, which also is unacceptable. To me, building a reasonable emergency supply of food for my family is responsible. It's insurance.These things give me peace of mind and assurance that I will be able to protect my property, my family and my life in the event of emergencies or disasters.One challenge with building a stockpile of food the way I'm doing it is that it takes a long time. Another option is to invest in a ready-made stockpile from a reputable company like My Patriot Supply. Their freeze-dried meals are really tasty, convenient to store, easy to prepare and they have a long shelf life.Done reasonably, emergency preparedness, in whatever form it takes, is not whacky. And I intend to do everything in my power to encourage you to follow my lead.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book Debt-Proof Living. \n \n Caption: MARY HUNT \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As interest rates and costs increase, people can afford less.That was one of the explanations President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Tom Barkin offered as he spoke with community members at the Tidewater Inn in Easton to answer questions about local economic concerns and offer insights on whether there is a recession in our future.The event was hosted by the Talbot County Department of Economic Development and Tourism.Questions about housing, specifically in Talbot County, were asked multiple times during the Q & A section of the event.Talbot County Council Vice President Pete Lesher said housing is one of the biggest barriers to hiring in Talbot County and that increased interests rates have made the problem worse.\"Is housing just an inevitable tragedy of the policies that we need to put in place to bring inflation under control?\" Lesher asked Barkin.Barkin agreed that putting policies in place to address inflation reduces housing demand.As interest rates and costs increase, he explained, people can afford less.Barkin added that the cost of an entry level house has increased more than wages.\"And so, the average policeman, fireman, teacher, nurse with a spouse and kid can't buy a house,\" he said.However, Barkin argued that the main issue is supply rather than interest rates.He said the two are connected \"And, yes, that supply problem has something to do with interest rates and people having to borrow to build,\" he said. \"It has a lot to do with construction costs which are driven by inflation.\" Barkin said the question that needs to be asked is how to increase supply.Al Bond, president and CEO of the Avalon Foundation in Easton, said Talbot County's higher real estate values create a high demand for a workforce that isn't there.\"Every business here I think struggles to beat that,\" Bond said. \"The Avalon Foundation, which I work for, has been trying to get an electrician to show up for two months.\" Bond said that the electrician company isn't able to come - not because they don't want to - but because they can't.Barkin said that COVID-19 has had this effect all over the country.\"We just didn't have enough electricians, didn't have enough plumbers,\" Barkin said. \"And no one's created more.\" He said there is a struggle to get \"back into balance\" and that electricians are a \"classic example\" of this.Barkin also shared his thoughts on a possible recession.\"Right now the No. 1 question I'm getting,\" he said, \"is, 'Are we headed into a recession?'\" He did not have an exact answer.Barkin said a recession, which has been predicted quarter after quarter of this year, will happen someday.\"Those of us who keep predicting a recession, someday are going to be right,\" he said.Currently, he said, there is a \"healthy demand\" from consumers. He said consumers are still spending. Part of this has to do with excess savings that consumers were able to put aside during the pandemic.Barkin listed examples of how consumers are spending money including flights and travel or buying tickets to things like the Barbie movie or Taylor Swift's tour.\"Consumer spending, which is 68% of the economy, may be weakening a little bit,\" he said. \"But it's still far from weak.\" As consumers continue to spend, Barkin said that businesses are treading more carefully after experiencing pandemic-related shortages over the last few years. He said businesses are saving and investing more as well as making efforts to retain workers.Barkin reminded the audience that while a recession could be on the horizon, it might not be as great as the Great Recession.\"It's worth remembering that not all recessions are created equally,\" he said.He gave three reasons for why a future recession might not be as severe: Less dislocation in the labor market - the people who have been getting laid off recently, like those in the technology industry, are folks with college degrees that are more likely to have backup savings and might find another job faster.Latent demand - there is still latent demand by consumers for things like cars and homes.The recession conversation - talk of a recession has been going on for a long time and as a result, businesses are planning conservatively in case a recession does come.\"So if you do have a recession, it's not going to go into an oversupply situation,\" Barkin said. \"It's going to go into one where people have been actually pretty conservative and that conservatively could be the source of a revival.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nPresident and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Tom Barkin speaks at the Tidewater Inn in Easton Aug. 16.

    "content": "Understanding the title company's role in the home buying process\n\n August 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A13 | Section: News \n \n 766\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Purchasing a home is an exciting journey whether you are a first time buyer, a growing family or downsizing, there are critical aspects you should be aware of to make an informed decision.Understanding the nuances of home buying and the significance of title commitments can safeguard your interests and ensure a smooth and satisfactory experience, noted Diana Kuhn, Partner with Flagship Real Estate Services LLC, and affiliate member of Mid-Shore Board of Realtors.Being aware of intricacies of home buying, the role of title companies and the importance of thoroughly reviewing title commitments will go a long way in safeguarding your property, Kuhn said.Maryland operates as a \"buyers' choice\" state, which grants the home buyer the freedom to select their preferred title company. Most homebuyers do not have a specific title company preference, so your local Realtor or lender is likely to recommend a company they have a professional relationship with.Megan Rosendale, president of Mid-Shore Board of Realtors, stressed the importance of choosing a title company that is local and familiar with your area of purchase.\"I have seen title companies put deals on the back burner or heavily inconvenience their buyers because they are not near the property, noted Rosendale. \"I have also seen extra fees add because the title company was not local.\" While it is common to refer to title companies as settlement companies, it is essential to comprehend the breadth of their responsibilities.A title company's primary role goes beyond handling the settlement process.It involves conducting extensive research on the intended purchasing property, ensuring it is free from any liens, judgments or other encumbrances against the seller at the time of settlement.Additionally, the title company thoroughly examines the property's title for any defects, easements or rights of way. These aspects are not typically discussed in everyday conversations but have significant implications for the home buyer's property rights and possible future plans.Real property can be affected by various elements, such as Homeowners Associations and utility easements.A HOA can impose specific rules and regulations on property usage and maintenance. Similarly, utility easements, water or natural gas easements, and rights of way can have an impact on the property's usability and development potential.These factors are referred to as \"exceptions,\" which denotes items not covered by the title insurance policy.The home buyers' coverage is limited to the items not excluded in the title policy's \"exceptions\" section.Fortunately, as a homebuyer, you have the right to request and review the title commitment when it is sent to your lender. Even if you are purchasing the property with cash, you can still ask to see the title commitment before the settlement takes place. Although the document may appear complex to those unfamiliar with the industry, your chosen title company can assist you in comprehending its contents.Although you may not have the option to accept or reject individual \"exceptions,\" understanding them is crucial if you have any development plans or changes for the property, such as adding structures, fences or making significant modifications.A thorough review of the title commitment allows you to assess any potential impediments to your future plans. If you identify issues that could hinder your intended use of the property, it is essential to discuss potential solutions with your real estate agent before finalizing the transaction. The last thing you want is to discover limitations on your property usage after the settlement is completed, with those items already excluded from your coverage.Being proactive and understanding of the home buying process and title commitments is vital to protecting your investment and securing your plans for the property. Ask questions, seek clarification and fully comprehend the title commitment.Being well-informed about the property's status will not only safeguard your interests but also provide you with peace of mind throughout the entire home buying journey.Use the resources at your disposal, such as your local trusted Mid-Shore Realtor and the expertise of your chosen title company. They will help to ensure a successful and rewarding home buying experience.Here are some helpful links to better understand title insurance: 1.

    "title": "Underpaid and overlooked, migrant labor provides backbone of Maryland Eastern Shore's local economy",
    "date": "2023-08-21",

    "content": "Underpaid and overlooked, migrant labor provides backbone of Maryland Eastern Shore's local economy\n\n August 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Thurka Sangaramoorthy; American University - The Conversatoin | Page: A4 | Section: News \n \n 895\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Every summer, people flock to Maryland to eat blue crabs. Named for their brilliant sapphire-colored claws, blue crab is one of the most iconic species in the Chesapeake Bay. The scientific name for blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, means \"beautiful savory swimmer.\" In restaurants and at home, diners pile steamed and seasoned blue crabs in the middle of a table covered in paper. Then, using small mallets, knives, bare hands and fingers, they break open the hard shells and extract the juicy meat from inside.It is a messy experience, especially with Old Bay seasoning and beer known locally as Natty Bohs, one that is quintessentially Maryland.Though many people know firsthand how difficult it is to pick and clean crab meat, they often don't realize how crab is processed when it is sold in stores already picked and cleaned. Most people also may not know that crab picking is a livelihood for many, mainly poor, women.For generations, African American women from Maryland's rural, maritime communities labored for crab houses on the Eastern Shore.Today, fewer than 10 crab houses are left on the Shore. The workforce consists of mainly female migrant workers from Mexico who do the grueling job of picking crab for eight to nine hours a day, from late spring to early fall. They make on average of US$2.50 to $4.00 for every pound of crabmeat they pick.That pay is roughly one-tenth to one-twelfth of the wholesale price of one pound - or about a half of a kilogram - of the seafood they pick, which is $35 to $44. In comparison, the Maryland minimum wage is $13.25 an hour, while the federal minimum wage is $7.25.RISE OF IMMIGRATION IN RURAL AMERICAOver 2.1 million migrants and immigrants work in jobs growing and processing food in the United States, playing an essential role in feeding Americans.As an anthropologist and global health researcher, my work has shown that they are part of an increasing trend in rural America.Since 1990, immigrants have been moving to small towns and rural regions at unprecedented rates, accounting for 37% of the overall rural population growth from 2000-2018.Some rural counties, like Stewart County in Georgia and Franklin County in Alabama, have experienced growth rates of over 1,000% in their foreign-born population, which have boosted their local economies and mitigated rural population decline.Maryland's rural Eastern Shore, for instance, has experienced a rapid rise in immigration since 2000. From 2010 to 2019, migration was the primary source of population growth, with the foreign-born population increasing by 90%.Many immigrants come to this region to find work in agriculture, poultry and seafood processing.Some come directly from Mexico, Central America and Haiti.Typically, farmworkers have temporary visas and arrive in late spring and early summer and stay through the growing season. Migrant Mexican women who work in crab processing also follow the same seasonal employment pattern. Others, like those working in poultry processing plants, have settled here more permanently, either as undocumented or permanent residents.AT RISK OF EXPLOITATION AND INJURYImmigrant workers in rural regions work dangerous jobs and are exposed to pollution, deplorable living conditions and limited safety training.Additionally, immigrant workers are among the lowest paid and lack access to health information, preventive care and medical treatment.Dry skin, cuts, scrapes, rashes, chronic pain and broken bones are common among immigrants who work in agriculture, poultry and seafood processing.These workers also suffer from numerous invisible injuries such as discrimination, verbal harassment and physical exploitation.CHALLENGES TO RURAL HEALTH Despite the daily risk of harm, migrant workers in rural regions have limited access to health care and rely on mobile clinics, local health departments and community health centers.But these facilities are not equipped to handle specialty care or emergencies. Nor are many of them easily accessible due to location or hours of operation. In addition, many workers cannot afford to miss work or are afraid to tell their supervisors that they need care.Some avoid health providers altogether because they are not treated well or feel misunderstood.ESSENTIAL BUT UNDERVALUEDDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the notion of \"essential\" workers became part of the nation's vocabulary as a way to describe people required to continue in-person work under lockdown conditions.They included food industry workers.The pandemic exposed the disproportionate numbers of immigrant workers in the agriculture, poultry and seafood industries in rural America.It also revealed how policies enacted during the pandemic to protect public health and essential workers did little to prevent people from working in dangerous workplace conditions without adequate safeguards.Unable to self-quarantine at home, many food production workers got sick or even died as a result of working in crowded conditions without personal protective equipment and adequate ventilation.In many ways, the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the long-standing crisis of health care for immigrants in rural America.But despite evidence that close to 2.5 million foreign-born people live and work in rural America, very little information exists on these people's health.This inattention by lawmakers is harmful and dangerous because it leaves health care providers and social workers with little understanding of immigrant experiences in small towns and sparsely populated rural communities.

    "title": "Sticker shock - Consumers getting smacked with new car payments north of $700",
    "date": "2023-08-21",
    "author": "Mike Sunnucks; APG National Enterprise Editor",
    "content": "Sticker shock - Consumers getting smacked with new car payments north of $700\n\n August 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; APG National Enterprise Editor | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 1067\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Talk about sticker shock.The average monthly payment for a new car in the U.S. is $733.The average monthly payments for used and leased cars are $571 and $598, respectively. Car buyers face average financing rates of 11.1% for used cars and 7% for new ones.That is according to July data from the Edmunds.com (car buying and automotive group and popular consumer website).Those sky-high prices and higher interest debt are leaving many consumers on some rough roads. Edmunds' consumer insights analyst Joseph Yoon said both sides of the car-buying coin are working against buyers right now.\"You need cars to be cheap. You need the money to be cheap,\" Yoon said. \"Right now, neither of those things are true.\" The current average monthly new car payment is up $242 per month (or 49.3%) from early 2015 and $158 per month (or 27.5%) since the coronavirus pandemic started in early 2020.The average payment for a new car was $575 in February 2020 before the pandemic emergence in the U.S. and $491 in January 2015, according to Edmunds data.The average price of a new car is $48,334 with luxury purchases averaging $63,552, according to numbers released Aug. 9 by Kelly Blue Book, another much-watched car-buying resource.Edmunds currently pegs the average new car price in the U.S. at $47,561 and average used car price at $29,179.Seven years ago, in 2016, used car prices averaged $18,661 while new cars cost $33,618. Before COVID-19, new cars were in the $38,000 range and used cars averaging around $20,500, according to Edmunds.\"It's wild too,\" he said, of the roughly $10,000 increases in average automobile prices since 2020.Monthly used car payments are up from $367 per month in early 2015 (a $204 monthly increase or 56% more). They are up from $412 in early 2020, before the pandemic, ($159 more each month or 38.6%), according to Edmunds data.The age finding a cheap used car is in the rear view mirror.RECORD CONSUMER DEBTHigh car prices have added to U.S. households recent financial strains.Americans saw record-high gasoline prices last year along with 40-year highs with inflation (including groceries). The current housing crunch has combined higher prices with limited supplies of affordable residences. They now face higher interest rates on car payments and credit cards after 10 rate hikes by the Federal Reserve since last year to battle inflation induced by central bank and fiscal infusions. All that came after employers cut 22 million jobs at the beginning of COVID-19 in 2020.Those rate hikes are adding interest to car loans and other consumer financing.New car buyers are now paying, on average, $8,999 in interest, on the vehicles they are buying.\"You are buying a $48,000 car for $56,000,\" Yoon said. \"That's obviously having a huge impact on monthly payments.\" In January 2015, U.S. car buyers were paying $3,831 in interest on new car loans.That's number is now but more than $5,100.Used car buyers - who are now seeing double-digit interest rates - have seen their interest payments go from $4,392 over the course of car loan in early 2015 to $10,802 now, according to July data from Los Angeles-based Edmunds.That translates into used car buyers financing $29,685 vehicle and paying more than $10,800 in interest.The upswing in car prices and associated debt is part of a broader tidal wave of consumer debt.U.S. household debt totaled a record $17.06 trillion in the second quarter of 2023 - including $1.03 trillion in credit card debt and $1.58 trillion in auto loan debt, according to the New York Federal Reserve Bank's Center for Microeconomic Data.Auto loan debt is up $20 billion from the first quarter of 2023 and $80 billion from a year ago, according the regional arm of the U.S central bank. Consumer debt has increased $2.9 trillion since the pandemic, according to the New York Fed.OTHER FACTORS Pandemic-related shutdowns of computer ship plants and ports (including in China) helped reduce inventories. Supply chains, auto plants and car dealerships are still trying to make up for that lost ground.A number of smaller, independent, \"mom and pop\" used car dealerships have disappeared from the marketplace with auction prices for previously owned vehicle also increasing with supplies low and lot prices high, Yoon said.Car dealerships and automakers have also been pushing more expensive trim levels to customers with more expensive packages and models being more readily available at the retail level in a climate with limited inventories.How about leasing?Yoon said the financial advantages of leasing car (including dealer incentives) have disappeared.In July, the average lease payment for car was $598 per month up from $468 per month before the pandemic hit in 2020 and $426 per month in early 2015.\"That's a pretty significant and notable increase,\" Yoon said.The price of leased cars and trucks was up 10.8% in the latest Consumer Price Index.Car repairs are up 19.5%. Car insurance is up 17.8%. Those all outpace the overall 3.2% inflation rate in the July CPI.With the payment price gap between leasing and buying evaporating, more buyers are opting to purchase.Leasing's share of the U.S. automotive marketplace has gone from 32% pre-pandemic to 21% in July, Edmunds reports.That helps drive demand for new cars and cuts previously relied upon supplies of used cars - another double whammy for consumers.NO AMERICAN APPETITE FOR CHEAP CARSYoon said from the consumer side of car buying, American buyers have shown no interest in some time for purchasing low-budget automobiles.While there is a market for mini-cars and min-trucks that can cost under $6,000 in China, India and African markets, it's not in the U.S.\"The American consumer doesn't want that,\" the Edmunds analyst said, pointing to past low-budget flops in the U.S. market such as the Yugo. \"We don't want budget vehicles.\" U.S. consumers expectations for items such as rearview cameras, high-tech display panels and climate-controlled seats offer ample evidence and are displayed in the costs of cars.\"Those things all cost money,\" Yoon said, pointing out the challenges of finding a used car under $25,000. \n \n Caption: AP PHOTO/DAVID ZALUBOWSKI\n \nIt's hard to find a used car under $25,000 and new cars have an average price north of $47,000, according to car-buying platform Edmunds.com.\n \nAP PHOTO/MATT DUNHAM\n \nU.S. new and used car prices and debt loads, including for auto loans are way up with interest rate hikes, low inventories and inflation. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Welcome to owner/occupiers\n\n August 23, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A7 | Section: Letters \n \n 437\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A recent event on the topic of interest rates and the housing supply was reported in the Aug. 17 Star Democrat. I'd like to make the readers aware of a local real estate investment what they would call a \"vehicle\" which would reduce the supply of townhomes making it more difficult for older people to downsize.Lately we have become aware of the almost helpless feeling of a community trying to stave off real estate investment greed in the form of mega residential developments of Lakeside and Poplar Hill.Whereas mega developments involve the purchase and assemblage of parcels of undeveloped land, this vehicle of real estate investment greed involves the purchase and assemblage of existing condominiums to convert them into rental properties.Once the investor has a majority of the units, he controls the decision making by the board incuding raising HOA fees to drive remaining owners who cannot afford them to sell.The real financial benefit of real estate investment for wealthy individuals comes from the substantial tax write off for depreciation of the property, and many find it useful to park their wealth there regardless the impact on the lives of people involved.This face of real estate greed has come home to me personally when all the owners of the units at Mallard Ridge in Easton received a letter from a local real estate brokerage indicating that there was a purchaser interested in our units. Attached to the letter was a recent purchase of a Mallard Ridge unit by an investor.From my point of view there is virtually no townhome in Easton that can match the warmth, community spirit and beautiful green space that is our home at Mallard Ridge. The HOA fees reflect the major involvement of owners and occupiers in the management of Mallard Ridge.As an older person, I came from St.Michaels to downsize and found Mallard Ridge perfectly located 5 minutes away from the Idlewild Avenue medical offices and the hospital emergency room and thought this would be my forever home.Many of us who live here are in that age category. I and a growing number of others here have agreed to only work with brokers who pledge to find owner/occupiers.Two things will happen when we do this.One is we will learn that the price they are representing is not high market at all. And second when there are sales we can continue to welcome other owner/occupiers who share our interest in maintaining our community as is and have the value of neighborliness that comes from having a stake in the community we have created here.I suggest other condominium communities similarly targeted do likewise.HOLLY WRIGHTEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Recently there was a letter about real estate so I read it.This writer read an article about interest rates and housing supply. Her response sounded as if she considered herself an expert.She accuses all \"real estate investors\" as rich, greedy and out to get the elderly.Just a little history as I remember it. Mallard Ridge, where the writer lives, was developed by Mrs. Nily. I would guess that Mrs. Nily found empty land at the edge of town which she developed.In those days condos were not popular, and there were very few in town. I guess you would call that \"the purchase and assemblage of undeveloped land,\" the vehicle of real estate investment greed.But it provided you and others a great place to live.The writer must be a member of the 30% of people that think Bidenomics is working. The less supply of a product generally leads to higher prices of the products available.Fewer houses and more demand increases prices.Reducing oil production raises prices. It's called inflation.Receiving letters from Realtors is called marketing. If a professional Realtor makes a sale in the neighborhood, this is a technique used to find new business.The writer claims that any investor is a rich, greedy, uncaring person.Let me give you a lesson in capitalism: The best way to get rich is to buy real estate and not sell it. The laws for business are written to encourage investment. It rewards those that are willing to work hard and take a risk. It also softens the blow if that investment goes down the tubes. This is capitalism.The alternative is called socialism. That's where the government owns everything and decides where you live, what you drive and whether you can have a gas or electric stove, etc.I've been a real estate investor and Realtor for around 40 years. I'm not rich, greedy or uncaring. I have helped people achieve the American dream, and I've provided a place to live for lots of people.CHIVY WIELANDEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Credit has complicated our lives\n\n August 28, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mary Hunt | Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 316\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Today's batch of reader questions reminds me how complicated our lives have become since the introduction of consumer credit.Some days I long for simpler times so long ago when cash was king and there was no such thing as a billion-dollar consumer credit industry attempting to control our lives.Dear Mary: A couple months ago, I left my wallet on the bus. I immediately called the bus company and was told the driver had turned it in. When I got it back, I found everything in its place, including my cash. I didn't think any more of it. Now my credit-card statement is two weeks late. Should I be concerned?- Brian Dear Brian: Yes, you should be very concerned.With identity theft so prevalent, you should see this as an emergency. First, call your credit card company to learn why your statement is late. While you're on the phone, report the incident. Request a new card, and report your current one as stolen.Verify that your mailing address has not changed.Your next calls should be to the fraud departments of each of the three major credit bureaus: Experian (888-397-3742), Equifax (800-525-6285) and TransUnion (800 680-7289). Tell them to flag your file with a fraud alert.At that point, all creditors will have to get your permission before opening any new accounts in your name. Additionally, request copies of your credit report. Review these carefully to make sure there are no new accounts in your name that you did not authorize.If you have not already set up online access to your bank and credit card accounts, I suggest you do that right away. Now you can monitor your account every day. Even though I'm fairly confident that nothing is amiss (the mail is often delayed), you are wise to stay on top of things, if for no other reason than to make sure your credit card payment will not be late.

It's a no-brainer.Here are my top handy recipes to help you get started saving all that money you've been spending on cleaners:EYEGLASSES CLEANING SOLUTIONFill a spray bottle of any size 3/4 full with 70 percent isopropyl rubbing alcohol (91 or 99 percent are fine to use but more costly and not necessary).Add 2 small drops of mild dishwashing liquid (Blue Dawn is ideal), and fill the rest of the bottle with distilled water (see note).Add the spray top, and gently shake the bottle by rolling it between your hands or on a countertop, so as to not create a lot of bubbles. To use: Spray both sides of your lenses, and gently rub them clean with a clean microfiber cloth.WINDSHIELD WASHER FLUIDPour 3 cups rubbing alcohol, 1 tablespoon Blue Dawn and 10 cups distilled water into a 1-gallon plastic jug. Shake thoroughly to mix. Pour into your car windshield washer reservoir in place of commercial windshield washer fluid. Always shake prior to adding to the reservoir.The alcohol speeds the drying time and prevents the windows from freezing or cracking in the winter.Mary Hunt invites you to visit her at Everyday-Cheapskate.com, where this column is archived complete with links and resources for all recommended products and services.

    "content": "Massive container ship visits Baltimore\n\n August 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 655\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BALTIMORE - The Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore recently welcomed the largest container ship ever to visit Maryland with the arrival of the Evergreen Ever Max at Seagirt Marine Terminal.The vessel weighs 165,350 tons and has the capacity to handle 15,432 twenty-foot equivalent containers.Maryland's Port is capable of accommodating massive container ships because of its infrastructure: the Port of Baltimore has a 50-foot-deep channel and an array of the ultra-large, Neo-Panamax cranes needed to serve a vessel of this size.\"It's no secret why these massive container ships want to call on the Port of Baltimore,\" said Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul J. Wiedefeld. \"They know Maryland's Port is a valuable resource and a terrific partner in moving goods efficiently across the state and throughout the region.\" At more than 1,200 feet in length, the Ever Max is longer than four football fields. Previously, the largest container ship to visit the Port of Baltimore was another Evergreen vessel, the Triton, which first visited in 2019 and has a capacity of 14,424 containers.\"Ships like the Evergreen Ever Max are able to come to the Port of Baltimore because of the work of every link in our supply chain,\" said Maryland Port Administration - Port of Baltimore Interim Acting Executive Director Brian Miller. \"From our great International Longshoremen's Association to our incredible truckers, pilots, tugs, freight forwarders, terminal operators and private marine terminals, the Port of Baltimore succeeds because we all pull in the same direction.\" \"Welcoming the new Evergreen vessel, Ever Max, to Seagirt Marine Terminal is an example of continued growth for the Port of Baltimore,\" said Mark Schmidt, vice president and general manager of Ports America Chesapeake, which operates the Seagirt Marine Terminal. \"Ever Max was completed this year, and comes to Baltimore from the Samsung shipyard in Korea. Thank you Evergreen, for adding vessel capacity to the Port of Baltimore.The Port of Baltimore continues to have a strong 2023. The most recent figures through May show major commodities at the state-owned, public marine terminals such as roll-on and roll-off farm and construction equipment, containers and general cargo are all up year to date compared to 2022. Roll-on and roll-off cargo is up 30%, containers are up 10% and general cargo is up 8%.The 2023 start follows an outstanding 2022, when the Port handled a record $74.3 billion in foreign cargo and established other new records for roll-on/roll-off, containers, general cargo and forest products despite worldwide supply chain issues.The Port's rising container business will be further buoyed by the ongoing CSX-owned Howard Street Tunnel expansion project in Baltimore, which will allow for double-stacked container rail cars, clearing a longtime hurdle for the Port and giving the East Coast seamless double-stack capacity from Maine to Florida.The project involves clearance improvements in the 127-year-old tunnel and at 21 other locations between Baltimore and Philadelphia. With the tunnel expansion project, Baltimore will be able to send double stacked containers by rail into the Ohio Valley and onto Chicago.The Howard Street Tunnel project benefits from public-private investment from the federal government, Maryland, CSX, and others. It is scheduled to be completed in 2026, and is expected to increase the Port's business by about 160,000 containers annually. It also will generate about 6,550 construction jobs and an additional 7,300 jobs from the increased business.Maryland's Port of Baltimore currently generates about 15,300 direct jobs, with nearly 140,000 jobs overall linked to Port activities. The Port ranks first among the nation's ports for volume of autos and light trucks, roll on/roll off heavy farm and construction machinery, and imported gypsum.It ranks 11th among major U.S. ports for foreign cargo handled and ninth for total foreign cargo value. The Port is responsible for nearly $3.3 billion in personal wages and salaries, $2.6 billion in business revenues and $395 million in state and local tax revenues annually. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nThe Evergreen Ever Max makes its way into the Port of Baltimore. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That spending supported 1,410 jobs in the local area and had a cumulative benefit to the local economy of $139 million.\"Since 1916, the National Park Service has been entrusted with the care of our national parks.With the help of volunteers and partners, we safeguard these special places and share their stories with more than 300 million visitors every year.The impact of tourism to national parks is undeniable: bringing jobs and revenue to communities in every state in the country and making national parks an essential driver to the national economy,\" said National Park Service Director Chuck Sams.\"People come to Assateague Island National Seashore to camp, enjoy the beach and bay and view the wild horses,\" said Superintendent Hugh Hawthorne.\"We recognize that this tourism is a critical driver to the local economy, bringing 1,410 jobs and $139 million revenue to communities within 60 miles of the park.\" The peer-reviewed visitor spending analysis was conducted by economists at the National Park Service.The report shows $23.9 billion of direct spending by nearly 312 million park visitors in communities within 60 miles of a national park.This spending supported 378,400 jobs nationally; 314,600 of those jobs are found in these gateway communities. The cumulative benefit to the U.S. economy was $50.3 billion.As for the economics of visitor spending, the lodging sector had the highest direct effects, with $9 billion in economic output nationally. The restaurants sector had the second greatest effects, with $4.6 billion in economic output nationally.Report authors also produce an interactive tool that enables users to explore visitor spending, jobs, labor income, value added, and output effects by sector for national, state and local economies.Users can also view yearby-year trend data.

MICHAELS - With a grant of $500,000 from The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, the largest it has ever received from a private foundation, the St. Michaels Community Center is poised to finish the total renovation of its aged building and provide enhanced services to the most vulnerable in the Bay Hundred area of Talbot County and throughout the Mid-Shore.\"This grant is truly a difference maker for us,\" community center Executive Director Patrick Rofe noted. \"We are grateful to the Weinberg Foundation for its generosity, and for its commitment to our shared goal of meeting the essential needs of every member of the community, especially the neediest and most vulnerable among us.\" Rofe said adequate nutrition, a safe environment in which to learn and play, access to training and appropriate educational offerings - all of which are offered at the community center - are the basic building blocks of human dignity.\"This crucial grant will make a profound difference in SMCC's ability to serve our community,\" he said.\"We are just months away from moving back into our building,\" said Rofe, adding that \"with the support of the Weinberg Foundation and our other supporters we will then be able to provide not only our existing programs but expanded services as well.\" When the St. Michaels Community Center reopens early next year the new facilities - well-equipped classrooms, a technology center and a modern commercial kitchen - will allow for expanded programming in four broad categories:. Community Food Distribution and Culinary/Hospitality Workforce Development.SMCC will expand food distribution from three to five days a week, and, in partnership with Chesapeake College, launch a new program to train muchneeded culinary and hospitality workers.

I am gratified that thanks to the hard work of our entire team and the generosity of our scores of supporters, we have done just that: We have received $1.75 million from the state of Maryland, the federal government and the town of St. Michaels; more than $1.5 million in donations from individuals; and $750,000in major foundation grants. \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nSt. Michaels Community Center Executive Director Patrick Rofe stands at the front entrance of the center's building now under major renovations.

We have more money, and we have more stuff, but clearly, greater affluence has not translated to greater happiness.Are there any circumstances under which more money will bring happiness?The truth is that if you are living in poverty, having more money will make a positive difference in your quality of life, and, yes, you will be happier.But once your basic material needs are met, many experts agree that having more money might be nice but is not likely to make you a lot happier, if at all.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" CO PYR IGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I understand.Most of us are total novices.Unfortunately, what do we do?We let others make our decisions for us, thinking they are so much smarter because they are \"professionals\" or TV commentators.Recently, I was drawn to a book - mostly because our grandson Sam is a newly minted second grader - that was simple to read, easy to understand and quite charming.In \"How a Second Grader Beats Wall Street: Golden Rules Any Investor Can Learn\" by Allan S. Roth, we follow the story of Kevin Roth, the author's 8-year-old son, to discover exactly how simple it can be to become a successful investor.By second grade, Roth contends, we've learned simple and truthful lessons about the world around us.As life goes along, however, what we continue to learn is less about making us smarter and more about making us outsmart ourselves.By adulthood, we're feeling that serious things - like money - are too important to deal with simply.And that's when things take a turn.Here are some of the dumb things Roth says that many adults do with their money: No. 1: They love to buy high and sell low. They buy after the market is up, panic and then sell when the market falls.No. 2: They play important games without understanding the rules. Kids know that you can't win if you don't know the rules.Same goes for investing in something no one can understand.Here's the bottom line: You are in control of your investments. This book will help you cut to the chase, connect with your inner second grader and take control of your future.Mary Hunt invites questions and comments at https: everydaycheapskate.com/contact/, \"Ask Mary.\" COPYR IGHT 2023 CREATOR S.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The manager we hired was inept and untrustworthy.Now we are in credit-card debt to the tune of $250,000. We are trying to crawl out from under this problem and are out of working capital to keep things going. We can't find anyone who will make us a consolidation loan. We are sinking fast! - Name withheld, Texas Dear Nameless: I wish you'd written before you headed down such a dangerous path. Instead, you violated nearly every rule of self-employment: You went into business with borrowed funds. You hired employees before you were profitable. You thought of credit as \"working capital.\" Need I go on?I will say that if there's one thing you did right it was not taking out a home equity loan to fund this nightmare. As much as your unsecured creditors may scream and yell, hassle and harangue, they cannot take your home. But they can sue you if you are unable to keep up with your monthly minimum payments.While bankruptcy is legal, it is neither quick nor easy.Some might agree with me that it is not even ethical for its ripple effect.Those who lent you money in good faith will be forced by law to take a huge financial hit on your behalf. While you might be relieved of the burden through bankruptcy, discharged debts don't disappear, and there might be tax implications. However, it pains me greatly to suggest it's probably time for you to consult with a bankruptcy attorney.

It's a four-letter word and certainly not ideal under any circumstances.Being debt-free is always better than being in debt. But not all debt is created equal. Generally, debt comes in two flavors: secured and unsecured.Secured debts are collateralized.That means the borrower pledges something of value to the lender that acts like a security deposit.If the borrower defaults, the lender gets ownership of that valuable asset. A home mortgage is probably the best example of reasonably safe, secured debt.In a mortgage, the property becomes the collateral.Unsecured debts, on the other hand, are wild and crazy because there is no security. Even worse, invariably, this kind of debt comes with double-digit interest rates. All it takes is the borrower's signature and the deed is done. This kind of debt is not safe, in fact it is toxic.Unsecured debt can ruin a life. Credit card debt is the best example of toxic debt. It looks so harmless.It offers so much convenience and flexibility. And nothing could be further from the truth. Unsecured consumer debt is like a steel trap armed with attractive bait to lure you in. Then, once you're in, it slams shut.I've been in the debt trap.It's a horrible place to be. It took me 13 years to gnaw my way out of a six-figure load of unsecured, toxic debt. My husband (a man of both of both long-suffering and integrity) and I didn't file for bankruptcy.We repaid every dime including interest, penalties and fees.I didn't get into the debt trap against my will. I did it to myself, naively and stupidly.I nibbled at that delicious bait. I chose to ignore the signs warning that I was heading for trouble if I didn't change my ways. I paid a terrible price for acting so foolishly.

I don't want to jeopardize my current job, but I also don't want to miss out on a potential opportunity because of a lack of references.What do you suggest I do? How can I approach this situation delicately without putting my current job in jeopardy? - Need a Reference DEAR NEED A REFERENCE: Is there anyone else where you work that you could ask for a reference?You don't always need the big boss to vouch for your abilities, as long as you find someone credible.Think about who else might help you and keep it confidential.If you really do need your boss and you think the potential opportunities are worth the risk, sit down and talk to him. Explain that while you like your job, you are looking to test the waters and see what else is out there.Be prepared to explain why.If you have any issues with your current job, be prepared to address them, albeit delicately.If you are looking to make more money, say as much. If you want to leverage your education and experience further, say that. Be prepared to share a timeline for when you might leave if the right opportunity presents itself.Showing your boss respect in the form of advance notice goes a long way and may just land you a better reference than you imagined.Be careful not to spend working hours on your job search, and continue to do an excellent job where you are.You never know.

I often rely on this option, especially when we have last-minute guests. It's impressive to quickly produce a high-quality, delicious pizza; it's my little secret.READY TO ROLLThe takeout pizza store in my neighborhood sells ready-to-roll pizza dough.I can buy a large ball of dough for $3.50, which makes a 16-inch pizza.Not all pizza stores sell their dough (the national chains in my area look at me as if I have three eyes when I inquire), but independent shops are typically more than happy for the business - any business.In fact, one store near me even lists this on their menu board.READY TO GOMy local supermarket sells ready-to-bake pizza dough in the deli section for $3.49 (enough to make one 12-inch pizza).Now is the time to start planning how to replace a regular meal more economically.You're smart, so I am confident you will come up with ideas and strategies I haven't considered.YOUR TURNThese are only a few ideas for combining quick-service foods with home cooking to create semi-homemade meals.What are your favorite tricks and tips?

But who knew we could decorate our homes from places like Dollar General? Our reader discovered that, and I think her tactic is simply brilliant.ALTERNATIVE DECORMy husband and I recently repainted our living room for a fresh, new look and then realized our curtains no longer worked with the new color. We couldn't find anything that we both liked. To our surprise, we found fabric shower curtains at Dollar General that worked perfectly - only $10 each.Because of how wide our window is, we needed four of them, but for only $40 we have a totally new look in our living room and we love it.- Trish STRETCH THE GASOLINEDriving fast reduces your fuel efficiency and increases expenses. While aerodynamic drag is less significant in the city, it significantly diminishes fuel efficiency at speeds exceeding 55 mph.Increasing your speed to 65 results in a 36% surge in the drag. For individuals engaged in frequent highway commuting, reaching your destination a few minutes earlier might lead to an additional expenditure of $510 annually. Sticking to a speed nearer to 55 mph and making use of your cruise control has the potential to yield favorable returns. - GregZIP IT!Always remember to zip up jeans and other garments that have metal zippers before laundering them.

    "content": "China has ailments made incurable by Leninism\n\n September 13, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: George Will | Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 733\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Vladimir Lenin, who died 100 years ago as of next Jan. 21, was having a good 21st century because the Chinese Communist Party emulated him. For four decades, the CCP's primacy was compatible with China's economic advance. Now, however, China has ailments partially caused by, and made incurable by, Leninism.In Russia, then in Mussolini's Italy, Hitler's Germany and elsewhere, including modern China, Leninism provided a new model of government: the party-state. Except China cannot be both modern and Leninist.Modernity requires social openness, and a nimble response to information and innovations that move faster than bureaucracies can or want to move.Karl Marx's only relevance to the CCP is in Lenin's reaction against Marx. The party-state was Lenin's obstinate rejoinder to Marx, who believed that Russia, a peasant society, lacked the material preconditions - principally, an industrial proletariat - for a revolutionary consciousness.Lenin insisted that a \"vanguard\" party, tiny but enormously ruthless, and possessing revolutionary consciousness, could pound the masses into material for transitioning to communism.Hence Lenin's party-state.Such a state has, however, two incurable defects: All policies are subordinate to the primary objective of maintaining the party's dominance. And the party incubates society's elites, who insinuate themselves everywhere into allocating wealth and opportunity. Absent market signals, this produces cascading inefficiencies in the allocation of society's human and material resources.With Leninist ham-handedness, Beijing recently highlighted its economic disarray by suppressing data confirming it. Having reported a youth unemployment rate of 21.3 percent in June - or misreported what might have been above 30 percent - Beijing released no data about youth unemployment in July, thereby fueling speculation about how much worse it now is.China is misleadingly said to have a \"hybrid\" economy of government planning leavened and disciplined by market forces. This suggests more orderliness than actually exists. Market forces are casually disregarded by the CCP's innumerable tentacles. China's \"industrial policy\" - pervasive government entanglement with private-sector enterprises - is a road to private-sector serfdom.Under the Leninist brutality of dictator Xi Jinping's \"zero-covid\" policy, a single covid-19 case could cause the lockdown of a city of millions, with devastating economic consequences. But most devastating is Leninist economic normality in a party-state. The Economist: \"If spending is weak because households and entrepreneurs fear the party's intrusive policymaking, their spirits will not revive until Mr. Xi commits to self-restraint - a commitment that he cannot credibly make. The party lacks the power to limit its own power.\" In a recent three-year period, the Economist reports, China produced enough cement to turn Britain into a parking lot. But analyst Edward Luttwak, citing \"at least 100 grossly under-utilized airports and the many highways that are mostly empty of traffic even in crowded China,\" says supposedly \"semi-private\" joint ventures are essentially CCP ventures.They are financed by \"loans of the local branches of state banks, whose managers could not just say no to local party bosses, who could choose to invite them to sumptuous dinners in pretty company or to lock them up for corruption investigations as they saw fit.\" Hence today's Everest of domestic debt, (China's developers' debts equal about 16 percent of the nation's gross domestic product) and stagnation. The Economist says \"short-term growth is no longer\" the CCP's priority. National \"greatness\" is. But Leninism precludes this as Xi values loyalty over competence: \"China used to tolerate debate about its economy, but today cajoles analysts into fake optimism. The fact that China's problems start at the top means they will persist.\" Writing in Foreign Affairs, Ian Johnson of the Council on Foreign Relations says Beijing's \"strategy of accelerating government intervention in Chinese life\" - an \"obsession with control\" - means \"political ossification and ideological hardening\" in a society devoid of \"self-critical reflection.\" These are fruits of Leninism.Also in Foreign Affairs, Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, notes that \"the autocrat's Achilles' heel is an inherent lack of credible self-restraint.\" In Xi's China, there is \"widespread fear not seen since the days of Mao - fear of losing one's property or livelihood, whether temporarily or forever, without warning and without appeal.\" This is a recipe for social paralysis.The Leninist CCP is the nation's neurological system, and is making China sclerotic. In his 1964 biography of Lenin, Louis Fischer, an American foreign correspondent, recalled that a participant in Lenin's autopsy said that blood vessels in his brain were so calcified that \"when struck with a tweezer they sounded like stone.\" China's regime has a Leninist brain like that.Reach George Will at georgewill@washpost.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Salisbury man convicted in investment fraud and theft of $1.8 million\n\n September 14, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 14 | Section: News \n \n 689\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BALTIMORE - A Salisbury man was sentenced Thursday, Sept. 7, to more than five years in federal prison for wire fraud conspiracy and aggravated identity theft in connection to the theft of more than $1.8 million from Shore Appliance Connection.U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow sentenced Stephen Franklin, 54, to 66 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release for the theft conspiracy. Franklin was ordered to pay restitution for the full amount of the victims' losses, which the parties stipulate is $1,850,488.94.Franklin was the chief operating officer of Accurate Optical, a chain of optometric shops on the Eastern Shore with locations in Easton, Cambridge, Kent Island, Salisbury, Ocean City and Berlin.With the owners of Accurate Optical, he purchased East Coast Optometric, a chain of optical shops in South Carolina.According to a release from the U.S.Attorney's Office, Franklin and co-defendant Duane G. Larmore met through the Salisbury Chamber of Commerce and became friendly. Larmore was an employee at Shore Appliance Connection whose duties included maintaining the books and records for the company.From mid-September 2016 through March 2020, Franklin conspired with others, including Larmore, to steal more than $1.8 million from Shore Appliance.Specifically, Franklin and Larmore stole over $1 million from Shore Appliance to use for their own purposes, including to make investments and to pay business expenses for Franklin's businesses, without the knowledge and consent of the owners of Shore Appliance.For example, Franklin convinced Larmore to invest $100,000 in an oil deal that promised quick and substantial returns. Those funds were ultimately returned to Shore Appliance because the name on the bank account did not match the named beneficiary on the wire transfer form completed by Franklin.Prior to the funds being returned and at Franklin's urging, Larmore transferred another $100,000 to a purported attorney for the oil deal. Franklin convinced Larmore to invest in other deals, including: in 2016, a $95,000 initial investment with a finance company in London followed by another $300,000, plus funds for expenses and travel abroad; in 2018, an investment through W.S. of $35,000 and an investment through Gateway Capital of $50,000; and in 2019-2020, investments and expenses through I.P. and E. P. S. to recover assets purportedly in the custody of U.S. Customs, part of the Department of Homeland Security.No investment paid any return to the schemers.To conceal how much money had been removed from Shore Appliance and to obtain cash to invest, Franklin suggested that Larmore enter into factoring contracts.Franklin had experience with borrowing operating funds for his optical companies from factors and provided Larmore with the names and contact information for factoring companies.Factoring is a means by which businesses can obtain cash quickly by leveraging accounts receivable.With Franklin's encouragement, Larmore applied for a factoring contract for Shore Appliance without the knowledge or approval of the owners, corporate directors, or officers of Shore Appliance.As detailed in the plea agreement, the factoring contracts provided cash deposits to Shore Appliance's bank accounts but encumbered the accounts receivable of Shore Appliance and required payments and interest of more than $725,000.To obtain contracts with factoring companies for Shore Appliance and to conceal the fact that the Shore Appliance owners were not aware of and had not approved the factoring contracts, the signatures of the owners were forged, and the fraudulent signatures were witnessed or notarized by Franklin.In all, Larmore paid $739,295.28 of Shore Appliance's funds, without the officers and owners' knowledge or consent, to invest in fraudulent schemes that never paid any money back. Of that amount, $395,000 was moved through bank accounts controlled by Franklin.Franklin caused an additional loss of $171,548.67 by having Larmore transfer funds to Franklin or to Franklin's companies.As a result of the conspiracy and efforts to conceal the losses, Shore Appliance lost an additional $731,250.07 in fees and other payments to factors and to factoring brokers.Larmore, 48, of Salisbury, has pleaded guilty to his role in the conspiracy and is awaiting sentencing.U.S. Attorney Erek L. Barron commended the FBI for its work in the investigation.Barron thanked Assistant U.S.Attorney Evelyn Lombardo Cusson, who is prosecuting the case. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And Republicans want to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and the Child Tax Credit, among other social programs, the president charged.\"Their plan, MAGAnomics, is more extreme than anything America's ever seen before,\" Biden said.Biden stated that job satisfaction was higher than it has been in 36 years and that his administration is growing the economy.\"That's Bidenomics, that's the objective of it,\" he said.Biden's economic message is the centerpiece of his bid for reelection, but the president is battling against widespread public dissatisfaction with the economy. Almost 70% of Americans feel the economy is getting worse, according to a Suffolk University Sawyer Business School/USA Today poll released Wednesday. The survey said 84% of respondents said their cost of living is going up.Sade Davis, a second-year public health student at Prince George's Community College, does not see it that way. As a mother to two sons and a first-generation college student, she told Capital News Service in an interview that Biden is a symbol of hope for families like hers, representing a dedication to bolster the middle class and support hardworking American families.Davis, who introduced Biden, said she believes in the direction the president is leading the country, emphasizing, \"I think we definitely need some kind of economic push in the right direction.\" When asked how Biden can reverse polls showing most Americans are unhappy with the economy, she emphasized the need for Americans to pursue education and opportunities like she has.\"When we have more educated Americans that actually understand President Biden's agenda, it's easier to share that message with your neighbor,\" she said.Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said in remarks before Biden spoke that \"factories are opening across America.\" Hoyer also touted the Biden administration's efforts to lower health care, prescription drug, and energy costs.Biden dismissed his predecessor as \"Donald Hoover Trump\" and blistered Republicans for saying that \"everything's wrong with America.\" \"They keep telling us that America is failing,\" the president said. \"Well, they're wrong. They're failing. America's not failing. America's winning, and there's one reason for it: you.\" \n \n Caption: NMERCADO/CAPITAL NEWS SERVICE\n \nPresident Joe Biden speaks at Prince George's Community College Thursday, comparing his efforts to improve the economy to what he called the Republicans' \"extreme\" plans to give tax breaks to the wealthy and cut social programs. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Recently, my husband's father died and we received a small inheritance.We sat down to decide how to handle this money. I pulled out the book and showed my husband the chapter on the 10-10-80 formula and the information about the Freedom Account.We figured out our expenses. We were shocked to discover we've been spending almost $1,800 more than we make each month. I guess we didn't notice because we would take a little out of savings to cover expenses as needed. At this rate, all of our inheritance would be gone in no time. Needless to say, I became rather depressed as we started reducing the outgo to balance our expenses with our income. We are looking at every area of spending and have already found so many ways we could make the adjustments.My husband actually thanked me this morning for all the work I've been doing on our budget.He always wondered why it seemed we were making good money but never able to save any. Now we know.I am telling you all of this to say thank you! I never would have figured this out if it hadn't been for \"Debt-Proof Living.\" I'll keep you posted on our progress. - Kimberly Dear Kimberly: Your letter reminded me of an interesting statistic I came across recently, which said that it takes an average of 17 months' time for a person to completely spend an inheritance. Aren't you glad you won't be part of that statistic? So am I! Thanks for writing.

Eating lunch out day after day is expensive.Here, let me do the math: $15 x 5 Days = $75 x 50 weeks = $3,750 per year. And that's just a quick estimate.If you could cut that number in half by bringing your lunch to work, you'd still have $1,875 for your savings account. However, I'm certain that with the right incentive (money in the bank is a great one), you could do even better than that.A GOOD CONTAINERFor me, a true brown bag is too flimsy. I want a lunch bag that is insulated, sturdy, leakproof and as attractive as possible. Cruise on over to Amazon, search \"lunch bags\" and you're sure to find hundreds to choose from that are as practical as they are cute.Look for one made of neoprene and that is insulated with a zipper closure. The test of a good lunch container is how often it is used.BENTO BOXESThese are portable food boxes with compartments that fit inside the lunch box to keep wet things wet, dry things dry and all things visually appetizing. The best bento boxes, in my opinion, have tight-fitting lids.I use a set of four compartment bento boxes and find myself using them for storing leftovers as well as in a lunch bag. While not completely leakproof (I wouldn't fill one with milk, for example), they keep lunch items fresh and tasty, and most are leak-resistant.

Now and then I get lazy, and then I get an immediate jolt that reminds me why I do this.My FoodsSaver gets a workout every day. Depending on the type of food, I use FoodSaver containers and canisters, plastic bags and canning jars to seal food items (this requires the jar sealer accessory).BLENDER I am more convinced than ever that healthy eating is one of the most cost-effective things we can do to reduce health care costs. That's why I thought we needed a powerful juicer to make healthy smoothies every morning. So I purchased a highly rated juicer - and used it exactly two times before it became a dust collector and space occupier.Cleaning the thing was so difficult and time-consuming it became more of a problem than a solution. Whoops.Another problem? Juicers don't make smoothies. Powerful professional-grade blenders do.So, six years ago, I donated the juicer to a friend who could use it and replaced it with a Blendtec Total Classic Original Blender.DEHYDRATOR No one was more surprised than me by what a terrific money saver a dehydrator can be. Of course, you have to actually use it. But when you do, you'll be quite amazed.The cost of dehydrating your own food is a fraction of the cost of commercially dehydrated foods, and with no additives or preservatives.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\"COPYR IGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

These new recreational use licenses will serve social equity applicants, with Maryland the first state to reserve the first round of cannabis licenses for those businesses.The MCA opened a social equity verification portal on Sept. 8 for applicants to ensure they qualify for this round before they apply, which Harris-Pierce is currently working on. To qualify, an applicant must have at least 65% ownership in their business and meet at least one of the following criteria:. Have lived in a disproportionately impacted area for at least five of the last 10 years. Attended a public school in a disproportionately impacted area for at least five years. Spent at least two years at a four-year institution of higher education in Maryland where at least 40% of attendees are eligible for a Pell Grant.LaWann Stribling, an aspiring cannabis business owner who only recently qualified as a social equity applicant, explains that social equity goes beyond where you live.\"I have two children whose fathers suffered from the war on drugs,\" Stribling said. \"No one is taking into account any families who have suffered that way, or families who have been incarcerated but didn't live in a disenfranchised area.\"Following the distribution of Round 1 licenses, the MCA will conduct a disparity study which will determine the criteria for Round 2 applicants, set to launch in the spring of 2024.Jake Van Wingerden, founder and president of SunMed Growers, has been a cannabis business licensee since 2016. He said that while the licensing has set dates for a reason, there will not be enough time between the first and second rounds for these applicants to get established and see how social equity is addressed.\"To actually think that any cannabis operator can get started in months is not realistic,\" he said.Despite these hesitations, Del. Jheanelle Wilkins, D-Montgomery, who as chair of the Legislative Black Caucus prioritized adult-use cannabis in the bill and helped assure access for social equity applicants, says the licensing process is right on schedule.\"The first step is putting out the information so that only qualified individuals take out the time and the effort to apply,\" she said. \"(It's) a perfect timeline to make sure that the applicants are able to have a fair process and that the application period is open as required by law with the ability to award them by Jan. 1.\"Wilkins added: \"We have worked to leave no stone unturned in terms of providing as much support as we can as a state, and making sure that the licenses are distributed in an equitable way that are reflective of repairing past harms and making sure that we're including as many people as possible, so I'm really proud of the bill.\"For Harris-Pierce, she is not in this business to make money, but because she wants to be one of the first Black female veteran-owned cannabis dispensaries in the state. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'How Lucky Is This Community' - Connect Talbot Project Celebrated For Its Success\n\n September 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; Njones@Chespub.Com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 856\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CORDOVA - More than 60 representatives from the U.S. Department of Agriculture took a field trip to the Eastern Shore Wednesday to celebrate the continued progress of Easton Utilities' Connect Talbot project.Headed by Easton Utilities, the Connect Talbot project is extending broadband to unserved portions of Talbot County. The USDA provided significant initial support for the rural connectivity initiative in July 2020 when the agency awarded Easton Utilities $13.1 million in grant funding for the project.Wednesday's activities kicked off at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova, where USDA representatives took in technical demonstrations and checked out stations designed to show broadband deployment.Guests enjoyed a hands-on experience with field crews showcasing their work, including all components from initial construction techniques, plowing, drilling, aerial lashing and the installation process connecting service to the side of the home.Demonstrations were followed by a customer panel sharing the positive impacts of broadband service made possible by the Connect Talbot and lunch on the winery grounds.In the afternoon, federal, state and local officials gathered to praise Connect Talbot's progress so far.Laurel Leverrier, the assistant administrator of the USDA's rural utility service telecommunications program, expressed gratitude for the opportunity to see the work being done on the ground in Talbot County - the first trip of its kind for her.\"It's very clear being here and meeting with you all and hearing from folks that you're serving of what a community focus your organization has,\" she said of Easton Utilities. \"I think part of it is the type of entity you are - you're municipally owned and operated I think it's really unique, and I think, 'How lucky is this community to get to benefit from the services you provide.'\" Sen. Johnny Mautz, R-37, emphasized the significance of prioritizing broadband accessibility for children in Talbot County.\"To put the power of the internet in the hands of our children is just phenomenal.And the investment that's been made; when we first talked about this, it would never pay for itself, you can't get the revenue or return out of the investment and what you're putting in - that's very true, that's not going to happen right away,\" he said. \"But I will guarantee you over the years, we will see benefits beyond anyone's imagination for what you've been able to do for our area.\"Mautz thanked the USDA for providing supplemental funding for the project, the cost of which has now risen significantly.Talbot County Council Vice President Pete Lesher acknowledged that prior to the project's kickoff, the county's 37,000 residents were divided between \"digital haves and digital have nots.\" But with the USDA funding and efforts from local government and Easton Utilities, rural addresses across the county are being connected.\"This is our proudest moment,\" he said. \"This is delivering on the American promise of a land of equal opportunity. This is transforming the lives in our community.This is creating prosperity in our corner of rural America.\"Also expressing gratitude was Easton Mayor Megan Cook, who emphasized the importance of the infrastructure in providing rural residents with connectivity and accessibility to enjoy the benefits of education, social interaction, health care, remote work, entertainment and more.\"Connectivity, interconnectedness, support, community - these are all pieces of the same puzzle, and they all become more important with each passing day,\" she said. \"It's our ability to look out for each other, and help where and when we can, to reap what we sow - that is truly essential.\"Easton Velocity has made significant progress installing and providing broadband service to significant portions of Talbot County.As of early September, Easton Velocity has completed more than 50% of the mileage construction mileage and offered access to more than 1,750 locations.According to Easton Utilities, 920 of these locations have already subscribed to service and are enjoying the benefits internet service offers.Since the initial grant funding in 2020, various grant funding sources now total over $30 million. The project will now provide access to 4,400 locations and is estimated to cost $40 million.The scope and timeline of the project are reflected on a real-time interactive map.The project is on track for completion in advance of the grant requirement deadline of Dec. 31, 2026, according to Ted L. Book, vice president of Easton Velocity.Hugh Grunden, Easton Utilities' president and CEO, closed out the celebration with appreciation for the wider community effort to bring broadband to the county's rural areas.\"It's about partnerships - we could not have done this alone, the county couldn't have done it alone,\" he said.\"So when you partner with the likes of the USDA, the state of Maryland, Talbot County, the Town of Easton, Easton Utilities, whether it be for the engineering, the funding or the execution, that's how it works.\" \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nEaston Mayor Megan Cook speaks to a crowd gathered to celebrate the progress of the Connect Talbot project.\n \nNATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nRepresentatives from the USDA, Easton Utilities and state and local governments gathered to celebrate the progress of the Connect Talbot initiative.\n \nNATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nHugh Grunden, president and CEO of Easton Utilities, speaks to a crowd celebrating the Connect Talbot project's progress. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Despite workers strike, UAW running out of gas\n\n September 22, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 768\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Henry Ford, according to corporate legend, said that if he had asked potential customers what they wanted when he founded his company in 1903, they would have said faster horses. The infant automobile industry began by giving people what they did not know they wanted.Twelve decades later, this industry is being discombobulated by government pressure to manufacture products - electric vehicles - that the public does not much want, least of all in the quantities that Washington's central planners deem proper.There has been much commentary about the nation's \"new economy\" because of all the new devices produced to serve the digital economy, and because of the dominance of finance - the making of deals rather than material things. Yet here we are, invited to be fixated on a partial strike affecting only a portion of a quintessential example of the old economy: the automobile industry.During the strike, much of the industry continues to manufacture vehicles, far from Detroit.In 1979, United Auto Workers membership peaked at 1.5 million, in a national civilian workforce of 98.8 million.Today, the \"big three\" - General Motors, Ford, Stellantis (Chrysler's parent company) - employ about 150,000 UAW members, and the civilian workforce is about 160 million. Time was, America's auto manufacturing meant those three.Today, they are not nearly as important as they were in May 1950, when the UAW and GM signed the \"Treaty of Detroit.\" No one wanted a repeat of that year's 104-day strike against Chrysler that idled 100,000 in Detroit.The \"treaty\" improved wages and established pensions and company-paid health care.In the 1950s, Detroit was the nation's fifth-largest city (it is now 27th) and Germany and Japan were still struggling to recover from damage done by U.S. bombers, many with Ford-built engines.U.S. car companies, with 95 percent of the national market share, had negligible competition and could pass along to consumers the costs of labor contracts.Labor strife in Detroit - the automobile industry had supplanted railroads as the emblem of the nation's industrial might - used to be riveting news: Capitalism's big battalions were battling for supremacy. Now, the union and the companies are subordinate to much the biggest battalion: the federal government.In a market economy, labor and management participate in profitmaking, then tussle over carving the profit pie. Now, however, government hovers over the negotiating table, armed with monetary incentives (subsidies) and regulatory coercions (e.g., everstricter CAFE - corporate average fuel economy - standards).The Biden administration is ladling at least $12 billion into the automakers to cushion them against the Biden administration.Against, that is, myriad government pressures to quickly eliminate the non-EVs that the obdurate public prefers.This will require the companies to make tens of billions in capital investments, some of which with money the public will provide.The semi/sort of/once-upon-a-time private companies will pretend this is private enterprise, freshly reimagined.The UAW reasons, not unreasonably, that its job is to seize for its members as much as it can of the billions sloshing around in the name of \"industrial policy\" subsidies. Meanwhile, non-UAW production lines are still humming along, disproportionately in the South's right-to-work states.The UAW worries that EVs, having many fewer components than internal combustion vehicles, will require many fewer assembly workers. Last year, Ford's CEO suggested 40 percent fewer. The union probably cannot even moderate the Biden administration's climate monomania. It might, however, extort some taxpayer-funded payoffs.The union should also worry that many Americans will keep their gas-powered cars longer than usual, rather than take a leap of faith regarding EVs. How many miles can they go between charges? The government is in charge of guaranteeing an adequate supply of charging stations, so drivers, too, should worry. To understand why this month's inventory of unsold EVs is almost twice that of gas-powered vehicles, start by reading NPR's report on Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm's misadventures during her planned drive from Charlotte to Memphis, trying to demonstrate EVs' delights. Fortunately, her advance team had a gas-powered car.Regarding one matter, the UAW is too timid, given the nation's increasingly political - very political - economy. The UAW rails against the CEOs' salaries at GM, Ford and Stellantis - reportedly $29 million (362 times a median employee's earnings), $21 million (281 times), and $24.8 million (365 times), respectively, in 2022.The UAW should propose that each CEO be paid $152,771, the highest base pay for GS-15 federal civil servants. This is what the CEOs should be considered, because their companies have become appendages of government, implementing its policies.Reach George Will at georgewill@washpost.com. \n \n Caption: GEORGE F.WILL\n \nPeople strike at the Ford Michigan Assembly Plant on Sept. 15 in Wayne, Michigan.\n \nVALAURIAN WALLER/WASHINGTON POST \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Now is a great time to get into home ownership\n\n September 22, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 15 | Section: News \n \n 668\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Mortgage rates may be higher today than what buyers have become accustomed, but rates are still lower than they were in 1981 when rates were 18.63%. In other words, rates fluctuate, but owning a home is an investment in your future. So why wait? It is still a great time to buy.\"I hear clients tell me they think interest rates are too high. They are going to wait to purchase a home when the rates come down,\" notes Mid-Shore Board President Megan Rosendale. \"I respond by saying you don't live in an interest rate; you live in a house, and I suggest they not wait because no one knows if or when this may or may not happen.\" Buyers need to understand the market is not going to return to the pandemic interest rate levels of 2.65 like they were in January 2021 anytime soon. Just because the rates were low did not mean it was easy to find a house. Buyers had to do all kinds of crazy things in addition to going way over asking price to get a home.It is not ideal to give up contingencies, waive appraisals or accept a home that needs repairs and pay $100,000 over list price, but that was what was happening, Rosendale said.In the end, things even out.It is a better situation today for buyers, they can make an offer in a less chaotic setting where they may have some leverage with a seller when it comes to negotiating terms.\"If you can afford a home, get in now, five years from now you will be glad you did. It may not be your forever home, but it can be a way to start accumulating equity and when the rates do drop, and they will, you can refinance or even find a different home,\" Rosendale said.The Mid-Shore and most of the Unites States continue to be in a low inventory market.We have seen the cost for some properties make pricing adjustments; however, the price of homes overall continues to increase. In fact, for our Mid-Shore region, the median price of a home has increased by 13.77% from 2019. Most of the properties that are overpriced for their condition and/or location, need work and don't show that well are the ones seeing price reductions.It is an interesting fact, but when a property is adjusted to the right price, it can actually create a multiple offer situation, Rosendale said.Some thoughts to consider about homeownership: With a fixed-rate mortgage, your monthly principal and interest payments will remain the same for the life of your loan.Your mortgage interest may be tax-deductible.(Property taxes and mortgage points may also be deductible; consult your tax adviser.)If your home increases in value, you could make a profit when you sell.A home could be passed on to children or other family members.Equity built through home ownership can be used to finance educational expenses, home-improvement projects, small-business startup costs or other needs.You decide when and what home improvements to make.A landlord cannot decide to sell your house and force you to move.Home ownership is still an American Dream, it is your land, for your family. The financial benefits are worthwhile, but the home also provides stability and security.Studies indicate that homeowners move less often and are more likely to vote and volunteer in their communities.Children of homeowners tend to perform better in school and attain higher levels of education than children of parents who do not own a home. Dollar for dollar, the rate of return on owning a house is substantial, and it is how many American families begin to accumulate wealth.Owning a home is a good investment, So why wait? Meet with a Mid-Shore Realtor and start the process and see why it's a great time to buy.The Mid-Shore Board of Realtors mission is to advocate for its members and the public to preserve the right to own, transfer and utilize real property.

The average age of a passenger vehicle on the road has just hit a record 12.5 years. And no wonder now that the average monthly car payment for new vehicles hit $725 in the first quarter of denly, for many, taking on that kind of new debt feels a lot worse than driving a new car feels good.Most cars and trucks are built to last far longer than we can imagine. And when all is said and done, the difference between a clunker and a cream puff is mainly the difference between how the owner has cared for it.Research by major car manufacturers reveals that neglect of routine service and maintenance is the No. 1 reason for major car repairs. Routine maintenance doesn't cost; it saves money, aggravation, frustration and lives. Pay attention. Anticipate maintenance so you don't have to pay for repairs.When you need a major repair, if at all possible, get three estimates before you proceed. Don't only judge by the lowest price but judge by competence, ability, experience, equipment, and after-service care.When you find a good mechanic you trust, stick with him or her even if the prices are a bit higher. All things being equal, you'll save time, money and aggravation in the long run. Plus, your mechanic will get to know your car more intimately.It's true. A clean car - inside and out - lasts longer because you are routinely washing away gunk, grime and contaminants that cause corrosion. A sparkling clean car makes you feel better.Follow these suggestions and you can look forward to doubling your car's useful life.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Is there any value in converting my existing 401(k) into cash without removing the funds from my 401(k)? Do they even allow that? I hate losing all that lovely money as things dip and swirl. I would continue to contribute at my existing rate, 12%, including the company match of 3% for the 401(k).- SymanthaDear Symantha: Employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as 401(k), typically have a cash option within the list of investments available to plan members. Look for a money market fund. If you move your account assets into that fund (which is perfectly allowable), the money is going to just sit there, not earning. It will be shielded from the wild swings in the market but will begin to lose value because you will not earn enough on your account to even keep up with inflation (reportedly 3.18% at this writing).The very nature of investing is that you expose money to reasonable levels of risk with the expectation of achieving a profit or gain. Not all of the choices in your 401(k) plan carry the same level of risk. Just remember that in order to achieve a reward, you must be willing to take a reasonable level of risk. No risk, no reward.The biggest problem with moving your account into a \"cash position\" is figuring how you will know when to move it back into investment funds that will give you a chance of achieving a gain. A better idea would be to contact your plan's administrator and make an appointment to meet with an investment counselor to assess all of the options you have in your 401k plan. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Stop playing Russian roulette with economy\n\n September 28, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 618\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In a few days, millions of federal employees, including active-duty military, could see their paychecks cut off.If the government shuts down at midnight Saturday, many federal services could be reduced or completely halted, affecting everything from national parks to food safety inspection to passport processing to airport security.Depending on how long the shutdown lasts, it could ultimately deprive poor children of federal nutrition and health care aid.Yet it will cost the taxpayers millions of dollars in lost economic activity - to say nothing of the real threat of downgrading America's creditworthiness, which would add to the national debt going forward.But, hey, Eric Burlison isn't worried.\"I'm not afraid of a shutdown,\" the Republican Missouri congressman was quoted as saying recently.Easy for him to say. His paycheck isn't at risk. Meanwhile, many of the U.S. military personnel who would suddenly stop getting paid will nonetheless be required to show up for work.Burlison is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, the misnamed klatch of hard-right extremists who are once again threatening to shackle America's economy.Readers aren't helpless to confront them. Even these bull-headed ideologues cannot entirely ignore the wishes of their constituents and fellow Republicans who, unlike themselves, actually care about the stability of government services. Pressure from the public could help. Contact numbers for Republican House members.The nation has, of course, been here before - earlier this year, in fact, when this same gang of political nihilists threatened to shut down the government over their demands for spending cuts.President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., averted a shutdown then with a deal in June that included about $1.5 trillion in spending cuts. But the Freedom Caucus wants more and is once again holding the government at fiscal gunpoint to get it.There are three things to keep in mind about those demands: One, they come from some of the same Republicans who enthusiastically rammed through the GOP's 2017 tax cuts. Those cuts primarily helped wealthy individuals and corporations, issued crumbs to everyone else and are expected to ultimately add close to $2 trillion to the federal debt. Republican debt obsession is, as always, situational - the situation being which party holds the White House.Two, the only ways to achieve significant levels of spending reductions is to deeply cut the defense budget, which the Freedom Caucus won't do; deeply cut Social Security and Medicare, which they'd like to do but won't admit to; or cut everything else - education, health care, basic government services, everything - to the bone. And even that won't come near the reductions the caucus claims to want.And three, this ultimately isn't just about money but about the Freedom Caucus' insistence that McCarthy, their House hostage - er, speaker - shut Democrats out of the process entirely. Caucus members have made clear they have zero interest in any kind of compromise with the opposing party.Which means no plan they would approve will stand a chance in the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats.These extremists don't even represent the majority of their own party, let alone the nation. Yet because of McCarthy's tenuous hold on his speakership, they are once again threatening to \"burn the whole place down,\" as McCarthy himself recently put it.Perhaps he shouldn't have given them the matches in the first place. If there's still some semblance of sanity among the vast majority of House Republicans who aren't members of the Freedom Caucus, they will join with Democrats to take them away.Toward that end, readers who are represented by Republicans in the House can and should pressure those elected officials to quit playing Russian roulette with America's economy.REPRINTED FROM THE ST.

    "content": "Check electricity costs when buying a home\n\n September 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 15 | Section: News \n \n 798\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Homebuyers' preferences are constantly evolving, but their desire to live in a home with increased energy performance and a more comfortable, healthier, living space has increased.While most newer homes include green features, finding one that meets your clients' expectations can be challenging, especially in a tight real estate market where many of the homes for sale were built 30 or more years ago. For buyers, the solution often involves finding an agent who understands their priorities and can help decide if a home measures up - or can be modified without breaking their budget.High-performance homes have always been in demand, but here are a few trends of recent interest.:1. Electricity costs more.In less than three years, the average price of electricity in U.S. cities has risen over 24%, from 13.6 to 16.9 cents per kilowatt-hour, driving up the cost to heat, cool and power a home's lights and appliances.Already faced with high housing prices and interest rates, many buyers want to know the cost of operating a home before buying it. The answer is not as simple as asking for the owner's utility bills because energy consumption patterns could differ significantly.Instead, buyers can evaluate a home's energy-performance features. For example, a cooling system with a high SEER rating can bring instant relief to homebuyers that may face intense heatwaves. Delmarva Power provides, at a cost, a Home Energy Assessment that will help identify areas in the home that are not an efficient as they could be.Also, look for resources like energy auditors, they can provide an audit in the inspection process. It helps if you are familiar with the auditors' rating systems, like the Home Energy Rating System (HERS), Home Energy Score (HES), and the Pearl Certification.2. New ways to save.Some Realtors are familiar with various rebates and tax credits that can help their buyers in selecting the best properties for making an existing home more energy efficient while enjoying substantial savings on upgrades. The Inflation Reduction Act contains several new tax credits and rebates for 2023 to help households pay for energy efficiency upgrades, electric vehicles, electric heating and cooling systems, and certain electric appliances. If you are considering buying any of the following items or services, you may be eligible for tax credits and/or rebates that can help you pay for them: opc.mary-land.gov/Consumer-Learning/Inflation-Reduction-Act.Maryland Energy Administration has an Energy Storage Income tax credit designed to encourage the deployment of energy storage systems in Maryland. The tax credit is available to residential and commercial taxpayers who have installed an energy storage system on their residential or commercial property in Maryland.Under the enabling statute, the state may award a total of $750,000 in tax credit certificates during a given tax year. Tax credit certificates will be awarded to eligible applicants on a first come, first served basis. This program was so popular it is sold out for 2023 but it will open again in 2024. (energy.maryland.gov/business/Pages/EnergyStorage.aspx)Researching solar panels and the placement is something to consider. Buyers want eco friendly homes but not at the expense of a yard. It is vital to have supporting documents of your solar contracts including roof quality inspection before installing.3. Climate considerations.Majorities of homebuyers and sellers say they are reluctant to move to areas at risk of natural disasters, extreme temperatures, and/or rising sea levels. However, that has not stopped the flow of new residents into numerous disaster-prone areas. We cannot predict the likelihood of a devastating local event, but being on the Eastern Shore we know we have flooding issues and are always watchful for hurricanes.Still, Realtors can help buyers evaluate whether a home includes improvements like a reinforced roof and garage door, impact-resistant glass, or storm shutters in areas where hurricanes threaten.Agents should be able to point buyers to the best climate risk data resources to form their conclusions about the risks they may face. Also, Realtors can recommend buyers research if the home will need flood insurance, especially when just one inch of water can cause roughly twenty-five thousand dollars of damage to a home. To see if the home is in a flood zone, floodsmart.gov.Realtors can support clients in many other ways. For example, they can highlight how a home includes upgraded features like energy-efficient systems, a tight building envelope, or a whole-house air purification system. This will help entice buyers eager to purchase a green home.If buyers and sellers prioritize sustainable home features or want to maximize the eco-aspects of their purchase or sale price, they want a Mid-Shore Realtor who understands the nuances and technical aspects of energy efficient homes.The Mid-Shore Board of Realtors mission is to advocate for its members and the public to preserve the right to own, transfer and utilize real property.

    "content": "Ahoy! It's crony capitalism sailing in U.S. ports\n\n October 5, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: George F. Will | Page: 7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 779\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Wesley Jones, a Republican U.S. senator from Washington, 1909-1932, should be canonized as the patron saint of industrial policy. His contribution to such mischief, which is enjoying a rebirth of respectability, is in its second century of doing damage.His advocacy of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, a.k.a. the Jones Act, included the usual cant about serving national security and the public interest generally. The act began, however, as garden-variety political parochialism.It survives because it is defended by the \"reliance interests\" - industries tethered to government favoritism - that industrial policy, a.k.a. protectionism or crony capitalism, invariably produces.Industrial policy involves government supplanting society's myriad private collaborations - i.e., market transactions - to allocate resources and opportunities as government thinks best.Such policy empowers government, which is politics in every fiber of its being, to supplant markets in shaping the future, deciding which industries and products should prosper. Jones wanted Washington state's shipping industry to prosper, with the help of the other Washington. He particularly wanted to protect his state's shippers from foreign competition serving ports in Alaska - over Alaska's strenuous objections.The Jones Act today requires that cargo transported by water between U.S. ports must travel in ships that are U.S.-flagged and are at least 75 percent U.S.-owned and - crewed. The ships also must be assembled entirely in the United States, with all major components U.S.-fabricated.Passed immediately after one war, the act was rationalized by anticipation of another. Supposedly protecting the domestic shipping industry from foreign competition would stimulate merchant marine shipbuilding sufficient for military emergencies.Predictably, however, protecting the shipping industry from competition increased costs of shipped goods (costs passed along to U.S. consumers), decreased pressure for efficiencies and contributed to the shrinking of U.S. shipbuilding.Colin Grabow and Scott Lincicome of the Cato Institute report that two years after the Jones Act was passed, a government report found that a U.S.-built ship cost 25 percent more than a comparable vessel built abroad. And after a century of the act? \"A U.S.-built tanker costs 300 percent more than one built abroad while a U.S.-built containership has a price premium of 400 percent.\" U.S. shipyards have collectively produced fewer than three a year since 2000.The Jones Act's strictures for \"U.S.-built\" ships include: \"major components\" of the hulls and superstructures, and at least 98.5 percent of the hull and superstructure components' steel weight must be fabricated in the United States. People acquire expensive law degrees to have careers writing such stuff.The 0.5 tacked onto the 98 does, however, perhaps reveal a sly sense of humor.This, however, is not amusing: The quality of the U.S. merchant fleet has national security implications. In Europe, a large, long war of aggression is raging, with the survival of the aggressedagainst nation depending on U.S. weapons, munitions and other materials. A much larger war could erupt in Asia, especially if the aggressor doubts the U.S. ability to sustain a protracted conflict.Jerry Hendrix, a retired Navy captain and senior fellow of the Sagamore Institute, an Indiana think tank, notes in the Atlantic: \"In 1977, American shipbuilders produced more than 1 million gross tons of merchant ships. By 2005, that number had fallen to 300,000.\" In 2022, it was less than 33,000.Norwegian and Dutch yards delivered about 147,000 and 118,000, respectively.The number of oceangoing cargo ships of at least 1,000 gross tons and meeting Jones Act requirements has declined from \"193 to 99 since 2000, and only 78 of those 99 can be deemed militarily useful,\" wrote Grabow and fellow policy analysts Inu Manak and Daniel Ikenson in 2018.\"Facing exorbitant replacement costs, ship owners are compelled to squeeze as much life as possible out of their existing vessels. Excluding tankers, the ships in the Jones Act fleet currently average 30 years old, fully 11 years older than the average age of a ship in the world merchant fleet of other developed countries.\" The authors above were writing for the Cato Institute.The libertarian think tank located near Capitol Hill, where crony capitalism originates, disparages the Jones Act. As does the Mercatus Center, which incubates market-oriented ideas at George Mason University.Cato obtained, through the Freedom of Information Act process, documents related to a 2020 meeting of a committee that advises, on behalf of the U.S. shipping industry, the U.S. Maritime Administration, which oversees the industry. The committee's recommendations included: \"Charge all past and present members of the Cato and Mercatus Institutes with treason.\" Such brainstorming from industrial policy's defenders indicates their assessment of their arguments' persuasiveness.Reach George Will at georgewill@washpost.com. \n \n Caption: MELINA MARA/WASHINGTON POST\n \nWith 44 container ships waiting off shore to be unload of their merchandise, a hectic and overcrowded Port of Los Angeles operates 24 hours a day in San Pedro, California, in 2021. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We are in our mid 70s and since our childhood we have always vacationed on the Eastern Shore. Twenty years ago we relocated to Northeast, Tennessee, but still annually come back to the Eastern Shore to get our \"seafood and steamed crab fix.\" However, I am writing to you not about your delicious food but about the kindness shown to us by Brent Spurry, owner of the Spurry Tire Company.Our story: We had just finished four glorious days in St. Michaels and while gassing up the car for the 450-mile return trip home, I noticed the valence (or mud guard) located under my front bumper was hanging down. Concerned that it would completely break away while on the highway, I began looking for a repair shop. It was Saturday, and I learned many repair shops were closed. In desperation I asked a kindly person tending our hotel's lawn for help. He directed me to the Spurry Tire Company on Elliot Road. He said be sure to ask for the owner, Brent Spurry.After a 20-minute ride including through picturesque downtown Easton, I arrived at the Spurry Tire Company. It was a larger business than I anticipated with six bays (all full) and maybe a dozen employees (all very busy). The waiting room was also full of customers which I thought didn't bode well for an out-of-state vehicle with a hanging mud-guard being repaired anytime soon.I reluctantly asked to see Brent Spurry and to my surprise he appeared within a minute. I related my story, and he said his bays were full but when one became available someone would take a look. I walked outside to ponder my next move (should I risk the trip home).Just then I heard a pleasant voice say \"We are putting your car in an open bay.Ten minutes later same voice says \"all fixed you're good to go.\" Surprised and grateful I asked, \"What do I owe you?\"[[---]] see the office was the reply. I return to the waiting room (it was even more crowded).\"Hello, I'm Mr. Townsend, you folks were kind to fix my car, what do I owe you?\" Nothing was the reply from the counter clerk. I said obviously this is a busy place but can I see Mr. Spurry?Within minutes Brent Spurry appeared. I thanked him and politely insisted that I pay him for the work.He smiled and said, \"No charge\" [[---]] even though I'm from out-of-state and he will likely never see me again [[---]] He said, \"No charge.\" In a flash he returned to the shop. I turned to leave and said to the crowded waiting room that they were fortunate to have a Spurry Tire Company in their city.A lady remarked for all to hear \"we know.\" I wrote this letter because I wanted others to know about Brent Spurry and his kindness and business practices.He is a perfect example of practicing excellent customer service even to someone from out-of-state.JERRY AND PEGGY TOWNSENDNortheast, Tennessee \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If you are or have ever been plagued by credit card debt, I can nearly guarantee that revolving expenses related to Christmas have contributed greatly to that miserable situation.Face it: When it comes to Christmas preparations, the longer you wait, the more you'll spend. The opposite is also true: The sooner you get started, the less you'll spend.Don't wait. Do something now.START SAVINGI get that not all of us are into Christmas shopping any other time than December. It just doesn't feel right. What you can do now is get diligent with creating a healthy cash stash so you have the money to do that come December.Stash $50 a week starting now.BOOK TRAVELWe're learning that the ongoing Boeing 737 Max grounding is going to affect holiday travel, and not in a good way. Southwest Airlines opened its booking calendar for flights in December much earlier than usual. And by the looks things, lots of flights are already sold out. Now's the time to book any holiday travel you have in mind.Southwest allows the cost of a canceled flight to be applied toward future travel and doesn't charge a fee to change flights. The airline is currently waiving fare differences for customers who need to change a trip because of the extended schedule disruption.FAMILY PHOTOWhether it's for your family Christmas card or a framed gift for friends and family, now's a great time to take that photo. You'll have plenty of time to shop around for the best price on high-quality prints. Check out Costco, Snap fish and Vistaprint for great prices.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Staying open after hours, business owners and chamber members were able to network and get a peak at each other's storefronts.Chambers across the country have begun sponsoring \"crawl\" events where members are welcomed into businesses located close to each other, allowing participants drop-in visits to learn more about each participating business, sampling their products and meeting their owners.\"This was our first such event,\" said Chamber Executive Director, Linda Friday, of the Sept. 27 event. \"We were excited for our members to learn more about this special area of our community.We had nearly 70 participants registered to attend, with some never having even been in historic Stevensville before.\" The owners of the businesses were excited to share their history and success with Chamber guests as participants made their way through the few blocks on, and just off Main Street.Bill Huffnell, owner, and Amy Francis, director of Marketing and Communications, of Bay Point Wealth were on hand to greet visitors at their Stevensville office, which happens to be the historic Stevensville bank building of 1903. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and today still showcases the original ornamental pressed tin ceiling and vault. Huffnell provides the building as a site for the Kent Island Heritage Society to use on their tours for $1 a year.Members of the Historic Stevensville Arts & Entertainment District volunteers also greeted guests as they strolled Main Street; providing information on upcoming events, as well as regular activities taking place in the area, as was the Art East organization that supports local artists with regular meetings, trips, book discussions, and participation in community events.Across the street, Joan McWilliams's My Little Studio displayed the many talents of a shared-space gallery, where local artists and crafters rent space to create, show, and sell their work. Classes ranging from jewelry making to quilting are taught there as well.The sweets lovers were not disappointed. Over at the Tasty Toucan, owner Nikki Neboscynsky greeted chamber members Beth Mosner and Anna Hetzel, both from Miltec UV, who asked about her shop and how business was going.Mosner said, \"Lots of members were excited about this event. It's nice to learn more about what these unique businesses have to offer.\" Across the street at the Peace of Cake bakery, sisters Kirsten and Kim Cate were busy working in the open kitchen and receiving compliments from happy chamber members who were enjoying a variety of their freshly baked items.Owners and sisters Kirsten and Kim Cate started their business in the same location 22 years ago and are still going strong.\"Business is a challenge,\" said Kirsten, \"but baking is in our blood. For us, it's more than making a living.\" Chamber member Erich Krach, branch manager of Shore United Bank in Stevensville, said the crawl was his favorite chamber event so far. \"I enjoyed seeing their businesses and seeing what we can offer them for support,\" said Krach.Chamber Board Member Eva Stoops participated as a both a chamber board member and a business located along the \"crawl route.\" Stoops, co-owner of Chesapeake Environmental Lab, Inc., said she wasn't sure how the event would go at first.\"Right at 5 p.m. everyone started showing up,\" she said. \"It's a fabulous event for both the participating businesses and the chamber.Many people don't how much the chamber does in providing these kinds of services and resources.\" Jessica Dolbec, who volunteers for both the Historic Stevensville Society and the Arts & Entertainment organization and works for Improvement Zone that is located on Main Street, assisted the chamber with providing regular communication among the participating businesses.\"It's wonderful to see the businesses open at this time, normally they are closed by now,\" she said. \"I hope that this is a win-win for both groups.\" \n \n Caption: LAURA TAYMAN\n \nMaureen Wheatley is one of several local artists whose works are sold in My Little Studio in historic Stevensville owned by Joan McWilliams.

But you can confidently cancel duplicate coverage.The boost: Add up what you're paying for credit card insurance, life insurance for your kids, mortgage insurance and accident insurance.What was offered to you for just pennies a day is probably about $100 a month, or more, that you will save.Caution: Get a term life policy first if you don't have one, then cancel the duplicates.Don't leave even the tiniest gap between coverage.Has your teenage driver brought home a great report card? Most auto insurance companies will knock about 10% off your premium if an insured teen maintains a 3.0 GPA. Is there an educator in the family? Mercury Insurance and other companies give discounts to credentialed teachers and educational administrators. Discounts also apply if you have a bachelor's degree in engineering or a science-related field. Finally, insurers often give discounts of 20% or more when you insure all of your cars with one company.Caution: Don't assume that discounts are automatic - you have to speak up. Ask to see a complete list, since companies offer different ones.The boost: Compound discounts can really add up for a big save.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\"COPYRIGHT 2023 CREAT ORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Sticking to the speed limit, using cruise control when it's safe and appropriate, and turning off the engine if he's going to idle for more than 10 seconds are other ways this savvy hypermiler wrings every possible mile out of his gasoline.He keeps his tires inflated to their maximum recommended pressure, and if he's running a series of errands, he drives to the farthest destination first to warm the engine to its most efficient temperature, while also increasing gas mileage.Whether you're into the extreme sport of hypmiling or not, all of us can reduce our gasoline costs by simply buying the cheapest gas. Websites like Gas-Buddy.com track local prices every day. A quick log-on will help you take the shortest trip to the station with the cheapest price. Just make sure you start off slowly.And whatever you do, when you see a red light or brake lights ahead, back off that accelerator. Right there, you'll reduce your chances of running out of gas before you get to the station.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" \n \n Caption: MARY HUNT \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You create attributes around that brand. Everything you create has something very similar,\" she said. \"So I applied that to the candles for sure.\"\"Each candle has a story and a custom illustration to support that story. We start with timeless fragrances based on the experience and joy and natural beauty ofthe Eastern Shore and the Chesapeake Bay,\"said Van Dorpe.The candles have evocative names like Starry Nights and Firelight, Chesapeake Homecoming and The Great Blue Heron.And in them, Van Dorpe celebrates the landmarks ofthe Eastern Shore.One ofthe candles is named for the Wye Oak, Wye Mills' famous 500year-old tree, which collapsed during a severe thunderstorm in2002.\"I wanted to tell that story because so many ofus visited it when we were kids,\"Van Dorpe said. \"There is so much history and magic about it. There was an Indian trail that went right by it even before the settlers came along. So I have a candle that smells like oak and autumn and bayberry.\"Scent can conjure, said Van Dorpe, who took a class in perfumery. She creates all ofher scents from scratch.\"My favorite part is blending the fragrances. It can take up to seven or eight months because I really want to get it right,\"she said.Van Dorpe and her two contract workers can make around 1,500 candles a week. Beyond her creative space behind her house, she has a 1,600 square foot facility in D.C., and she is looking for a much much bigger place close to home as her business grows.All ofher natural candles are produced with no petroleum products.\"These are coconut soy wax candles,\"she said. \" In the last ten years, folks in the industry have noticed ifyou use vegetable based wax that is available now, the candles are cleaner to burn. I have found that ifyou add coconut to the wax, then you get the best in all worlds.\"There are about 15 boutiques on the Shore where Van Dorpe sells.One boutique owner in Easton is Louisa Griffin. She runs Curliecue on Goldsbor-ough Street.\"These candles go beyond supporting a local maker. I carry them and restock constantly, because they are the best. They fly offthe shelves and it is always fun to hear what inspired someone to take one (or two) home with them. It's a lovely way to gift a bit ofthe Eastern Shore, whether to yourselfor a lucky recipient,\" said Griffin.Van Dorpe spends a lot of time delivering to wholesalers and boutiques that are mostly on the shore. But she has a larger goal.\"I would like to be in beautiful boutiques throughout the country and share the story of the Chesapeake Bay and the Eastern Shore with the rest of the country. People are inter-ested.

I first cut off the used edges to make new edges, then I decided to cut the sponges into thirds when they're new. Much more efficient.-SueIf you are taking salad for lunch, pour the amount of dressing you will need into the bottom corner of a small plastic bag. Put a twist tie above the dressing and cut off the rest of the bag. When you are ready to eat, just snip off the corner and squeeze the dressing into your salad. - KristineMy toddler eats only a small portion of a box of macaroni and cheese. Leftover mac and cheese is never a hit, and the individual packs are too pricy. Instead, I buy the boxes when they are on sale, open every box and store the cheese powder and noodles in separate jars. Now, I can prepare individual servings as needed. I use ½ cup of dry noodles and 1 heaping tablespoon each of cheese powder, butter and milk.-MichelTo get rid of mineral rings in the toilet, put some warm water in the toilet bowl and add one or two denture tablets. Check its progress in 30 minutes. The toilet should be sparkling clean. - AmyI save water by washing my car using the dew in the early morning.

Tawes has always been and is part great food, part great networking and part great schmoozing, the level to which every attendee will engage in is up to them.Tickets provide an opportunity to partake in an all you can eat selection of seafood and sides.At a recent crab feast in Easton, attendees got a single serving of seafood, chicken and sides for $60 per person. No small wonder why a significant number of Tawes attendees are nonpolitical and attend the event Tawes for the food, to reconnect with old friends and to make new friends.The central feature of Tawes is not a large tent hosted by the office of Bruce Bereano with signs reading invitation only.Every Tawes attendee can partake of the food available at Bereano's tent if they purchased a Tawes event ticket from his office in advance. He sells tickets to anyone who wants one at face value, with no markup or handing fee. He remits the full amount collected for every ticket sold to the Crisfield Chamber of Commerce.Bereano also supports the Crisfield community by purchasing goods and services from Crisfield vendors and merchants.He pays students from Crisfield area schools to serve guests in his tent.Local school administrators have expressed deep gratitude not only for the money these students earn, but also for lifelong lessons learned on the values of hard work and customer service.DAVID REELEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There's nothing like a couple of episodes of the reality television show \"Hoarders\" to make even the biggest clutter bug want to get rid of something.It crossed my mind that, at least in one episode, the subject hoarders were living with their stuff, which is more than we can say for the 14.6 million U.S. households that are paying a public storage facility, every month, to store their stuff.Why is self-storage such a big business in the U.S.?One facility owner told me that the industry counts on - and even capitalizes on - the fact that once renters move in, they're in. Facility owners know that no one likes the idea of spending the day moving all their accumulation of stuff out of storage.Of course, there are situations where self-storage may become a necessary expense.However, the operative word should be \"temporary,\" a stopgap for a specific period, not permanent.Let's say you are paying this small fortune each year to store stuff you truly like. Your enjoyment level is off the charts. When was the last time you actually thought about those items or took the time to visit?After all, how much can you really enjoy something you have stashed away in an offsite storage unit? Take a photo of all the things you like so much. Often, it's the memory you're looking for.A photo will take care of that, allowing you to get rid of the items themselves.If you're ready to take control of your storage situation, I have two words for you: eliminate and organize, in that order.Make a decision for when you will go through all those boxes and bins. Tell a friend or relative of your decision, then ask that person to hold you accountable to keep it.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\"COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The conference, sponsored by the Delaware Chapter of the Public Relations Society of America, explored the story oftour-ism and its impact on the tri-state area of southern Delaware, Maryland's Eastern Shore and Cape May County in southern NewJersey.The feasibility study on a Bay ferry was initially scheduled for release by the end of the year. \"(It's) a little later than that,\"Pironis said.A consortium ofcounties - Anne Arundel, Somerset, Queen Anne's, Calvert and St. Mary's - provided matching funds for the $125,000 federal Economic Development Administration grant to complete the study.The focus of the study is not on transportation.\"This is about a tourism experience,\" Piro-nis said.During the panel discussion, she talked about \"destination management,\" providing people with things to do at places the ferry docks.\"People want more to do\" she said.\"We are not experts in ferries, Pironis said, adding that tourism is driving this study.Another expert on the panel was Heath Gehrke, director of operations for the Cape May ferry. He echoed Pironis.\"It's not just about transportation,\" he said. \"It's about experiences. It's about tourism.\"He pointed to a third of the riders who ride the Cape May ferry for the experience with many of them buying a round-trip ticket and not getting off in Lewes, Delaware.Pironis' colleague on the panel, Clint Sterling, is director of Somerset County Recreation, Parks and Tourism. He said the study is not about a single county but about the entire region.Visitors to Maryland and the Eastern Shore do not acknowledge where they are as far as a single county. They are there for experiences. That is why the counties are working together to determine if a passenger ferry is feasible.\"The visitor does not know the county lines,\" Sterling said. \"That's been one of the biggest takeaways of this study.\"He added: \"We are all stronger together. A rising tide will lift all boats and ferries.\"There are more counties that have expressed interest in the possibilities of a passenger ferry, including Talbot and Dorchester counties.Pironis said the study is exploring the question: Will this be feasible?\"This (study) is either the first step of the last step or the first step of many steps.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some days, it's bulging; other days, not so much. But every day, your messages of support, love and occasionally a great tip charge my batteries and confirm how much we need one another. Enjoy the following tips from your fellow readers.I make my own frozen coffee drinks, better than the ones that cost so much money. It all starts with frozen coffee cubes, which I make from the flavored coffee of my choice and freeze in ice cube trays. That's the secret. Most recipes call for adding things to cold coffee and then blending with ice. But the ice can water it down. Starting with frozen coffee means there's no need for ice to make it cold. My favorite recipe is frozen coffee cubes, hazelnut or caramel syrup, chocolate milk or powder, light cream or milk, and a little sugar (I like mine sweet). Blend until smooth. Yummy. I keep a zip-type bag full of coffee cubes in my freezer. - LoriSince it's not recommended to put your home address in your GPS, because in the event your car is stolen, you've just offered them your house as well, I've set my \"home\" address as my local police station. I figure if a thief is dumb enough to think they can steal a car, they'll be dumb enough to pull into the police station. If my car is ever stolen, I'll tell the police to monitor their parking lot. While I don't know if it would actually work, I'd have the story of stories if it did. And, by the way, I do know the way home from the police station. - TimFor those buying their wine in a box, when you think it's empty, take the \"bladder\" out, and you will find at least one more glass of wine inside. - MargaretMary Hunt is thefounder ofEverydayCheapskate.com, afrugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living. \"COPYRIGHT 2023CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The two stories, \"Lillian Vernon, Kitchen Table Millionaire\" and \"Byron Lewis, Ad King Extraordinaire,\" will be featured in the exhibition's Consumer Era (1940s-1970s) section.The exhibit will feature selected objects from across both entrepreneurs' career trajectories, including Vernon's original yellow Formica kitchen table and Lewis' antique French provincial desk and chair. Her kitchen table served as a foundation for Vernon's home business-turned-major corporation, The Lillian Vernon Corp., and Lewis ran his pioneering ad agency, UniWorld Group, from behind this desk.\"Innovations in broadcasting, advertising, postwar consumerism and an increased number ofwomen and African Americans in the business world really begins between the 1960s and 1970s,\" said Anthea M. Hartig, the museum's Elizabeth MacMillan Director. \"It is in this 'consumer era' that we see entrepreneurs such as Lewis' and Vernon use their persistence, creativity and drive to launch and see their enterprises thrive.\"As a young, married woman in 1951, Vernon began selling monogrammed accessories from her kitchen table to earn additional income for her family. Starting with a handbag that was manufactured by her father and advertised in Seventeen magazine, Vernon sold her products using niche marketing and direct-mail catalogs.These innovations helped her home business flourish, eventually expanding into a major corporation by the 1990s. Graphics of those early ad campaigns, along with an early example of the monogramed purse from 1951, will be on view. The Lillian Vernon Corp. became the first wom-en-founded business to be publicly traded on an American stock exchange.Lewis founded UniWorld group in 1969, inspired by his time working in the multicultural neighborhoods ofNew York City. As the CEO ofUniWorld, Lewis advanced the interests of Black consumers and promoted the work of Black artists, filmmakers, activists and politicians. Among his many projects, Lewis promoted the 1971 movie \"Shaft,\" co-directed the National Black Political Convention and UniWorld was the first Black-owned agency to land a general consumer campaign with \"3 Musketeers\" candy.In recognition of author Alexandre Dumas' French and African ancestry, he cast a Black actor as one of the three musketeers. Three swords used in that campaign will be on view along with a number of awards, including one recognizing Lewis' induction into the Advertising Hall of Fame by the American Advertising Federation in 2013.\"American Enterprise\" chronicles the tumultuous interaction of capitalism and democracy that resulted in the continuous remaking of American business-and American life. Visitors are immersed in the dramatic arc of labor, power, wealth, success and failure in an 8,000-square-foot gallery.To mark the opening of the exhibit on Oct. 17, the museum presented a panel discussion titled \"Women's Business: From Kitchen Table to C-Suite,\" focusing on how women of color are changing the ways Americans do business, moderated by MSNBC news anchor Symone D. Sanders-Townsend.The exhibition was made possible by significant support from Mars Inc., the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation and SC Johnson. Generous support came from Intel, Monsanto Co., the United Soybean Board and History Channel, with additional support by Motorola Foundation, 3M, Pete and Linda Claussen, the William T. Kemper Foundation and John Deere.Through incomparable collections, rigorous research and dynamic public outreach, the National Museum of American History seeks to empower people to create a more just and compassionate future by examining, preserving and sharing the complexity of the past.The museum, located on Constitution Avenue N.W., between 12th and 14th streets, is open daily except Dec. 25, between 10 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Admission is free.

Did I get scammed?- EarlDearEarl: I don't know if I'd call it getting scammed, but you've definitely experienced the old bait and switch.They drew you in with promises of a low-interest rate, got you to apply, and when they decided you didn't qualify for the better deal, they made the switch.These days, only people with good to excellent credit scores - typically above 740 - will get those low advertised rates. If you have a lower score, your application will be rejected, or you'll be offered a card with a higher interest rate.EXTENDED WARRANTIES FAVOR RETAILERSDear Mary: My son works for a large home improvement store. He said that because planned obsolescence is even worse than 20 years ago, buying extended warranties on products is now important. I have always disagreed, thinking they are a rip-off, preying on customer fears.My son purchased two warranties within the last five years on two major brand appliances and had to use both. Do you think he's right? Should we consider buying extended warranties? - LynnDear Lynn: It's a matter of dollars and sense, no pun intended.I cannot say that an extended warranty is a bad deal in every situation. But we have to deal with the law of averages.Never forget this: Sales commissions on extended warranties are quite handsome. Why do you think that is? It's because extended warranties are a huge profit maker for retailers. They give salespeople a big incentive (commission) to sell them.Got a question? You can send it to: DearMary@everydaycheapskate.com. Then keep your eyes open. You just might get an answer in an upcoming column. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Third quarter stats point to strong Mid-Shore housing market\n\n October 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Debbie Leber; Mid Shore Board Of Realtors | Page: 11 | Section: News \n \n 738\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - The fall weather may be cooling, but the fall housing market on the Eastern Shore is still looking sunny and bright.For the five counties of Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot, 655 homes sold in the third quarter of 2023, and these homes sold in 45 days or less.The average sold price went up in four of the five counties, and the homes sold within 95% of their original list price. This is all good news, according to Mid-Shore Board of Realtors President Megan Rosendale.I am, however, hearing from homeowners with low mortgage rates, that there is not much incentive for them to sell.Many current homes on the market are from homeowners who need to move, and this is not creating enough availability to meet the demand, said Rosendale.By working with a Mid-Shore Realtor, Rosendale said, the Realtor can help you negotiate the terms of the buyer's contract and may even be able to assist with financing programs to help with down payment and closing costs.A positive indicator for sellers is the list price compared to the sold price.This means that homes are selling for 97% or better than the asking price on average, which is great news for those looking to maximize their profits.Nationally, the median sales price of a home is $394,300. This is a 2.8% increase over 2022.Across the nation, we are seeing pending home sales decline by 7.1%, mostly due to the current interest rates, which are around eight %, said Rosendale. Once the rates start to drop, we expect to see more homes coming on the market and more buyers qualified to buy.For the five counties of the Mid-Shore, here is the third quarter 2023 average home prices: Caroline County's average home price was $344,382, a 21.44% increase compared to the third quarter of 2022.Dorchester County's average home price was $305,886, a 14% increase compared to the third quarter of 2022.Kent County's average home price for the third quarter of 2023 was $356,022, an 8.39% decrease over 2023.Queen Anne's County's average home price was $609,101, a 19.32% increase from the third quarter 2022.Talbot County's average home price was $746,949, an 8.95% increase compared to 2023.The overall number of homes sold in all the five counties declined during the third quarter of 2023. A total of 655 homes were sold in the third quarter, a decrease of eight %.In Caroline County, 93 homes sold in the third quarter of 2023.This is 31 fewer homes compared to the third quarter of 2022.Dorchester County had 145 homes sold during this third quarter.This is 14 fewer homes than this time last year.Kent County sold 81 homes.This is 17 fewer sold homes than during the third quarter of 2022.Queen Anne's County had 193 homes sold. This is 47 fewer sold homes.In Talbot County, 143 homes were sold in the third quarter of 2023. This is 28 fewer homes than this same time in 2022.There is only a week or less difference in the number of days it took to sell a home this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2022.Homes in Caroline County sold on average in 35 days, only four days longer than the third quarter of 2022.Dorchester County homes took four days longer to sell, or 45 days, compared to third quarter 2022.Kent County took 29 days on average to sell, seven days longer than the third quarter of 2022.Queen Anne's County homes sold in 31 days, only five days longer than this same time in 2022.Talbot County homes sold on average in 32 days, the same as they did during the third quarter of 2022.The third quarter statistics show the strong demand for homes on the Eastern Shore, said Rosendale. Home prices overall continue to increase, and for those who price a home competitively, it sells on average in 34 days.Buyers still need to act quickly, and your Mid-Shore Realtor can help you make a strong offer. It's important to remember, according to Rosendale, that once mortgage rates start to decline, there will be more competition on the already limited number of available homes for sale.The Mid-Shore Board of REALTORS ® mission is to advocate for its members and the public to preserve the right to own, transfer and utilize real property.

You're about to learn that when it comes to selling a house, you can judge a book by its cover. Some call it curb appeal. I call it the little things that get potential buyers through the front door, and that's what matters most.If you have a limited budget - and these days, who doesn't? - here are home improvements to help you sell your house for the highest price.Refresh the landscape. Spread new mulch in flower beds and around the base of trees. Lay down new sod; swap out failing bushes with fresh ones. Introduce color, either in the flower beds or with potted flowers. Even a small touch can make such a big difference.Spruce up the entrance. Invest in a new front door or give the current one a fresh coat of paint. Make sure the porch is immaculately clean. If your house number and mailbox appear worn, consider replacing them.Swap your light fixtures and plumbing fixtures. If yours are no longer in style, change them out. Let your local home improvement store be your guide for what is most popular now. Updating old ceiling lights and bathroom faucets can give your home a modern look without breaking the bank.Clarify space to clear up confusion. Make sure to fix any areas that might leave potential buyers puzzled. If you have an unusual alcove, consider adding a desk or a dresser to show how the space can be utilized most effectively. Many homes have quirks or issues that can be fixed visually, so don't leave potential buyers wondering.It goes without saying, but let me say it anyway: You won't get a second chance to make a first impression!Mary Hunt is the founder ofEverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living. \" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I pulled out a couple to share with you today.Dear Mary: Is it ever OK to have debt? How much debt can I afford? - Deanna Dear Deanna: Sure, it is OK, under the right reasonable and safe conditions. After all, not many of us could be homeowners or purchase a car without a mortgage or financing of some kind. These days, it's difficult to finish a college education without incurring some amount of student debt. But there needs to be self-imposed limits and boundaries.Mortgage debt: Your monthly mortgage payment - including principal, interest, real estate taxes, and homeowners insurance - should not exceed 30% of your gross monthly income (before taxes).Student debt: A good rule to follow is that your total student debt should not exceed the first year's income in your chosen field of study.Auto debt: Your loan should be for no more than 36 months.With this kind of aggressive pay-back structure, you can be pretty sure your car won't go upside down where it's suddenly worth less than your outstanding debt.Credit card debt: It is never OK to have credit card debt.It's just too expensive. If you are charging more than you can reasonably repay in that same month, you are overspending.Your total monthly debt obligation should not be more than 36% of your gross income. This is known as your debt-to-income ratio.I hope this helps as you determine if debt has a place in your financial life, and if so, how to handle it responsibly so it makes your life better, not worse.Got a question for Mary?You can send it to Dear-Mary@everydaycheapskate.com. Selected questions will be answered in future columns.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Project to put homes on long-time vacant property\n\n November 3, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 568\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - For years, 807 N. Washington St. was a vacant property. Now, a local investor has plans to build 10 homes on the parcel.Beth Spurry, who works for the investor that has started the Sandy Lane project, said it all started about three years ago.\"We were looking for an in-town development opportunity to build houses for normal people, so to speak,\" Spurry said. \"It's sort of a passion of my client.\" The 10 homes will be around 2,000 square feet each. They will all have garages as well as primary bedrooms on the first floor.Spurry said they will be energy-efficient homes.\"We're really hoping to create an economical, high-quality, custom-built product for that buyer,\" she said.The houses will be priced somewhere in the $400,000s, Spurry said. However, that number could fluctuate based on raw material costs.Before the project, Spurry said there was a unsalvageable vacant house on the property, as well as a garage that was falling down.\"I'm 52 years old,\" she said.\"I can't remember there ever being a person living in that house.\" One benefit of this being an infill development project is that it will bring up surrounding property values \"because what was there before was a blight and wasn't even safe,\" she said.This is not the only infill development project in Easton right now. Joseph Mayer, the plan reviewer in the Town of Easton's Planning and Zoning Department, said there are a few smaller lots in town that developers are \"trying to make meaningful\" for the community.One infill project to build a duplex on North Street will compliment the community, he said.\"It's not too big,\" he said.\"It's on par for what's already out there.\" Mayer said he is looking forward to seeing the Sandy Lane project when it is complete.\"They really put a lot of effort into their architecture and how to make use of the land,\" he said.Spurry said she thinks everyone is excited for the project.\"It's really positive for the town,\" she said. \"It's housing we need. It's good land use.\" Spurry added that the developers have \"followed all the rules\" and listened to the community. She said they have included green space and are protecting a small piece of wetlands at the back of the property.For more than a year, the developers have been doing all of the site work to prepare the land before the homes can be constructed. Now that they have put in a road, Spurry said it is possible to have the first building permit approved.\"We'll be waiting for that with bated breath for the first house to go in,\" she said. \"Which will be the one that's closest to Washington Street.\" Spurry said the city has given the developers a \"preliminary thumbs up\" but couldn't give them a building permit until that blacktop went in.\"Now that that's done, we shouldn't have any hurdles to that first permit being released,\" she said.Even though no houses have been built yet, Spurry said they have already had lots of interest from prospective buyers.\"I think it's the kind of housing stock that is really missing in the town of Easton,\" she said about the project. \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVA TO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nA view of the Sandy Lane project from Washington Street in Easton on Nov. 1\n \nMAGGIE TROVA TO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTen homes, around 2,000 square feet each, are planned to be built off Washington Street in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And believe me when I tell you that the only way to deal with this monster known as Groupon is to unsubscribe.Do you have a question for me?

You pay a small fortune to get it and keep it.Then, if you have the blatant audacity to actually file a claim, the company either increases your premiums or cancels you altogether.OK, that may be a bit extreme, but you get my point.While the world of insurance can at times be so confusing as to be maddening, going without basic automobile coverage is simply not an option. The financial risk is just too great. But there are some things you can do to make sure you don't stand out to the company as an intolerable risk.You should file an auto insurance claim if: There are injuries, even minor ones. It's crucial to report the incident to your insurer to ensure your coverage applies, preventing unexpected bills and safeguarding you from potential lawsuits by injured drivers.Another driver is involved.Contact your insurance company whenever you're in a crash with another driver, especially when fault isn't clear. Reporting the incident to your insurer helps make sure the blame is assigned fairly and shields you from excessive liability.There is damage to vehicles or property. Insurance is there to help you with costs when things get damaged, so you don't have to pay a big lump sum. That's why you pay monthly premiums.You shouldn't file an auto insurance claim if: You are the only person involved. If the incident is your fault and does not involve injuries, not telling your insurance company will help protect your premium.There is only a small amount of damage. Even if you have collision coverage in your car insurance, you might decide not to file a claim if your car has only minor damage.Mary invites you to visit her at EverydayCheapskate.com, where this column is archived complete with links and resources for all recommended products and services.Mary invites questions and comments at https://www.everydaycheapskate.com/contact/, \"Ask Mary.\" CO PYR IGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A gift card, of course.At this point, I will resist the urge to list all the reasons that gift cards are not really gifts, why they are so problematic for both the giver and the recipient, or ask if you're going to give money, why not just give the money?The truth is, consumers racked up more than $162 billion in gift card sales in 2022. I can't stop the insanity, but I can shed a little light on how these things work and how to avoid the pitfalls.Understand that no gift card is the same as cash. It's not. It's the same as store credit. That's what you are giving as a gift. The store gets to write the rules for how it will handle your recipient and its store credit. And should that store fall into financial trouble, that gift card will become instantly worthless even if it has no expiration date.Unused gift cards represent free money for stores.Consumer Reports has estimated that a quarter of all gift cards go unredeemed for a year after purchase, and about 7% never get used at all. Bankrate reports 47% of U.S. adults have at least one unused gift card. It all adds up to an estimated $8 billion windfall annually for the retail industry.If you have a gift card you just know you aren't going to use, sites like Raise, Gift Card Granny and Card Cash may take it and give you cash back, credit your PayPal account or give you an Amazon gift card a percentage of the original gift card's value.I can no longer resist the urge to ask: If you're going to give money this holiday season, why not just give the money? Your recipient will get every single penny of that $20 bill to spend wherever he or she desires.Chances of that money getting lost or forgotten are slim-to-none, and you won't be feeding that completely out of control retail monster known as the Gift Card Retail Industry.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I just love to wade through reader mail and clever money - and time-saving tips sent in by my dear readers.Enjoy this small sampling.I wash my children's stuffed animals in the dishwasher. I run it on a normal cycle, soap and all (although I use much less soap) and then run an extra rinse cycle. I hang the little critters out to dry on the line after they have gone through the heat cycle, as they are still wet. I've only placed these precious toys on the top rack and you need to make sure their eyes and any pieces are well attached, as they can come off during their bath. - Pam I got this great household tip from a plumber, who happens to be my husband.Dump baking soda down the drain (this can be done with a clogged drain or to prevent the clog) and then follow with apple cider vinegar.This will loosen and eat away any gunk clogging the drains.Allow to sit overnight, then flush the drain with hot water. This is cheaper than drain cleaner and will not harm pipes or septic systems. It's also safer to have around the house with children and animals. - Whitney Put a fresh head of garlic in a plastic sandwich bag and freeze. When you need garlic, just pull off the number of cloves you need and leave the rest of it in the freezer. Let the cloves sit on the counter until thawed enough to chop or press. I've stored garlic this way for years. It really does turn out just like fresh and certainly beats the alreadychopped garlic you buy in a jar. - Jean Would you like to submit a frugal, thrifty tip?

Maybe you've thought this from time to time: \"Family - can't live with 'em, and can't live without 'em!\" The same thing could be said about credit cards in these very strange times in which we live. Many people can't live with them but can't live without them, either.The relationship I have with my credit card is appreciation on the one extreme and hatred on the other. I have an \"appreci-hate\" relationship with it.Yes, I said hate. It is a strong word.The credit card relationship is a funny thing.When you maintain a $0 balance at the end of every month so that you have no credit card debt, you have a very useful financial tool that you are free to appreciate.Your $0 balance credit card works hard to keep your credit score high. That financial tool makes it possible for you to purchase an airline ticket, rent a car, buy things you need online - all without paying a nickel's worth of interest. You get a 25-day grace period when you keep your balance at $0.You own it. You're the boss of it. It works for you, and you win.But if it's the other way around, and you've racked up revolving debt that rolls from month to month accruing more and more interest, sorry, my friend.That credit card owns you. You are its slave. Yes, another strong word. So be it. That's exactly the relationship.That credit card debt beats you up to keep you down.

We were having dinner with friends when the subject of the \"company store\" came up. I knew I'd heard that phrase somewhere.\"You haul sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt. Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go - I owe my soul to the company store.\" What was this company store and, more importantly, why did this guy owe his soul to it? Must be serious if his debt could forestall his death.As I've always said, if you need an answer, find a teacher.Welcome Richard Joyce, history teacher at Wilmington High School in Wilmington, Illinois, from whom I learned: Soon after the discovery of extensive coal fields in the 1860s, large corporations bought huge tracts of land, mines were sunk and \"boom towns\" exploded in size as miners flocked from eastern states and Europe. Life was horribly difficult for the miners and their families.The most common complaint of the miners concerned their pay and the total control that the companies had over their financial well-being.Companies sometimes paid in \"scrip,\" which was taken in trade only at the company store. At times, men who refused to buy from the company store were dismissed.Well, that certainly explains things. It's not only a song; it's a history lesson.Makes me thankful to be living in 2023 and not 1898.These days, stores care about their customers more than their bottom line.You know, it's good to take time for reflection now and then, to make sure we've learned from the mistakes of the past.

For tipped employees, the rate is $3.63.At $13.25 an hour for a 40-hour week, 52 weeks a year (with no time off for vacation), you would only earn $27,560. This would be difficult for one person to live on, much less a family.This is why families turn to SNAP (aka food stamps) or come through our food pantries.Each of us working at the food pantries or delivering Meals on Wheels have gotten to know the people who come to us for food, proud people who too often have to skip a meal every day to keep the lights on.We have come to know the people who use our food pantries, and we know it only takes one of life's hiccups to turn that life upside down, which is why you will find the volunteers at the food pantries are so dedicated and have made being at the food pantry a commitment.There are volunteers and then there are volunteers. People who are on the frontline combating hunger are a very special breed and deserve the thanks and continued support of the community.This Thanksgiving, we are most thankful to the farmers, the grocery stores, the Maryland Food Bank, and the generosity of the Talbot community for making it possible for 5,000 of our neighbors to sit down to a Thanksgiving feast this year, complete with all the trimmings.And we in the Talbot County Hunger Coalition are most thankful that once again we are there to make it happen.These are the Talbot County food pantries: Corner of Care, Chesapeake College; Harvest of Hope, Easton Church of God; Neighborhood Service Center; Royal Oak United Methodist Church; Scott's United Methodist Church, Trappe; St. Mark's Pantry at Brookletts Senior Center; St. Michaels Community Center; St. Vincent de Paul; and the Tilghman Food Pantry.Catherine Poe is the Chair of the Talbot County Hunger Coalition. \n \n Caption: COURTESY OF STEVE WALTRICH\n \nThe team that made the Thanksgiving meals possible, from left: Tom Barwick, Scott Clausen, Mike Lancaster, Catherine Poe, Patty Lancaster, Tabby Evans, and Gary Yeatman.

I use only a debit card. But still, there are times I feel out of control.How can I get some control over my spending?- Rob K., Nebraska Dear Rob: Merchant research groups have proven it over and again: Customers who shop with plastic spend about 30% more than those paying with cash. I believe that's because credit and debit cards (even checks) are stand-ins for our money. They're not the real thing, but more like \"play money.\" I know for myself that swiping a card or writing a check for, say, a $50 purchase doesn't require the same kind of mental consideration as paying with cash. It's painful to part with cash.I suggest you put yourself on a cash-only diet for the next 30 days. Don't even carry a checkbook or plastic - debit or credit.Except for payments you must send through the mail, force yourself to pay with cash. You bet it's inconvenient, and you must plan ahead for how much cash you'll need for the day. Keep a written record of how you spend every penny, too.While making the switch to cash will be quite an adjustment in the beginning, I predict your mindless spending will disappear.Mary invites you to visit her at EverydayCheapskate.com, where this column is archived complete with links and resources for all recommended products and services.

    "content": "What's on the List? Games and Toys for 2023\n\n November 23, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Amy Pollick; Wealth Of Geeks | Page: 5 | Section: News \n \n 927\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Sears & Roebuck Wish Book may have gone the way of the dodo bird, but children still make Christmas lists with games and toys at the top. According to a Research and Markets study, the worldwide games and toys market is worth $342 billion.The study reports the games and toys market is driven by an emerging middle class in populated areas and the continued growth of legacy brands, among other factors.TOP OF THE WISH LISTSIf kids still want toys, what items are most popular?Statista reports the U.S. toy market is seeing a resurgence in traditional toys, like dolls, board games, puzzles, and construction sets.The Barbie movie topped $1 billion at the box office, so it follows that Mattel's flagship toy is popular this year. Emma Stessman and Bella Druckman with The TODAY Show interviewed Laurie Schacht, Chief Toy Officer at The Toy Insider.She shared that Barbie: The Movie Collectible Doll, Barbie: The Movie Ken Doll, the Barbie Dreamhouse 2023, Barbie Fashionistas Doll, and the remote-control Hot Wheels Barbie Corvette are some of the most popular toys of 2023.Arts and crafts toys are making a comeback, too, according to Schacht. The Make it Real Mini Pottery Studio and Cra-Z-Art The Real Cotton Candy Maker are also a hit with youngsters this year.Other retailers have released their most popular toys for 2023. Kohl's department store list includes the L.O.L. Surprise Magic Flyers and the Melissa & Doug Stack, Sort & Pound Wooden Toy Collection.The list at Macy's includes a revamped Tamagotchi Uni.Sesame Street's Elmo is still popular and appears as the Elmo Slide Plush.Amazon reports the Clue Conspiracy Board Game is a popular choice, while Walmart offers the Nerf Elite Junior Flyer.STEM/STEAM toys are popular, too, including the Educational Insights Geo-Safari Jr. Kidnoculars and the Melissa & Doug Super Smile Dentist Kit.TOYS PARENTS LIKENo matter what toys the kiddos want, mom and dad have the final say on what goes under the tree or in a birthday gift.Monica Fish, founder of Planner At Heart, says, \"Despite my kids' 5-year age difference, they both have LEGOs on their holiday wish list. It is a toy that encourages creative, imaginative play, problem solving, and introduces engineering concepts. But they just think it's an exciting gift from their favorite Disney or video game franchises. Even though LEGOs tend to be a high-priced item, it's one that always makes it under the tree.\" For youngsters whose preferences are a little harder to nail down, parents have to watch what the kids are playing with for a better idea of what to buy.Sarah Gilliand is a travel editor and mom of three kids who owns the On The Road With Sarah travel blog.She's on board with being an observant parent where holiday gifts are concerned.\"The 4-year-old always wants everything he sees: in stores, on TV, you name it,\" she says. \"We usually can't ask him what he wants because it's always a huge list, but we know what he plays with the most. He loves building things, and he recently received a marble run set for his birthday, so we will probably get him more attachments for that. He also loves LEGO blocks and magnetic tiles for building.\" \"Pretend play has also ramped up for him,\" she continues, \"and he enjoys being a chef or a doctor, so we will mostly likely add to his accessories for those costumes. Dinosaurs and MatchBox cars are also always welcome. We love the brands Melissa & Doug, VTech, and LEGO.\" Sometimes, gifts for youngsters are an easy pick.Gilliland explains, \"My tweens want gift cards, money, or accessories for their phones.\" Parents also have opinions on gifts they're not sure about.JayDee Vykoukal, owner of Mom Blog Life, expressed her concerns. \"My 5-yearold has two consistent requests this year so far. A tablet, because her other friends have one, and a Llama squishmallow. The squishmallow is an easy win,\" she explains, \"but I'm hesitant to get my child an electronic [device] at such a young age. I've been looking into kid-friendly tablets with educational apps, parental control, and time limits.We'll see as it gets closer to Christmas.\"WHAT THE EXPERTS LIKEChild development experts have their own thoughts about toys and games for children.The editors at New York Magazine's The Strategist spoke with Dr. Roberta Golinkoff, a professor of child psychology at the University of Delaware. She said, \"The best toys allow growing kids to engage in imaginative play, practice communication, and develop fine motor skills.\" Experts on the Early Learning Centre website recommend toys that stimulate children's touch and motor skills, particularly for toddlers. Older children like toys that allow them to practice their communication skills, like toy phones that also encourage their auditory skills.Kids love physical activity toys, too, and child development experts recommend them to encourage children to move and exercise. Bubble machines and mini ball pits are popular toys to help get kids moving.Experts also recommend kids use crayons, finger paints, modeling clay, and other art supplies to express their creativity and to develop fine motor skills and color recognition.This article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n \n Caption: AP PHOTO/RICHARD DREW\n \nDog-E, by Mastermind Toys, whose lighted wagging tail shows hearts, is displayed at the 2023 Toy Fair, in New York's Javits Center, Monday, Oct. 2, 2023.\n \nAP PHOTO/SKYROCKET/JASON DECROW\n \nUsing special bone conducting sound technology, Magic Whispers Kitty interactive plush tells Instagram influencer EAExtremeFun secrets that no one else can hear at Toy Fair, Saturday, Sept 30, 2023 in New York. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Shop Local - Merchants Aim To Bring Great Experiences To Customers This Saturday And Every Day\n\n November 24, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; Mtrovato@Chespub. Com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1078\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - For some, shopping is all about the experience of walking into a store to sniff a candle, touch the sleeve of a soft, cashmere sweater or even sample an infused cocktail.On Small Business Saturday - and everyday - local businesses in Easton are making sure that each of their customers has the particular experience that makes getting out of the house to go shopping, rather than doing it from the convenience of your couch, worth it.Mark Greene, owner of the clothing store Sailor in Downtown Easton, describes why it's so great to shop local with a simple phrase: \"It always fits better in a small box.\"\"In other words, we're not a big box store,\" he said. \"So there's always better product and better stuff and more one-on-one in a small box (store).\"Not only do you get that one-on-one time with a store owner or employee, but you get the opportunity to do business with those that keep money in the community, Greene said.Joan Hoge-North owns The Mercantile, a boutique next door to Sailor that has been open for about 18 months.Hoge-North said she gives what she can when she is approached by different organizations for things like silent auctions.One thing she's been doing since she opened is putting a quarter aside every time someone declines a shopping bag for the items they have purchased.\"For every bag not used, I donate a quarter to conservation on the Shore,\" she said. \"Last year it was the equivalent of about 560 bags, and I made a gift to Eastern Shore Land Conservancy.\"This year, Hoge-North said they are up to more than 600 bags not used.Those 600 plus quarters will be donated to ShoreRivers, she said.Saturday, Nov. 25, the Saturday after Black Friday, is Small Business Saturday - a day to celebrate and support small businesses during the busiest shopping season of the year.Small Business Saturday was founded by American Express in 2010 and has been officially cosponsored by the U.S. Small Business Administration since 2011. Reported projected spending among U.S. consumers who shopped at independent retailers and restaurants on Small Business Saturday reached an estimated $17.9 billion, according to the 2022 Small Business Saturday Consumer Insights Survey commissioned by American Express.Deena Kilmon, director of strategic initiatives at Easton Economic Development, said small shop owners are \"the heartbeat of Easton.\"\"They create its personality, they open their doors to our visitors and locals with a smile, they support our non-profits with their many donations and they are crucial players in all of the amazing events we have downtown that are free to the community,\" she said.Darcy Bernot, the owner of Lizzy Dee, which is also located in downtown Easton, said that buying local is worthwhile because the gifts are often more thoughtful and unique.\"We mostly buy from what are called made-to-order companies,\" Bernot said.\"That means that they only make what I and other store owners order. So you're not going to see these things coast to coast, all over the place.\"Kilmon said that three-quarters of every dollar spent locally stays in the local economy.\"Those dollars are crucial to maintaining a healthy downtown,\" she said.Until opening The Mercantile, Hoge-North spent her career in the nonprofit sector.\"This is something completely different,\" she said.\"But the nonprofit - giving back - is just a part of who I am, who the store is.\"Supporting other small makers, women-owned businesses and socially-and environmentally-conscious brands is something Hoge-North makes an effort to do in her store.\"A lot of things in here have a story that comes with them,\" she said. \"People like giving that too, and knowing that through their purchase, they're giving back and helping someone else.\"Some of the best holiday gifts in The Mercantile, Hoge-North said, are dish towels that show off local pride and cocktail infusers - tall, glass jars of dried items like orange slices and rosemary that you can add the liquor of your choice to.\"Like, this one says tequila is best,\" Hoge-North says, pointing to a jar. \"You let it sit for three days, you strain it out, you make an awesome margarita.\"This weekend, The Mercantile will be offering samples of the three different infusers in the shop.Along with the opportunity to take a sip of a cocktail (or three), Hoge-North said The Mercantile will be offering a few sales beginning Friday and ending Sunday. There will be discounts on all jackets and tops, a buy-oneget-one-half-off deal on jeans and select boots will be on sale.Starting next Tuesday, The Mercantile will be open seven days a week for the holiday season.\"To make it easier for everybody,\" Hoge-North said.Sailor has also extended its hours for the holiday season.Greene said it will be open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday through Saturday and from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sundays.For those looking to gift their loved ones with name brand items like like Patagonia, Vineyard Vines and Lilly Pulitzer, Sailor is the place to go.Open from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, Lizzy Dee will have gift guides posted around the boutique.The guides will have different groupings of merchandise on them based on personality and style to make gift giving a piece of cake this year.Hoge-North said shopping downtown keeps Easton thriving.\"It's one of the reasons people love living on the Shore is that we have a really vibrant downtown,\" she said. \"People shop for an experience. They come downtown to hear the stories, to see the different things, to be a part of all that's going on, and there's a lot going on this weekend.\"Those interested in learning more about Small Business Saturday and the different merchants in Easton can visit DiscoverEaston.com. \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nJoan Hoge-North, owner of The Mercantile, holds up a stuffed panda - the perfect holiday gift for a child - at her shop on Harrison Street in Easton on Nov. 20.\n \nMAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nBracelets hang from a mini Christmas tree at The Mercantile on Harrison Street in Easton Nov. 20.\n \nMAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nHats and gloves for sale at Lizzy Dee in Downtown Easton on Nov. 20.\n \nMA GGIE TROVA TO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nKerry Condon works at Lizzy Dee on Harrison Street in Easton Nov. 20.\n \nMAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nCocktail infusers - tall, glass jars of dried items like orange slices and rosemary that you can add the liquor of your choice to - at The Mercantile in Downtown Easton are one holiday gift option this year.\n \nMAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTies for sale at Sailor in Downtown Easton on Nov. 20. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I hope the following encouraging tips from your fellow readers on how to be a frugal rockstar will inspire all of us to pay attention and embrace ways we can immediately begin to see more money left in our wallets.Over the past six months, I've been on a tear to declutter and get organized. It has made a huge impact on my spending.Basically, I've stopped spending money on stuff I have already but just didn't know where to find it. The key is knowing what you have and finding it when needed. If you can't find your stuff easily, you might buy something you already have or, even worse, believe you got rid of it, buy a replacement, and then find the original shortly after. - Millie, New Jersey We have a new weekly menu item at our house - Everything But the Kitchen Sink Soup. Basically, this is just throwing a bunch of whateveris-in-the-fridge to make a soup in order to get rid of stuff that's about to go bad or otherwise needs to be used up.

    "content": "Find ways to cut all prices by up to half\n\n November 28, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mary Hunt | Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 337\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It's a benchmark, a goal, a mindset - a kind of game I play with myself. Whatever the price tag - real or perceived - I challenge myself to find a way to get it down to \"half the price.\" Here's an example.Harold and I make a business trip to California about every month, to take care of a business we have there and to stay connected with friends and family. We've done this so often, by now, I know about how much those plane tickets will be. And every month I take the challenge to cut the cost in half.Sometimes I make it; other times, I must concede to something far less than half the price. But now and then I hit it just right, and it feels like I won the jackpot.Not long ago, by agreeing to take a later flight, applying a special discount code, not checking any bags and not being picky about our seats, we flew for less than $100 each, round trip. These days, that's nearly unheard of.Then there are the times that I get the price of something down to nothing by deciding not to buy at all - doing without or deciding to wait. It amazes me just how often, if I'm just willing to wait a day or two, that \"urgent need\" kind of fades away.Living your life for half the price is not easy. It takes skill and determination to go against the tide and buck a system that says it's OK to spend all we have now, plus what we hope we'll get in the future. It takes the strength of character to protest against the message that it's OK to have what you want now and pay for it later.Here's the principle, the thing I hope you will take away from this: It's the money you don't spend that gives you the freedom to live the life you love.Think about it, embrace it, live it. I promise it can change your life.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Investors consider climate change before buying homes\n\n December 1, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 13 | Section: News \n \n 908\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A recent Forbes survey reveals nearly a third of Americans cited climate change as a reason to move last year.For aspiring homeowners, climate has transitioned from a selling point to a critical risk factor.Prospective home buyers must educate themselves on the tangible impacts of climate change to safeguard their property investments from potential catastrophic events.When sizing up a property, environmental considerations used to be a matter of taste. Does the buyer prefer warm, sunny summers on the coast or the snug, cool, white winters of the northern interior? Now, aspiring homeowners must consider how climate change will affect their property over the long run and what costs they may incur as a result.\"As awareness of risk grows, the financial value of risky places drops,\" says climate futurist Alex Steffen. The rising costs of climate change will make some properties indefensible.\"[They] will be unofficially abandoned. That will then create more problems. Bonds for big projects, loans, mortgages, business investment, insurance, talented workers - all will grow more scarce then, the value will crash,\" Steffen predicts.Coining the term \" brittleness bubble,\" Steffen wants to raise awareness. These brittle properties, prone to sudden, irreparable climate-fueled failure could create unrecoverable losses for their owners. The climate crisis poses dire choices, especially for those buying a home for the first time.Yet being forewarned is being forearmed. The sooner investors and home buyers alike bone up on the ground facts of climate risk, the better they can mitigate their property portfolio against the perils of extreme weather.FEW GOOD OPTIONSAs a global phenomenon, climate change impacts human populations everywhere. No region in America is truly immune from the fallout. When disaster strikes one part of the country, everyone suffers since they depend on the supply of goods and services nationwide.However, some regions are being hit sooner and harder than others. This information can help those buying land as an investment navigate the ever-changing climate map.Data from First Street and Moody's Analytics shows that Texas, Florida, New Jersey, and California, four of the country's largest and most populous states, are all likely to face more climate change risk sooner.With its vast coastline and wetland ecosystem, Florida is most vulnerable to rising sea temperatures and exacerbated tropical storms. The state has been a favorite destination for \"snowbirds\" from the North, especially among Canadian homebuyers. Florida accounts for almost half of all Canadian property purchases in the United States.According to the 30-year forecast by Moody's, climate change events will continue to affect communities up and down the East Coast and, at some point, will impact the livability of states such as Florida and the Carolinas. In the Southwest, e.g., Arizona, record heat and fires increase weather dangers and threaten reliable water supplies.The nation's interior is also feeling the climate stress, with intense heat and unprecedented rainfalls recorded in recent years. As the weather becomes more extreme, smaller, less exposed cities such as Boise, Idaho, are poised for an influx of newcomers seeking shelter from climate catastrophe.FLOODS AND FIRESOf all the natural disasters impacting home valuations in the U.S., wildfires and flooding are among the most damaging.As more study on climate change risk is undertaken, the potential effect on the American real estate market becomes apparent. For instance, the journal Nature Climate Change recently published a study that claims property prices in flood zones are overvalued by $121 to $237 billion.\"Increasing flood risk under climate change is creating a bubble that threatens the stability of the U.S. housing market,\" said lead author Dr. Jesse Gourevitch, a postdoctoral fellow at the Environmental Defense Fund.\"These risks are largely unaccounted for in property transactions, encouraging development in flood-prone areas.Accurately pricing the costs of flooding in home values can support adaptation to flood risk, but may leave many worse off.\"Unfactored environmental risks bode poorly for low-income households. The study found this demographic may lose up to 10% of their property's market value to the risk of significant flooding.\"For many people, their most valuable asset is their home. We need policy approaches that improve the transparency of climate risk in markets while providing increased support and protection for frontline communities,\" said co-author Dr. Carolyn Kousky, Associate Vice President for Economics and Policy at the Environmental Defense Fund.INSURE YOURSELFThe rising risks will make home ownership, already out of reach for most Americans, even more unaffordable. The increasing costs of covering the damage from natural disasters are unsustainable for homeowners and insurance companies.Huge claims from natural disasters in states such as California and Florida leave companies rethinking their risk and opting out of insuring susceptible regions.State-backed insurers cover some gaps in this landscape, but the premiums only sometimes cover the bills that homeowners are forced to pay. This situation worsens as climate change continues to upend the weather patterns and wreak havoc through extreme weather events.Slowing the impact of climate change is a global effort requiring deeper coordination between governments, corporations, citizens, and the world. Unfortunately, the average American can do little to change the broader trends However, by being informed of the dangers posed by climate catastrophe, homeowners can prepare for the worst and safeguard their families' future. Real estate remains many Americans' primary investment vehicle, so contingency planning is urgent. Without it, a local extreme weather disaster could bring untold financial ruin. \n \n Caption: Threats associated with climate change, such as severe weather, are being considered by real estate investors when buying homes. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Claire Nevin-Field, Rector of Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Chestertown remembered a day in late summer where she smelled something delicious coming from the church's kitchen. \"It was volunteers of the church making jam for this (November) event,\" she said, \"That's how much work it takes for this to happen.\"The event is Emmanuel Episcopal Church's annual Christmas Bazaar, now 30 years old, with no sign of slowing down. Their Friday night preview party had 200 attendees, who got a peak at what was offered and a first chance to purchase items before the event was officially open to the public.\"All of the items you see here were donated,\" said Coordinator Linda Robbs, who has chaired the event for 12 years. \"We have a very invested parish, and a lot of volunteers.\"One volunteer, Jenny Freebery who was supervising the \"Elegant Elephant\" table of higher end items like silver and crystal, said, \"I love shopping for a cause.\"The cause is fundraising for three nonprofits, different every year. For the 2023 event, proceeds will go to Echo Hills Outdoor School in Worton that provides experiential outdoor education programs on their 240-acre campus; the Bayside Hoyas who sponsor activities for youth to help the next generation of the community achieve their full potential; and Minary's Dream Alliance that works to improve the lives of families and youth in the Mid-Shore region, particularly those families that are disadvantaged and underserved by existing institutions and organizations.Each year three other nonprofits are chosen, with a requirement that the recipients have to wait at least two years before being nominated again.Nancy Henderson supervised the knitting table, with items from scarves to mittens to ornaments, lovingly made by the ecumenical knitting club that meets weekly at the church. The kitchen volunteers were busily making homemade sandwiches and desserts for patrons and volunteers.A silent auction was also a big part of the event, with bids on everything from signed books, to boat rides, to art work, and even Saki, just flown to Maryland from Japan, again all donations from individuals and businesses.The day brought out a special visitor, the former Rector of Emmanuel, the Rev.Dr. Darcy Williams. \"It's just wonderful, I always have to come,\" said Williams. \"It's a real labor of love.\"Barbara Fisher, a friend of a church volunteer, said she drives to Chestertown every year to shop. \"I love it,\" she said. \"It makes me want to live here.\"Cashiers proclaimed it was a great day for selling toward the end of the event. Robbins said, \"It's really unique that we can raise this much money for local nonprofits.It's worth it.\" \n \n Caption: Nancy Henderson and Anne Bricker supervise the knitting table at the recent Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Chestertown. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We like to take care of our staff because they are so good.\"Almost since the restaurant opened, Veteran's Day has been recognized by providing a free meal once a year to veterans, in thanks for their service to the nation. Honoring veterans began at The Narrows Restaurant as Bo wanted to honor the memory of his youngest brother, Michael Hardesty, who gave his life serving in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War.The Hardestys are also loyal supporters of the local fire departments and have always been leaders in protecting public health.\"When our restaurant first opened, we didn't have cigarette vending machines, and we were the first restaurant to have a 'smoke free' dining area,\" Brenda said. \"That was before it became law, as smoking has not been permitted in any restaurants for many years now.\"Bo and Brenda's daughters, Kelly and Kate, now manage the restaurant. Bo comes in frequently, but the daughters are in charge, they quipped.The Narrows Restaurant has become well known for overnight mailing of different dishes of their foods all over the nation.\"During the pandemic, those overnight orders for our crab cakes and crab soups helped us stay open,\" shared Brenda.\"[And] you should see all the boxes that go out of here in December!

    "content": "Tasty Toucan shines as national Paleta Champion\n\n December 1, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 8 | Section: News \n \n 427\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE - Kent Island's Tasty Toucan emerged victorious at the North American Ice Cream Association 2023 Paleta Competition at their annual convention in Las Vegas.The North American Ice Cream Association, a dedicated trade organization committed to advancing the frozen dessert industry, annually recognizes outstanding contributions and innovation. Tasty Toucan seized the title of Paleta Champion, solidifying their place as an example of excellence in the frozen dessert industry.For those unfamiliar with the term, a Paleta is a Mexican-origin frozen treat, similar to a popsicle, that has gained popularity in the United States. Unlike traditional popsicles, paletas are crafted from fresh fruits, chocolate, or cream. The distinguishing factor lies in their use of natural ingredients and creative flavor combinations, offering a more authentic and artisanal experience.The six artisan Paleta competitors had two hours to make their best strawberry and chocolate popsicle/Paleta. Nikki Neboshynsky, owner and chief tasty officer of Tasty Toucan, Stevensville whirred and stirred her best recipes before the judges. Her final submissions were Summer Tango and 'Tis the Season.The judges analyzed every pop/paleta for taste, uniqueness, presentation and appeal to the market.The Summer Tango is a delightful blend of whole strawberries, fresh-squeezed lemon juice, twisted with layers of mango, dipped in Tajin. On the other hand, the 'Tis the Season features chocolate fudge infused with natural peppermint extract and adorned with shimmering candy cane pieces.Neboshynky's entries are a true standout, earning unanimous praise from the judges for its unique flavor profile, exceptional texture, and eye-catching presentation.\"We are thrilled to recognize Tasty Toucan and Nikki Neboshynsky as the Paleta Champion of 2023,\" stated Evan Waldt, Board member of NAICA. \"Their Paleta not only demonstrated exceptional craftsmanship but also highlighted the innovative spirit that drives our industry. It's an honor to celebrate their talents and dedication to the craft.\"Neboshynsky shared her excitement about the win, saying, \"Tasty Toucan's goal has always been to deliver sweet frozen treats with incredible flavor from natural ingredients, this competition was the perfect platform to showcase that.We are incredibly proud to have received this recognition and are excited to continue our journey of creating unique and delicious popsicles.\"To savor these award-winning paletas, head to Tasty Toucan at 400 Love Point Road in Stevensville.Additionally, you can find them at various concerts, festivals, and catering events.

    "content": "Easton Utilities proposes electric, gas rate increases\n\n December 7, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 3 | Section: News \n \n 777\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Easton Utilities is proposing increases to its electric and gas rates, citing inflation's impact on the cost of operations as a main driver for the price hike.The utility company's Monday evening presentation to the Easton Town Council marked the first time in six years Easton Utilities had come before town leaders with increases for electric and gas rates.Easton Utilities is a townowned, not-for-profit utility company operating electric, gas, water, wastewater, cable television and internet services for the Town of Easton and portions of the surrounding area.Over the last few years, the company has kept \"cost-consciousness\" in mind through keeping compensation levels below the inflation rate, assuming greater risk to dial back on some insurance coverage and changing the company's medical insurance, said Hugh Grunden, Easton Utilities' president and CEO.Easton Utilities invested over $17 million into its electric and gas infrastructure to maintain and increase reliability of services, most of which has gone toward the electric department.The roughly $15 million spent on electric improvements in the last four years includes installation of a concrete duct bank across the runway at Easton Airport, improving reliability in the northern parts of the service areas and reconductoring, or replacing wires or cables, in historic Easton.However, rising supply chain costs for transformers, overhead wires and gas meters, along with investments yielding losses for gas and electric, led to the need to increase rates in the new year to ensure reliability.Those issues have led to a \"drastic\" fall off in Easton Utilities' earnings, said Steve Ochse, the company's senior vice president and chief financial officer.To recover what's been invested, Easton Utilities proposed increasing its electric base revenue to $4.45 million.For typical residential electric customers, that means the newly proposed rates would increase monthly bills by about $24, though the actual number is likely to be lower after litigating the rates with the state's Public Service Commission, Ochse said.The company also proposed increasing its natural gas base revenue by $520,000. Typical residential gas customers would see a $7 increase in monthly bills.Revenue collected from base rates pays for operations, maintenance and infrastructure replacements for electric and gas systems in Easton, but not the energy itself.If the proposed rate increases are approved by the Town Council in mid-December, Easton Utilities will file formal rate increase requests with the state Public Service Commission late this month.From there, the PSC will likely hold a public hearing on the proposed rates next spring and make a final determination, though approval may not come until late spring or early summer 2024.At Monday's meeting, Grunden said the rate increases being recommended are \"well below\" the overall rate of inflation customers experience elsewhere in their lives, and even with the changes being proposed, customers' average bills will remain lower than those of neighboring utilities.The decline in energy costs this year, which are projected to continue into next year, would further reduce the increase to average customers' electric bills when comparing this December and December 2022, according to the company's presentation.And in a similar comparison for Easton Utilities' typical gas customers, an average total bill with the newly proposed rates would be 31 cents less per day than a December 2022 bill.Ochse said the lower energy costs make now \"perfect timing\" to do a rate increase.\"This time last year would not have been an ideal situation - we knew energy costs were high, we knew we were losing money on both departments, but we held off because we were hoping that we would see the energy costs come down and our impact on our customers would be less,\" he said.There were no public comments at the meeting on the proposed changes, though council members asked about profits from Easton Utilities' other services being used to offset costs and if the company could maintain reliability and quality of service without increases in base rates.John Horner, Easton Utilities' executive vice president and chief operating officer, emphasized the importance of implementing the base rate increases sooner rather than later.\"It's important for us to go through this process now, because waiting really much longer means that we'll have an additional third, or maybe fourth, fiscal year - in the case of the gas business - with negative net income, and it will begin to impact those three important metrics, and most importantly, could impact safety.\"Public hearings on the two pieces of legislation authorizing the revisions to electric and gas rates will remain open until the council's Dec. 18 meeting. \n \n Caption: Steve Ochse, Easton Utilities' senior vice president and chief financial officer, speaks to town leaders during an Easton Town Council meeting Monday, Dec. 4. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2023-12-08",

    "content": "Net worth of homeowners 40% higher than renters\n\n December 8, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mid Shore Board Of Realtors | Page: 11 | Section: News \n \n 514\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For some, it can be hard to decide whether to rent or to buy a home, said Shelby Roney, president of the Mid-Shore Board of Realtors.There are so many factors to consider, but a new study may help make this decision a bit easier.The Survey of Consumer Finances, conducted by the Federal Reserve Board every three years, shows valuable insights into the net worth disparity between homeowners and renters.In an informative revelation, the average net worth of a homeowner surpassed that of a renter by nearly 40 times.Homeowners in the U.S. had a median net worth of $255,000, compared to renters who had a net worth of $6,300.The surge in homeowner net worth can be largely attributed to the unprecedented rise in home prices during the so-called \"unicorn\" years for housing. The term \"unicorn,\" for real estate purposes refers to something greatly desired (unheard of record low interest rates) yet difficult or impossible to find (that perfect home in a record low inventory market).In the real estate realm, it signifies the extraordinary conditions experienced during the last few years when interest rates were 3 to 4% or lower.The scarcity of available homes for sale, coupled with a substantial influx of buyers taking advantage of historically low mortgage rates, led to an imbalance in supply and demand, propelling home prices to new heights. Consequently, homeowners who possessed a home during this period experienced substantial growth in their equity.For those still contemplating the decision to rent or buy, it may be tempting to wonder if the opportunity for significant net worth growth has passed.Despite mortgage rates around 7 to 8%, many areas of the Eastern Shore continue to see higher home prices due to persistent low supply compared to steady demand.Expert predictions suggest ongoing growth in the housing market, although at a slower pace than the record surge observed in the past two years.Roney said, \"I tell my clients who are considering buying to think of homeownership as a longterm investment, just like the stock market, with the potential for net worth growth, portfolio building and generational wealth opportunities.\" While attending the National Association of Realtors conference in Anaheim, CA in November, Roney had the opportunity to hear Jessica Lautz, deputy chief economist for NAR, speak about the real estate market.Roney said Lautz underscored the importance of weighing the total cost of homeownership against the financial benefits when deciding between renting and buying. The latest federal data showing the median net worth of homeowners at 40% higher really demonstrates the wealth gain associated with homeownership.For those grappling with the decision to rent or buy, connecting with a Mid-Shore Board of Realtors agent to discuss the options and possibility of homeownership is the first step toward the potential of a higher net. The likelihood of a substantial boost in net worth over time serves as a compelling reason to consider homeownership.The Mid-Shore Board of Realtors' mission is to advocate for its members and the public to preserve the right to own, transfer and utilize real property.For more news and information check out the website midshoreboardofrealtors.com. \n \n Caption: SHELBY RONEY \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Economic Humbug - One-Third Of Americans Are Skipping Christmas Gifts Thanks To Inflation",
    "date": "2023-12-11",

    "content": "Economic Humbug - One-Third Of Americans Are Skipping Christmas Gifts Thanks To Inflation\n\n December 11, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jon Dulin; Wealth Of Geeks Undefined | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 888\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Inflation seems to have found its way into Santa's workshop - and the elves aren't happy. A recent survey found that more than one in three Americans are skipping gift-giving this year thanks to inflation, while 50% say Santa will be less generous than in previous years.Even though it appears that consumers are handling a slowing economy, some cracks are forming. Credit card debt is rising.\nAlmost half of Americans say they won't pay off their holiday purchases by the due date.\nAdditionally, over half of people surveyed report feelings of anxiety.\nLuckily, there are steps one can take to limit the damage to their finances and the stress they experience during this time of year.\nA SNAPSHOT OF CHRISTMAS 2023 According to a Wallethub study, Christmas 2023 will see a thriftier Santa. Over one in three Americans say they will not give gifts due to inflation, and 28% say they plan to spend less on holiday shopping. Almost half say that inflation has affected their charitable giving.\nForty-eight percent of Americans said they planned to start their holiday shopping earlier in hopes of smaller monthly bills as opposed to one large one. It could also help them take advantage of earlier sales many retailers offer to get consumers in the door.\nDana M. Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, says, \"October's Consumer Confidence Index suggests Americans are entering the holiday season in a somewhat cautious mood, with the overall, present situation, and expectations indexes all seeing dips.\" She continues, \"The softening in confidence may have affected overall holiday spending plans.\nPlanned spending on non-gift items fell materially this year.\" CHRISTMAS PRESENT VS CHRISTMAS PAST Christmas spending has fluctuated in recent years. The overall amount people planned to spend on holiday gifts plummeted during the pandemic, from $942 in 2019 to $805 in 2020. Last year, people spent an average of $932.\nThe $923 estimated spending this year is a slight decrease from last year. But with conflicting consumer data, retailers are stuck. Still reeling from excess inventory after the pandemic and its negative impact on their bottom lines, they're nervous about stocking up because of softer consumer demand. As the season progresses, this could lead to many out-of-stock items or even fewer discounts if demand is higher than forecasts.\nDEBT IN THE NAME OF CHRISTMAS CHEER Instead of cash stuffing throughout the year in preparation for the upcoming holiday season, many people rely on credit for Christmas shopping.\nWhile budgeting is not a magic bullet, it can help an individual maintain perspective and plan more efficiently for increased spending at the end of the year.\nSadly, credit card debt is almost synonymous with the holidays.\nPeople start racking up debt around October and continue through mid-to-late December.\nThen, they spend at least a portion of the following year paying off that debt.\nThis year, though, consumer credit behavior is a little more telling, hinting at a financial struggle amid growing inflation in a sinking economy. Almost one out of five Americans plan to apply for a new credit card to help with their holiday expenses.\nNearly one in four Americans say they are still paying off last holiday season's credit card debt, and roughly half say they won't pay off their purchases in full by the due date.\nSTRESS AND THE HOLIDAYS: IT'S NOTHING NEW Stress is also synonymous with the holiday season, and spas offer special packages ingeniously targeted at those who may feel the pressure of the holidays.\nPhysician referral site Sesame polled 500 respondents about their mental health and stress levels as they approach the holidays. Two-thirds said they were experiencing moderate to extreme holiday stress levels, including increases in: · Anxiety (52%) · Depression (41%) · Financial stress (66%).\nSome of the most stressful parts of the holiday shopping season include: · Coming up with gift ideas (35%) · Holiday weight gain (33%) · Crowds (28%) · Finding the best deals (20%) · Cost of gifts (17%).\nOnly about 34% of Americans polled said that they would consider seeking counseling to help them deal with the stress. About 14% said that they are interested in seeking professional help from a mental health counselor but feel that they are not able to afford it now.\nCHRISTMAS SURVIVAL TIPS FOR LESS FINANCIAL STRESS The good news is there are solutions to lessen or avoid much of the stress surrounding the holidays.\nThe simplest for most is to plan ahead by knowing how much money can go towards gifts. Then, keep a list of receipts to avoid overspending.\nSome people should pick up a side hustle if money is tight, like becoming a rideshare driver or helping others wrap gifts. There are many ways to double your money so that the cost of gifts is not as stressful.\nMany people (35%) feel stressed about coming up with gift ideas. To limit this stress, contact the person and ask what they need. Alternatively, ask their friends or family for ideas.\nFinally, it's critical to take some personal time to limit stress and enjoy the true meaning of the holiday season. By being proactive and intentional this year, it's possible to make this season the most enjoyable one yet.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n A man dressed as Santa Claus waves as a train arrives carrying passengers for a Christmas tree lighting ceremony and parade Saturday, Nov. 25, 2023, in Plains, Ga. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The donated dollars are used to help improve life for the many at risk adults and children throughout Dorchester County.\nHoliday programs funded by the Santa Swim provide individuals and families with food, clothes, toys, and other items. But throughout the year, the Fund also aids those with critical needs that are not able to be filled by public sources or Dorchester County Department of Social Services during the clients' period of crisis. The nonprofit Care & Share Fund, which began in 1998, also provides help with prescriptions, utility payments to prevent cut-off, medical equipment, hearing aids, diabetic supplies, and a variety of other services, including free notary service.\nFortunately, the weather for this year's festive dunk on Saturday, Dec. 9 at 11 a.m. was anything but frightful for the 20 swimmers, who helped raise a bit over $5,000.\n\"This is a wonderful holiday tradition that raises funds for an organization doing good for the community. The weather for the event was the best I can remember in years but even when the weather is horrible there is a solid group of community centered residents going out into the river to help those in our county that need assistance,\" noted Dorchester County Chamber of Commerce President/CEO Bill Christopher.\nMichael S. Wheatley, now in his fifth year as Care and Share President, was grateful for all those involved who supported the event, raising money and awareness.\n\"Everyone who contributed helps our organization make a difference for needy families right here in Dorchester County, in our home communities\" Wheatley noted.\nFor more information, visit careandsharefund.com or call 443-521-4070. \n \n Caption: CONTRIBUTED\n\n Partners in Giving prepare to take the plunge for the Care & Share Fund, an organization tasked with meeting critical needs for county residents, not only at Christmas, but year round. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Earlier this year. He has been a newspaper editor in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska and California, including a time with The Omaha-World Harold overseeing technology and information security. From 2012-2020, Jim and Bridget owned a newspaper in Iowa.

    "date": "2024-01-04",

    "content": "Tinned Fish Market on the Rise as 'Affordable Luxury'\n\n January 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Cara Campbell; Wealth Of Geeks | Page: 7A | Section: News \n \n 802\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n According to a report by Persistence Market Research, the tinned fish market in the United States is predicted to reach $17.2 billion by the end of 2033.That's a jump from $9.5 billion in 2022.\nPart of the demand is driven by consumers becoming more health-conscious.\nTinned fish contains omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to help with heart and brain health, and they help protect against the negative impacts of mercury, which some other fresh fish are known for.\nHealth coach Karen Kelly from Seasonal Cravings says tinned fish is excellent for several reasons. \"I often recommend canned fish to my clients who need more nutrient-dense foods in their diet and are looking for convenience.\nIt is readily available, easy to prepare, and affordable,\" she says. \"It tastes great in grain bowls, with leftover roasted vegetables and a drizzle of your favorite salad dressing.\" WHAT IS TINNED FISH?\nTinned fish, or canned fish, are fish that have been processed, sealed, and sterilized.\nSome popular examples include tuna, sardines, salmon mackerel, anchovies, and herring. And while many are probably familiar with a classic tuna sandwich, tinned fish has gone way beyond that, finding its way onto everything from charcuterie boards to upscale restaurant menus.\nTIKTOK REVIVAL\nPart of the recent increase in sales is attributed to the \"rediscovery\" of tinned fish on social media. Anna Hezel is an Epicurious senior editor and the author of Tin to Table: Fancy, Snacky Recipes for Tin-thusiasts and A-fish-ionados. She says, \"Getting into tinned fish is a little intimidating if you've never bought a particular product, and you have no idea what it's going to look like when the lid is peeled back.\nTikTok has really helped demystify this category of seafood for so many people and celebrated the social and visual aspects of collecting and eating tinned fish.\" The hashtag #tinnedfish has 116.4 million views on TikTok as of this writing, and it's also cultivated a community called #tinnedfishtok, which has nearly 68 million views.\nORIGINS\nAlthough a younger North American audience may be discovering tinned fish for the first time, it's a food with a long history. It originated in the 1700s in France, when preserved foods were in great demand. Their long shelf life and accessibility were precious for the French military.\nHezel says COVID-19 played a part in opening up American markets to the industry more recently. \"I think there was a big cultural shift during the onset of COVID-19 when people started seeking out shelf-stable foods way more and also started to do their grocery shopping online a lot more,\" she says. \"This coincided with the launch of a bunch of new tinned fish brands with availability in the U.S., and from there, the trend hasn't really slowed down.\" AFFORDABLE LUXURY\nThe booming trend on TikTok is revamping the image of tinned fish for many young people. Either they didn't know what to do with it or were scared by it.\nNow, says Hezel, canned fish has become an approachable form of luxury, mainly at a significant cost reduction from fresh seafood, like ahi tuna.\n\"I think of certain hobbies, like collecting wines, which require hundreds of dollars just to get started,\" says Hezel. \"By comparison, you can buy a really beautifully crafted, hand-packed tin of sardines in amazing olive oil from Portugal for $6.\" Much like appreciating the craftsmanship that goes into a chef-made lobster ravioli dish or a perfectly selected bottle of wine, \"you get to taste all of this skill and tradition that's gone into preparing the fish without buying a plane ticket or paying for a restaurant meal,\" says Hezel.\nHOW TO USE TINNED FISH AT HOME\nTinned fish is a versatile ingredient. A quick search online will reveal a wide array of pasta, salads, charcuterie boards, toasts, and more creative ways for tinned fish lovers to consume this product.\nLavender & Macarons food blogger Iryna Bychkiv says she eats tinned sardines at least once a week. \"They make an excellent 'emergency' food when you're too tired or busy to cook a complicated meal,\" she says.\nOn the flip side, if she has time, she'll make a sardine salad with boiled potatoes, eggs, chopped cucumber, and green onion. \"It's very filling and satisfying, plus sardines are packed with proteinso it's a win-win.\" Hezel loves to make tinned fish the star of the show when she's having a fancy dinner or a date night.\n\"I love to make a big, elaborate salad, buy a nice loaf of sourdough, and open two or three tins to try,\" she says.\nHERE TO STAY\nWith the market set to grow over the next 10 years, the popularity, availability and choice for tinned fish isn't going anywhere.\nIt's affordable, nutritious, convenient, and versatile.\nIt may appear on pantry shelves, restaurant menus, and date nights for years.\nThis article was produced by the Gourmet Bon Vivant and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n \n Caption: WEALTH OF GEEKS\n\n BURKHARD MÜCKE/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS\n\n Anchovy Pizza \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "WBOC dropped from Breezeline cable lineup\n\n January 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Local News \n \n 551\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Breezeline, a local cable provider serving viewers in the Mid-Shore region, dropped Salisbury-based news station WBOC-TV from its lineup on Dec. 31, upsetting many customers.The cable provider made the decision to drop the CBS-affiliated news station from its lineup due to WBOC being an out-of-market station to the communities Breezeline serves, according to a statement on the news station's website.\nThose communities — some in Talbot, Queen Anne's and Kent counties — are in the Baltimore viewing area, per Nielsen Media Research.\nAccording to Andrew Walton, a spokesperson for Breezeline, the Federal Communications Commission designated WJZ, the CBS affiliate in Baltimore, as the in-market station. WBOC, an out-of-market station, is not significantly viewed, he said in an email.\nNielsen determines the designated market area based on viewing patterns. The designated market areas and stations within those areas are published quarterly, and the FCC has established processes for subsequent modifications.\nBreezeline notified its customers in November about the drop of WBOC from its local lineups, Walton said.\nCraig Jahelka, president of Draper Media, the company that owns WBOC, stressed that the decision was not a carriage dispute, or made because the station and the cable provider couldn't agree. It was a unilateral decision by Breezeline, he said.\nJahelka, a former journalist, said it was \"very frustrating\" for the decision to be made for the station by Breezeline executives not in WBOC's coverage area.\n\"Without us ... people don't know what's going on,\" he said.\nNews stations in Baltimore won't cover stories local to the Mid-Shore region, or the area's weather and sports, Jahelka added.\nWalton said the discontinuation of carriage was instituted to manage costs for customers.\nWhile there is constant pressure on rates because of large, ongoing increases in content costs, Breezeline works to manage costs where possible to make sure its video service provides a strong value for customers, he added.\n\"We understand the disappointment that some Grasonville customers feel about WBOC,\" Walton said via email. \"Yet, all Breezeline TV viewers would have been burdened with the cost of both channels when the content on WBOC substantially duplicates that found on WJZ. In addition, local content on WBOC can be accessed on their website for free.\"\nThis is not the first time WBOC was dropped from Breezeline's lineup.\nIn late December 2014, Atlantic Broadband, which was rebranded as Breezeline in early 2022, dropped the news station after a local programming review.\nThe volume of public outcry then about the decision prompted the cable provider to restore WBOC to its channel lineup within a month, Jahelka said.\nWhile Jahelka can't force the cable provider to add the station back to its lineup, a resurgence of public outcry about the decision could potentially prompt Breezeline to return the channel, he added.\nWBOC itself has already been inundated with calls from upset viewers. Some viewers have taken to social media to voice frustration with the decision.\nJahelka encouraged customers to contact Breezeline, saying it's the only way for the cable provider to understand how important WBOC's coverage is to Delmarva residents.\nViewers with concerns or complaints can reach out to Breezeline via email at breezeline@breezeline.com.\nBut for now, those interested in viewing WBOC's news programs can watch via its website or the WBOC app. News is also available via WBOC's social media.\nThis story has been updated from an earlier version to include the most current contact information for Breezeline. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 4.8 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stand 22.6 cents per gallon lower than a year ago.The national average price of diesel has fallen 2.0 cents in the last week and stands at $3.89 per gallon.\nAccording to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.74 per gallon yesterday while the most expensive was $4.79 per gallon, a difference of $2.05.\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 0.6 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.04 per gallon Monday. The national average is down 1.4 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 23.9 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nJanuary 15, 2023: $3.28/g (U.S. Average: $3.28 per gallon).\nJanuary 15, 2022: $3.25/g (U.S. Average: $3.30 per gallon).\nJanuary 15, 2021: $2.46/g (U.S. Average: $2.39 per gallon).\nJanuary 15, 2020: $2.51/g (U.S. Average: $2.56 per gallon).\nJanuary 15, 2019: $2.24/g (U.S. Average: $2.24 per gallon).\nJanuary 15, 2018: $2.55/g (U.S. Average: $2.53 per gallon).\nJanuary 15, 2017: $2.37/g (U.S. Average: $2.34 per gallon).\nJanuary 15, 2016: $1.92/g (U.S. Average: $1.92 per gallon).\nJanuary 15, 2015: $2.24/g (U.S. Average: $2.07 per gallon).\nJanuary 15, 2014: $3.40/g (U.S. Average: $3.30 per gallon).\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.01/g, down 3.0 cents per gallon from last week's $3.04 per gallon.\nWashington D.C.: $3.13 per gallon, down 3.6 cents per gallon from last week's $3.16 per gallon.\nHagerstown: $3.06 per gallon, down 3.2 cents per gallon from last week's $3.09 per gallon.\n\"Last week was a bit of a mixed bag for gasoline prices, with prices increasing early on but falling again in recent days as the situation in the Red Sea continues to drive market volatility,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"While last week saw the U.S. attacking Houthi militants engaged in attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, oil prices jumped, but then promptly fell as economic concerns with weak demand sapped the upward move after the U.S. and allies attacked Houthi rebels. Gasoline inventories also saw another large rise, putting some downward pressure on gas prices, and leaving an opportunity for the national average to potentially briefly fall below $3 per gallon. We'll have to see if the stars finally align for such a move.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "2023 year-end housing statistics for the Eastern Shore\n\n January 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MID-SHORE BOARD OF REALTORS | Section: Real Estate \n \n 715\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Home sellers were happy in 2023, as the median and average home prices increased across our five-county Mid-Shore region.The flip side is that many homebuyers continue to be priced out of the market, said Shelby Roney, Mid-Shore Board of Realtors president.\nBut that may change in 2024, as the federal reserve has indicated they may lower interest rates.\nFor the five counties of Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot, 2,466 homes were sold in 2023, and these homes sold in 44 days or less.\nThe average sold price went up in four of the five counties, and those homes sold within 95% of their original list price. This is all good news, Roney noted.\nA positive indicator for sellers is the list price compared to the sold price. This means that homes are selling for 95% or better than the asking price on average, which is great news for those looking to maximize their profits.\nCombine that with the average days on market still being a little over a month, and it shows pricing your property competitively from the start leads to a quick and rewarding home selling experience.\nFor our five counties 2023 home prices averaged:\nCaroline County's average home price was $314,874, a 7.13% increase compared to 2022.Dorchester County's average home price was $304,646, a 2.07% increase compared to 2022.Kent County average home price for 2023 was $402,413, down 1.82% compared to 2022.Queen Anne's County average home price in 2023 was $561,349, a 1.86% increase from 2022.Talbot County's 2023 average home price was $789,471, a 13.77% increase compared to 2022.\nContinuing with the low inventory of recent years and adding in the rising interest rates, it is no surprise that the overall number of homes sold in all the five counties declined in 2023.\nThe 2,466 homes sold in 2023 represented a decrease of 8.6% from the year prior.\nIn Caroline County, 308 homes sold in 2023, 117 fewer than in to 2022.\nDorchester County had 539 homes sold in 2023, 56 fewer than in 2022.\nKent County sold 308 homes, 10 fewer than in 2022.\nQueen Anne's County had 805 homes sold in 2023, 70 fewer than in 2022.\nIn Talbot County, 506 homes were sold in 2023,140 fewer than in 2022.\nThere is only a week difference in the number of days it took to sell a home in 2023 compared to 2022.\nHomes in 2023 in Caroline County sold on average in 51 days, only seven days longer than in 2022.\nDorchester County homes took eight days longer to sell, or 51 days, compared to 2022.\nKent County took 41 days on average to sell, four days longer than in 2022.\nQueen Anne's County homes sold in 35 days, six days longer than in 2022.\nTalbot County homes sold on average in 41 days, one day less than in 2022.\nThe year-end statistics continue to show a strong demand for homes on the Eastern Shore, said Roney.\nThe trend continues with families moving from Baltimore County and Washington, where the home prices are higher, to the rural sections of the state such as the Eastern Shore, southern Maryland and western Maryland, where the home prices and property taxes are generally lower.\nA small ray of hope for both buyers and sellers was at the end of 2023, where the falling mortgage rates helped more buyers purchase homes in December. But they still face the same issues that we have seen for the past years, the severe lack of homes, Roney said.\nLooking forward, reduced interest rates will allow for more buyers to enter the market, but it will also create a more competitive environment as home buyers compete for the few listed properties.\n\"I am encouraged to see that 2023 ended with an 11% increase in active listings compared to the year's end in 2022,\" Roney said.\nFor buyers, you still need to act quickly, and your Mid-Shore Realtor can help you make a strong offer.\nIt is important to remember, Roney said, that once mortgage rates start to decline, there will be more competition for the already limited number of available homes for sale. Right now, buyers should expect a very competitive market in 2024, with prices continuing to rise.\nThe Mid-Shore Board of Realtors' mission is to advocate for its members and the public to preserve the right to own, transfer and utilize real property.

    "content": "A taste of the Shore: Eat Sprout cafe opens in Statehouse\n\n January 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: General Assembly \n \n 635\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Maryland lawmakers and legislative staffers returning to the Statehouse this year are welcoming a delicious upgrade to the building's canteen: an Eat Sprout cafe.The new cafe, jokingly called the \"Sprout Canteen\" by owners Ryan and Emily Groll, is serving up a full spread of locally-sourced and organic grab-and-go food options in the heart of the state capitol.\nThe cozy cafe is Easton-based Sprout's fourth location and its second in Annapolis.\nThe opportunity to open a cafe in the Statehouse came \"relatively fast,\" according to Ryan Groll.\nSprout was already known to some year-round Statehouse staff, who've shopped at Sprout's Annapolis location or popped by to the St. Michaels cafe while on vacation, he said.\nSen. Johnny Mautz (R-Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Wicomico), a St. Michaels resident, also advocated for a Sprout cafe opening in the Statehouse when he found out about the search for a new vendor, joining a number of other legislators and government officials impressed with Sprout.\nWhen Groll was at the existing Annapolis cafe late last year, he began talking with one staffer, who mentioned the canteen's previous offerings were lacking during the legislative sessions.\nArmed with that knowledge, Groll voiced an idea.\n\"(I) said, 'Hey, what if Sprout came in and provided all kinds of foods, bread, snacks and espressos to all the senators and congressmen and legislators and governor,'\" he said. \"They said, 'Oh my gosh, that would be amazing if you can do that.'\"\nFrom there, it was \"kind of like wildfire,\" Groll said.\nThe Sprout team had about a month to make everything work, including securing vendors, equipment and staffing, along with tackling other logistical challenges of opening up shop in the Statehouse.\n\"I'm not sure who did what or who connected us to the right person, but it was almost like every day somebody from the Statehouse was calling me to just check in on us to see how the progress was going,\" Groll said.\n\"Getting phone calls from senators and phone calls from chiefs of staff was really neat, to see how much they truly cared and wanted to make sure that we were there and open and ready for them when they were in session,\" he added.\nSeveral other small businesses on the Shore helped support Sprout's newest cafe, too.\nShawn Bell of Cambridge-based Kommercial Kitchens Inc. supplied refrigerators, with a team helping to unpack and unload the equipment early one morning. John Callahan of Callahan Signs printed marketing materials the same day Groll called him and installed them the next day.\nChesapeake Coffee Roasters, a Crofton-based business, also lent a hand with setting up espresso machines.\nAll of the logistical work was done remotely, unfolding during the holidays, but it finished just in time.\n\"We had equipment delivered on a Monday, cooked food on Tuesday and opened for session on Wednesday,\" Groll said.\nThough the session is only a week in, the newest Sprout cafe already has some regulars, said Emily Groll, nodding toward a familiar legislative staffer who'd popped in for a quick bite on a chilly Tuesday morning.\nLawmakers, staffers and law enforcement alike are still scoping out the cafe, milling in and out between sessions, meetings and calls of duty.\n\"This is nice,\" a first-time customer said as he perused the refrigerated display case's offerings.\nMautz praised Sprout's innovative business model, acknowledging the cafe's fresh, originally made food being available in a convenient grab-and-go style seems to fit well with the busy and sometimes inconsistent schedules in the legislative world.\nSprout's menu, though different from the previous canteen staples, is a refreshing change, he said — and the business being Eastern-Shore-based is another plus.\n\"(It's) a variety, and a lot of healthy options — not everybody's looking for 100% healthy food, but they want to know what they're eating is good quality. I view quality over the health factor,\" Mautz said. \"They know it's a good quality product that they're getting.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In the 10 years since, Boyd has found that the act of coming together around food represents much more than just breaking bread.\nBorn into a family of women who prioritized family meals, Boyd learned from her grandmother, aunt and mother how to prepare \"soul-warming feasts.\"\n\"I knew I wanted to be a chef … (which) came from being able to cook with my grandmother, aunt and mother,\" she said. \"My grandmother's home was open to everyone: different backgrounds, ethnicities — you were going to feel loved, and you were going to feel taken care of. That's how my family has always celebrated … That was ingrained in me.\"\nA graduate of Baltimore International College's culinary program, Boyd shared her gifts cooking in restaurants from 2014 to 2018, waiting for the right time to establish the Humble Hearts concept. After a setback from breast cancer, from which she has recovered, doing events with her then-business partner became full-time in 2018.\nThe catch? Both had other full-time jobs.\n\"In 2020, we decided, 'Let's do this full time,'\" she said. \"We left our jobs one month before the pandemic started.

It's no big deal. I am used to it.\"\n\"In the winter we are clearing snow. When it snows, we are out here pushing snow. I am a pushing guy today, but I will do whatever it takes,\" he said.\nAccording to Widener, Friday's temperatures, though frigid, were high enough to keep the workload manageable for the team.\n\"If it gets too cold, the salt doesn't work,\" Widener said. \"I am the foreman today. I have five guys working for me. But for this, today, it is not too cold, and the salt works well.\"\nRock salt, lots of it, gets put in a spreader, which is attached to the back of a pickup truck for crews to drive around clients' roads and parking lots.\nDoupnik said the team used over 100 40-pound bags of salt to handle Friday's workload, purchased from Site One landscaping supply.\n\"It is not cheap. Salt costs $450 a ton,\" he said. \"We get them in 40-pound bags. You can put six bags at a time in the tailgate salt spreader.\"\nFriday's storm brought upwards of three inches of snow to Easton and upwards of four inches to the town's north and east, according to the National Weather Service.\nIn more intense winter weather, Doupnik said, the team requires even larger quantities of salt, and staying ahead of the icy roads can be a strain on their bodies.\n\"This (storm) is a piece of cake. It is not really blowing. The six- to 10-inchers, you are out for two days. It sucks. You go home and try to get some rest, and then you are back out fixing it up. You just go back out there,\" he said.\nIn his 40 years of plowing snow, Doupnik has learned the value his team's hard work provides to not only his customers, but to the community as a whole.\n\"For commercial clients, you kind of have to provide it. They like an all-inclusive package,\" he said. \"We do a lot of banks, we do these private schools and the churches. People still go to church. People still bank, and they have got to go to school. These places have to be open — especially the banks. We were out early this morning getting the banks opened up. Since schools are out, we do them last.\"\nDoupnik said the community often shows appreciation for what his crew does.\n\"My guys get treated very well. My customers give them stuff a lot — especially at Christmas time,\" he said. \"These are good guys, hard workers.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2024-01-23",

    "content": "What are the benefits of Roth IRA accounts?\n\n January 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KEVIN CALDWELL | Section: News \n \n 700\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Roth IRA accounts are one of the best retirement vehicles available to most people. These accounts are excellent avenues to lower your income taxes in retirement.Below we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these accounts. Please keep in mind that these are generalities, and the nuances of everyone's situation can change the strategies discussed below so it is important that you consult with your financial advisor to discuss your particular situation.\nADVANTAGES OF ROTH IRA\nThe advantages of Roth IRAs are significant and each one has some subtleties included in it. Some advantages are similar to other IRA accounts; however, the unique advantages of Roth IRAs bring substantial value over time.\n1) Tax-Free Growth — As with all other IRA accounts, the earnings while in the account are tax-free. However, unlike some other IRA accounts, the contributions to a Roth IRA have already been taxed, meaning you will not receive tax deductions at the time of funding the account like you do in a 401(k) account.\n2) Withdrawals are tax-free and include more flexibility — Since the contributions have already been taxed you can withdraw those at any time, penalty-free and tax-free. The earnings cannot be withdrawn until you reach 59 and a half-years-old and the account has been open for five years. But once you meet those criteria, all withdrawals are tax-free.\nThe only exceptions to the age and time requirements are due to disability, a first-time home purchase, or death.\n3) No Required Minimum Distributions — There are no Requirement Minimum Distributions on Roth IRA accounts. Most other IRA accounts force you to start taking withdrawals at the age of 73, at an increasingly higher rate each year. Those withdrawals are taxable, and you can get hit with severe penalties if you do not meet the RMDs. This also means Roth accounts can be left to heirs tax-free.\n4) No age limits — There is no age limit for contributing to a Roth IRA. As long as you have earned income from a job or receive 1099 income, then you can contribute to a Roth IRA.\n5) No effect on Social Security benefit taxes — One of the most overlooked advantages of a Roth IRA is the positive effect on the taxes of Social Security distributions, potential Medicare Surtax and Medicare premiums. When you take social security distributions in retirement, you may get taxed on those distributions. If your combined income is between $25,000 and $34,000 (if filing as an individual) or between $32,000 and $44,000 (if filing as married filing jointly), then up to 50% of your social security distributions could be taxed. If you are above those thresholds, then up to 85% of your social security distributions could be taxed.\nThe key here is the term \"combined income\", which includes your adjusted gross income plus nontaxable interest and one-half of your Social Security benefits. That means that non-taxable income like interest from Municipal Bonds and Capital Gains (assuming you are in the 0% Capital Gains tax bracket) can still increase your taxes by the effect that income has on your Social Security benefits tax.\nDISADVANTAGES OF ROTH IRA\nThere are really only two disadvantages. First, you are funding the account with after tax dollars versus other IRA savings where contributions can reduce your current income (such as 401k contributions), and thereby your current tax liability.\nSo if you are in a high income tax bracket while working and expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, then taking advantage of 401(k) contributions can be more beneficial.\nThe second disadvantage is the income limitation.\nFor 2024, if you are a single filer and your Modified Adjustment Gross Income is more than $146,000, your contributions are reduced. Contributions are completely eliminated at $161,000. For married couples filing jointly, those figures are $230,000 and $240,000 respectively.\nAs you can see the advantages of owning a Roth IRA while in retirement are enormous. That does not mean they are better for everybody throughout a lifetime of savings, but if you are able to take advantage of these accounts, they will help you stretch your retirement income by reducing your taxes.\nKevin Caldwell is found and advisor at Islands East Advisors in Stevensville.

    "content": "The Arc is making progress toward August completion\n\n January 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 733\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Arc Central Chesapeake's 24,000-square-foot Port Street Commons center is growing, with concrete monoliths, the beginnings of the new building, reaching into the sky.And as the project takes shape, they are getting closer to providing both affordable housing and support for community members with developmental disabilities, Arc leadership said.\n\"We started construction on Aug. 14, so yes, we are roughly six months in. That estimates the completion is November 4,\" said Jonathon Rondeau, the president and CEO of The Arc Central Chesapeake Region.\n\"It was always designed to be a 14-month build, and we have worked in partnership with our architect, Rauch, and our general contractor, BGC, to keep on top of that,\" he said.\nTo speed up the construction process, everything down to bathroom tile has already been chosen.\n\"There is no design process at the same time, which is a little bit different. We front load everything. That is where delays are, making decisions on site,\" Rondeau said.\nHe said the design of the building is meant to mirror what it looked like in Easton 50 or 60 years ago, mimicking architectural styles that were common in the area at the time.\nIt will be three stories tall and have one elevator.\nAccording to Rondeau, the building will provide space for The Arc to continue to grow in their mission.\n\"The Arc Central Chesapeake has been providing support and services to people with disabilities in the Mid-Shore region for 20 years,\" he said. \"Over the last five, we have seen a growth in our services by over 80%. The need to have a more established presence here was true when we chose Easton as sort of a central hub for the Mid-Shore and the Eastern Shore as our headquarters 15 years ago.\"\nThe Arc been getting support from the town, county and state inspectors.\n\"Everyone has been aligned to help us to get on that timeline,\" he said.\nThis facility has two large goals. One is creating affordable housing, which Talbot County needs for people like EMS workers. The Arc has a specific hourly range in mind.\n\"Fifteen years ago, The Arc started a housing subsidiary called Chesapeake Neighbors, One, to create better housing for people with disabilities, but also realizing that if we are going to create inclusive and equitable communities, they can't just be people with disabilities,\" Rondeau said. \"Chesapeake Neighbors' vision is to create affordable housing for all.\"\nThey have grown from 11 units to over 70. Nine of these will be at Port Street.\n\"There will be seven two-bedroom apartments and two three-bedroom apartments on this site. It might be for your local Barista or a person who works at Royal Farms. It could be a teacher or childcare worker — people who make $20 to $25 an hour,\" he said.\nRondeau said that Talbot County's median income is $100,000.\nSo even if someone makes $80,000, they can't buy or rent easily in the county. Aside from Scotty's Taxi, there is no public transportation.\nWhere is all this money coming from to build Port Street Commons?\n\"We have a capital campaign called Expanding What Is Possible. It officially launched two years ago. We have raised about $5.1 million to date,\" Rondeau said. \"The total campaign is $8.5 million. Under Gov. Hogan we received $1 million. Under Gov. Moore we have received $1.5 million. And from the federal government with Sen. Van Hollen and Sen. Cardin, we received $750,000.\"\nHe said the Arc is looking to hire direct support professionals. They already have 400 people in that role, but will need more help on Port Street. Applicants do not need a degree, and the Arc will train new employees with 80 or 90 hours. They are looking for people who want to affect change in a person's life.\n\"I am excited to be taking a piece of land that really didn't have a purpose and there will be something meaningful that the community has needed for a long time, particularly Port Street,\" Rondeau said. \"And there will be a community hub for the people we support, like families with children with disabilities. It will look like a Capital One cafe. The Easton Rotary Club sponsored this room. It will be the Easton Rotary Community Hub.\"\nRondeau ended with, \"There is a huge need in the community. The building is a catalyst for someone to get services. It allows families to feel like they are safe. And The Arc is investing and putting roots in this community.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The organization, based in Essex, also works closely with government, community and business leaders to make considerable progress in marine-related areas — from waterfront living to recreational boating.\n\"I think everything went excellent,\" said Brian Schneider, president of association.\n\"We've had an extremely good response … hats off to all my guys that have donated their time to us. It's really incredible to see all of this come together.\"\nThe three-day event, held at the Maryland State Fairgrounds in Timonium, featured more than 30 Maryland boat dealers showcasing new boats and marine equipment, including sport fishing boats, performance boats, ski boats, cruisers, cabin cruisers and more.\nGuests and participants traveled from as far as Virginia and Delaware for the boat show, which featured children's activities, live musical performances, more than exhibitors, fishing and boating seminars, food and beverages, a fishing simulator, fishing tackle pier.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Boat Show drew attendance from a number of Essex-based organizations, including Maryland Waterways, Back River Restoration Committee, Baltimore Boating Center, Friends of Hart-Miller Island and the Coastal Conservation Association-Maryland.\nBringing together nonprofits, a vibrant community of boaters, boat dealers and organizations \"is huge for our industry,\" Weaver emphasized.\n\"This is our third year, and it's our largest year to put this together,\" he said.\nSam Weaver, co-founder of Maryland Waterways Foundation, worked alongside colleague Karen Wynn and others at the organization's exhibit at the boat show to highlight and promote environmentally sustainable practices to improve the condition of the state's waterways and the Chesapeake Bay.\n\"It was a great experience … the space was sold out, and other than the weather it was a great time for all,\" Weaver said. \"We just hope that, somehow or another, we impressed people enough to join us in cleanups and take care of [the environment].\"\nMaryland Waterways' participation in the boat show was also an opportunity to recruit for internships, Weaver added.\nSchneider has presided over the MTABC for a decade and also serves as the president of the Chesapeake Bay Boat Show. Prior to the pandemic, MTABC participated in a yearly boat show in downtown Baltimore that was costly with less space.\nBeginning the boat show in 2022 was one of the most worthwhile decisions the organization made, Schneider said, considering the affordability, free parking and the abundant space that the Fairgrounds venue provided for attendees and participants.\n\"There's only a couple of boat shows in the state, and this is the premier show in the state of Maryland,\" Schneider said, highlighting the Chesapeake Bay Boat Show's uniqueness and pivotal role in contributing to the regional economy.\n\"I hope [visitors] felt it was well-worthwhile to attend … and I hope they're looking forward to coming back next year.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dissen, president of Dissen & Juhn Company. \"Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions, and our belief that a Company is only as good as its employees are what has kept us strong and growing.\"\nBeing good stewards to the communities it serves has always been another guiding principle for Dissen & Juhn Company.\nAlthough that principle typically shows up in how the construction crews operate in environmentally sensitive areas, as Dissen & Juhn turned the page on its 50th year it made the decision to be stewards philanthropically.\n\"Nearly all of our management, administrative staff and crews live here on the Eastern Shore and are raising their children here. We are grateful for our business successes and for all that this area has given to us, so we wanted to say thanks by helping others,\" Dissen said.\nDissen & Juhn Company made donations ranging from $2,500 to $7,500 to: The Brighter Christmas Fund, Easton, for its holiday giving program; Giving the Edge Foundation, Stevensville, for its leadership program, providing mentorship to middle school students; Haven Ministries, Queenstown, to support its food pantry; Rebuilding Together of Queen Anne's County, Centreville, to support home repairs for veterans in need in Queen Anne's County; the Sultana Education Foundation, Chestertown, for its scholarship and financial aid programs and United Way of Queen Anne's County, Chester, to support its annual fund.\nLighthouse Point Marina nominated Marina of the YearAs 2023 came to a close, Dissen & Juhn Company got an unexpected, but welcome surprise — Lighthouse Point Marina in Baltimore was named the Marina of the Year by Marina Dock Age at the 2023 Docks Expo in Nashville. The $16 million marina construction project was part of a $40 million redevelopment project, which transformed the 25-year-old marina into a world-class facility. Completed at the end of December, the new 400-slip marina features slips ranging in length from 35' to 70', with plenty of room for larger boats on exterior side ties and T-Head end ties as well as state-of-the-art floating docks from Meeco Sullivan.\n\"When the award announcement was made, we had just finished Phase 1 of the project,\" says Dissen. \"We thought, just wait until they see the project at completion,\" he jokes. \"For Dissen & Juhn, the project had all the components that allowed us to show what makes us different from other marine and foundation contractors. The project was extensive in scope and size, and had tight delivery requirements.\"\nNew projects on the horizon for Dissen & Juhn Company include: a complete marina rebuild for an HOA marina in Annapolis; two bulkhead replacement projects on Maryland's Eastern Shore and dredging in Grays, Hunter's, Saltworks, and Yates creeks for Anne Arundel County.\nFounded in 1973, Dissen & Juhn Company of Stevensville, is a second generation, family-owned full-service marine and foundation contractor that has built a solid reputation as an agile, customer-focused small company with heavy construction capabilities rarely found in a firm of its size. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Remote Realities: Office vacancies rise as work from home fully takes root\n\n February 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: Business \n \n 1553\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Office vacancies are at record highs in the U.S.A year-end report from Moody's Analytics found the national office vacancy rate ended 2023 at a \"record-breaking 19.6%.\"\nWhat's the culprit?\"\nRemote work born from the coronavirus pandemic is fully rooted for many workplaces and expected by many workers for certain occupations.\nThere are also significant declines in job postings for office jobs as automation, artificial intelligence and corporate restructurings change the economic landscape and reduce workforces.\nAccording to Moody's, the previous record high for empty office was 19.3% set in 1986 and 1991 during the savings and loan crisis. Moody's also found new office construction in 2023 (24.5 million square feet) is the lowest since 2012.\nRemote work is here to stay for many workers — with many permanently at home offices or working hybrid models of two to four days at home and limited office time.\n\"The permanence of dynamic hybrid models has effectively muted office demand, making the year of 2023 the most downbeat since the Great Financial Crisis,\" Moody's economists Thomas LaSalvia, Lu Chen and Nick Luettke write in their year-end analysis, referring to the Wall Street and global financial upheavals of 2007 and 2008 and resulting recession and real estate crash.\nOther commercial real estate firms also see record-high vacancy levels.\nAccording to real estate firm Avison Young Inc, 23.4% of U.S. office space was available for lease in the fourth quarter of 2023. That includes 27.4% of Class A space.\nVacancy and availability rates are north of 30% in Atlanta, Dallas and Austin and ended last year at 36.2% in San Francisco, according to Avison Young's Q4 numbers.\nAmong other large markets, vacancy rates end the year at 26.4% in Chicago, 19.2% in Manhattan, 23% in Los Angeles, 29.6% in Houston, 21.9% in Minneapolis-St. Paul, 29.8% in Denver and 19.1% in Miami.\nThe commercial real estate firm said office space needs could continue to be downwardly impacted by significant drops in job postings for office jobs infields such as finance, media, public relations and insurance as well as decrease in job openings in markets such as San Francisco, Charlotte, New York, Tampa and Atlanta.\nIMPACTFUL ACTIONS\nMany employers across the U.S. have set their post-pandemic paths on remote work and whether and how to require workers to be at the office, according to Alicia Scott-Wears, content director for World at Work, a Scottsdale, Arizona-based human resources association.\nWhile some bosses yearn to require workers to be physically present, contemporary realities, including labor preferences and employee retention — are often resulting in hybrid work models where employees can work at home but are required to show up at offices an expected number of days each week or month.\nThat is becoming accompanied by some tracking of employees' attendance and productivity via wi-fi usage and badge swipes.\nScott-Wears said employers and managers need to tread carefully on these fronts otherwise they run the risk of losing existing employees and could find themselves struggling to hire new ones.\n\"The manner in which employers approach the implementation of their preferred strategy will be an impactful aspect. An organization's culture not only influences the decision for the chosen path of workplace flexibility but how the organization rolls that out will in turn impact the culture and perception of the organization,\" she said. \"Organizations will want to take care not to erode trust and positive culture they have worked long and hard to build which could easily occur if adequate consideration and thoughtful practice in implementation are not taken with return to office efforts.\"\nScott-Wears said many job applicants prefer work from home jobs but that she's seen a drop in those types of jobs listed by employers. The result is high numbers of applicants for jobs with remote options.\n\"However, even though there are fewer remote jobs, those are the positions receiving the high interest and application submittals. So even though it may not be the expectation, there is certainly a desire and preferential availability to the talent with remote work,\" Scott-Wears said.\nWorking from home has made suburban office locations more popular for employers with hybrid models, according to Moody's.\nBEST PLACES FOR REMOTE WORK\nAn analysis of U.S. Census Bureau occupation data by SelectSoftware Reviews (SSR) found the District of Columbia (54%), Colorado (37.3%), Maryland (37%), Massachusetts (36.4%), Utah (36%), Washington (34.8%) and Minnesota (33.7%) have the highest percentage of remote workers.\nTelework has also allowed some workers to relocate to smaller towns and rural areas since they are no longer tethered to metropolitan commutes.\nReal estate agents and brokers from Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Florida say they have seen remote workers relocating from more urban and many times more expensive coastal areas. Some are taking advantage of states with no or lower income taxes while others are looking for less expensive real estate and more hospitable places for their small businesses or freelance work.\n\"We are seeing a lot of small business owners and workers relocating here. I think the main driver is the healthy economy, good schools, low crime and abundant choices of recreation,' said Mike DeVries, a broker with McCaw, Devries, Steinhauer and Company Real Estate in Bozeman, Montana.\nTechnology sectors are also growing in the Mountain West.\n\"I think there is more tech coming here and not just computers and software stuff. There is a surprising amount of smaller high tech manufacturing businesses that just do their thing and stay under the radar,' DeVries said.\nAccording to Massachusetts-based SSR. Mississippi (11.9%) and Louisiana (13.7%) had the lowest percentages of teleworkers. Among other states, 29.9% of California workers report doing at least part of their jobs remotely. That figures stands at 31% in Oregon, 23.6% in Idaho, 25.4% in Wisconsin, 25.2% in Florida, 27% in North Carolina and 24.2% in Ohio.\nBY THE NUMBERS\nAccording to year-end 2023 figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 21.9% of American workers report teleworking some hours on the job with 10.5% working totally at home.\nOverall, 21% of private sector workers, 33.5% of federal workers, 22.6% of state government workers and 9.8% of local public sector workers (which include police officers, firefighters and public works employees) have telework options, according to BLS.\nFor some professions, remote work (including totally working from home) is increasingly the norm.\nTwo-thirds (66%) of workers in computer and mathematical related jobs work remotely with 38.3% of tech workers completely out of the office.\nAmong other professions, 43.2% of employees in media, design, arts and sports-related office jobs work remotely at least some of the time with 22.7% completely working from home, according to BLS.\nMore than half (52.6%) of lawyers and other legal workers work remotely some of the time but only 18.2% are completely remote.\nDemographically, Asian men are the most likely to be able to work remotely — with 33.4% reporting they work remotely some of the time. Just over 30%of Asian women, 24.4% of White women and 21.3% of Black women are able to work remotely for some of their occupation, according to December figures from BLS.\nThat compares to 20% of White Men, 12.3% of Black Men and 8.5% of Hispanic Men working remotely for some of their jobs.\nA lot of that has to do with the types and level of employment. Some jobs — ranging from graphic designers and news editors to software engineers and programmers — can work from home.\nWomen, especially those with college degrees, are more likely to work in office settings that now afford telework options, Employees with more education and higher pay levels are more likely to be given remote work options than lower-paid, frontline, blue-collar and part-time workers.\n\"The type of work to be performed also plays a large role; if the nature of the work is not conducive to a remote environment then there is unlikely to be as much demand or push for it with those roles. On the other hand, there are many professional positions that are readily feasible to be performed from anywhere and highly conducive to remote work which then also opens up talent pool options for the employer,\" Scott-Wears said.\nIS AI COMING FOR YOUR JOB?But those same employee groups who are able to work from home are also more likely to have jobs that could be impacted by artificial intelligence and automation.\nAn analysis by the Pew Research Center, 19% of U.S. workers have jobs that could be impacted by AI. That includes potentially being replaced. Women are more likely than men to be jobs impacted by AI. Asians are the potentially most impacted racial group and higher educated workers have more automation exposure professionally, according to Pew.\nSome of the jobs likely to be most impacted — and potentially most at risk from AI — include budget analysts, tax preparers, data entry workers, technical writers and web developers, according to Pew. Frontline workers and service providers such as barbers and hair stylists, construction workers, child care workers and those working at restaurants and hotels are the least likely to feel the employment affects of artificial intelligence.\nScott-Wears said larger employers are more equipped for telework options and it allows them to take advantage of larger labor pools less dependent on geography and commute times. That might give them some competitive advantages in attracting and retaining workers. \"The size of the business is also a factor as larger multinational organizations have a higher likelihood to be better prepared for a more flexible or remote-first approach as they often have fewer obstacles through culture, connection, or technology platforms etc.\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He stopped by Maryland Lottery headquarters on Monday with his wife Rachel to collect his prize.\nThe 50 Years! game, which arrived in stores with three $5 million top prizes on Feb. 20, 2023, was part of the Maryland Lottery's 50th anniversary celebration. The first top-prize winner hailed from New Carrollton.\nA super fan of the $50 scratch-off, Deneau said it is the only lottery game he currently plays. He's been on a hot streak, too, winning $100, $200 and $10,000 on different 50 Years! instant tickets.\nThe loyal player caught the big prize when he visited Dash In at 7201 Main Street in Willards on Thursday, Feb. 1.

    "content": "Maryland Democrats try to cap live-event ticket prices\n\n February 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANGELIQUE GINGRAS Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 806\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — State lawmakers are proposing legislation that cracks down on ticket scalping in Maryland, hoping to stop unfair ticket prices and bad actors in the resale market.Sen. Dawn Gile (D-Anne Arundel) and fellow Democrats in both chambers are pushing this ticketing reform bill, inspired by the overwhelming demand for artists like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé and by the scalpers who in recent months have preyed on their fans.\n\"We really believe that, you know, entertainment tickets are not real estate, stocks, other commodities,\" said Gile. \"They should be for fans to see the show, and so this bill would get to the heart of the scalping issue by eliminating the incentive to scalp in the first place.\"\nBut critics are concerned about some parts of the bill they say won't protect consumers — and may even encourage monopoly. The proposed changes might limit a consumer's choice on where to purchase tickets, they say, and threaten healthy competition in the market.\nThe debate comes amid a rise in online ticket scalping. Swift fans came to know the problem all too well in 2022 when an unprecedented number of buyers tried to score tickets to her \"Eras Tour\" on Ticketmaster. Also flooded with resellers and ticket scalpers, the site crashed, leaving fans with less than a love story.\nThat fiasco triggered interest in Congress, still considering legislation aimed at rebuilding trust in the ticket industry. Lawmakers are trying to increase transparency in ticket sales and protect consumers from overpriced tickets with harsher penalties on scalpers. According to Live Nation Entertainment, Ticketmaster's parent company, Maryland is one of 12 states that have passed laws or are considering legislation to protect resale.\nThe fiasco also inspired Gile's bill in the Maryland General Assembly last year, which focused on restricting resale, but Gile withdrew the bill after small concert venues complained that it didn't do enough to address the scalping issue.\nNow, Gile and Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), chair of the Economic Matters Committee, are taking another stab at the problem.\nThey will focus on three things: requiring the full ticket price to be disclosed at every step of the transaction; banning so-called \"speculative ticket\" sales, so third-party vendors can't sell tickets they don't have in hand yet; and capping the secondary market, so that a ticket can't be resold for an amount more than its face value.\nThis new approach has the backing of at least one major venue in the state.\n\"This bill would make Maryland the premier state for protecting consumers and the ticket buying experience,\" said Tom Coale, a lobbyist for It's My Amphitheater, which operates on behalf of Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia.\nHe added: \"It takes on all of the worst practices, ticket scalpers, it addresses speculative tickets, it addresses the upselling of these tickets, and that shows just the level of deliberation and research that Senator Gile and Chair Wilson put into this bill.\"\nWhile there is general support for increasing transparency in ticket sales, critics are concerned with other parts of the bill.\nDana McLean, executive director of the Coalition for Ticket Fairness, said her organization represents small business in the ticket resale industry as well as fans and season ticket holders. She told Capital News Service that \"spec ticketing\" has a negative connotation in the industry, but that responsible resellers are actually good for the fans.\n\"The term spec ticketing now is synonymous with people not actually getting the tickets that they paid for because somebody can't come through and actually deliver that,\" said McLean. \"When it's done the right way and done by the people who should be doing it … It's actually really beneficial to the customer. It gives them more options.\"\nWhile Gile's proposed legislation doesn't define speculative ticketing either way, it does say that any tickets sold in the secondary market should be capped at their initial price. CTF calls this an anti-consumer practice.\n\"When you have a closed market, when you restrict resale, it restricts competition and consumer choice from entering into a market and it gives more power to monopoly,\" said McLean.\nCloser to home, the House Republican Caucus has similar concerns about consumers not being able to freely sell tickets they purchased.\nHouse Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) said if \"regular people resell tickets to sporting events or concerts that they've purchased fairly and honestly they can't attend, and now they want to sell their tickets and there's a hot commodity for it, I don't want to in any way prohibit them from being able to engage in those transactions.\"\nStill, Buckel said, if \"there's a very organized, technological effort to basically control the ticket site, and groups come in and purchase almost all of the tickets within minutes, and then create a secondary market where they gouge folks for what the face value of the tickets are … that's a different set of facts. I'm certainly open to applying limitations.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Maryland charter boat and commercial fishermen air grievances about rockfish limits\n\n February 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly | Section: Local News \n \n 1538\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Charter boat operators were joined by commercial fishermen Saturday, Feb. 17, to air grievances about proposed restrictions on catching Atlantic striped bass in the Chesapeake Bay.About 75 people, including Mid-Shore political leaders and 1st District congressional candidate Chris Bruneau, attended the afternoon forum hosted by Delmarva Fisheries Association and the Maryland Charter Boat Association at the Talbot County Community Center.\nAttending the 1 p.m. forum, were Maryland Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico); Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico); Kent County Commission President Ron Fithian and Kent County Economic and Tourism Development Director Jamie Williams.\nAt issue is the economic impact the restrictions will have on the charter boat industry and the ripple effect among related businesses if the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission get their way, panelists said.\n\"We've got to put a stop to this,\" said Fisheries Association Chairman Robert Newberry.\nNewberry was part the panel explaining the issue and proposing solutions, along with Capt. Brian Hardman, president of the Maryland Charter Boat Association; Capt. Ken Jeffries, vice president of the Upper Bay Charter Captains Association; commercial waterman Brian Nesspor of Rock Hall; attorney James Butera of Meeks, Butera & Israel in Washington, D.C.; and David Reel of Quantum Communications.\nAn emergency action enacted in 2023 by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission restricting the size and number of rockfish — as striped bass are known locally — that can be caught by recreational anglers. That emergency action was extended in January 2024 for implementation May 1.\nAlthough charter boats operate for profit, they fall under the recreational fishing designation.\nThe commission's action \"was approved to reduce fishing mortality in 2024 and support stock rebuilding,\" according to its website.\nASMFC \"has served as a deliberative body of the Atlantic coastal states, coordinating the conservation and management of 27 nearshore fish species,\" according to Asmfc.org, Three commissioners from each state serve on the commission, along with other representatives. Each of the 15 states from Maine to Florida has one vote.\nMaryland commissioners are Lynn Waller Fegley, DNR director of fishing and boating services, whose ongoing proxy is Michael Luisi, DNR director of the monitoring and assessment division; Russell Dize of Tilghman, vice president of the Maryland Watermen's Association, whose proxy is Robert Brown, president of the Maryland Watermen's Association; and Del. Dana Stein (D-11B), whose proxy is David Sikorski, executive director of Coastal Conservation Association Maryland.\n\"I can't believe that ... other states can dictate how a business is run in the state of Maryland, and how they can create financial havoc on a business in the state of Maryland,\" Hardman said.\n\"They're Godzilla,\" Newberry said.\nStates must submit implementation plans by March 1 for Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission board review and approval.\nThe commission's 19-inch to 24-inch slot limit, one-fish bag limit, is too restrictive, and the economic impact will have far-reaching effects, forum participants said.\nPUSHING BACK\n\"The bottom line is they want to address the overfishing in the Chesapeake Bay and the coasts of striped bass by … recreational fishermen,\" Newberry said. \"They said commercial (fishing) is not the problem.\"\nHowever, along with maintaining the 2022 striped bass season dates, Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission measures toward \"stock rebuilding\" will reduce commercial quotas by 7% in both the ocean and the Chesapeake Bay.\nOn Feb. 9, DNR announced striped bass emergency regulations \"to bolster the species\" spawning population were \"effective immediately.\" The regulations were approved by the Maryland General Assembly's Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive, and Legislative Review. The regulation aligns with the commission's plan.\n\"Maryland is considering establishing these new rules permanently,\" the DNR press release stated. The department encourages anglers to instead pursue invasive species, such as blue catfish and snakeheads to contribute to \"a healthier ecosystem in the Bay.\"\nCharter boat operations are still recovering from pandemic-related restrictions, as well as marinas, bait and tackle shops, restaurants and hotels, which would be \"decimated\" by the restriction, Hardman said.\n\"These businesses are saying, 'If you guys are gonna have a 30, 40, 50% decrease, so are we because we depend on that summer business' — kind of like Ocean City,\" Hardman said. \"So, it's gonna have a huge impact far beyond the charter boats.\"\nHe said charter boats were \"hammered\" during COVID-19, but inflation also is taking its toll.\n\"People can't afford to go fishing, so we take a hit on that. Maybe they've got to make a choice between going fishing for two fish or groceries. If it's one fish, that (choice) has already been made for them. So we're getting hit on a lot of fronts.\"\n\"I explained (to DNR) it's not because there's not any fish out there,\" Hardman said. \"Sometimes it's an environmental thing, but mostly it's what's going on in economy.\"\nAPPEAL FOR SUPPORT\nHardman said 377 charter boats are registered with the Chesapeake Bay FACT electronic reporting system.\nCharter boats are often booked the year before with clients' paying deposits, Hardman said. Restricting the limit from two to one fish with size restrictions for each client gives clients second thoughts about chartering a fishing expedition.\nIt also creates a conundrum for charter boat captains.\n\"You can catch (one rockfish) in half an hour,\" Jeffries said. At that point, the captains move on to catch perch, catfish or other species. If a rockfish gets on the line, it's thrown back. Captains are required to report statistics electronically through the whole fishing cycle. Charter boat catches are measured in number of fish, but commercial fishermen's catches are measured in pounds.\nBoth Bay charter boat operators and commercial fishermen say they are disproportionately blamed for \"dead discharges\" resulting from catching and releasing striped bass.\n\"ASMFC has this big saying: A dead fish is a dead fish,\" Newberry said.\nNesspor said he's argued with DNR officials \"till I'm blue in the face.\"\n\"A dead fish is not a dead fish,\" he said. \"A dead fish comes up on my beach for the buzzards and an occasional eagle. Mine gets a tag in his mouth and eight people make money off of it after it leaves my hands.\"\n\"This is DNR and ASMFC's great idea of how to save these fish, putting a burden on the charter boats. They caught 100,000 fish last year; they're saving 50,000 fish — that's it,\" Newberry said. \"All this and your financial difficulties is for 50,000 fish. You probably find that, when boat traffic's busy on the Fourth of July, about 100,000 are killed a day with all the boats going up and down the Bay.\"\nForum speakers thanked local legislators for pushing back against DNR, but consistently pointed fingers at environmental groups, DNR, ASMFC and Gov. Moore for their predicament. \"They ganged up on us,\" Jeffries said.\n\"Give us our own quota like the commercial guys,\" Hardman said. \"We are a commercial entity; give us our own quota and then leave us alone. If we fish it out, that's our problem.\"\nCommercial fishermen must also take a hit, adding a cumulative financial burden that has affected their businesses for the last eight years, Newberry said.\nECONOMIC BOONS\nBoth commercial and recreational industries are economic boons for states.\nAccording to ASMFC, \"In 2016, marine commercial and recreational fisheries generated approximately 1.7 million jobs in the U.S. economy. In addition, commercial and recreational fishing combined generated $212.2 billion in sales impacts, $64.2 billion in income impacts, and $99.5 billion in value-added impacts throughout the economy. Further, more than 90 percent of the Atlantic coast recreational catch is taken in state waters, with many of the most prominent species, such as Atlantic striped bass, summer flounder and red drum, moving through multiple jurisdictions.\"\nNewberry has another concern. \"Out of the 34 species that ASMFC manages, there is only one species that does not have what they call conservation equivalency. Whales even have conservation equivalences, (but) not the striped bass, so they can overregulate it,\" Newberry said.\n\"This has got to stop and … we've got to explore all avenues,\" including protesting in Annapolis and \"telling the governor, 'Do the right thing, be a man of your word … don't leave us behind.' He's not leaving just the charter boats and the commercial guys in the dirt, he's leaving restaurant owners, marina owners, tackle shops …\"\n\"When you look at the voting record on the ASMFC, every single state from Maine to Florida … goes to bat for their fishermen except one state — Maryland,\" Newberry said. \"Our state does not, our legislators do not support the fishermen.\"\nASMFC oversees compliance with the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act of 1984. \"(A)ll Atlantic coast states that are included in a commission fishery management plan must implement required conservation provisions of the plan or the secretary of Commerce (and the Interior in the case of striped bass) may impose a moratorium for fishing in the noncompliant state's waters,\" according to the organization's website.\nNewberry suggested organizing a protest in Annapolis, strategically \"going out of compliance\" as other states have done and possibly taking legal action in federal court.\n\"I'm tired of people telling us how we have to work, when we have to work,\" Newberry said. \"The bottom line is no one holds a gun to our head to go to work. We go to work because we love the Bay, and we love what the Bay gives us, and that is a living for our families. So, this has got to stop.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Together with their daughter Quin Warner and son-in-law Andy Warner, they transformed the hotel into a thriving family business venture.\n\"Well, we don't know how to have dinner together and not talk about work. But it's enjoyable,\" Quin Warner said. \"We all have the same vision… we're fully ingrained. We love it. And we have ideas, and it's just how we're going to execute these ideas. We all balance each other out, too.\"\nQuin Warner functions as business manager, and Andy Warner acts as general manager. Together, they balance all the weddings and significant events that keep the hotel booked.\nThe recently renovated Oaks Hotel dates back to the 17th Century. The entire plot consisted of 740 acres, and over the years, the property transformed into a premier waterfront venue for wedding receptions.\nIncluded in the renovation were interior and exterior changes to the main building. An additional four cottages were built on the property, and over 200 mature trees were planted.\nBut most importantly, the hotel's owners said, they sought ways to improve accessibility. Scott Wagner explained that they wanted to provide ways for potential grandparents to enjoy the weddings and family reunions often booked on the property.\nThey installed an elevator, created accessible handicap rooms and renovated the dock to make it easier to use for everyone.\nTracy Wagner describes the vision for the hotel as being comfortable and a fun place to welcome guests and locals alike.\nAndy Warner said the community has embraced them, and they have enjoyed hosting events for locals, including holding Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, hosting burger nights and galas, and opening the restaurant and bar to locals on Wednesday and Thursday nights.\n\"We have the best burgers in town, by the way,\" Andy Warner said, beaming with pride.\nLast December, they hosted a Christmas party of between 350 and 400 people. Scott Wagner described the experience as akin to a reunion. Contractors, families, friends and people from every walk of life joined in the fun.\nOverall, the owners look forward to having guests discover the beauty of the Eastern Shore. Whether walking through St. Michaels and Oxford or biking through nature, there's something for everyone, they said.\n\"We've done this for you. We've done this for Talbot County,\" Tracy said. \"We've done this for the brides, for the parents of the bride. And we are proud of this. And we are proud that we've had this opportunity to bring this to Talbot County and to keep this historical place. We've given it a whole new life.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Income tax hike unlikely in Maryland, this year\n\n February 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LYDIA HURLEY Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1015\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Some Democratic lawmakers in Maryland are proposing a set of income tax hikes this year, but even bill sponsors have admitted that getting their colleagues on board will likely be a long-haul effort.The lawmakers aim to address a looming state budget deficit with a bill that would raise an estimated $1.6 billion per year for the state's general fund once it's fully phased in, supporters say.\nSupporting lawmakers want to start to build the case for a restructuring of the tax system, even if the initiative doesn't seem likely to pass this session, Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore), the sponsor of the Senate bill, said.\n\"I'm under no illusion that the bill is going to pass this year,\" Hettleman said, laughing. \"However, there are important policy issues that as a legislature we need to be considering as we're trying to figure out how we're going to pay for the services Marylanders value and need.\"\nThe sponsoring lawmakers hope to shift more of the tax burden from working families onto high-income earners and corporations, while relying on tax credits to assist in closing the income gap. Other states are making similar moves. Massachusetts passed a law in 2022 that requires a 4 percent income tax on those who earn more than $1 million annually.\nAdvocates for businesses are worried that the bill would threaten corporations and small businesses and might even deter them from operating in Maryland.\nAside from the bill sponsors, though, most Maryland officials are not jumping at the chance to raise taxes this election year. Democratic Gov. Wes Moore introduced a 2025 fiscal year budget that is balanced without any tax increases. This is despite the fact that the state is projected to face a deficit of $1.8 billion in 2028 if it doesn't dramatically change its spending and revenue habits.\nThe deficit might threaten Maryland's ability to keep some of its most important state programs adequately funded, advocates say.\n\"We see looming holes in the budget that need to be dealt with. Otherwise, we're going to have to start cutting things,\" Del. Julie Palakovich Carr (D-Montgomery), the sponsor of the House bill, said.\nHealth care, education and transportation all depend on state funding, said Kali Schumitz of the Maryland Center on Economic Policy. The budget deficit might inhibit the state's ability to keep money flowing toward these initiatives, Schumitz said.\nThe revenue raised by the bill, known as the Fair Share Maryland for Act of 2024, aims to address these concerns. A major goal of the bill is to increase income taxes for Marylanders who earn more than $250,000 a year.\nThe bill would also reduce taxes for lower-income earners by expanding Maryland's Child Tax Credit, Schumitz added. The additional funds would make more people eligible for the tax credit by increasing the maximum earning level allowed.\n\"This would increase the number of kids benefitting from the credit, which is a really powerful anti-poverty tool,\" Schumitz said.\nChild tax credits would assist working families, bringing economic relief to those who need it most, said Terry Cavanagh from SEIU 500, a public sector workers union, told lawmakers in the Senate bill hearing on Wednesday.\nThe increased income taxes would go toward the state's general fund, and lawmakers can use their discretion to decide where the funding should go, said Palakovich Carr.\nEconomic justice advocates are urging lawmakers to consider using the revenue on education. If not, schools could be left severely underfunded, said Shamoyia Gardiner, Executive Director of Strong Schools Maryland, a grassroots educational organization. A similar fate is possible for the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, an initiative that is fully funded only for the next couple of years, Gardiner added.\nOther advocates think lawmakers should use it to support housing affordability and assistance, as these initiatives go hand-in-hand with education, Schumitz said. \"There's an increasing recognition that all these things are interconnected,\" Schumitz added.\nThe bottom line for some lawmakers is that, regardless of where funds may be used, the tax system is in need of a restructuring.\n\"Our tax system is upside down. The wealthiest 1 percent of Marylanders, people making over $700,300 a year, pay a smaller share of their income in state and local taxes than people in any other income group,\" Schumitz said.\nThe bill is a way to \"check and rebalance the fairness\" of Maryland's tax system and re-evaluate funding state programs, Hettleman said.\nUnlike in some other states, this initiative has not been labeled a millionaires tax because the tax increase would impact some high earners who make less than $1 million.\nThe impact on tax rates wouldn't be as drastic as it seems, some advocates say. \"More people are actually getting a tax cut than a tax increase under this bill,\" Christopher Meyer, a research analyst at the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, said.\nThe bill also aims to close corporate tax loopholes that allow big corporations to file taxes in places that don't charge a corporate income tax, avoiding paying the income taxes they owe in Maryland, Schumitz said.\nThe legislation would address this by requiring parent corporations to file a combined tax return, reflecting the income of all its subsidiaries as one entity for tax purposes.\nHowever, opponents of this bill raised concerns about the use of this so-called \"combined reporting.\"\n\"There is no guarantee that mandatory worldwide combined reporting would actually increase state revenues, and certainly would not create a stable revenue stream,\" Leonore Heavey, a senior tax counsel with the Council On State Taxation, told lawmakers in the Senate bill hearing.\nOther opponents were concerned that enforcing combined reporting would discourage small businesses from continuing to operate in Maryland.\n\"You're looking at tax policy that discourages entrepreneurship and the expansion and even creation of small businesses here in Maryland,\" said Mike O'Halloran, the Maryland State Director of the National Federation of Independent Business.\n\"The state is facing a lot of fiscal issues,\" O'Halloran said. \"There are a lot of priorities that this administration and the prior administration laid out, that you all are now having to deal with how we pay for it. So it might be better for the body to pursue this than a roughly $1 billion tax hike over the next few years.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This important legislation, sponsored by Del. Marlon Amprey, would permit beer and wine to be sold in Maryland grocery stores.Based on my own experience as a 20-year resident of Talbot County — the one jurisdiction where this is actually legal — we can safety conclude there are two things this bill would do and three things it would not.\nIt will provide immeasurable convenience for consumers who lead increasingly hectic lives, which is why more than 80 percent of Marylanders support it.It will provide much-needed economic sustenance for grocery stores that provide good-paying jobs, reinvest in our state's economy and are now fighting to stave off the threat posed by online retailers.It will not put the local, independent retailers — colloquially known as the \"mom and pops\" — out of business. Experience here and elsewhere has confirmed that the big box retailers tend to stock the most popular, mass-produced products and leave it to the local package stores to sell craft beer, boutique wines and locally sourced products. Furthermore, our package stores will still have exclusive domain over the sale of distilled spirits. Finally, the \"mom and pops\" offer a level of customer service and subject matter expertise that the grocery stores just cannot match.It would not increase underage consumption of alcohol. In more than two decades of shopping in Talbot County grocery stores, not once have I witnessed an adolescent or teen try to sneak out of Aisle 9 with ill-gained IPAs or Merlots. In fact, one can argue that grocery stores — equipped as they are with multiple cameras, secured storefront doors and other theft prevention devices — are better suited to prevent unauthorized access and theft than the independent stores.Finally, this will not lead to alcoholism, substance abuse, vehicle fatalities and other dire outcomes cited by the Annapolis lobbyists who are hired to kill this bill every year. Their hypothetical scenarios and apocryphal anecdotes are simply not reflected in the data.\nForty-seven other states already have this measure in place. It's time that Maryland join the 21st century and pass this bill into law. Consumers win and our state's economy will be stronger as a result.\nLEN FOXWELL\nBaltimore \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Truth behind utilities' claims\n\n February 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 427\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the corridors of legislative power in Maryland, a bill looms large, bearing the ominous moniker Senate Bill 1/House Bill 267. This legislative concoction threatens to strip away the cherished right of choice from Maryland's electricity and natural gas consumers. The intended consequence? Cementing the dominion of utility monopolies while muffling the voice of the customer.Baltimore Gas and Electric, among others, wields an iron grip over the market, a fact that evokes the ire of many consumers. Despite fervent opposition, BGE's petition for a staggering three-year, $408 million rate hike found favor in December. If permitted, this would culminate in a jaw-dropping 30% monthly rate increase this year. Such unchecked control, it is plain to see, bodes ill for the ratepayers.\nCast your mind back to 1999 when Maryland's lawmakers, in a gesture toward fostering consumer choice, ushered in legislation aimed at broadening the array of electricity options available. Yet, despite the ostensible diversity promised, the tentacles of utility monopolies still ensnare a staggering 80% of residential customers, leaving the notion of choice a mere chimera for many.\nAdvocates of Senate Bill 1/House Bill 267, like former Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, tout its virtues in a recent online news publication, alleging that retail energy suppliers have raked in undue profits at the expense of the consumer. However, this narrative conveniently sidesteps the elephant in the room – the exorbitant profits amassed by utility monopolies, which then find their way into the coffers of organizations like \"Power for Tomorrow,\" serving as a haven for erstwhile regulators and governors in their advocacy pursuits.\nA damning report from the Energy and Policy Institute unmasks the opaque machinations of Power for Tomorrow, revealing its aversion to any attempts at fostering competition in the utility sector. Under the guise of consumer advocacy, this Arlington-based cabal furtively advances the interests of corporate behemoths.\nThe former champion of consumer choice, Gov. Glendening, merits accolades for his role in shepherding the Electric Customer Choice and Competition Act of 1999 into existence. However, his dalliance with Power for Tomorrow warrants scrutiny, exposing the veritable collusion between regulated utility monopolies and those ostensibly tasked with safeguarding consumer interests.\nSB 1 stands poised to usher in a new era of monopoly hegemony under the pretense of consumer protection — a wolf in sheep's clothing if ever there was one. Let it be known: the erosion of the competitive market is no panacea. I urge you to wield your voice and preserve your choice, lest the specter of utility monopolies cast its suffocating shadow over the landscape of consumer rights.\nCLAYTON A.

    "content": "Local cowrites business book based on Ted Lasso\n\n February 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 579\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n GREENSBORO — A local author has co-written an uplifting and humorous business leadership book based on the wisdom of a favorite TV show.\"Ted Lasso,\" a hit AppleTV+ series that ran from 2020 to 2023, caught the attention of two successful software developers, Marnie Stockman, an Greensboro resident, and Nick Coniglio, who lives in Georgia. They loved the show, so they said, \"Let's write a book.\"\nStockman and Coniglio recommend seeing the show before delving into their book, \"Lead It Like Lasso,\" which you can get on Amazon.\nIn the show, a successful American college football coach gets recruited to coach a Premier League soccer team in England. He knows nothing of English culture or the game, but he knows people and how to get the best out of his different players. He knows how to build a cohesive team.\n\"It is a feel good, fish out of water story where you are rooting for kind of everybody,\" she said.\nThe book focuses on five characters from the show as archetypes of leadership. Sam is the \"optimistic achiever.\" Roy is a \"tough love mentor.\" Keeley is \"the supportive collaborator.\" Rebecca is \"the visionary transformer.\"\nPeople have read the book and were surprised to find themselves a \"Roy/Keeley\" or another mixture, the authors said.\n\"We don't need a whole Earth of Teds. It takes everybody including the Diamond Dogs,\" Stockman said.\nDiamond Dogs, who play a comic role in the show, are depicted in the book as friends who both support you and tell you the truth. They hold you accountable.\nBoth Stockman and Coniglio have had experience leading and being lead in corporate settings, and one of the points they emphasize in their book is that anyone can be an effective leader. Mothers, small business owners, college kids and nonprofits can all learn from the different leadership styles portrayed by characters in Ted Lasso.\n\"Leadership is life. We believe everyone is a leader,\" Stockman said.\nStockman and Coniglio's company got acquired three times, and each time they were given more responsibility and less resources to succeed, they said. This frustrated them. They wanted to think of building something they believed in.\nTed Lasso came out as they began building their company, Lifecyle Insights.\n\"We built a platform on that right as Ted Lasso started,\" Coniglio said.\nHe told Stockman, \"You are Ted Lasso, and you need to watch this show. I saw her positivity, optimism and kindness. It is really tied to his belief in people and inspiring people. And his relentless commitment to insure that people work to achieve the best versions of themselves,\" he said.\nShe liked it and agreed to work on the book.\n\"If we hooked it to what folks love about Ted Lasso and paralleled his leadership principles with our leadership framework and told stories about both, that might just do it. So that is the book we wrote,\" Stockman said.\nA lot of leadership books emphasize vision. This book is more about core values.\n\"Two of our core values — one was raving fans and one was transparency. Focusing on doing the right thing for our customers created raving fans,\" she said. \"So they ended up doing the sales for us. And the transparency piece is when the site went down once, I immediately sent out a note saying, 'The site is down. I will be back in an hour, and we are working to resolve it.' They were super appreciative that we were open with them.\"\nSince the book first published in November, Stockman and Coniglio have sold 4,000 copies. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Best places in America for remote workers: Colorado, Florida, Oregon, North Carolina do well\n\n February 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG Newspapers | Section: National \n \n 529\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Colorado, Florida, North Carolina and Oregon — and a number of college towns — are the best places in the U.S. for remote workers.That is according to a new analysis.\nDesignRush — a Miami-based B2B consulting firm — looked at factors such as housing costs, broadband connections, costs for internet and phone services, commute times. and current numbers of remote workers.\nThe group used U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Communications Commission numbers for come up with the rankings.\nBoulder, Colorado tops the list.\n\"Boulder's high suitability comes from a high percentage of workers working from home at 20.8%, 114% above the national average of 9.7%, high percentage of households with a broadband subscription at 93.3%, 6.3 percentage points above the national average of 87%, and cheap access to fiber internet,\" the according to the study.\nColorado and the Mountain West are well represented in the list of top remote working locations with Fort Collins, Colorado 7th, Denver 11th and Boise, Idaho 21st.\nRaleigh-Cary, North Carolina is second with 16.3% of local worker doing their jobs from home and 91.6% with broadband internet connections. Durham-Chapel Hill ranks 9th and Charlotte 15th on the list.\nAustin, Texas is third. Bend, Oregon is fourth accompanied by three other Oregon cities including Corvalis 6th, Portland 8th and Eugene 26th.\nPunta Gorda, Florida is fifth on the remote working list.\nAccording to the study, 12% of workers in Punta Gorda (in Southwest Florida) are employed from home and the area has lower average monthly housing costs ($908.50) compared to the national average ($1,203.50).\nFour other Florida cities make the top 30 for remote working:\nTampa-St. Petersburg 12th\nHomosassa Springs, Florida 17th\nNorth Port-Sarasota-Bradenton 24th\nPensacola 29th.\nFlorida's warm weather, population centers and lack of a state income tax make it attractive to remote workers especially from more expensive norhthern and eastern states.\nThe rest of the top 30 includes a number of college towns. Those include Ithaca, New York (10th); Ann Arbor, Michigan (13th), Charlottesville, Virginia (19th) and Bloomington, Indiana (25th).\n\"Remote working has become increasingly viable in recent years due to a combination of faster and more reliable internet connections, changing societal priorities, the changing nature of work, and in some cases necessity, such as during the pandemic,\" said Gianluca Ferruggia, general manager at DesignRush.\nRemote work was prevalent during the coronavirus pandemic and its shutdowns. It has become the norm and expected from workers in fields such as media and communications, professional services, finance as well as law firms and among graphic designers and other creatives.\n\"Many workers now prefer to work from home due to the better work-life balance it can provide, plus it can allow workers to take advantage of higher average salaries that might be paid in other areas than the areas in which they live,\" Ferruggia said.\n\"Businesses also benefit from the increased desirability of remote working, as it allows them the widest talent pool to choose the best candidates for a job. This could be done by hiring workers for remote roles or by outsourcing projects to digital contractors when a full hire might not make financial sense.\"\nOther cities making the list including Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Lawton, Oklahoma; Santa Fe, Mexico; Kingston, New York; Portland, Maine and Minneapolis-St. Paul. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Haven Harbour marina manager talks shop and sails\n\n March 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 874\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Erik Lostrom, manager of Haven Harbour Marina Resorts in Rock Hall, is trying to keep an important industry afloat here.Boat building, boat repair and marina management.\nThe recreational marine industry.\nHe's hoping his new position on the board of directors of the Marine Trade Association of Maryland can help him support the industry that has been in his family for generations.\nTo do this there has to be new blood.\n\"We need to develop the younger generation to get them interested in the business,\" he said.\nHe acknowledged it's an aging trade and noted that schools should do a better job encouraging the industry. Trades, in his opinion, offer better pay starting out and does not come with enormous debt.\nTo get younger people enthused, he spends his time talking to the high schools.\nHe's doing his part to educate at the college level too, teaching a course on Marine Systems two nights a week, where students learn to install, troubleshoot, diagnose and repair marine equipment and systems.\nThe class consists of some late teens but also boat owners who wish to gain knowledge about the hobby they enjoy.\nIn the classroom, his students have the benefit of learning from a man coming from a long line of shipbuilders. His grandfather on his mother's side, Elmer Rosenblad was a master shipbuilder during World War II.\nHis father, Robert F. Lostrom built wooden boats as well.\nHe carries on that tradition, working in naval architecture and boat building before settling into boat repair.\n\"It's in my blood I guess. I've built 15 types of wooden boats.\"\nBeing born on the Jersey shore was an ideal place to learn those skills. After high school, Lostrom pursued his passion in Kennebunkport, Maine, the location of the infamous Bush compound. In Kennebunkport, at the Landing School Lostrom spent two years of intensive study being instructed on wooden boat building and yacht design.\nGraduating in 1989, he found a way to ply his trade, in Philadelphia at the Independence Seaport Museum.\nHis marine versatility grabbed the attention of Kent County residents, the Johnson family in Quaker Neck. They owned a log canoe that was built in 1890, they wanted restored. After several months, working with a crew, Lostrom completed the job.\nHe remarked it was so efficient it started winning races.\nOver a summer watching the log canoe compete, soaking in the sights and sounds on the Chesapeake Bay, Lostrom said he fell in love with Kent County. He found a job at Higgins Yacht Yard in Saint Michaels around 1995 and has lived on the Eastern Shore ever since.\nWith forty years experience he's a good candidate to keep our elected officials informed about the issues of the business.\nHe was nominated to the board the Marine Trade Association of Maryland board in December.\nA group that consists of marina owners, boat builders and boat suppliers, they lobby with the state on regulations to support the marinas. Lostrom will be helping in the area of workplace development.\nThey'll be addressing all the changes in the industry. An industry, he said which is a luxury business.\nLostrom further described it as a \"sunset dream industry.\"\n\"The people who sail, have a dream view in mind, of having a cocktail and cruising on their boat,\" he added.\nThe business may be luxury, but it is also vital to the economy on the Bay.\nAccording to John Stefancik, executive director of Marine Trades Association of Maryland, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting the recreational marine industry, the annual economic impact to Maryland is $4.2 billion. He estimated that in Kent County that could be tens of millions.\nWith approximately 350 marinas in the state and only 1100 workers, Lostrom sees the challenges ahead.\nThere is lack of experienced skilled trade labor to service customer vessels in a timely manner.\nHe said, \"The customer base has become more 'turnkey' type users putting more demand on skilled labor to keep vessels operating.\"\nFor instance, vacationers might have two weeks to get their yacht in the water. If it's still in the shop for repairs, and the boats are backed up, they might decide to sell it and stop living that specific dream.\nA dream doesn't have to be limited to the boat owners either.\nIt could also be a dream for a lot of young men and women on the Shore, who hunt, fish, boat and love the outdoors.\nA career outside of a cubicle.\nThere is a need for workers, Lostrom said. All marine trades are needed, from mechanics, marine plumbing to administrative work.\nWith a salary range starting at $40,000 that can go upward to $200,000, it could be a good option.\nLostrom pointed to one local success story, a life long employee of his. Under Lostrom, the employee learned about working with wood, received tips on proper use of tools and was instructed on fiberglass repair, engine mechanics and proper maintenance.\nAnd he's doing it where he loves, working outside around the boating environment. And at Haven Harbour, a business that Stefancik indicated is one of the largest marinas in the state.\nBetween balancing the responsibilities of his marina, Lostrom will be lobbying across the state, passionate over his newfound responsibilities.\n\"I want people who read this to know that this is a professional career. A trade that should be treated as such.\"\nIn April, Lostrom will be conducting a career fair; the exact date to be determined later. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There were milestone awards, business awards and other recognitions.\nPhotographers popped flashes as each winner finished their speech and brought their team up to stand in front of room. The crowd cheered for each award acceptance.\n\"We have 23 awards to be presented. This whole evening is just about celebration.

    "content": "Down payment grants awarded by Mid-Shore Board of Realtors\n\n March 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mid-Shore Board of Realtors | Section: Real Estate \n \n 460\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — In less than one-year, the Mid-Shore Board of Realtors Love Down Payment Grant program has distributed 15 $1,000 grants to new homeowners in the five-county area the board serves.\"The first down payment grant was awarded in May 2023, and we have had a grant distribution almost every month since then,\" said Shelby Roney, president of Mid-Shore Board of Realtors. \"It is such a needed program. With home prices being high and interest rates around 7%, these $1,000 grants really help.\"\nThe 15th grant went to Madison Loker, the emergency management coordinator with Talbot County, who is a first-time homeowner.\nLoker combined the Mid-Shore Board of Realtors grant with another grant from the county. This is another advantage of the MSBR program, noted Roney. It can be combined with other grants and programs.\nTom Draper, branch manager with First Home Mortgage, said, \"When I met with Madison and reviewed her application, I recommended she apply for the MSBR Love Down Payment Grant. The application process is very simple and streamlined. Once the application was complete it was submitted to the grant committee who expeditiously reviewed the application and awarded her the grant. It took less than a week to be approved for the funds.\"\nThe first recipients of the Mid-Shore LOVE Down Payment Grant were Melissa Crews and Liam Mayo, who purchased a house in Hurlock, and they said having the extra funds helped them make repairs and paint.\nThe $1,000 grant does not have to be repaid and gives homeowners extra cash to fix the house up and make it their own. Crews and Mayo were grateful to Mid-Shore Board of Realtors, saying every dollar saved really helps.\nThe grants have benefited a police officer, a school bus driver, and administrative and trades employees. Of the 15 grants, five have gone to new homeowners in Dorchester County, four in Caroline County, and three to both Queen Anne's and Talbot Counties.\nMid-Shore LOVE Down Payment grant is for those working and also buying a primary residence in Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's or Talbot counties. The income limit is based on the USDA amounts. The applicant's buyer's agent or the seller's agent must be a Realtor with MSBR. Additional information can be found on the Mid-Shore Board website at midshoreboardofrealtors.com.\nTo continue providing grants, Mid-Shore Board of Realtors is holding a golf tournament fundraiser on Tuesday, May 14, at Hog Neck Golf Course in Easton.\nRegistration is at 8 a.m. and tee off time is 9 a.m. Diemon's BBQ will be providing lunch, and participants can enter to win raffle prizes or the 50/50.\n\"We are excited to hold this spring fundraiser and are actively seeking golfers and sponsors so MSBR can provide additional grants to even more homeowners,\" Roney said.\nTo sponsor or register to play, visit midshoreboardofrealtors.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A business built on kindness\n\n March 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Business \n \n 662\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Araceli Castillo, owner of Castillo's Cleaning, has built a business based on the kindness she receives from her clients. Castillo said that the community of Oxford motivated her to begin her own business and build a better future for her daughters.Originally from Puebla, Mexico, Castillo said the poverty of her hometown made it difficult for her family to sustain themselves. She came to the Eastern Shore with her husband and three daughters 15 years ago. Everything about the experience was challenging, Castillo said.\nShe didn't know the language, didn't know how to drive and had difficulties getting accustomed to the culture of her area.\n\"It wasn't easy to start new,\" Castillo said. \"If you don't have family in the area, it's hard to find a place to live, and it's hard to find work.\"\nYet, she said, the kindness she experienced living in Oxford pushed her to where she is now. Castillo is a business owner who provides for her family and is a gracious member of the Eastern Shore community.\nThe first act of kindness she received was when she was hired to clean a woman's house, and she gifted Castillo a vacuum cleaner. Owning her own equipment gave her independence and the possibility of doing better work and earning more money.\nCastillo laughs when she remembers how she would carry that vacuum from job to job because she couldn't drive.\nMany clients would pick her up from her home and drop her off. Those were kindnesses she appreciated daily. When there wasn't a client to do so, Castillo would walk home or wait until evening for her husband to finish work to come pick her up.\nShe said she remembers one client fondly. After finishing cleaning a woman's house, the client was so impressed that she made a deal with Castillo: \"Get a business license, and I will give you a car.\"\n\"That was the best experience for me,\" Castillo said. \"There are good people, there are people who notice when you work hard and appreciate seeing your efforts and your potential.\"\nThat same client gave Castillo advice: \"Clean my house the same way you would clean your own. Clean it the way you want someone to care for your home.\"\nCastillo said she carries that advice with her in every home she cleans.\n\"I clean with love and care,\" Castillo said. \"I think that you need to love your job to have results that you would be proud of because if you don't have love in your work, it shows. When I leave a home, I leave with the satisfaction that I left the place the best way I possibly could and leave it in the most impeccable shape possible, so my client could feel it too.\"\nThe kindness continued to pour in for Castillo and her family.\nClients would refer their friends and family to her business, and at one point, a client rented out an apartment to her family so they could live more comfortably.\nAt the time, Castillo and her family lived in one room of a home they shared with many other people. Their new home allowed each of their daughters to have their own room, and they stayed there until they could buy a home of their own.\nCastillo's daughter, Leslie Rodriguez Castillo, works managing the business. She said she has been helping her mother with her business since she was a child. Rodriguez Castillo handles communication between clients, works as a dispatcher, creates schedules and handles billing and invoices.\n\"Seeing where she is right now, I always look back, and I'm so grateful for how motivated she's been throughout the years,\" Leslie Rodriguez Castillo said. \"She has learned a lot, and I have learned a lot through her clients and through her.\"\nCastillo continues to work hard every day and is grateful for the blessings in her life.\n\"My life changed when I moved to the United States,\" Castillo said. \"If you have drive and work hard to move forward, then it's possible to accomplish anything. It's the American dream.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Chesapeake Bloom: Healing and building through flowers\n\n March 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 575\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On Friday evening, Dede Hoopes, owner of Chesapeake Bloom, a full-service floral design studio in historic downtown Easton, hosted a flower bar.The shop welcomed residents to come by and learn how to build bouquets to celebrate International Women's Day.\nWomen poured in with friends, mothers and sisters. Each had a vase in hand and carefully reviewed the bundles of flowers they had to create their bouquets.\nHoopes said gardening and flowers have healed and changed her life. She seeks to bring that same joy to the people of the Eastern Shore.\nThis was not where she thought her life was heading. In 2015, Hoopes had a career in human resources. Due to health challenges, she turned to gardening and flowers to help her heal.\nShe decided that she wanted to be a flower farmer, and she shared her dream with her family.\n\"It seemed far-fetched at the time, but it was my husband who said I should follow my dreams — he was all in,\" Hoopes said. \"We moved and built our flower farm in Oxford. My daughters asked me why I didn't do this when they were younger. They were so excited.\"\nShe left her career in human resources. The Hoopes built a house on a quarter acre dedicated to her flower farm, which she named Oopsy Daisy Farm.\nThrough her interest in flowers, she met Samantha McCall, a fellow garden enthusiast, floral designer and her soon-to-be business partner and dear friend. They began sharing their dreams of opening their shop and made moves to make it happen. Hoopes said it happened quickly. It was an idea in December, and by March, they were in business.\nTogether, they shared their love for fresh, local and specialty flowers with the Eastern Shore. Their business grew, and even through the pandemic, they adapted by delivering hand-tied bouquets curbside to customers and avoided supply chain issues by growing local flowers.\nDue to health issues, McCall had to step away from the business in 2021. McCall and Hoopes remain best friends and are a support system for each other.\nToday, Chesapeake Bloom is in its fifth year of thriving. Hoopes said Chesapeake Bloom is an all-women business operated by five flower enthusiasts.\n\"I feel lucky to work with such motivated, smart and hardworking ladies here,\" said Madeline Poe, floral designer for Chesapeake Bloom. \"We have a great team. … This job really has been a blessing because this is where I feel at home.\"\nDuring the flower bar on Friday, Poe guided attendees to create unique and beautiful bouquets. Working alongside Pam Keeton, co-worker and master gardener, they trimmed and cut fresh flowers for attendees.\n\"It's a cheerful place,\" Keeton said. \"It's a great way to meet like-minded people. We all like to garden. Most of us are into conservation and horticulture.\"\nHoopes said she is proud of her team and business and believes that if women want to open their own businesses, they should do so with faith in themselves. Hoopes said that women tend to be hesitant to take on challenges or changes, but if they don't try, they will never succeed.\n\"This is a second act for me, and I absolutely love it,\" Hoopes said. \"I have two daughters, and if I could tell them to do it, I would say to do it. I would say go have your own business because I love it. It challenges you every day, every aspect of it at the same time. I don't think I would do anything different.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "date": "2024-03-17",
    "author": "DAVID REEL",
    "content": "No consensus on dealing with projected deficit\n\n March 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 869\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last November, progressives in Maryland were thrilled when Democratic candidate Wes Moore was elected governor in a landslide after defeating nine much more well-known opponents in a Democratic primary. They were even more thrilled when progressive Democratic candidates were elected to replace moderate Democratic members and Republican members in the Maryland House of Delegates and the Maryland Senate.Those elections further solidified the Democratic veto- proof supermajorities in both houses of the General Assembly.\nGoing into the 2014 General Assembly session, progressives seemed to be large and in charge. They looked forward to further advancing their progressive public policy agenda.\nAs the 90-day session begins to wind down, that has not been the case, especially on tax and budget matters. It is increasingly clear the Democratic supermajorities are not monolithic, nor is the governor fully embracing an aggressive progressive tax and budget agenda.\nThis outcome was not expected when Gov. Moore presented his proposed state budget in mid-January. Then there was consensus that a balanced state budget would be easily approved before or by the end of the session as required by the Maryland Constitution.\nRecently that consensus has been shaken to the core based on five consecutive revised State Board of Revenue Estimates projecting state budget deficits will be the largest since the \"Great Recession\" which began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009.\nNext fiscal year, the deficit is projected to reach $1 billion. In fiscal year 2027, the last year of Gov. Moore's first term, it is projected to grow to $1.3 billion. A year later, it is projected to more than double to $3 billion and could be $4 billion the following fiscal year. These projections do not include the impact of funding to address a $3.1 billion deficit in the state Transportation Trust Fund and $8 billion to fully implement the Blueprint for Maryland's Future (The Kirwan Report).\nAs a result, there has been intense and even contentious debate in the Democratic supermajorities on what to do and when to do it. The answer depends on who you ask and where they sit.\nThe Democratic House majority leader, Democratic chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, and the Democratic chair of the House Appropriations Committee, are united in saying the General Assembly needs to raise taxes and needs to raise them now. The Democratic Senate president and Democratic chair of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee are saying not so fast, we do not need to raise taxes in this session.\nGov. Moore agrees with the Senate leader's position, there is no need for tax increases for now. Asked if that position would hold beyond the current year, Moore has said, \"I just know that the bar for raising taxes not just this year, but for every single year for me, it's going to be a very high bar.\"\nHis budget secretary has elaborated on Moore's overall strategy on budgets and taxes going forward by saying, \"These revenue trends continue to underscore the necessity of taking bold steps to improve our economy, create jobs and bring new businesses and population to Maryland.\"\nNo doubt the Moore administration is aware of the results when Maryland Democratic General Assembly supermajorities approved a wide range of tax and fee increases proposed by progressive Democratic Gov. Martin O'Malley. With a \"Change Maryland\" message that resonated with Republican, Democratic and unaffiliated voters, Republican Larry Hogan won two terms as governor and now has an opportunity to be elected to the U.S. Senate.\nAs is almost always the case In Maryland, final decisions over increasing state spending and increasing state taxes and fees will come down to how much and when?\nThe larger question is how Democratic Party control of the state government will be impacted if the current divide between the shrinking moderate wing of the party and the growing progressive wing of the party on budget and tax matters is not resolved.\nOne unforeseen obstacle to resolving this divide are comments made recently by one high profile progressive Democratic county executive and agreed to by another.\nAnne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman said the failure of long-standing progressive \"tax reform\" goals to gain support in the General Assembly is because \"loopholes are everywhere for interests that lobby for loopholes. It's baked into the system. Legislators survive on a diet of campaign contributions to get into office and to stay there. The largest donors tend to be the very interests lobbying for loopholes and opposing a fair distribution of the tax burden.\"\nMontgomery County Executive Marc Elrich agreed with that observation.\nSuch remarks are not going to help advance progressive positions in the General Assembly even when their party has supermajorities.\nGiven all of the above, one can ask if the dynamics in the state legislature may be open to real change. What if Republican members who are accustomed to being largely irrelevant on budget and tax matters in Annapolis, forge a working relationship with moderate Democratic members on issues of common interest such as spending and taxes?\nLikely? No. Probable? No. Possible? Maybe.\nIn politics anything is possible. Ask Larry Hogan and Wes Moore. I suspect both were told early on when they launched their gubernatorial campaigns that winning was not possible.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Senators hear arguments for 32-hour work week\n\n March 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TORRENCE BANKS Capital News Service | Section: Business \n \n 606\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — In 1955, Walter Reuther, head of what was then known as the United Automobile Workers (UAW), told a Senate hearing that coming technological advancements would make a four-day workweek possible.That was the last Senate hearing on the subject for nearly 70 years. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee finally ended the draught Thursday as lawmakers debated legislation, sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) that would reduce the standard workweek to 32 hours without cutting employees' pay.\n\"...Despite an explosion in technology and a massive increase in worker productivity, nothing has changed,\" Sanders said. \"Think about that, huge transitions we have seen in the economy. But in terms of the workweek, nothing has changed.\"\nSanders said that the goal of his bill was to ensure that working-class citizens benefit from the revolutionary changes in the workplace over the past seven decades.\nIntroducing his measure Wednesday, Sanders said that U.S. workers had become over 400% more productive since the 1940s. Even so, people now are working longer hours at lower wages, he said.\nUAW President Shawn Fain said that automation now allows a single worker to do what used to require 12 workers. Companies' obsession with ensuring productivity every second of the day has come at the cost of workers, he said.\n\"When people reach the end of their lives they never say I wish I'd make more money,\" Fain told senators. \"What they wish for is they wish they had more time. There was a time when this phenomenon was supposed to lead to workers getting our time back, getting some of their lives back.\"\nForty percent of Americans work at least 50 hours a week, and 18% of today's workforce works more than 60 hours a week, according to research cited in Sanders' statement.\nA 2019 study published by the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found that working more than 60 hours a week led to a decline in workers' mental health compared to those who worked standard hours.\n\"It causes an increase in cortisol levels, which lead to heart disease, cancers, strokes,\" Fain said about working extended hours during the week. \"But given all those facts as someone is lucky enough to get to retire, typically when they weren't willing to work themselves to death their entire life, they face knee replacements, hip replacements, shoulder surgeries, and the rest of their lives, figuring out how they're going to survive.\"\nBut Liberty Vittert, a data science professor at the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis, said that studies suggesting that working fewer hours leads to happiness are flawed. Vittert said that many of the studies showing an increase in happiness find the effects are short-term and that long-term studies show that happiness does not increase over time.\nIn addition, only companies that can cut out extra meetings and coffee breaks during the day participate in these studies, excluding more than 70% of the U.S. job economy, Vittert said.\n\"If you want to see those same employees really stressed out, just see what happens when their employers lay them off to hire part-time workers instead, or have to close their doors because they cannot make enough revenue,\" Vittert said.\nShe pointed out that older workers who cannot complete the same amount of work in fewer hours are at a disadvantage.\nSen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the ranking Republican on the panel, emphasized that there is no law preventing companies from already enacting a 32-hour workweek and that federal intervention is not necessary.\n\"Let's give flexibility to workers and employers — don't have government come in and intervene,\" said Roger King, senior labor and employment counsel at the HR Policy Association. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He chose veterans Gretchen Gordon and chef Sean Raspberry to help him implement a new menu and oversee renovations in the 16-room inn.\n\"Instead of watching all the cars go across to St. Michaels, we want to watch them coming across to come here, and this will be great for the town,\" Gordon said. \"We will be open seven days a week.\"\nBy early April, the plan is to offer three meals a day.\nThe restaurant is called Financier. The offerings — like crispy ginger fried oysters, lamb sliders and tandoori chicken skewers — let you know this isn't some backwater joint. They want this to be a destination.\nSnyder, who was a history major, read a lot about Robert Morris.\n\"The history of this property is unbelievable,\" Snyder said. \"I still can't believe that I am associated with it.\"\nThe name of the restaurant comes from Morris' role as a financier during the American Revolution. He lived at the inn for three years and was a confidante of George Washington.\nTo capitalize on that notoriaty, Snyder wants to create Robert Morris beer along with bourbon and wine. He is balancing between celebrating what is historic and expanding and reenvisioning what is possible for future growth.\nSome of the entrees speak to the wide-ranging palate of Chef Raspberry, who has cooked at The Inn at Perry Cabin, Out of the Fire and General Tanuki's. Asian-style crispy duck, cornmeal dusted crispy fried whole snapper and chimichurri marinated braised short rib enchalladas all make the choice difficult.\n\"I have been cooking for 40 years,\" Raspberry said. \"(My food says) 'I am here. Come see me.' Me and general manager Gretchen, we were bound to meet, bottom line. It is a match made in heaven. I want to do 150 plates a day.\"\n\"I am excited about the whole menu,\" he said.\nThey have a plan to get into catering. Snyder said he would love to do weddings on site too.\nThe menu at the Inn is \"Southwest meets the Chesapeake Bay,\" Gordon, who used to run Latitude 38 in Oxford and sold it, said. \"This chef's flavors are right up there at the top.\"\nOnce they get that established, they will open for lunch and eventually create a breakfast and coffee bar.\nTheir goal is to convert an outdoor space behind the inn into a beer garden with views of the Strand and the Oxford Ferry. Snyder wants to get permission from the Historic District Commission to make these changes.\nHe employs around 20 people already. He has worked back of the house and front of the house, but his focus will be on building the brand and finding new opportunities for this property.\nSnyder wants to convert the parking lot in the back of the Inn into permeable space like grass for people to play lawn games. Eventually, permits allowing, he wants to put a pool and putting green in the back and have yoga classes up on the roof.\n\"We can turn this back into the 'River View House,' and it will have views again,\" he said.\nWith all these plans, he remains aware that he has invested in something built in the 1700s.\n\"I want to bring it up and improve it in ways that future generations can use it,\" he said. \"Just being a steward of that is incredible.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The national average is up 18.7 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 1.6 cents per gallon higher than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nMarch 18, 2023: $3.28 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.43 per gallon)\nMarch 18, 2022: $4.13 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.27 per gallon)\nMarch 18, 2021: $2.84 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.87per gallon)\nMarch 18, 2020: $2.21 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.16 per gallon)\nMarch 18, 2019: $2.57 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.56 per gallon)\nMarch 18, 2018: $2.55 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.54/g)\nMarch 18, 2017: $2.30 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.29 per gallon)\nMarch 18, 2016: $1.98 per gallon (U.S. Average: $1.98 per gallon)\nMarch 18, 2015: $2.42 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.42 per gallon)\nMarch 18, 2014: $3.52 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.52 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore- $3.50 per gallon, up 19.3 cents per gallon from last week's $3.30 per gallon.\nWashington DC- $3.57 per gallon, up 8.9 cents per gallon from last week's $3.48 per gallon.\nHagerstown- $3.47 per gallon, up 11.3 cents per gallon from last week's $3.36 per gallon.\n\"Most Americans continued to see average gasoline prices march higher last week. The reason is the season: gasoline demand is rising as more Americans are getting out, combined with the summer gasoline switchover, which is well underway, and continued refinery maintenance,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.\nHe added: \"The madness should slow down in the next few weeks as we've seen positive data that refinery output is starting to increase, a sign that the peak of maintenance season could be behind us.\"\nIn some positive news for Midwest motorists, the BP refinery in Whiting, Indiana, that can process 440,000 barrels of oil per day, is finally back to normal operations for the first time since an electrical failure happened in early February. For now, gas prices will likely continue to trend higher, but the fever may break soon. When it comes to diesel, the news has been good — above average temperatures have lowered heating oil demand, and average diesel prices are on the cusp of falling back below $4 per gallon.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Eclipse 2024: America gets ready for next month’s big celestial event (VIDEO)\n\n March 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: Travel \n \n 1382\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Mansfield, Texas, and Mansfield, Ohio, are more than 1,100 miles and a 17-hour drive from each other.But the two cities share more than a name.\nLike communities from Texas to Maine, the two Mansfields are expecting a surge of visitors for next month's total solar eclipse.\nOn Monday, April 8, the total solar eclipse will cross North America with at least a partial view of the moon blocking out the sun throughout the continental U.S.\nAs many as 4 million people could travel to viewing sites across 13 states in the path of totality to view the moon completely blocking out the sun for between 3 and 4 minutes.\nThat path starts in Mexico and then traverses Texas and 12 other U.S. states including Oklahoma, Missouri, Kentucky, Illinois, Ohio, New York and into New England.\n\"It's simply the most spectacular sight you will see in your life,\" said Michael Zeiler, a self-professed eclipse chaser who operates GreatAmericanEclipse. com. He's been viewing celestial events since 1991.\nThere will not be another similar celestial event in the continental U.S. until 2044, according to Angela Des Jardins, a physics professor at Montana State University, who is a lead researcher in a NASA initiative deploying 1,000 faculty and students from dozens of colleges and schools throughout the country to analyze the eclipse.\nSpecial glasses and viewers are needed to watch the eclipse in order to avoid potential eye and vision damage from staring at the sun.\nTOURISM BOOST\nIn Mansfield, Ohio, Jodie Snavely expects as many 250,000 people to visit Richland County (which sits between Cleveland and Columbus).\n\"We have not had anything like this before. The last total eclipse in our region was 1806. But it's exciting to see the creativity of what the local businesses have planned before and during the eclipse for the residents and visitors,\" said Snavely, special projects director for Destination Mansfield — Richland County.\nEclipse viewing events will be held at Kingwood Center Gardens and the historic Ohio State Reformatory (a former prison where \"Shawshank Redemption\" was filmed and is celebrating its 30th anniversary.)\nSnavely said some of Mansfield's eclipse marketing is tied to the movie.\nOther creative events range from watching the eclipse during a yoga class at the Ohio Bird Sanctuary or with alpacas at a local farm to a weekend music festival and \"You'll Burn Your Eye Out\" eclipse watch party hosted by a local brewery.\nSnavely said the area could see a $7 million tourism and economic boost from the event.\nTim Roberts, marketing and promotions manager for Mansfield, Texas' Convention & Visitors Bureau, said his town moved its spring musical festival to April 6 and renamed the Music Alley Eclipse Fest to coincide with the event.\n\"We are fully expecting 8,000 to 10,000 people based upon our hotel bookings. Our hotels are mostly booked that weekend,\" Roberts said, adding that some room rates are as high as $500 per night.\nMansfield — 34 miles southwest of Dallas — is also hosting eclipse watch parties. Roberts said he's seen interest from visitors as far as Europe including Poland.\nTexas is the prime U.S. spot to view the event with the longest totality times (how long the moon will darken the sun), according to eclipse chasers and astronomers.\nZeiler said he is viewing the April event from Fredericksburg, Texas (70 miles northwest of San Antonio). He said Texas is the ideal U.S. spot because it is more prone to have clear weather on eclipse day and Fredericksburg is near multiple highways in case cloudy or inclement weather necessitated relocating to clearer skies.\n'COMING FROM ALL OVER'\nMany eclipse travelers are looking at camping options to enjoy the event.\nMany campgrounds along the U.S. route have already or will sell out for the weekend leading up to the Monday eclipse.\n\"We've got them coming from all over,\" said Monica Garcia, general manager of Mystic Quarry, a camping site in Canyon Lake, Texas (in between Austin and San Antonio) that offers cabins, tents, teepees and spots for RVs.\nGarcia expects to be sold out by eclipse day with remaining cabins and teepees running $230 per night.\nThe early April combination of spring break travel and the eclipse path near major population centers could make for one of the busiest travel periods in U.S. history.\nOTHER TOP DESTINATIONSAixa Diaz, a spokesperson for AAA, said the likes of Cleveland and Dayton, Ohio; Buffalo and Syracuse, New York; Indianapolis, Little Rock, Arkansas and Burlington, Vermont; join Texas cities as the top eclipse destinations.\nAnd, she said travelers are paying hefty prices.\n\"Flights to cities along the path of totality are averaging 28% higher compared to last year and hotels are 48% more expensive during the eclipse weekend compared to that same weekend in 2023,\" Diaz said.\nIn Ohio and other states, tourism bureaus, campground operators and universities are centering events around the eclipse.\nZeiler said northern Ohio on the shores of Lake Erie and spots along Lake Ontario in upstate New York could also offer clear viewing weather for viewers.\nIn the southeastern part of the state, Defiance County, Ohio and Ohio University are among those hosting events leading up and on April 8 including at the latter's Chillicothe campus.\nMany astronomers and solar researchers are traveling to experience and analyze the event in person.\n\"Most of the solar specialists in our department (and actually around the country) are going to be in meetings or events that are in the path of totality for the eclipse itself,\" said Rachael Filwett, a physics professor at Montana State University specializing in space physics.\nDes Jardins said 53 research teams (which include college and some high school students) will release high-altitude research balloons to study the impacts of the eclipse, including on the atmosphere and climate.\n'ECLIPSE FLIGHTS'\nOther cities and towns in the totality path — from Rochester, New York to Paducah, Kentucky — also have events planned the weekend before as well as eclipse day.\n\"Paducah was in the path of totality for the 2017 Great American Eclipse, so this is a 'twice in a lifetime event for the city,\" said Liz Hammonds, director of marketing and communications for the local convention and visitors bureau.\nThe Kentucky town, which sits at the confluence of the Ohio and Tennessee rivers between Nashville and St. Louis, will host an \"X Marks the Spot\" festival April 7-8 to celebrate the crossroads of the two eclipses.\nHammonds said an estimated 150,000 visitors are expected in western Kentucky including an influx of aircraft flying for celestial happening.\nSouthwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines also have flights coinciding when the solar eclipse travels across sections of the U.S.\nUnited has five flights from Chicago and four from Houston on April 8 that will traverse the eclipse path, according to Remy Milburn, an airline spokesperson.\nShe said outbound bookings from San Antonio after the eclipse are up 288% compared to last year and destinations such as Cleveland and Little Rock are also seeing increased travel demand.\nSouthwest Airlines had eight flights on April 8 that could offer aerial views of the event including routes from Dallas to Pittsburgh, St. Louis to Houston and Austin to Indianapolis.\nGrant Myatt, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines, said an eclipse flight from Austin to Detroit is sold out and there were limited seats left for another one from Dallas to Detroit.\nThe few seats left for those flights have fares running at $660 or more one way (and that's before fees and taxes).\nAAA's Diaz said Niagara Falls is also a popular destination and the auto club's travel agents have also seen bookings for eclipse cruises on the Panama Canal and vacation packages to Mexico.\n'BLOWN AWAY'\nThere will also be livestreams of the moon meeting the sun hosted by NASA as well as the Exploratorium in San Francisco.\nDes Jardins said teams from Montana State and 74 other schools are working with those two groups. She's also interested to see how animals and insects react.\nRobyn Higdon, senior project director and executive producer at the Exploratorium, said the museum will broadcast eclipse livestreams from Torreon, Mexico and Junction, Texas.\nThe museum partners with NASA and has numerous events and webinars with local schools, planetariums and museums across the country.\nHigdon first got interested in eclipses in 1998. \"I was just blown away,\" she said.\nHigdon and Des Jardins will be part of a contingent viewing the eclipse from Junction. Texas.\n\"If anyone can travel to the eclipse in person the experience is worth it,\" Higdon said. \"It's an all body, just incredible experience.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Kent County raises economic concerns over one-fish limit on charter boats\n\n March 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 642\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Owners of charter boats in Kent County all seem to agree — a single-limit fish-per-person rule is going to hurt their business, especially when striped bass, rockfish, season begins May 16.During summer season, the rockfish size and limit will be 19 inches to 24 inches, and each person can keep one rockfish, new regulations state.\nThat might discourage clients from booking trips on charter boats, especially for a trip that costs almost $600 for a half day, say opponents of the limit.\nThe Kent County Commissioners recently sent a letter siding with the charter boat captains to Josh Kurtz, secretary of Natural Resources.\nThe letter expressed the county is opposed to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission Addendum II to Amendment 7 of the Interstate Fishery Management Plan for striped bass.\n\"We are frustrated with the one-fish bag limit, the increased slot limit and all the restricted season dates which will negatively affect the Charter Boat industry,\" the letter states.\nCommission President Ron Fithian composed the letter after attending a Feb. 17 meeting in Easton, alongside Kent County Director of Economic and Tourism Development Jamie Williams.\nThere, charter boat operators were joined by commercial fishermen to air grievances about proposed restrictions on catching striped bass in the Chesapeake Bay.\nRob Newberry, Delmarva Fisheries Association chairman, said at that meeting, \"We've got to put a stop to this,\" referencing the overregulation commercial watermen are experiencing.\nFithian too expressed his concern over the matter on Tuesday, March 5, at the commission's weekly meeting, informing the public about the letter.\nHe restated how much the fishing industry means to the area.\n\"In 2022, we had $72 million dollars in visitor spending, so this is very detrimental to Kent County. This is going to affect the lodging, restaurants...any and all of them.\"\nHe added with a population of 13,000 full-time residents, they have about 1,500 boat slips, which turn into second homes for lodging.\nQuite frankly, he said, it's going to be a \"gut punch\" to the county.\nAlready he knows of one group who schedules ten trips a year who have cancelled after learning of the policy in effect.\nWilliams, also at the meeting, has become more educated in the manner, since it will affect what she sees as well. She talked about how a one-limit catch rule will result in more catch-and-release, which will create more dead fish on the shores.\n\"It doesn't make common sense when you follow it down the line,\" Williams said.\nAt the public portion of the meeting, Newberry provided his statements. And like Fithian, gave an example of paying clients disenchanted with the idea of the one-catch policy.\nHe said a party from Talbot County normally rents a room 12 times a year to fish. They stay from Thursday until Saturday night and head home the next day. They cancelled all trips this year. That, he pointed out, is about $3,000 a night lost.\nNewberry is not optimistic about the Department of Natural Resources' help either.\n\"The Department has showed no willing move to put forward to the charter boat industry to right this wrong.\"\nHe added when they reached out to Kurtz, they only received an effort on his part to ensure the captain and his mate each get a fish for themselves.\nUnfortunately, with the regulations becoming more strict, Newberry told to the commissioners some people won't cooperate with the DNR any longer.\nThey might decide to not electronically report any fish caught.\nThe commissioners had no comment about that.\nFithian just wanted it to be made public their stance on this policy.\n\"We're speaking out against it and hoping something will get done down the road.\"\nThe position of DNR and ASMFC is that these emergency actions are needed, and the tighter striped bass fishing regulations are in response to ongoing population decline and rock-bottom reproduction.\nIn October 2023, according to the DNR, the results of the annual juvenile striped bass survey found the worst recruitment in Maryland since 1957. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Frugal Feasting: 4 budget-friendly tips to host a cracking Easter\n\n March 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Liz Douglas Wealth of Geeks | Section: Entertainment \n \n 826\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n 72% of people are reconsidering their Easter holiday plans due to rising costs, according to a survey by FinanceBuzz.More than 80% of Americans plan to celebrate Easter. The average consumer will shell out in excess of $192, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF).\nThe top planned expenses included food, clothing, gifts, candy, and flowers, totaling a staggering $24 billion in collective spending.\n\"Easter endures as an important holiday for many Americans, signifying new beginnings and a time of celebration with friends and family,\" NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay says.\nAs Easter approaches, the financial strain for the hosts of family gatherings tempers the excitement of reuniting with loved ones. Here are four practical strategies to help you stretch your dollar further.\nPlan Your Menu in Advance\nBy planning, you can create an abundant spread without spending a fortune.\nShop early to take advantage of sales and coupons that may come up between now and the day.\nSpeaking to Bustle, culinary influencer Stephanie Nass said, \"Plan the menu as soon as you decide you're hosting. If you need specialty ingredients, source them early on. Dry goods and alcohol can be purchased as far out as you want. Produce can be purchased three to four days before the event. Meats, fish, and flowers should be purchased the day of or the day before. Bread must be fresh-fresh.\"\nA 2024 study by Numerator determined only 14% of Easter celebrators intend to buy alcohol. Fewer partiers planned to purchase alcohol for Easter out of nearly all annual holidays, with consumer estimates comparable only to Mother's Day. Hosts shouldn't feel obligated to provide an extensive drink selection.\n\"Having a bar adds an unnecessary level of complication,\" Nass told Bustle. Instead, she advises picking a signature cocktail or beverage for the event to minimize costs and fuss. Include reference to planned drink offerings when inviting guests. Advance notice will allow them to bring drinks if they prefer something else.\nAnother cost-effective alternative is hosting a potluck-style gathering where guests bring dishes to share. Hosts can elevate these by making them a themed degustation — a sampling or tasting — and assigning each guest an appetizer, side dish, or dessert. Have fun introducing the dishes each guest brings and exploring new flavor combinations.\nAnother way to keep costs low is hosting a brunch instead of dinner. Brunch foods are more affordable and easier to prepare in advance, allowing hosts to spend less time in the kitchen and more time enjoying guests' company. Consider a mix of sweet and savory dishes — quiches, tofu scrambles, fruit salads, vegan yogurt, banana bread, and pastries — to satisfy various tastes and dietary preferences.\nBe Selective About Candy\nWhen it comes to candy, remember that less is often more. Less than one quarter of shoppers plan to purchase less candy, and 20% will switch from real eggs to plastic.\nUsing a mix of chocolate and reusable plastic eggs in an egg hunt is a cost-effective way to keep costs down without sacrificing the thrill of the hunt. Consider buying more affordable chocolate eggs or looking for discounts and coupons before the holiday to get a bulk deal.\nOf course, you can still indulge without completely cutting back. Reallocate some of the cost savings by investing in one high-quality chocolate bunny or large egg for each child or guest as a special treat.\nDIY Decorations\nFlowers are collectively the fifth highest expenditure at $1.8 billion. While it's tempting to go all out with decorations and spring flowers, setting a budget and prioritizing essential items is essential to avoid overspending.\nFocus on key decorative elements like tablecloths and candles, or repurpose items you own, such as vases, jars, and decorative accents, to save money and minimize waste.\nDIY decorations can also be a fantastic activity for the group on the day, as most people like to play an active role at a party. Boston event planner Bryan Rafanelli told Oprah.com, \"I like to put a group of my friends together; I call them my hospitality team … The bigger the party, the bigger the hospitality team.\"\nUse this logic to encourage your guests to create fun, homemade decorations. Think paper chains, painted eggs, origami decorations, or flower arrangements. Not only does this take the pressure off you to decorate, but it also keeps your guests engaged — a fun activity for kids and adults alike.\nTrim Your Guest List\nWhen hosting a budget-friendly Easter celebration, one effective strategy is to keep your guest list selective. According to FinanceBuzz, 14% of people plan to have fewer guests for dinner.\nThe upside: fewer people means your budget can go a lot farther. \"When your party is smaller, you can really splurge on the little details,\" Nass points out. Rather than inviting acquaintances or distant relatives, prioritize inviting close friends and family members who will truly appreciate and enjoy the festivities.\nKeeping the guest list small and intimate allows you to create meaningful connections and shared experiences without breaking the bank.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That experience, she said, changed the arc of her career.\n\"Over crabs at the Odyssey, a spark of an idea came forward,\" O'Sullivan said, remembering a trip to Ocean Odyssey Crab House and Seafood Restaurant.\nThat idea: For NPS to partner with business leaders and community members to \"bring the principals of well-known, successful gateway communities from around the country here to the Chesapeake region,\" O'Sullivan said.\nWith this pilot, that idea is becoming a reality.\n\"I am thrilled to share that NPS Chesapeake Gateways is poised to take the next step in our 25-year journey of partnerships to begin to work at a whole-community scale,\" O'Sullivan said.\nNPS Chesapeake Gateways has rebuilt its team so that it can lean into its ability to work with the private sector. That authority, O'Sullivan said, hasn't been utilized in 25 years.\nAlong with tapping into its authority to work with the private sector, NPS Chesapeake Gateways has revived its grants and technical assistance, and it has reactivated the Chesapeake Gateways Visitor Experience Network. The network offers opportunities and benefits to sites and places that join.\nDorchester Chamber of Commerce member Joel Bunde will lead Cambridge's team for the Chesapeake Gateways Communities Initiative pilot. The Cambridge team will be part of a cohort that tests and refines the gateways community training and helps build this initiative, O'Sullivan said.\nDuring her speech, O'Sullivan said gateway communities \"embrace and leverage\" the outdoor economy.\n\"Capitalizing on their natural assets to stimulate new businesses (and) economic growth,\" she said. \"Which, in turn, enhances the overall well-being of their communities.\"\nAfter O'Sullivan's speech, Dorchester Chamber of Commerce President Bill Christopher called the initiative a \"game changer.\"\n\"We think it's going to be a great program for us and potential for the community to make a huge difference,\" he said to the audience.\nIn an interview, Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc. Executive Director Matt Leonard said the initiative will \"absolutely\" complement the Cambridge Harbor project, CWDI's project to develop the space along the Choptank River.\nLeonard said CWDI will be part of the Cambridge team for the pilot.\n\"We just think it's a tremendous opportunity for the local community and we're really proud to be a part of it,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

GOTTO Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Business \n \n 635\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Kent County is the home of many well-established, women-owned businesses, all bringing unique offerings and services to the community at-large through their specific enterprises.One woman in particular is approaching her eighth year in business as the owner of a gift and upcycled furnishings store at 335 High Street.\nAlong with her talents for merchandise mixing and furniture rehabilitation, Helen Cowley brought a fierce sense of resolve to her store, Bee Crafty Collectibles, after a chronic arthritic illness nearly sidelined her working life.\nThe experience would be transformative for Cowley, who worked in office management prior to opening her own business.\nAfter 15 years of battling debilitating pain in her feet and ankles that began in her 50s, Cowley came up with the concept for her store between the two surgeries that would ultimately address the underlying arthritic condition in her feet.\nA long, painful road was walked prior to that, however, as years of doctors' visits and various medications did little to address life with her debilitating condition.\n\"It was stopping me from doing a lot of things because I couldn't walk for long periods. I just sat around, and I was in pain constantly,\" she said.\nIt was around this time when, Cowley said, her daughter, who is a researcher, told her about an unconventional pain treatment called apitherapy.\n\"At this point, I felt I had nothing to lose,\" she said, of the treatment that uses live bee venom as an anti-inflammatory agent. Cowley said she found she could purchase bees for this purpose, and she began the process of \"stinging with bees.\"\nFortunately, it wasn't long before Cowley began to experience results.\n\"After getting the bees and using them for just a few days, I had relief,\" she said.\nThe break in the pain allowed Cowley's creativity to flourish and enhanced her ability to focus. She began the process of educating herself on the art of furniture restoration and began working out of her house to find new homes for old, but reimagined furnishings between the two years where she would have the surgeries to address her pain in both feet.\nCowley thrived. However, she couldn't help but develop a sense of profound gratitude for the bees that helped her to do so.\nIt was a bittersweet thing, she said, knowing what would happen to the bee once it treated her, as a bee does die after it stings.\nShe knew she wanted to do something that would pay homage to her friends, the bees. And so, when she was able to get her upcycled furniture business going, she did just that.\n\"They gave up their lives for me, so I named my store after them.\"\nToday, Bee Crafty Collectibles is command central for all the upcycled projects she creates and a plethora of other home goods and gifts. Cowley said her regular customers know that 335 High Street is where they can go to purchase signature items like humorous message signs, Fisher's Popcorn, Foozie socks and Route 1-brand merchandise.\n\"Everyone loves Maryland and the flag,\" she said, of her popular Maryland-centric merchandise.\nWhile Cowley is currently getting ready for Easter with a 15 percent-off sale on all Easter basket stuffers this weekend, she admits her biggest vertical is all the bee-related items in the store, including bee-themed jewelry, plushies, kitchen wares and, of course, local sweet honey.\nThis was all part of her plan to create not just a store, but something experiential. And she does a great job at that, too.\n\"I like to be involved with things that are going on in town,\" she said. People shouldn't be surprised to see her in a bee get-up or any number of the fun costumes she dons to help promote the town's famous festivals and events.\n\"One of my customers once said, 'This is a shopping experience in here,\" she said.\nTo readers, Cowley said, \"Come experience it for yourself!\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's cathartic to sink the axe in the wood.\"\nFranciotti, along with Rob Chase and her husband Carmen Franciotti, took over the business in December 2022.\nAlong with offering a place for people to practice healthy coping, DoCo Axe Co. wants to help the community in other ways.\nThis year, the local business started naming a DoCo Axe DoGooder of the Month. Every month, people can nominate someone who is doing good in the community. Whoever wins the title that month receives $50 from DoCo Axe Co.\nFranciotti herself is also working to do good in the Cambridge community and beyond. In 2022, she started a nonprofit called Homeless & Human, which works to advocate and resource share for people who are experiencing homelessness or on the verge of homelessness.\nFranciotti understand that the resources available to those experiencing homelessness \"far under-weigh the overwhelming needs.\" For years, she experienced homelessness as a single mother with two kids and a full-time job.\nTechnically, Franciotti said, she is still homeless, living with her sister.\n\"Most people are struggling to find housing,\" she said. \"Even well-employed people.\"\nOwning DoCo Axe Co. has given Franciotti the opportunity to make more connections in the community and get the word out about her nonprofit.\n\"We have a donation box,\" she said about DoCo Axe Co. \"We tell every single person who comes through the door what they're supporting is this.\"\nFranciotti said that conversation is important because a lot of the business' clientele don't know about the needs of the homeless population.\n\"So we can have this opportunity to chat with people about how it's teachers and nurses and the person who's working at the grocery store ... (who) are struggling to find housing and just survive day to day.\"\nAlthough DoCo Axe Co. has made itself a part of the community, it is facing multiple challenges as a local small business. Franciotti said the business is not currently making a profit.\nThe main challenges come from difficulties with staffing, a decrease in consumer spending and rising costs, from operating expenses to card processing fees, she said.\nFranciotti said the problems DoCo Axe Co. is facing aren't unique in Cambridge. She said other local business owners she has spoken with are facing similar challenges.\nDorchester Chamber of Commerce President Bill Christopher said finding staffing is one of the biggest challenges local businesses are currently facing.\nThe reason for this challenge includes a decrease in the workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in people retiring early and even a lack of childcare options.\nChristopher said that even if a person can find childcare, the cost can be so expensive that it doesn't make sense to work and pay for childcare.\nChristopher also said the expectations for people who are graduating school and entering the workforce aren't \"level-set with what the economy needs.\"\n\"So we've got to attack all three of these things to get the (staffing) problem solved,\" he said.\nPromoting a business and the cost of running a business are two other major challenges local businesses face.\n\"The dollars and cents,\" Christopher said. \"Because if you find the staff, can you afford them?\"\nThere are multiple ways that people can support DoCo Axe Co. — and not just with a wallet.\nFranciotti said learning about the business, having conversations about it, sharing and interacting with social media posts and even clicking on the website to boost its search engine optimization can all benefit DoCo Axe Co.\nAnd for those that have the means to support businesses with their wallet, Christopher said a dollar spent locally goes far in the community.\n\"You go to DoCo Axe and you spend that dollar, they're going to then use that dollar to pay for other things in the community, so it stays here,\" he said. \"That's the key. Rising tides raise all boats.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Moore needs to say more on tax increase plans\n\n March 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 753\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n {&by2}Since the Republicans reclaimed a majority of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives in the last election cycle, a recurring issue has been the impact of conservative Republican members (notably the Freedom Caucus) on efforts by the House Republican leadership to reach consensus on such issues as government spending, debt limits, aid to Ukraine and southern border security.\nAs that division continues some observers of the Maryland General Assembly like to say, \"With a Democratic supermajority in both houses of our General Assembly here we don't have all the division and disruption that they have in Congress.\"\nRecent events in Annapolis cast serious doubt on that observation.\nIn the current General Assembly session, there has been and is deep divide over the state budget and tax increases to fund it between the leadership of the Democratic super majorities in the state House and in the state Senate\nEarlier this month, the state Senate approved their version of the state budget with relatively little debate and rancor. It ultimately passed unanimously with yes votes from every Democratic senator and all but one Republican senator (who was not present that day due to a death in his family).\nThe day after the Senate version of the state budget was adopted in the Senate, the Democratic leadership in the Maryland House announced a $1.3 billion revenue plan to be paid for with expanded corporate taxes, legalized internet gaming and new fees on ridesharing, tolls and electric vehicles. They did so, maintaining now is the time to adopt tax and fee increases to help ensure there will be full funding in the future for three high priority initiatives for House of Delegate progressives. Those initiatives include funding public education as called for in the Blueprint for Maryland's Future (the Kirwan Plan), addressing chronic deficits in the state transportation trust fund and addressing climate change.\nThe response to that announcement from the Democratic president in the Maryland Senate was immediate and blunt. He said \"I don't think there's much room for compromise. We [the Senate] will not be considering wholesale or significant increases to Maryland taxes.\"\nExtending an olive branch to the Democratic House leadership, the Senate president did say that Democratic Senate and House leaders share the same priorities. He also did not rule out the possibility of the Senate considering a revenue package \"next year.\"\nAt this point, no one knows for sure what will happen on a final state budget that must be approved before the General Assembly adjourns early next month.\nThe wild card on all the discussions on current as well as future state budgets, tax increases and fee increases is Gov. Moore.\nSo far, in this budget debate he has embraced the position of the Democratic Senate leadership. Asked if that position would hold beyond the current year, Moore has said, \"I just know that the bar for raising taxes not just this year, but for every single year for me, it's going to be a very high bar.\"\nA week ago, the governor focused instead on Maryland's post pandemic lagging economy and the role of a more robust economy in expanding Maryland's tax base.\nMoore said, \"For the past five years, Maryland's economy has grown by .2%. The average state has grown by 7.5. So, we've got to get this economy moving. There is a way that we can continue growing, be bold, and also know that any conversations around taxes are going to have a very high bar.\"\nNow is the time for the governor to say even more.\nHe can share his definition of what constitutes a \"very high bar\" for any discussions on evaluating tax increases. He can share his plans to get Maryland's economy moving. He can use his office as a bully pulpit to spread the message that his overall strategy is taking bold steps to improve Maryland's economy, create jobs, retain current jobs, bring new businesses and population to Maryland, and keep current businesses and current residents in Maryland.\nHe can share revenue projections from a more robust Maryland economy that could eliminate, minimize or delay a need for future tax and fee increases.\nLast, but not least, he can remind the House Democratic leadership that after eight years of progressive Democratic Gov. Martin O'Malley and Democratic supermajorities approving a wide range of tax and fee increases, Republican Larry Hogan was elected twice as governor, and now has an opportunity to be the first Republican to be elected to the U.S. Senate from Maryland since 1968.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I take any opportunity to go out in the community and share,\" Forrest said.\nShe highlighted the connections she has made through the chamber with church members, nonprofits and businesses to help her to get out and teach her classes.\nBut Forrest was not the only member of her family who was recognized at the Caroline County Best in Business Awards.\nIn perhaps a first, Forrest's sister also won an award that night — the Rising Star award.\n\"I wish everyone could have won an award. Everyone deserved it — they all work so hard,\" said Michelle Dahlman, Forrest's sister and owner of Shore Love Cleaning Service. \"(Chamber Executive Director) Tracey (Snyder) does so much hard work for all the members. The moment I joined, I felt like family. I always have someone cheering me on. It has opened up so many possibilities.\"\nThe sisters were among nine representatives from the local business community who received awards and citations from Sen. Chris Van Hollen at the annual celebration, which was held amid the Celtic splendor of the Market Street Public House in Denton.\nIt was a packed house of community leaders who had a buffet dinner provided by the pub. There was a wine raffle that benefited the Caroline County Chamber of Commerce's Scholarship Fund.\n\"We share what great things our businesses are doing in our chamber and our community,\" Snyder said. \"What makes this county great is what all these businesses do to cheer each other on.\"\nChamber Vice President David Harper came up to the podium.\n\"Entrepreneurs are the backbone of our community.

These are young children who don't have resources. The chamber has really allowed us to grow and expand,\" said Horne.\nThe Excellence in Agriculture Award went to Clayton Farms. Eileen Simmons spoke for co-owners Sean Rizer and her husband Kenny Simmons.\n\"We are a small community and we are all winners. If we don't have it, we will send them your way. We are third generation and have three daughters next,\" Simmons said.\nBusiness leader of the year award went to Realtor Kathleen Brenton.\n\"I want to say thank you, thank you, thank you. I look around this room and see a whole bunch of people that deserve this award just as much, if not more than me. I am in shock. I am a strong believer in this community,\" Brenton said.\nTenchi Spanish American Kitchen won business of the year.\nRecognizing these businesses' work is part of the Chamber of Commerce's bread and butter, said new Chamber President Laura Reeder.\n\"Helping our businesses grow and thrive is what our chamber is all about,\" Reeder said. \"Our goal this year is to increase the number of member to member connections.

But what sets the Flying Decoy Bar and Grill apart is it is chef-driven, Golder said. Along with a small, reliable staff, Golder said he's thankful for, he'll be cooking most of the time.\nAnd he's happy to be running it, focusing on cleanliness, service and fresh food from local sources when available.\nAs the former chef at the 98 Cannon Riverfront Grille in Chestertown, which shuttered its doors due to a fire, he's had to face uncertainty and setbacks to get back to what he enjoys.\nThat fire changed things for Golder.\nIt occurred Jan. 12, caused by an electrical or mechanical failure within the ice maker or the electrical system energizing the component.\nAbout 60 firefighters from Chestertown and surrounding areas responded and brought the flames under control in two hours.\nBut the smoke hovering above the waterfront signaled the beginning of the end for the popular restaurant.\nThere were some efforts to keep it going. The summer after the fire, Golder was running a food truck from the patio, hoping to reopen.\nThat fell through, and with very few restaurants hiring, what was a chef with over 40 years experience to do?\nThe location in Rock Hall was a fortunate find.\nNot only did The Flying Decoy allow Golder to stay at his residence in Chestertown, but they offer great dishes, benefitting folks on the Eastern Shore.\nWith a focus on resourcing from local farmers, producers and watermen, he calls for only the freshest ingredients to put on the plate.\nBlue catfish served creole style is on the menu.\nBurgers and ribeye are Rosetta beef, a consistent brand of beef, known for quality. Shrimp with grits and jalapeno corn fritters and many other tantalizing dishes.\nWith plenty of space to accommodate 80-100 people a night and a nice selection of wine and craft beers to choose from, Golder invites the public to drop in.\nAs a low-key person, not one to wear his name badge on his jacket, his affection comes through in the food he prepares.\nGolder has a willingness to teach as well. He's looking for staff, anyone who feels as he does, who gets a thrill of seeing people enjoy the food, who is willing to work hard.\nThe benefits: you learn from a certified chef who traveled the states, managing crews on yachts and restaurants and who understands the business side of the food industry.\nThe cons: you may have to clean out the grease trap every once in a while, Golder said.\nBeing a chef is not as glamorous as they make it look on reality television, he added.\nBut it's worth the effort to see his customers leave happy.\nThe Flying Decoy's located at 21270 Rock Hall Ave. Their hours are Monday through Saturday, 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. with plans to open up for lunch this month. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gluten-Free Bakery Girl rises to the challenge\n\n March 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Business \n \n 628\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — It began as a challenge for an already established cook.Tricia King, owner of Gluten-Free Bakery Girl, said that during her time as a personal chef, she had a client with rheumatoid arthritis who needed to avoid gluten in her diet. King undertook the task of creating tasty gluten-free recipes.\nNow, about 20 years later, she is the owner of Gluten-Free Bakery Girl, an entirely gluten-free bakery on the Eastern Shore.\nKing centers the health and well-being of her customers in everything she does, and that includes making sure all her baked goods are not only safe but also a delight to eat.\nThe passion for tasty food has been a long love of King's. She has been cooking almost all her life, and even when she wasn't cooking, she was studying and watching other cooks like Julia Child and her mother. She said that cooking just came naturally to her.\n\"When you have a passion for it, it's easy to do it,\" King said. \"I've loved food my whole life.\"\nAfter studying interior design, she decided to open a personal chef business in Salt Lake City, Utah, called Purple Pomegranate. For two years, she traveled from house to house every day, doing the shopping and cooking for two weeks and then repeating the same cycle with different clients.\nThen, she had the opportunity to be a sous chef in a hotel in Scotland.\nIt was there that she dove into baking. When she came back to the States, she trained under pastry chef Matt Ratliff in the Perry Cabin.\nThe work was intense, King said. Daily, the kitchen would produce 40 souffles, bake bread and cookies, and make wedding cakes.\nIn the back of her mind, she still yearned to open her dream bakery. So, she began using the back kitchen to try different gluten-free desserts.\nBefore she made the leap to establish her bakery, she shared her dream with one of her friends, and he said, \"Oh, it's never going to work. A gluten-free bakery?\" She smiles, recollecting the memory and how he has since taken back his words.\nGluten-Free Bakery Girl has been in business in St. Michaels for 12 years and will be opening in a bigger location in Easton. Its products can be found throughout Maryland, Delaware, D.C., Massachusetts, New York and other states nationwide.\nKing said the vast majority of her customers have celiac disease, an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. Due to this, it is of the utmost importance that there is no cross-contamination in her kitchen.\nShe operates in a 100% certified gluten-free facility and kitchen.\nAll products are individually wrapped to prevent any potential cross-contamination from other foods during shipping and sale, and all employees are only allowed to bring gluten-free food to work.\n\"People don't understand that you can't just bake in a kitchen and then wipe it down and then bake gluten-free,\" King said. \"Twenty parts per million, which is a crumb of bread, is enough to make someone who has celiac disease sick.\"\nMore than anything, King wants to help people with celiac disease lead a more accessible and safer day-to-day life. King said her customers with celiac disease often feel that they need to miss out on treats for their health, but having the opportunity to provide people the chance to indulge in a baked good makes all the effort she puts in her bakery worth it.\nKing urges young girls thinking of starting a bakery or any business to have faith in themselves and allow themselves to grow outside their comfort zones.\n\"We women are the hardest on ourselves,\" King said. \"We beat ourselves up the most. It puts blocks in front of us, but we have to know we can make it through. So, keep going. You have to keep going.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Tradepoint Atlantic will be essential to Key Bridge cleanup\n\n April 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connor Bolinder connor.bolinder@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 498\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last weekend, demolition crews began to carefully remove the first pieces of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge from the Patapsco River.A 200-ton portion of the bridge was cut away by demolition experts, hoisted out of the water with massive cranes, and floated away on a barge.\nAccording to Gov. Wes Moore, this 200-ton segment was only a small, \"bite-sized\" piece of the wreckage. Thousands of tons of steel and concrete need to be removed from the Patapsco River after the devastating collapse of the Key Bridge last week when it was hit by a cargo ship. Estimates to clear the debris and reopen the shipping channel range from months to over a year, with a heavy emphasis on safety.\n\"I cannot stress enough how important today and the first movement of this bridge and of the wreckage is. This is going to be a remarkably complicated process,\" Moore said.\nCentral to the cleanup efforts is Tradepoint Atlantic, the Sparrows Point-based logistics center on the site of the old Bethlehem Steel mill. Located off Interstate 695, businesses at Tradepoint Atlantic depend almost entirely on the Key Bridge and the Port of Baltimore to move goods.\n\"I want to thank Tradepoint Atlantic,\" Moore said. \"This human tragedy is also an economic catastrophe. In the early hours, it was Tradepoint who said 'Let us help.'\"\nAlthough the facility won't be able to take in most of the shipping traffic bound for the Port of Baltimore, it will act as a staging area for Unified Command to bring in heavy equipment like the Chesaepeake 1000, a crane capable of lifting 1000 tons. After a piece of the collapsed bridge is lifted and carried away, barges take it to Tradepoint for disposal.\n\"Generally when the debris is taken to the laydown yard at Tradepoint Atlantic at Sparrows Point, it will be inspected and secured until they find the final disposition for disposal in a safe manner,\" Army Corps of Engineers Col. Estee Pinchasin said.\nWith deep-water docks, railroad connections and plenty of heavy equipment, Tradepoint is in an ideal position to take away the debris. In fact, it has the only deep-water berths in the Chesapeake Bay that are still accessible.\n\"We will continue working with their team, and we are grateful for their support and grateful for their leadership,\" Moore said from a shipyard at Tradepoint.\nAlong with clearing the shipping channel to reopen the port, officials are trying to figure out how to rebuild the major bridge, which was completed in 1977.\n\"I know, right now everybody wants to see things moving,\" Pinchasin said. \"You need to know and you need to trust that behind the scenes, it's moving.\"\nEven as the demolition crews shift their focus to removing the debris, officials extended their sympathy and prayers to the families of the six victims.\n\"As our engineers are assessing and surveying and figuring out how they're going to lift those loads, they know in the back of their minds that they're also looking for any traces of the fallen.\" Pinchasin said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

GOTTO Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Business \n \n 423\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Those who enjoy a \"proper cuppa,\" as the British often say, may want to check out the monthly event being held at the Brampton Inn.The fourth Sunday of the month is quickly becoming a special occasion for those who choose to frequent the historic Chestertown inn, built circa 1860, for their elegant afternoon tea experience.\nOwner and innkeeper, Hilari Rinehart, said she had been getting requests to hold some sort of regular afternoon tea for the general public since her husband, David, and she first bought the bed and breakfast back in 2020. This monthly event is an addition to the afternoon tea they provide for their daily lodging clientele.\nRinehart works closely with their primary chef, Carole Baxter, to make certain that each monthly seating has a unique menu and theme.\nOf the two most recent teas, offerings included a traditional scone and finger sandwich menu, with some savory twists like cranberry meatballs and walnut and cranberry goat cheese balls and a tea-around-the-world experience featuring an appetizer of Thai peanut hummus and a French-themed ham and cheese bite wrapped in fine pastry.\nEach seating offers six different varieties of tea for the choosing, including robust options like Scottish afternoon tea and selections with fruity notes, like Paris tea with hints of lemony bergamot.\nWhile sipping tea, visitors are also treated to the lovely views of the Brampton gardens and landscape from a sunny dining room and its two walls of floor-to-ceiling windows that show off the enhancements the owners have made to the inn since purchasing it.\nAttendance at the teas has been robust since the event's inception and Rinehart commented that feedback has been very positive.\n\"Everyone has loved it so far,\" she said. \"Down the road we are going to do a series of dinners on the patios, starting in May and running through October.\"\nA trial run of these Gourmet Club dinners was successfully held last fall, Rinehart said, and provided the encouragement for them to continue them this year. Also on the inn's schedule of events is a Dining Under the Stars Dinner Series, and a Ship-to-Shore dining experience. Curated, private events for small groups are available as part of the inn's menu of offerings to the general public as well.\nRight now, the inn has dates in the books for the Elegant Afternoon Tea series well into summer, including one for Mother's Day, and Rinehart said there will be more to come.\nSeating is limited.

    "content": "A forgotten promise and a pillowcase filled with cash fuel local business owner's dream\n\n April 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 593\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — It began with an unshakable passion, a forgotten promise and a pillowcase filled with cash.Those three things brought Jessica Tanglao, owner of Tanglao Carriage Driving, to her passion today, providing horse-drawn carriage rides to the Eastern Shore.\nTanglao said she had no idea where her love for horses originated, but it was her first defining feature as a child. When she was about 5 years old, after continuously begging for a horse, her mother made her a promise. If she could raise $2,500, then she could have a horse.\nTanglao went door-to-door in her neighborhood for over four years and took any job she could. From shoveling snow to raking leaves, she was determined to have her horse. Then, at the age of 9, she brought a pillowcase filled with cash to her mother, who had completely forgotten the promise, and finally got her horse.\nEbony, Tanglao's first horse, was mean and a biter. He was forced out of horse school for bad behavior. Yet, she loved this ill-mannered horse and found joy in caring for him every day.\nFrom there on, her love for horses grew. She got another horse and another.\n\"I think they're just like my will to live,\" Tanglao said. \"There's something about them that's just part of my soul. I love them.\"\nOriginally from Lexington, Virginia, she learned of horse-drawn carriage tours in the area and begged the local business for a job over the course of years. Finally, they gave her a job that she loved. There, she decided to one day have her own horse-drawn carriage business.\nToday, Tanglao has 11 carriages, ten horses and acres to help teach people how to lead a horse-drawn carriage.\nJessie Willey, owner of Alternative Therapy, said that Tanglao's love for horses is striking to anyone who meets her, and her work ethic knows no bounds.\n\"Jessica's passion is evident through the happiness of her horses,\" Wiley said. \"I've never met a group of horses more excited to work. Jess puts her heart and soul into her horses and her business. Rain or shine … or snow, she'll be out at the barn taking care of her best friends. Her knowledge about the horse and carriage is a gift to the rapidly growing community.\"\nTanglao says doing carriage rides allows her to entertain and bring joy to all her customers. Putting on a show and making her customers laugh is what makes this job worth it.\nHer two children, both under the age of 6, share the same passion for horses. Tanglao said her children saw her around horses, and soon, their love for them became infectious.\nNow, her daughter Millie Tanglao is interested in driving horses and being around her pony, JamJam.\nWhile leading her pony to enjoy some grass, Millie shared what she loved most about horses, which included being around them, especially when they were sniffing her.\nTanglao says it's important to encourage young people's interest in animals, especially regarding activities with animals. She shared that it is uncanny how much her daughter reminds her of herself as a child. They both share the same determined love for horses.\nTanglao hopes to share her love for horses with everyone and show young girls that being driven and believing in themselves can result in achieving their dreams.\n\"I tell my daughter all the time that the words 'I can't' don't exist,\" Tanglao said. \"If you want something and you want to do something, figure it out. You can figure it out. Look at all the women who have figured it out before us. Just keep going and keep the dream alive.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Prices in Maryland are 26.3 cents per gallon higher than a month ago and stand 9.9 cents per gallon higher than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has increased 3.1 cents in the last week and stands at $4.02 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $3.25 per gallon yesterday while the most expensive was $4.79 per gallon, a difference of $1.54per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 6.5 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.57 per gallon today. The national average is up 17.1 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 0.8 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nApril 8, 2023: $3.51per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.58 per gallon)April 8, 2022: $3.74per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.12 per gallon)April 8, 2021: $2.78per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.86 per gallon)April 8, 2020: $1.98per gallon (U.S. Average: $1.88 per gallon)April 8, 2019: $2.68per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.75 per gallon)April 8, 2018: $2.67per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.65 per gallon)April 8, 2017: $2.36per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.39 per gallon)April 8, 2016: $2.05per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.04 per gallon)April 8, 2015: $2.35per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.39 per gallon)April 8, 2014: $3.59per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.58 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.60 per gallon, up 7.5 cents per gallon from last week's $3.52 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.72 per gallon, up 4.7 cents per gallon from last week's $3.68 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.58 per gallon, down 3.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.61 per gallon.\n\"After a brief break, gas prices have leapt back up, driven by extensive refinery maintenance on the West Coast, where prices have increased notably; only a handful of states have seen prices decline over the last week,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"With oil prices rising to nearly $87 per barrel last week, their highest since October, we are not only facing the seasonal factors that push prices up — refinery maintenance, the switch to summer gasoline and rising demand — but also escalating crude oil prices as OPEC's production cuts continue to cause declining global oil inventories, with escalations between Iran and Israel adding to concerns of further destabilization.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Actor Jim Belushi launches his cannabis brands in Cecil County\n\n April 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 1054\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n PERRYVILLE — Larry Villani and his wife, Yvonne, were beaming on Wednesday as they walked off the concert hall stage in the back of Grounded Coffee near Perryville after meeting actor Jim Belushi, who has appeared in more than 90 movies and 60 television shows since the late 1970s.\"I told him that my family has been watching your family for almost 50 years,\" Larry said, referring mainly to Belushi's work as an actor, comedian and musician in the entertainment industry and that of his late brother, John Belushi, who was one of the original seven \"Saturday Night Live\" cast members before starring in \"Animal House,\" \"The Blue Brothers\" and other movies.\nAs for the North East couple's brief interaction with Belushi, Yvonne summarized, \"He''s a very laid-back, nice person.\"\nBelushi starred in \"According to Jim\" from 2001 to 2009 and was a \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member from 1983 to 1985, to list a couple of the dozens of TV shows on his resume. His long list of movie credits includes \"Red Heat\" with Arnold Schwarzenegger; \"Trading Places\" with Eddie Murphy, Dan Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis; \"The Principal\" with the late Louis Gossett Jr.; and \"Curly Sue\" with Steve Carell and Alisan Porter.\nBut Belushi wasn't in Cecil County on Wednesday to look back on his acting career thus far. Nor was he here to promote any existing or upcoming film or TV projects. Belushi, instead, was in Cecil County to launch his own cannabis brands — Belushi's Farm and Blue Brothers — in Maryland through a partnership with Warwick-based SunMed Growers, which he visited on Wednesday as part of his whirlwind promotional tour.\nBelushi spent about five hours at SunMed Growers, a licensed grower and processor that employees about 200 people. SunMed grows, processes and distributes various types and brands of cannabis to approximately 90 state-regulated marijuana dispensaries throughout Maryland, including Nature's Care and Wellness on Route 40 near Perryville, which now is selling Belushi's products and was one of Belushi's stops on Wednesday.\n\"He was down to earth. He talked to every employee and thanked them for their hard work. He shook hands. He signed autographs,\" outlined Paul Quill, director of sales and security at SunMed, noting that Belushi talked shop at length with SunMed President, Jacob Van Wingerden. \"Mr. Belushi is very knowledgeable. He talked plants and genetics and processing with Jake.\"\nBelushi then visited Nature's Care and Wellness, founded and owned by Bobby Windsor. While touring that dispensary, Belushi chatted with employees and customers, graciously signing autographs and posing for photos. At one point, after Belushi was introduced to an employee whose name is Mary Jane, he joked with her because \"Mary Jane\" is slang for marijuana.\nFrom there, he made the short walk eastward to Grounded Coffee, also owned by Windsor. Belushi then spent approximately the next two hours interacting individually with the dozens of people who waited in line to meet him. Attendees were gifted different strains of one of his brands — Blues Brothers — in flower and pre-rolled form along with other swag, including a Belushi's Farm poster. Belushi autographed the posters, the plastic tubs containing the Blues Brothers flower and other items presented to him by the meet-and-greet attendees.\n\"I am a Jim Belushi groupie,\" gushed Abingdon resident Laura Martin, moments after meeting him on the stage.\nMartin was sporting a shirt covered with images of Jim Belushi's face. She turned sideways to reveal a fresh scribble near the bottom of her Jim Belushi print top and then remarked happily, \"He autographed my shirt for me.\"\nShe is more than a fan of Belushi — the entertainer.\n\"I love his product, too,\" Martin said, holding up a couple of containers of Belushi's cannabis.\nLocated on 93 acres along the Rogue River in Oregon, Belush started Belushi's Farm Cannabis with 48 plants in 2015 during that state's medical marijuana program. A long-time proponent of adult-use legalization who has advocated for patients rights across the United States, Belushi operates a farm that now grows a wide range of legal cannabis offerings that include Captain Jack's Gulzar Afghanica and Good Ugly Weed. Belushi's brands of cannabis are now sold in 13 states.\nChronicling his work in the legal cannabis industry is a television show on The Discovery Network called \"Belushi's Farm,\" and Season 3 premieres at 9 p.m. on Friday (April 5). The show provides the audience with an insider perspective on the people, operations and mission behind Belushi's Farm cannabis.\n(Belushi is an ambassador for Last Prisoner Project — a coalition of cannabis industry leaders, executives and artists dedicated to bringing restorative justice to the cannabis industry. He is working with the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission and the Portland City Council to create an opioid trade program in which \"veterans, the infirmed, downtrodden and addicted\" can have a place for healing for low to no cost, according to a press release regarding Belushi's product launch.)\nThe partnership between Belushi and SunMed started last year, according to Quill, who explained that Belushi's celebrity and his high-profile involvement in and advocacy for cannabis, including his popular \"Belushi's Farm\" television show, were attractive to SunMed.\nSunMed replicated the different marijuana plants that yield the various brands and types of cannabis that Belushi's Farms grows, a process that began with taking cuttings of those plants and then essentially cloning them, in the broadest of terms. The repeated process involved about 16 weeks to grow the desired plants, followed by drying and curing. The cannabis produced then was sent to a state-certified lab, where tests were performed to measure the various levels of properties, including the percentages of THC, which is the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, and to determine if the cannabis is \"clean and safe,\" according to Quill.\nConsistency is paramount at SunMed, as with any reputable grow center.\nBelushi's Farm offers two brands. Belushi's Farm has a THC level from 25 to 30 percent and is considered to be a premium brand while the other, Blue Brothers, has a THC level of 20 to 25 percent and has been dubbed by Belushi as \"the working man's cannabis.\"\nRegarding the partnership between SunMed and Belushi, Van Wingerden commented, \"Our collaboration with Belushi's Farm symbolizes more than just the strength and maturation of Maryland's market. For me and Jim, it is a testament to our shared commitment to innovation, quality, social responsibility and the healing power of cannabis.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mother-daughter duo treats texture with style\n\n April 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: NIAMBI DAVIS Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Business \n \n 625\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n QUEENSTOWN — In October 2022 Onyx Beauty Supply, Salon, and Barbershop opened in Queenstown Premium Outlets to fill a particular need.\"Growing up here, raising two daughters, we always had to go outside of the area, often 35-40 minutes away, and even to other states to get hair and skin products compatible with our texture and skin tone,\" said Deayna Ewell, co-owner of Onyx with her daughter Kay Bowser.\nBefore owning Onyx, the pair had already forged a business relationship with the Outlets. When Deayna's mother, Pastor Annie Ewell, passed away, Kay returned from Atlanta where she trained as a phone repair technician. At the time, Ewell had over 30 years of corporate retail experience at the Outlets with The Loft, Express, Old Navy, and Brooks Brothers.\nWhen the mother-daughter team put their heads together, utilizing Kay's training as a phone repair technician, the women opened and operated a phone repair store in Queenstown for three years. \"But Kay was forward-thinking,\" recalled her mother. \"She saw that the industry was changing and would not be a good fit in the long run.\"\nIn its place, their skills, experience, and drive produced a business that provided a much-needed service to the community and honored Annie Ewell's community outreach legacy.\n\"We do all hair,\" the shop's motto proclaims.\n\"When people come into our shop and ask 'do you do the texture of my hair' it sparks an instant conversation that shows that hair is not a race, it's a texture,\" Ewell said. And the barbers, braiders and stylists at Onyx know how to service all of them.\n\"We need to try to understand each other; we don't need to be afraid of each other,\" Ewell said.\nAt Onyx it's a common sight to see a white man getting his hair cut next to a black woman having her hair braided.\nIn the culture of community barbershops, Onyx upholds its role as a source of information, fellowship and aid.\n\"Everything goes back into how we can help our community. We do a lot of outreach here,\" Ewell said.\nAs part of its community outreach activities, Onyx has sponsored three \"Free cut/Quick style\" charity events in support of back-to-school activities, families in need, and shelters for men and women. They've put on events to introduce the staff and business to the community, which resulted in Onyx receiving Business With The Biggest Heart and Favorite New Business Owner in community-voted awards.\nAt Onyx, care extends into the place where beauty and emotional well-being meet. Motivated by the experience that left a friend and cancer patient weeping and distraught from her treatment at a wig shop, Onyx carries a selection of wigs that Ewell cuts and styles to suit each woman. \"I want to make the experience personal and private. We offer encouragement to people going through cancer treatment, and losing their hair to alopecia. We've done more of that than we've made money. But I say if that's why I'm here we'll keep going.\"\nAs part of its goals, Onyx hopes to raise capital for expansion into alopecia/COVID/cancer hair loss solutions, apprenticeships for local cosmetology/barber school students and additional salon/barber equipment.\n\"Our name is spreading and we need our business to catch up with our name,\" Ewell said.\nOnyx Beauty Supply celebrated its first year this past November. \"There were times when I felt like giving up. But then someone would come in and say \"I'm so glad you're here. We believe in our hearts that our communities, more than ever, need every opportunity to be united and come together for strength and encouragement in these tough and uncertain times. At Onyx we value creating a diverse and inclusive environment to support unity within our community, one customer at a time.\"\nOnyx Beauty Supply and Barber is located at 439 Outlet Center Drive in Queenstown. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tax increase opposition resonates with voters\n\n April 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 720\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Larry Hogan's elections to two terms as a Republican governor in deep blue Maryland are over but are not forgotten.His legacy as a successful champion of limits on government spending and no tax increases during his two terms is well established in Maryland political history.\nIt also continues in recent history and bodes well for the future.\nLast week, after intense debate between the Democratic leadership of the state House of Delegates and the Democratic leadership of the state Senate on the need for and timing of state taxes and state fee increases, the respective leaderships finally reached agreement on both matters.\nBefore that agreement was finalized, the Democratic House leadership pushed hard for immediate and significant state tax and fee increases. The Democratic Senate leadership consistently refused to agree to those proposed increases.\nDuring that debate, Larry Hogan released the following statements:\n\"It's deja vu all over again — the same crushing tax hikes that convinced me to run for governor in the first place are rearing their ugly head again. The House has approved the single largest tax increase in Maryland history — a proposed $1.3 billion in new taxes on the backs of working families already struggling with historic inflation and a cost-of-living crisis. Marylanders know it doesn't have to be this way. As governor, I cut taxes for eight straight years by $4.7 billion and left Maryland with a record surplus. It breaks my heart to see that progress slip away. I urge Democratic leaders in the Senate to work with Republicans to stop this crushing tax hike and protect hard-working taxpayers. Enough is enough.\"\nHogan also posted on X — \"Let's reject these tax hikes and send a message that it's time to end politics as usual.\"\nAfter Hogan's remarks, the agreement between negotiators from the House and Senate resulted in relatively modest tax increases on tobacco products, as well as several user fee increases to address serious structural deficits in state funding for transportation.\nThe user fee increases include a surcharge on vehicle registrations for owners of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, increased vehicle registration fees based on revised vehicle weight classes and a 75-cent fee per trip for ride-share services.\nIt was a different outcome that many observers expected with a Democratic governor and Democratic super majorities in the Maryland House and Maryland.\nCredit is due to Gov. Moore whose original proposed budget was balanced without any tax increases. Moore also said early and often that he supported the position of the Senate Democratic leadership. He said, \"I just know that the bar for raising taxes not just this year, but for every single year for me, it's going to be a very high bar.\"\nGov. Moore also shared his vision on how best to address Maryland's post pandemic lagging economy and the role of a more robust economy in expanding Maryland's tax base. He expressed a need to focus on taking bold steps to improve Maryland's economy, create jobs, retain current jobs, bring new businesses and population to Maryland, and keep current businesses and current residents in Maryland.\nHis comments made a difference.\nI suggest Larry Hogans's comments also made a difference.\nI am not suggesting Hogan's comments were solely responsible for the tax and fee debate outcome, but his observations were duly noted by one key player in the negotiations.\nFollowing the announcement on the compromise on tax and fee increases, Senate President Bill Ferguson said, \"If you go back to 2014 and 2018, I think it's not brain science to see what happened and how the former governor was successful in the state of Maryland, and so that context is very real, and we have to be honest about it.\"\nFerguson also observed that Hogan's well-known opposition to tax increases resonated with Republican, Democratic and unaffiliated voters in his two successful campaigns for governor.\nFerguson suggested Hogan's track record as governor may also help him in his campaign to be elected to the U.S. Senate.\nThat is good news for a framework for future discussions and decisions on state budget and tax decisions in Maryland.\nIf this occurs, Larry Hogan's legacy as a successful Republican Governor in a deep blue state will likely extend well beyond his two terms as governor.\nIf he wins in his U.S. Senate bid, that legacy will be extended even more.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

CONDON Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 593\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DUNDALK — More than 1,000 small businesses have sought emergency federal loans to stay afloat following the March 26 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and closure of much of the Port of Baltimore, according to the U.S. Small Business Administration.One of those seeking aid was Ricshay Johnson, the owner of Salon Ricshay on North Liberty Street in Baltimore, who suddenly found her client appointment calendar less crowded after the bridge collapse.\n\"I don't know what that's going to entail for me, or what that's going to look like down the line,\" said Johnson.\nJohnson went to a Small Business Administration emergency relief center in Dundalk, one of three opened in the Baltimore region. The trip to the SBA center last week normally would have been impossible given her salon's busy schedule. Many of Johnson's customers, who come from outside Baltimore, complained about traffic since the bridge collapse, she said.\nThe cargo ship Dali lost power and collided with the Key Bridge, bringing down the main span of the 1.6-mile bridge into the Patapsco River, and clogging a main access point to the Port of Baltimore. Six construction workers died in the collapse. The potential economic impact is vast, since the Port of Baltimore directly and indirectly employs some 51,000 people, more than the population of Annapolis. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it hopes to clear the channel and fully reopen the port by the end of May.\nThe Small Business Administration, which seeks to assist small businesses in times of distress, said businesses affected by the bridge collapse may apply for economic injury disaster loans, which have a 4% interest rate for small businesses and 3.25% rate for private nonprofit organizations.\nBusinesses from Maryland, Washington D.C. and select counties from Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia are eligible. Businesses can wait a year before beginning to repay the loans, according to Yvette Jeffrey, Small Business Administration spokesperson.\nThe SBA opened emergency relief centers at the Community College of Baltimore County's Dundalk Campus, the CareFirst Engagement Center on South Clinton Street in Baltimore, and at the Arundel Christian Church in Glen Burnie.\nJuan Proaño, chief executive officer of The League of United Latin American Citizens, a civil rights organization, has raised more than $40,000 through an online GoFundMe fundraising campaign for the families of the six victims as of April 9. Proano, who accompanied President Joe Biden and Gov. Wes Moore on their April 5 visit to Baltimore, said these donations only meet some basic needs for the deceased workers' families.\n\"These families are going to have to pay the electric bill by the end of the month, they're gonna have to pay rent by the end of the month,\" Proano said. \"These Latino men are the primary wage earners in those homes, right. And so all of a sudden, you have children, you have wives, now, single parents, that are going to have to figure out how they're going to move forward.\"\nOther businesses across the city are still navigating the uncertainty that comes with the collapse.\nBrett Rhodes of Zeke's Coffee in Northeast Baltimore said the loss of the bridge added an extra 20 minutes to their driving routes. \"Now, if there's a disabled vehicle or accident during the morning hours, which will definitely happen, [it] would be a disaster for our drivers,\" Rhodes said in an email.\nHe quickly acknowledged the broader context of the tragedy. \"The real victims here are the workers that were stuck on the bridge during the collapse,\" Rhodes said. \"Who am I to complain about an inconvenience for a couple of years?\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Today, Guessregen, owner of Anthony's, an Italian restaurant in Oxford, shares his love for cooking with people from the Eastern Shore.Guessregen said he learned how to work from his grandmother, whom he affectionately referred to as Nana. At around 7 years old, he could help cook meals for his family when his father worked nights.\nFrom there, he continued to teach himself and gain experience working in various kitchens. At age 12, he worked in a pizzeria, and from there, he went to work on fishing boats and in restaurants in Florida and other states.\nHis experience took him throughout the United States, from New York to Vermont to Oxford, Maryland. For Guessregen, it's essential to maintain the integrity of his food and treat the kitchen with the respect it deserves.\n\"Every day I come in here (to the kitchen), I start off with the idea of a war or a battle,\" Guessregen said. \"There are no games to be played here. I'm really serious about the food itself. So I try to really turn out a top-notch product, and most of the time, I do.\"\nLaura Richeson, director of development and marketing at Talbot Interfaith Shelter, said that Guessregen has worked with Talbot Interfaith, an organization dedicated to ending homelessness on Maryland's Mid-Shore, in raising funds to support the work that the shelter does with assisting people experiencing homelessness.\n\"I think his presence in Oxford is fantastic because it's their only Italian restaurant,\" Richeson said. \"And Anthony is a pleasure to work with. ... He has a heart of gold for the community and cares about the lives of people experiencing homelessness.\"\nRicheson said Guessregen has assisted in raising over $24,000 in funds for the shelter, and they appreciate his work in helping with the fight to end homelessness.\nFor Guessregen, investing in the community is essential to understanding the people better.\n\"For me, if you don't help out, then you're not being part of the community there,\" Guessregen said.\nDale Jafari, a regular at Anthony's, said she is thankful that Guessregen established his restaurant in Oxford.\n\"Anthony's Restaurant in Oxford is one of our favorite places to enjoy a genuine Italian experience,\" Jafari said. \"Extensive menu, great specials and food prepared with the love borne of Italian heritage. We love the dining experience he creates every month, where entertainment is part of the dinner.\"\nGuessregen said he wants to maintain the work he does for his restaurant. He feels accomplished if he can provide customers with a great dining experience.\n\"I can hit a home run with the customers there; that's when it's fun,\" Guessregen said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — On Thursday morning, Blue Heron Coffee buzzed with excitement and laughter as over a dozen patrons engaged with each other. In the center of it all are owners Jay and Heather Hudson.Blue Heron Coffee is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month. Jay Hudson said he spent the first 25 years of his career working in bars and restaurants helping people end their day, and now he wants to spend the next 25 years of his life waking them up.\nJay and Heather Hudson began their business in April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Jay Hudson said they had been working on buying the business before COVID hit and tried their best to work through all the uncertainty around them.\nJay Hudson expressed the difficulties his family had to work through to establish their business. One way they were able to start was by making connections with their customers.\nThe Hudsons would write little messages to every customer, and soon, they were developing connections, learning about customers' hobbies and families and exchanging jokes with each other.\nHeather Hudson said building community is the most crucial aspect of their business.\n\"We just want a safe, inclusive place for people to come,\" Heather Hudson said. \"And even if you don't like coffee, and you want to get a bottle of water or a tea, I just want you to be able to come sit, make new friends or just be quiet and still if that's what you want to do. Having a safe place where you can be yourself is so rare, and I think it's nice that we can provide that.\"\nJay Hudson said that although he loves coffee, people bring him the most joy out of his work.\n\"The coffee is just a vessel,\" Jay Hudson said. \"We put so much care into roasting our own coffee, curating wonderful beans with unique flavor profiles. And we love doing that. But at the end of the day, it's just a vessel to have fun and connect with the community.\"\nWhen news got around that Jay and Heather Hudson would have a profile written about them by the Star Democrat, over a dozen patrons shared their adoration for Blue Heron Coffee and its owners.\nAce Moritz, co-owner of Eastern Shore Brewing in St. Michaels, said Jay Hudson worked as general manager of his business for about seven years, and he expected nothing less from Jay Hudson than utter success and creativity in his business.\n\"I never had any doubt that he was going to knock it out,\" Moritz said. \"His customer loyalty is insane. He cares so much about them, and his customers feel the same way that we all feel about him.\"\nJayme Dingler, a longtime friend and customer, said Jay and Heather are the sweetest people and active community members.\n\"Jay and Heather, they're always out in the community doing things, or they're so entrenched in this community,\" Dingler said. \"They have built this really beautiful community around themselves.\"\nVicki Cotter, a former resident of St. Michaels who now lives in Arizona, eagerly shared why she still buys her coffee from the Blue Heron.\n\"Buying coffee, whether beans or a cup of coffee, became an integral part of my life in St Michaels,\" Cotter said. \"I felt loved every time I walked in. I don't remember how Jay learned my name, but he did. Words that come to mind when I think of Jay are love, hugs, community, coffee.\"\nTim Unsell, a customer from Illinois, said the love that Jay has for his coffee is intense.\n\"The love is evident on the first sip of his Donnie Darko blend,\" Unsell said. \"I believe Jay would legally marry his coffee roaster if certain laws were changed in the Old Line state.\"\nBill Webber, a resident of Hagerstown, said Jay and Heather Hudson made their establishment incredibly welcoming and \"uniquely Hudson.\"\n\"Watching how they interact with customers, from the well-known regulars down the odd first-timer, they all get treated with the same degree of warmth and belonging no matter what or who they are,\" Webber said. \"In short, Jay and Heather are arguably two of the most genuine and compassionate people I have ever met …They are the real deal, and whether they realize it or not, St. Michaels is lucky to have them.\"\nBlue Heron Coffee is located at 500 S. Talbot Street in St. Michaels. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Maryland Starbucks unionizes days before a Supreme Court case on labor rights\n\n April 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MATHEW J. SCHUMER Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 752\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ELLICOTT CITY — Workers at the Shipley's Grant Starbucks cafe voted to unionize this week, just days ahead of a Supreme Court case involving the company's challenge of a federal labor injunction.\"I started working here two and a half years ago, and as soon as I got here, I knew something had to change,\" said Noah Smith, a shift supervisor at the Shipley's Grant shop, which voted 21-2 on Thursday afternoon to unionize. Smith was one of the first three workers at the store to speak with Workers United about organizing the staff.\nDwindling hours coupled with increasing traction of unionization of Starbucks workers across the nation influenced Smith and his coworkers to initiate a union petition, which they filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on March 19.\nData compiled by UnionElections.org shows that 9,270 Starbucks employees are covered by a union — accounting for a bit less than three percent of the company's total workforce.\nThe Shipley's Grant location became the ninth Starbucks cafe in Maryland to unionize. Staff at more stores in the state are expected to go public with unionization efforts in the coming months.\nWorkers at a Starbucks location in Buffalo, New York, made history as the first unionized store in the company when they voted to organize with Workers United in 2021. Over 400 Starbucks locations have unionized since then, spanning 43 states and the District of Columbia.\nIn early 2023, corporate-level decisions led to reduced hours among the workers at the Shipley's Grant cafe. While full-time employees saw only marginal schedule changes, part-timers came face-to-face with the possibility of losing health care benefits and access to free education — both offered to staff members working a minimum of 20 to 22 hours a week.\nThe team of 27 employees has a tough time ensuring every staff member works enough throughout the week to receive benefits, according to Smith. He added that workers often need to pick up shifts at other stores to meet the quota.\nSmith said that one of the primary goals of unionizing was to establish a dialogue with the corporate leaders at Starbucks, setting clear guidelines about minimum working hours and clearer expectations for employees.\nAnother focal point of the unionization effort is to create a more inclusive work environment at the cafe. Smith shared a story about a recent directive from the store's district manager to remove a Progress Pride Flag the workers had hung up in the store.\nSince the staff went public with its petition to unionize, Smith said that Starbucks management also began enforcing a dress policy prohibiting workers from wearing union t-shirts on the clock.\nStarbucks did not respond to a request for comment.\nAt other locations, the company has taken more serious action against union promotion, going as far as firing pro-union employees at several stores, NLRB judges have ruled.\nIn total, the NLRB has taken legal action in more than 700 unfair labor practice cases leveled against Starbucks by employees — the majority of which were filed in the last couple of years.\nStarbucks Corp. most recently lost an appeal in the District of Columbia Circuit Court in which the company challenged an NLRB ruling to stop interfering with workers' unionization efforts at a Seattle location.\nThe Supreme Court case involves a suit by Starbucks against the NLRB involving company actions against workers at a store in Memphis, Tennessee, in 2022, including the firing of seven employees for allegedly associating with the Workers United union.\nIn October 2023, Starbucks filed a petition for the case to be heard by the Supreme Court, which was granted in January. The question presented by the company to the court is whether NLRB injunctions should be subject to the same standards in all jurisdictions.\nAs it stands, injunctions filed by the board are evaluated by courts in some jurisdictions using a two-factor test, whereas other jurisdictions use a four-factor test to determine if they are warranted. An affirmative decision in this case would establish the four-factor test in all jurisdictions.\nBoth parties presented their arguments to the court on Tuesday.\nStarbucks and Workers United announced in February that collective bargaining negotiations would begin in the near future. Discussions are scheduled to begin towards the end of this month.\nOnce the Shipley's Grant vote is certified by the NLRB, the cafe's staff will join nationwide bargaining discussions affecting unionized Starbucks workers across the United States.\n\"I'm not going to be here forever, but the next people that come behind me, I want them to have a store that's safe and inclusive and open and with them,\" said Smith. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Millington solar farm granted approval for construction\n\n April 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Business \n \n 539\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n MILLINGTON — The Queen Anne's County Planning Commission granted major site plan approval for construction of a 64-megawatt utility scale solar project in Millington.Jones Farm Lane Solar will be constructing a 64-megawatt utility scale solar project on a 601-acre parcel, located at 148 Jones Farm Lane in the Agricultural Zoning District.\nThe parcel includes a fenced solar array area of 319 acres southeast of Millington in the far northeast corner of the county, according to county Principal Development Review Planner Rob Gunther.\nThe property, owned by John and Ruth Stoltzfus of Kennedyville, will be leased by Urban Grid as Jones Farm Lane Solar for 35 years.\nSite plan features for the proposed solar project include more than 150,000 panels, 22 inverters and transformers. The project will deliver 64 megawatts of power to the point of interconnection, Gunther said.\nThis plan received original concept approval in 2017 and first set of conditional use and variances in 2018, according to Gunther.\nThe property was previously utilized for agricultural production, but the fields are currently fallow, planning staff reported at the April 11 commission meeting.\nThe project is located within the county's utility scale overlay solar district.\nThe project's property collector substation will collect and deliver the power to the Delmarva Power Substation that will be located on a separate lot and subdivided from the parcel.\nA portion of the project site has an existing Delmarva Power and Light transmission line easement running through it.\nThe property is laid out to ensure constructor workers can park on site and tractor trailers can fully enter and navigate the property without risking traffic backlogging on adjacent roads, Nick Leffner, engineer of Kimley-Horn and Associates said.\nUtility scale solar projects are required to plant landscape buffers 50 feet wide where significant vegetation doesn't already exist. The applicant has already installed buffers along Blanco Road and the southeastern property line, he said.\nAccording to Leffner, \"Almost the entire project is surrounded by existing forest in the sense of providing screening and buffering.\"\nThe majority of the areas underneath the arrays will be grass, he said.\nAn annual ground cover will be put in place as a temporary stabilization during the construction. As the project near completion and electrical wiring is installed, the area will be stabilized with a permanent ground cover.\nVery little topsoil will be removed from the site, he said.\nThe property has two listings on the Maryland listing of historic properties, the location of the former Noble House in the center, as well as the area of the Jones Farm homestead itself, he said. There is also an area of archaeological significance within the property with a 50 feet fenced buffer to be placed around the area.\nStaff do not have experience with the aftermath of the project because no solar projects have been decommissioned yet, Gunther said.\n\"Knowing there is an expected life cycle for the project, decommissioning would happen at the end of the project,\" with panels and posts removed and often recycled, Leffner said.\nThere is a requirement with the county to put a decommissioning bond in place in the event the project reaches the end of its usefulness or is no longer operating for whatever reason, he said.\nWith approval granted, construction for the Jones Farm Lane Solar project is expected to begin soon, according to Leffner. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Parking requirements for site businesses such as the boat storage facility are based on square footage and do not necessarily need that much parking, Gunther said.\nWith the modified concept plan approved, the Bay Bridge Marina duplex dwellings and hotel project next seeks sewer water allocation and an Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance study to address traffic and school capacities to begin the site plan process. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The public-private partnership is designed to accelerate innovation in the U.S. biopharmaceutical industry, which produces vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, gene therapies and other medical products derived from biological sources.\nNIIMBL Director Kelvin Lee said the SABRE Center will allow researchers to further test and refine innovations developed at NIIMBL.\n\"This facility would provide a place where we can actually test how those technologies work in a manufacturing environment,\" Lee said. \"And then if we need to modify or make adjustments to make it more suitable, we then have those lessons learned.\"\nSen. Chris Coons said the COVID-19 pandemic, and the speed at which a vaccine was developed, demonstrated the power of biopharmaceuticals.\n\"What is going to be possible with this institute, with its next phase, is to speed up the cycle of innovation,\" Coons said.\nThat innovation, he said, will give birth to new companies.\n\"Spinning out from that will be a remarkable next generation of opportunities for Delawareans to work in biotech and in manufacturing, for companies to be launched here and regionally,\" Coons said.\nSABRE will also be a training ground for people looking to develop the skills needed to work in high-tech biopharmaceutical manufacturing.\n\"This facility provides an opportunity for people to get trained in how you gown up properly, how you move through a facility properly, how you actually operate pieces of equipment,\" Lee said.\nHaving a skilled workforce here will help attract new pharmaceutical companies to Delaware. UD officials have previously said that the SABRE Center will bring 3,500 jobs to Delaware over the next decade.\n\"Places that have very effective training programs typically find a significant amount of capital investment coming down the road, where companies want to build their factories there because they know they can access a talent pool to staff their factories,\" Lee said.\nSen. Tom Carper said the SABRE Center is an important addition to the STAR Campus, which already boasts 1 million square feet of new development on what used to be the Chrysler assembly plant.\n\"While we're not going to build tanks here anymore, we're not going to build Chrysler products here anymore, we are going to be building facilities that help provide medicines that will make us a healthier country and a healthier world,\" Carper said.\nSo far, the SABRE Center has secured $45 million in investment from the federal government and $30 million from the state.\nLee declined to say when the new facility will open. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But the business owners and married couple are in no rush to sell it or the restaurant itself.\n\"We love it, and we love what we've built,\" Jeannie VanDyke said about the restaurant, later adding, \"We just wanted to let people know that it's something we would be interested in if there's someone out there that would love it as much as we do.\"\nLil' Bitta Bull started as a food truck in 2017. The restaurant has operated out of its current location on Race Street since 2021.\nVanDyke said she has loved their journey with Lil' Bitta Bull. With the food truck, they helped create legislation to allow food trucks in Cambridge, she said. On Glasgow Street — where the restaurant was located before the Race Street location opened — VanDyke said they created a restaurant environment where Carol's Kitchen currently is.\n\"So it's like we're helping not just Lil' Bitta Bull, but also the people who come (after) us to have it a little bit easier.\"\nVanDyke said that since putting the restaurant on the market, they have talked with \"a couple\" people who are interested. She said she didn't know their level of interest, however.\nVanDyke said she and her husband are more focused on running the business, letting the realtor handle the sale side of things. According to the Powell Realtors' website, the property is listed for $850,000.\nIf the couple does end up selling Lil' Bitta Bull, it doesn't mean they're quitting the restaurant game.\nVanDyke said they own a building in Hurlock that they hope to turn into a gastropub.\n\"Somewhere in North Dorchester that you could get a high-end burger,\" she said. \"We love mom-and-pop (shops), but there's not anything in Hurlock other than mom-and-pops, which is more of your home-cooked food.\"\nVanDyke said the gastropub would be a place where people could get something a little higher-end, and it wouldn't step on the toes of the mom-and-pop restaurants already in business in Hurlock.\nFor those that know the VanDykes, it doesn't come as a surprise that they're making plans for another food business. VanDyke said her and her husband's first date nights were \"sitting around, planning the food truck.\"\n\"You know that saying, 'If you want to impress me with you're vehicle, it better be a food truck?'\" she said. \"That kind of is our relationship.\"\nThis isn't something they haven't done before. In December 2022, the couple leased the space for and sold DoCo Axe Co. — an axe throwing, escape room and virtual reality game business in Cambridge — to new owners.\n\"We love that we were able to build something that somebody else was able to come in, take over and continue the dream of owning a business and operating a business,\" VanDyke said. \"So that's kind of what has inspired us to offer (Lil' Bitta Bull) for sale.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Battle lines being drawn for tax fights in 2025\n\n April 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 790\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Earlier this month I joined countless Marylanders in filing my federal and state income tax returns.As I did so, the timeless observations of Benjamin Franklin came to mind: \"In this world nothing is certain except death and taxes.\"\nAfter the Maryland General Assembly adjourned, I suggest Ben was only partly right.\nI suggest that in Maryland, almost certain are new state taxes, state tax increases, new state fees and state fee increases. The only uncertainties about them are when and how much.\nBefore the 2024 Maryland General Assembly adjourned for the year, this matter was discussed at length but never fully settled. Some relatively modest tax and fee increases were approved, but none as large as or as far reaching as expected.\nNone will be approved throughout the balance of this year. The earliest formal discussions on any tax increases can happen is after the General Assembly reconvenes in January 2025.\nBattle lines are already being drawn.\nProponents and opponents of tax increases are busy organizing and promoting their positions. Not surprisingly, there are stark and irreconcilable differences between them.\nThe Maryland Public Policy Institute recently released a statement headlined \"Tax increases Are Never Inevitable.\"\nThe statement includes the following messages: \"Maryland's political leaders would have us believe the state is in a fiscal mess through no fault of their own and that the only solution is massive tax hikes that they've put on hold — for now. This narrative, however, both misrepresents the problem and ignores a real and preferable solution. When pressed, responsible lawmakers admit that the primary cause of the budget chaos at both state and county levels is the Blueprint for Maryland's Future (a.k.a. Kirwan) education plan. The Spending Affordability Committee projected that budget shortfalls will increase substantially over the next five years \"due to the need for general funds to support costs related to the Blueprint.\"\nThe recommended treatments are to \"minimize the enactment of new mandates,\" increase \"efficiency,\" and \"consider revenue options.\" Sadly, legislators seem focused only on that last tactic — i.e., tax hikes. But the Blueprint is not Holy Writ etched in stone. And tax hikes on hard-working Marylanders are not inevitable. Instead of pretending to have no way out, lawmakers could choose to alter the Blueprint's mandates or eliminate it altogether.\"\nSupporters of Kirwan especially the Democratic super majorities in the General Assembly and the state teachers' union have a much different view.\nThey support increasing state revenues to a level to ensure Kirwan is fully implemented as it was written when the current version was approved by the General Assembly.\nThey believe they have public support for that. They may be right.\nA recent article in the Baltimore Sun had the following headline: \"Majority of Statewide Voters Support Blueprint for Maryland's Future.\"\nThe article included the following.\n\"An overwhelming majority of Marylanders support the state's ambitious Blueprint for Maryland's Future education plan, according to a new poll done for The Baltimore Sun, the University of Baltimore and FOX45. Nearly three quarters of the 1,300 likely general election voters polled across Maryland said they supported the Blueprint. When the poll asked about potential changes to the plan to lessen its financial pressures on local [education] budgets, 55% said they supported making some reduction, such as cutting all-day prekindergarten programs (24%), or teacher pay raises (11%). However, 29% said they would not cut anything.'\"\nThe professional pollster who conducted the survey opined the results indicate \"profound, widespread\" support among voters for the landmark education plan, tempered by \"a willingness to set adjustments.\nHe further observed, \"It's very hard to argue against public education. The intent [of the Blueprint] tracks with the priorities of Maryland voters.\"\nI suggest the results of this survey, like the results of all surveys, only reflect public sentiment at a point in time. How durable those poll results has yet to be seen.\nThe pollster did acknowledge one huge unresolved issue that cannot be ignored going forward.\nHe said, \"Local school boards will have to balance how to fund their school districts with meeting their Blueprint financial burden, which could force [school board] members to cut local initiatives. Will it force school boards to cut other things? That's where the electoral equation changes.\"\nThat is a key observation that leads to more certainty on discussions and debates on taxes and fees in Maryland.\nBetween now and January 2025, supporters and opponents of Kirwan will be aggressively engaged in efforts to inform, galvanize and mobilize voters to support their respective positions ranging from maintaining Kirwan as presently written, adopting modifications to Kirwan and the necessity for and scope of revenue sources needed to fully fund implantation of whatever the final form Kirwan turns out to be.\nDepending on the outcomes, those efforts may continue well beyond next year.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lierman calls for better support of day care in Maryland\n\n May 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 640\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On April 26, Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman made a stop to visit the Talbot County Council on her tour of the Eastern Shore. She has been traveling around the state to let different county councils know what the comptroller is up to.Her stops emphasized getting women back into the workplace in Maryland by supporting them with better day care.\nThe council members asked questions after Lierman's 15-minute update.\n\"I have three key roles as comptroller. No. 1 is to act as an elected CFO. To see every dollar in and every dollar out of the state. We also pay all the employees and balance all the books with a general accounting of the state. The second responsibility is that we act as, or I am on, a number of financial boards for the state,\" Lierman said.\nShe said she was on the Board of Public Works, which approves major contracts and any contract or grant over $200,000. She is on the State Retirement and Pension System Board with $65 billion in assets.\nHer third role as comptroller is revenue administrator.\n\"We just finished tax season, and I will give you a little update,\" Lierman said. \"We have processed about $2.7 billion tax returns. We are ahead of schedule from last year. We have sent out refunds to 1.7 million Maryland households.\"\nThen Lierman got into how the Board of Public Works affects Talbot County.\n\"We have approved five projects worth almost $1 million since I took office,\" she said. \"For the renovation and expansion of the St. Michaels Library and a 665-foot living shoreline as well.\"\nShe touted the modernization of her office.\n\"Louis Goldstein used to brag that he took the Office of the Comptroller from pencil and paper to the mainframe. We now we are moving from the mainframe to the cloud. … The online portal is called Maryland Tax Connect. We launched it in February,\" she said.\nThe number of workers is affecting the state's economic profile.\n\"We are constrained in our economic growth because we don't have the labor force we need. We have seen a lower labor force participation rate in Maryland since the pandemic. Other states have rebounded, and we have not. We have lost around 181,000 workers since COVID,\" she said.\nOne of the key demographics is loss of women in the workforce.\n\"We lost about 2%, and nationally was about 1%. One of the key reasons that we did see, and that was cited, is the cost of child care,\" she said.\nEarlier in the day, Lierman visited Critchlow Adkins Day Care Children's Center of Easton and found that they have a waiting list of over 100 people for their services.\n\"If we are talking about the economy and we are not talking about child care, we are missing a big part of the picture. It is a key piece of economic development,\" she said.\n\"We are the eighth most costly state for child care in the nation right now. We lost a number of child care spots in the pandemic, and we haven't recovered all of them. We need accessible, and affordable and high quality child care available for families who want to have working parents, who need to get out into the workforce,\" Lierman said.\nThe council members had questions for Lierman.\nCouncil member Lynne Mielke asked about affordable housing. Lierman responded with statistics about the population shrinking in Maryland because people are moving away. People are moving from high-cost to low-cost-of-living states.\nShe said the No. 1 reason for people moving is the cost of housing.\n\"The support for housing really comes from the Department of Housing and Community Development budget,\" she said.\n\"Part of your housing crunch is because you have so many short-term rentals. It used to be long-term rentals. You on the Shore face this,\" Lierman said.\nLierman invited those who want to learn more about her office and Maryland's economy to go to marylandtaxes.gov. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Since then, it has awarded over $900,000 to 112 Mid-Shore nonprofits. This year, the organization has awarded 18 grants totaling over $62,000 to nonprofits.\nAt the event, two community awards were given to recognize individuals who embody the mission of the Women and Girls Fund.\nKaludis presented the Women and Girls Fund Award to Amy Blades Steward for her \"grace, dedication and for consistently sharing a generosity of spirit.\"\nDuring Steward's acceptance speech, she thanked all the women in her life for uplifting her and her father for teaching her to desire to make her community a better place. Steward ended her speech with a quote from Sara Blakey, the world's youngest self-made female billionaire and inventor of Spanx.\n\"'When you help a woman fulfill her potential, magic happens.' I believe it does. Each of us in this room can do that for someone else in our lives. Be that person, and leave that legacy if you can. It matters,\" Steward said.\nRyan presented Childlene Brooks with the Sheryl V. Kerr Award for her \"exceptional contribution in the community.\"\nDuring Brooks' acceptance speech, she thanked her church, family, co-workers and daughters. She said she hoped she has helped someone feel inspire to volunteer their time to help others.\n\"As a wise man once said, 'Our actions tell who we are.' Hopefully, my actions have made a positive impact on someone,\" Brooks said. \"I know there are many women in the Eastern Shore area who are eligible for this award, so I'm humbled to be selected.\"\nAllison Prell, chair of the Women and Girls Fund's Grants Committee, presented 18 organizations with annual grants. The organizations awarded included children's programs, domestic violence support and women's health programs.\nThese organizations received grant awards: Academy Art Museum, Benedictine School for Exceptional Children, Community Mediation Upper Shore, Compass Regional Hospice, Critchlow Adkins Children's Centers, For All Seasons, Girls on the Run of the Greater Chesapeake, Haven Ministries, Imagination Library of Talbot County, Kent Attainable Housing, Open Doors Partners in Education, Partners in Care Maryland, Pine Street Committee, Talbot Community Connections, Talbot Hospice, Talbot Interfaith Shelter, Tilghman Area Youth Association and YMCA of the Chesapeake.\nDuring final remarks, Kaludis told the attendees that none of the organization's work would be possible without the guidance of women and the work that they do to uplift each other.\n\"Some of us here are writing our first chapter, and some of us are writing our 44th chapter,\" Kaludis said. \"It doesn't matter which chapter; it just doesn't. The beauty of it is we all have a next chapter. And each one is a new opportunity for exploration, adventure, growth and service.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dire Straits: Across the country, communities continue to navigate sky high housing costs\n\n May 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National enterprise editor | Section: Business \n \n 987\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Hannah Edwards is on the frontlines of America's housing crunch in the southernmost reaches of the U.S, and it's a very tough battle.Edwards works for Habitat for Humanity in the Florida Keys. The archipelago of small tropical islands offers some of the most expensive and housing constrained communities in the country.\n\"It's pretty dire down here,\" said Edwards, who is assistant director for the housing group's affiliate in Key West and the Lower Keys, noting an entry-level home costs $700,000, with high costs driven by stricter building codes and exorbitant insurance costs because of hurricanes and the prevalence of short-term rentals and second homes. \"We don't have any more land. Land is at a premium.\"\nThe average home price in the Florida Keys is more than $1.1 million, with Florida's statewide home prices averaging $415,300, according to real estate firm RedFin. Home prices in Florida are up 67% since 2019.\nHomeowners insurance rates in Florida averaged close to $11,000 annually in 2023 — more than $8,600 higher than the U.S. average — and are expected to approach $11,800 this year, according to Insurify, a Massachusetts-based insurance firm.\nApartment rents are just as burdensome, averaging more than $4,000 per month across the Keys, according to real estate firm Zumper Inc. That results in tourism-industry and other workers and their families living in crowded residences, older trailer parks or commuting significant distances.\n'JUST A DROP IN THE BUCKET'\nBut housing costs and the lack of affordable housing — especially for seniors, service workers and lower-income households — are not unique to the Keys or any other community.\nClose to one out of three U.S. households (including more than 41% of renters) spend more than one-third of their income on housing, according to Harvard University.\nNationally, the median sales price for a home was $393,500, according to the National Association of Realtors. That's up more than 57% from pre-pandemic levels in 2019.\nThe median asking apartment rent was $1,987 per month nationally in March, not far off the record high of $2,054 set in 2022, according to RedFin. That is roughly double pre-pandemic levels.\nIn the Mountain West, populations are growing, but don't always have communities with critical mass to draw new construction and national builders. The lack of housing stock and affordable inventories is hitting middle-income and lower-income workers hard.\nScott Hoversland, executive director of the Wyoming Community Development Authority, said the situation is impacting service workers hardest, particularly in tourism-oriented areas.\n\"Rents have gone way up,\" he said.\nAverage rents in Wyoming have risen from $652 in 2010 to $1,249 currently, according to numbers from Multinumeric LLC and RentalRealEstate.com.\nThat's a 92% increase.\nIt's a common trend across the region and the rest of the country, with average apartment rents also north of $1,200 in Idaho and Montana, approaching $1,800 in Colorado and Washington state, and above $1,600 in Florida and Oregon, according to RentalRealEstate.com.\nAverage monthly rents are even more expensive in big cities such as New York ($3,781), San Francisco ($2,825) and Boston ($3,369), according to Apartments.com\nMeanwhile, available housing for middle-income and first-time buyers has decreased.\nAccording to a new housing assessment in Wyoming, the median home value in 2010 was $174,000. The statewide figure now stands at more than $322,600, according to ATTOM Data Solutions.\nThat's an 85% jump.\n'IT'S KIND OF CRAZY'\nHoversland said the rise in home prices and rents during the pandemic and the post-pandemic inflation wave and resulting interest rate hikes have discouraged entry level and move-up sales.\n\"The costs of most things have gone up,\" he said. \"Inflation is so high that it makes it tough for anybody to get in.\"\nHoversland, who is also involved with Habitat for Humanity efforts, said the situation is tough in expensive areas, such as Jackson Hole, which struggles to keep and hire service workers (including snow plow drivers).\nHoversland said higher costs are also hitting builders, adding to their incentives to build more expensive homes.\nHe said the cost to build has gone from $150 per square foot in pre-pandemic real estate markets to $350 to $450 per foot now.\n\"It's kind of crazy,\" Hoversland said.\nIn Florida, Edwards said rising home values are stressing longtime homeowners with higher property taxes. She also worries about tourism workers (many of them living in trailers), teachers and public safety employees leaving the Keys.\n\"If they can't buy a house, they are going to leave,\" she said. \"We aren't going to have certain age groups. I think, in 20 years, I wonder how the economy is going to be working.\"\nLocal Habitat for Humanity branches are helping seniors and other existing income-qualified homeowners with repairs and are developing some affordable units, but those are smaller projects trying to address a big challenge.\n\"That's just a drop in the bucket, but it's the best we can do,\" Edwards said.\nLEFT BEHIND\nIn northwestern Wisconsin's Chippewa Valley, Susan Wolfgram and Paul Savides said housing challenges are pronounced, especially for lower-income workers and seniors making $30,000 or less per year.\nThey are part of an interfaith housing effort called JONAH (Joining our Neighbors, Advancing Hope) that aims to bring local developers, government planners and tenants together.\n\"We have 40% of our workforce that is making $30,000 or less per year,\" said Wolfgram, who also serves on the Eau Claire Plan Commission and as co-director of the Eau Claire Tenant-Landlord Resource Center. \"We don't have any housing for those particular seniors and low-income folks.\"\nLike other regions, cost burdens and barriers have risen, with smaller apartments costing $1,000 per month and rental housing for families more than $2,000 per month, according to Wolfgram.\nSavides said the entry point to buy a home is approaching $300,000.\n\"Wages are so far behind housing costs,\" Wolfgram said.\nBut the Wisconsin pair, along with affordable housing cohorts in Wyoming, Florida and across the U.S., are working to overcome a host of challenges and implement creative ideas and best practices to address the housing crunch.\nIn Part 2 of this series, we will look at some of the impediments to building more affordable housing and how housing advocates are navigating those waters. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Capts. Judy and Tom Bixler are sailing through the waters to provide residents and tourists a chance to experience this \"Icon of Talbot County.\"Judy Bixler said she and her husband have been leading the ferry for over 20 years. Now, they are looking to find someone to whom they can pass on the legacy of the ferry, someone who will maintain its historic status.\n\"It's really a great job,\" Bixler said. \"We love what we do, and we hate to give it up in one sense, but our grandchildren are getting older, and we'd like to have some time to spend with them.\"\nJudy Bixler said she and Tom are a small part of the Oxford Bellevue Ferry's long, beautiful life.\nThe Oxford Bellevue Ferry is America's oldest privately owned ferry. Its original ownership was established in 1683. As its name implies, the ferry provides transportation services for vehicles, bicycles, motorcycles and passengers between the incorporated town of Oxford and the historic working community of Bellevue.\nIt has plied the waters of the Tred Avon River for over three centuries, providing another entrance into Oxford by water and a shortcut to St. Michaels and Tilghman when leaving Oxford.\nIt has been named one of the top 25 bicycle routes in the USA for many years.\nThanks to the Oxford Museum and a grant from Maryland Humanities, signs depicting the 341-year history of the ferry are displayed along the bulkhead, offering a history lesson with the trip.\nJudy Bixler said she enjoys the ability to use the ferry as a tool to help nonprofit organizations raise money and bring the Talbot community together. Through ferry racing, the Bixlers raised money for the Oxford Fire Department, for the Richardson Museum and for a cancer foundation.\nTalbot County Economic Development and Tourism Director Cassandra Vanhooser said that Judy and Tom Bixler are a staple of the ferry.\n\"Capt. Judy and Capt. Tom are the face of hospitality for so many visitors that come to Talbot County,\" Vanhooser said. \"They are terrific ambassadors, and I can't say enough great things about them.\"\nVanhooser said they are on the hunt for the next ambassador for the ferry. Although she doesn't like the idea of not having the Bixlers leading the ferry, she knows that another ambassador will hold the same love for the ferry that Judy and Tom Bixler have.\n\"It's hard for us who have such love and affection for them to think about a ferry without them, but there will be another keeper of the ferry,\" Vanhooser said.\nRay Stevens, an Oxford resident, said that Tom and Judy Bixler are great stewards of the ferry and will be missed for all the great work they have done for the ferry and the county.\n\"The ferry is a staple of the community,\" Stevens said. \"It's been owned these last few years by Tom and Judy Bixler, who have just taken care of it and used it to benefit so many things in Oxford and Talbot County.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Our history tells the power of immigrants\n\n May 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RICK SCHIMING | Section: News \n \n 791\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n While Donald Trump is wrong about almost everything, he is especially mistaken about the role of immigrants in our economy.Immigrants are not \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" Rather they are a needed transfusion of youth and vitality into our economy and labor force.\nOur history tells the power of immigrants. The U.S. became the world's major economic power in large part due to the waves of immigrants arriving on our shores and going to work.\nImmigrants make us a younger nation especially compared to the major industrial nations in the G7. Among those nations, the U.S. has the youngest median population age of 38.8 years with the average of 45 years of those other nations.\nLocally, Talbot County's median age is 51.1 years, making us the oldest county in Maryland. Most other counties in Maryland have a median age between 35 and 42 years. Four of the five next oldest counties also are located on the Eastern Shore. Increased immigration would lower the median age and give our county and the Eastern Shore a boost of increased demographic and economic vitality.\nImmigrants are not \"animals.\" Each additional person entering our labor force whether native or foreign born expands our production possibilities, enabling us to produce more goods and services for the whole economy. In a very real sense, immigrants provide us with a gift of years and years of productive labor and entrepreneurship that we should be grateful to receive.\nMuch of our high-tech industry and Silicon Valley is already populated by immigrants. Who knows what gifts new immigrants may yet give us in the future?\nDo we have room for all these immigrants in our nation and economy? The answer is clearly yes.\nIn the U.S. labor market, there are currently about 9 million unfilled jobs, jobs where employers are often desperately seeking workers but unable to find them. Filling those jobs would reduce inflationary pressure. Locally, crab packers end up begging every year for more immigrant crab pickers. One can only wonder how two of the Eastern Shore's iconic industries, poultry and seafood, would survive without the contributions of immigrants.\nImmigrants provide an opportunity to repopulate those rural areas of our country that have slow-growing or declining populations and economies. We have plenty of room for immigrants. In terms of population density, the U.S. has fewer people per square mile than all the other G7 nations besides Canada. If we had the same population density as the average of the other nations in the G7, we would have room for nearly 2 billion people.\nTalbot County's population density is even less than that of the U.S., so we have even more room.\nImmigrants are not \"parasites.\" They benefit our economy in many ways. Just as one example, by paying into Medicare and Social Security, they extend the lifetime of these two vital programs. Undocumented immigrants alone contribute over $10 billion into the Social Security trust fund and $3 billion into Medicare trust fund every year.\nYounger immigrant workers are essential in maintaining the health of Social Security and Medicare since they pay into the trust fund for many years before they start receiving any benefits. Other industrial nations with a higher median age population are finding their social safety net for older citizens to be much more at risk.\nImmigrants are not \"destroying the fabric of our country.\" Foreign born adults in the U.S. have a higher labor force participation rate, a greater percentage of prime working age adults, and start more businesses than native born Americans. Forty-five percent of the Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children.\nImmigrants also provide the economic benefit of increased local spending. A dollar of spending by an immigrant at Lowe's or Giant or any other business in Talbot County has exactly the same economic impact as a dollar spent by a lifelong resident of the Eastern Shore.\nWhile immigration provides many benefits, it does comes with some costs. For example, to turn those increased production possibilities into actual production requires some additional efforts in education and assimilation. (For those worried about the costs of undocumented immigrants and border security, Congress has a bipartisan bill already drafted that addresses those concerns if Donald Trump wants to fix immigration now.)\nBut the basic rule of economics still applies: as long as the benefits of any action (immigration) exceed its costs, the society should welcome more of that activity.\nThe bottom line as reported by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is that immigration will add $7 trillion in economic activity for the U.S. in the next 10 years. The benefits of immigration clearly exceed the costs, and we should welcome immigrants to our shores. Immigration is a gift that keeps on giving.\nRick Schiming is a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum and lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 3.9 cents per gallon higher than a month ago and stand 23.9 cents per gallon higher than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has dropped 3.4 cents in the last week and stands at $3.94 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $3.19 per gallon yesterday while the most expensive was $4.39 per gallon, a difference of $1.20 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has fallen 1 cent per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.62 per gallon today. The national average is up 2.7 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 11.1 cents per gallon higher than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nMay 6, 2023: $3.41 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.50 per gallon)\nMay 6, 2022: $4.37 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.29 per gallon)\nMay 6, 2021: $2.85 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.95 per gallon)\nMay 6, 2020: $1.87 per gallon (U.S. Average: $1.80 per gallon)\nMay 6, 2019: $2.81 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.89 per gallon)\nMay 6, 2018: $2.78 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.80 per gallon)\nMay 6, 2017: $2.33 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.34 per gallon)\nMay 6, 2016: $2.26 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.22 per gallon)\nMay 6, 2015: $2.61 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.64 per gallon)\nMay 6, 2014: $3.67 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.67 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.64 per gallon, down 6.2 cents per gallon from last week's $3.70 per gallon.\nWashington, D.C.: $3.73 per gallon, up 5.9 cents per gallon from last week's $3.67 per gallon.\nHagerstown: $3.73 per gallon, down 2.2 cents per gallon from last week's $3.75 per gallon.\n\"We've seen the national average fade slightly again as oil prices have cooled and our spring peak appears to be more confidently behind us,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"While refinery utilization rates last week indicated that there is still some refinery maintenance work to be done, oil prices have helped put downward pressure on gasoline prices, with oil falling below $80 per barrel last week. In addition, a weaker than expected jobs report is adding to some concerns that gasoline demand could remain weak through the summer driving season, which is just a few weeks from beginning. With the seasonal factors behind us, looking ahead, we expect gasoline prices to continue cooling alongside diesel prices as we look forward to Memorial Day weekend.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She is a mother, she is working on a doctorate in education and she was recently appointed as president of the Preston Commissioners.And, she has just cut the ribbon on her new business support services building.\nWinston has turned a 3,900-square-foot old bank into a multifaceted space to incubate other businesses.\n\"We do administrative support services. So part of that is to offer the business center services, you can come in and get your copies made, fax, scan, notary,\" Winston said. She also offers call center services and tax returns.\nHer business's name is Van Tech Business Solutions. With it, she hopes to provide support to other local entrepreneurs.\nThe chamber of commerce has been a huge support in her efforts, Winston said, along with her friends, family and other community members.\n\"Tracy Snyder, director, she led the ribbon cutting ceremony. The whole community was there. People came from near and far. I had family that traveled in, and I had other businesswomen that traveled from the western shore to come over in support. My bishop was here to bless the building,\" she said.\nEntrepreneurs see potential where others just drive by, Winston said. She is hoping to employ five people.\n\"That was one of the goals behind purchasing this property. As well as carrying out the vision of the mayor to bring economic development to the town. For so long this building was vacant. It has been a great six months of development,\" she said.\nShe reached out to the Maryland Capital Enterprise Women's Business Center in Salisbury to get help with her loan. She shared her business plan and didn't have any problem getting the funding, she said.\n\"This is all part of my leadership is to empower women in business, to really get out there. If you have a business, don't be afraid,\" Winston said.\nWinston has a lot of space. Her own business needs only require about ¼ of the whole footprint. She plans to rent out the remaining space to long-term tenants as well as offer desks and office space for short-term business needs.\nShe has two renters already. One is Elegant Affairs event planning service and the other is Eternal Love Cleaning Service. There will also be a musical organ repairman, who will have his showroom in the back. She wants to open her front lot to food trucks.\n\"If you work from home or remotely, you can just come in and work in a different space or meet a client here. I also have more private office space you can rent by the day. Just go on my website and reserve your space for the day — you have a furnished office,\" she said.\nShe knows this will bring more businesses to town, another one of her goals, both as a businessperson and as a local elected official.\n\"If you want to see more businesses come to town, you have to lead the way,\" she said. \"... I am an entrepreneur. It is all about bringing the resources to the community and allowing others to also to grow and expand their business opportunities. Why not do it together? I love partnerships and collaboration,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Dire Straits: Across the country, communities continue to navigate sky high housing costs\n\n May 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National enterprise editor | Section: News \n \n 988\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Hannah Edwards is on the frontlines of America's housing crunch in the southernmost reaches of the U.S, and it's a very tough battle.Edwards works for Habitat for Humanity in the Florida Keys. The archipelago of small tropical islands offers some of the most expensive and housing constrained communities in the country.\n\"It's pretty dire down here,\" said Edwards, who is assistant director for the housing group's affiliate in Key West and the Lower Keys, noting an entry-level home costs $700,000, with high costs driven by stricter building codes and exorbitant insurance costs because of hurricanes and the prevalence of short-term rentals and second homes. \"We don't have any more land. Land is at a premium.\"\nThe average home price in the Florida Keys is more than $1.1 million, with Florida's statewide home prices averaging $415,300, according to real estate firm RedFin. Home prices in Florida are up 67% since 2019.\nHomeowners insurance rates in Florida averaged close to $11,000 annually in 2023 — more than $8,600 higher than the U.S. average — and are expected to approach $11,800 this year, according to Insurify, a Massachusetts-based insurance firm.\nApartment rents are just as burdensome, averaging more than $4,000 per month across the Keys, according to real estate firm Zumper Inc. That results in tourism-industry and other workers and their families living in crowded residences, older trailer parks or commuting significant distances.\n'Just a drop in the bucket' But housing costs and the lack of affordable housing — especially for seniors, service workers and lower-income households — are not unique to the Keys or any other community.\nClose to one out of three U.S. households (including more than 41% of renters) spend more than one-third of their income on housing, according to Harvard University.\nNationally, the median sales price for a home was $393,500, according to the National Association of Realtors. That's up more than 57% from pre-pandemic levels in 2019.\nThe median asking apartment rent was $1,987 per month nationally in March, not far off the record high of $2,054 set in 2022, according to RedFin. That is roughly double pre-pandemic levels.\nIn the Mountain West, populations are growing, but don't always have communities with critical mass to draw new construction and national builders. The lack of housing stock and affordable inventories is hitting middle-income and lower-income workers hard.\nScott Hoversland, executive director of the Wyoming Community Development Authority, said the situation is impacting service workers hardest, particularly in tourism-oriented areas.\n\"Rents have gone way up,\" he said.\nAverage rents in Wyoming have risen from $652 in 2010 to $1,249 currently, according to numbers from Multinumeric LLC and RentalRealEstate.com.\nThat's a 92% increase.\nIt's a common trend across the region and the rest of the country, with average apartment rents also north of $1,200 in Idaho and Montana, approaching $1,800 in Colorado and Washington state, and above $1,600 in Florida and Oregon, according to RentalRealEstate.com.\nAverage monthly rents are even more expensive in big cities such as New York ($3,781), San Francisco ($2,825) and Boston ($3,369), according to Apartments.com\nMeanwhile, available housing for middle-income and first-time buyers has decreased.\nAccording to a new housing assessment in Wyoming, the median home value in 2010 was $174,000. The statewide figure now stands at more than $322,600, according to ATTOM Data Solutions.\nThat's an 85% jump.\n'It's kind of crazy'Hoversland said the rise in home prices and rents during the pandemic and the post-pandemic inflation wave and resulting interest rate hikes have discouraged entry level and move-up sales.\n\"The costs of most things have gone up,\" he said. \"Inflation is so high that it makes it tough for anybody to get in.\"\nHoversland, who is also involved with Habitat for Humanity efforts, said the situation is tough in expensive areas, such as Jackson Hole, which struggles to keep and hire service workers (including snow plow drivers).\nHoversland said higher costs are also hitting builders, adding to their incentives to build more expensive homes.\nHe said the cost to build has gone from $150 per square foot in pre-pandemic real estate markets to $350 to $450 per foot now.\n\"It's kind of crazy,\" Hoversland said.\nIn Florida, Edwards said rising home values are stressing longtime homeowners with higher property taxes. She also worries about tourism workers (many of them living in trailers), teachers and public safety employees leaving the Keys.\n\"If they can't buy a house, they are going to leave,\" she said. \"We aren't going to have certain age groups. I think, in 20 years, I wonder how the economy is going to be working.\"\nLocal Habitat for Humanity branches are helping seniors and other existing income-qualified homeowners with repairs and are developing some affordable units, but those are smaller projects trying to address a big challenge.\n\"That's just a drop in the bucket, but it's the best we can do,\" Edwards said.\nLeft behindIn northwestern Wisconsin's Chippewa Valley, Susan Wolfgram and Paul Savides said housing challenges are pronounced, especially for lower-income workers and seniors making $30,000 or less per year.\nThey are part of an interfaith housing effort called JONAH (Joining our Neighbors, Advancing Hope) that aims to bring local developers, government planners and tenants together.\n\"We have 40% of our workforce that is making $30,000 or less per year,\" said Wolfgram, who also serves on the Eau Claire Plan Commission and as co-director of the Eau Claire Tenant-Landlord Resource Center. \"We don't have any housing for those particular seniors and low-income folks.\"\nLike other regions, cost burdens and barriers have risen, with smaller apartments costing $1,000 per month and rental housing for families more than $2,000 per month, according to Wolfgram.\nSavides said the entry point to buy a home is approaching $300,000.\n\"Wages are so far behind housing costs,\" Wolfgram said.\nBut the Wisconsin pair, along with affordable housing cohorts in Wyoming, Florida and across the U.S., are working to overcome a host of challenges and implement creative ideas and best practices to address the housing crunch.\nIn Part 2 of this series, we will look at some of the impediments to building more affordable housing and how housing advocates are navigating those waters. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Disaster relief loans available for businesses affected by Key Bridge collapse\n\n May 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Business \n \n 548\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It's inevitable that Kent County businesses will be impacted due to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse, says Liliana Tschanett, public affairs specialist for the Office of Disaster Assistance for the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).When that happens, she wants to be available and armed with the proper resources to lend a hand.\nThe SBA announced that Mid-Atlantic small businesses affected by the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore can apply for disaster loans now until Dec. 30, 2024.\nOn Tuesday, April 23, she went before the Kent County Commissioners, presenting some options business owners have.\nShe stated that small business owners can receive up to $2 million if they can prove that the collapse has affected their business.\n\"It's a loan, not a grant,\" she pointed out meaning they'd also have to prove they can pay it back at 4% interest.\nSpecifically, Tschanett explained, it's called a short idle loan; an economic injury disaster system loan.\nTschanett told the commissioners that after the tragic collapse, every county in Maryland and adjacent counties in neighboring states were declared a disaster area, so the loan is a certification from Governor Wes Moore...distinct from a presidential declaration.\nTo be eligible, businesses must prove they've been in operation for a year at least. They will also be asked to submit the proper forms such as a copy of a federal tax return and information from their insurance company.\nShe added that it has more success of being approved if it is $25,000 or under as well.\nIt's similar to the COVID-19 loan, she said. However with their new automated processing software, Tschanett hopes it will be easier for people to navigate the website.\nShe acknowledged their office heard complaints during the Covid-19 time period.\nFor anyone still overwhelmed maneuvering through the website, Tschanett invited them to talk to one of their many loan officers either via email or in-person at one of their three sites in our area.\nThere's plenty of help available, whether it be through their own loan officers, or their partners at SCORE (a business mentoring organization) or the Small Business Development Center.\nThey will answer any questions that pop up.\nFor instance, if a small business already has a Covid-19 loan can they still be eligible for this one?\nTschanett's answer was yes. A loan officer will work with the business owner to change the terms of the loan.\n\"They'll take you step by step,\" Tschanett assured the public.\nWith a December 30 deadline to get the information in, her advice is to start the application process early.\nShe predicted that businesses will look for grants before loans. However, towards the end of the year, when grant money's not available, like around Christmas, they'll be a peaked interest.\nWhen that happens, she wants to have resources at the ready.\nResources like webinars with detailed instructions while partnering with Jamie Williams, director of Kent County Economic & Tourism Development and Sarah King Executive Director of the Chamber of Commerce.\nCommission member Albert Nickerson, relaying a personal anecdote on how the bridge collapse was used as a reason for a delay of building supplies, saw the importance of the loan.\n\"Unfortunately, we'll have a lot of people enquire about this,\" he said.\nTschanett said when that time comes, she'll be prepared.\nBusiness owners can contact a loan officer of the SBA at customer service at 1-800-659-2955, or through their website: https://www.sba.gov/. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The pastry is a staple of Leonard's business, Sugar Buns Cafe and Bakery, and it also reflects her journey to her love for providing comfort food to all those seeking it, which has involved a lot of creativity.Leonard said she came to owning her cafe the same way she came to all her past careers: through a mixture of boredom and curiosity.\nFrom her two decades career as a flight attendant to receiving her master's in Chinese medicine and practicing acupuncture at Johns Hopkins Hospital, to real estate and mortgage banking and even to being one of the first women to receive an acceptance letter for the FBI training program, Leonard has gains a wide range of life experiences.\nHer only consistency through all these career changes has been her love for food.\n\"My joy comes from making people happy and seeing them really appreciate good food,\" Leonard said.\nLeonard was raised by what she describes as a \"meats and potatoes\" traditional father and an \"ahead of her time\" mother who encouraged her to seek independence and \"pave her own path.\" Leonard kept curiosity at the forefront of her life.\nAs a flight attendant, she would take cooking classes during layovers in places like Paris, Barcelona and Athens.\nThat combination of cooking and air travel is reflected in Sugar Buns Cafe and Bakery's menu.\nLeonard said she tries to make her menu leave an impression through humor and decided to use airport codes for all her hamburgers, including LAX, CDG and London Heathrow, which was named so because it is a double-decker burger.\nThe cafe is located in the terminal at Easton Airport.\nJessica Gibbs, the waitress at Sugar Bun Cafe, said she tries to provide an open, free-flowing and friendly atmosphere. Customers often come in to enjoy a meal while watching planes land and take off, she said.\nGibbs said she also enjoys the celebrities that have come down for a meal, including John Travolta, Harrison Ford, Adam Sandler and a handful of senators and representatives.\nBesides sugar buns and hamburgers, the menu includes a variety of breakfast and lunch items, including the signature \"Crabzilla,\" a large sandwich with six pieces of bacon, thick tomato slices and a large crabcake between Texas toast, finished with two olive eyes.\nCalvin Johnson, chef of Sugar Buns Cafe, said he enjoys working there and his creative freedom with the menu, especially since almost all the food is made from scratch and they refuse to use frozen food in meals.\n\"All the stuff here is comfort food, and I've been around a bunch of different places, but I've been here a long time,\" Johnson said. \"Me and Susan are kind of like Batman and Robin.\"\nThrough all her adventures, Leonard said she has always tried to follow her gut and chase curiosity, which is what she advises young girls to do, similar to what her mother modeled for her.\n\"You take a true accounting of your gifts and challenges and then what your heart wants to do,\" Leonard said. \"It's usually a good match, like the old saying 'if you do something you love, you never have to go to work.'\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 11.4 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stand 15.8 cents per gallon higher than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has fallen 4.6 cents in the last week and stands at $3.90 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $3.16 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $4.69 per gallon, a difference of $1.53 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has fallen 3.2 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.58 per gallon today. The national average is down 3.7 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 6.1 cents per gallon higher than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nMay 13, 2023: $3.41 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.52 per gallon)May 13, 2022: $4.42 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.44 per gallon)May 13, 2021: $3.02 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.03 per gallon)May 13, 2020: $1.88 per gallon (U.S. Average: $1.86 per gallon)May 13, 2019: $2.77 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.86 per gallon)May 13, 2018: $2.86 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.86 per gallon)May 13, 2017: $2.31 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.33 per gallon)May 13, 2016: $2.22 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.22 per gallon)May 13, 2015: $2.63 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.67 per gallon)May 13, 2014: $3.64 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.64 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore- $3.54per gallon, down 10.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.64 per gallon.Washington DC- $3.76per gallon, up 2.5 cents per gallon from last week's $3.73 per gallon.Hagerstown- $3.65per gallon, down 7.9 cents per gallon from last week's $3.73 per gallon.\n\"While pump prices haven't exactly plummeted, we've seen the average price of gasoline drop in a majority of states over the last week as refineries finish maintenance and ramp up output of products like gasoline,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"With gas prices now nearing a 10-cent drop to the high we saw a few weeks ago, the future looks good as we get closer to Memorial Day; price drops could potentially accelerate after last week's jobs data shows the economy continues to cool off. While gas prices stand slightly above where they were last year, I expect most Americans will see prices fall before the holiday weekend, and I'm optimistic the trend could extend into June and beyond. I'm excited to say it does appear that for now, the worst is behind us.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Marylanders have saved $8.3 million on monthly internet bills statewide, according to the White House.\nThe Biden administration is pushing Congress to support an extension of the broadband program.\nPresident Joe Biden last October requested an additional $6 billion in funding for the program.\nLast month, he made public appeals for support in tweets.\n\"During the pandemic, we saw just how essential high-speed internet really was — from telemedicine, online school, and small business e-commerce to the ability of millions to work remotely and connect with one another when it wasn't safe to gather,\" Biden said.\n\"It's past time Republicans in Congress joined their Democratic colleagues and worked to pass funding for this essential program.\"\nA bipartisan effort by 17 senators to amend the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill to include $6 billion for the internet program failed Thursday. Senate leaders resisted efforts to include the program and other non-aviation-related amendments in the FAA measure.\n\"Congress must take action to save the ACP to lower costs for American families, boost the economy, and promote job creation and economic mobility,\" Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-New Mexico, said in a statement. He was the sponsor of the amendment.\nIn the House, 122 Democrats and Republicans on Thursday wrote a letter to congressional leaders urging action to preserve the discount internet program.\n\"While certain bipartisan reforms to the program are necessary to improve efficiency and effectiveness, it is the most vulnerable families across the nation that will bear the burden of our inaction if funding lapses,\" the lawmakers warned.\nThe program offers internet discounts of up to $30 a month for qualifying households and up to $75 a month for homes on tribal lands, according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Also available is a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating internet service providers under conditions.\nA Baltimore-based Twitter/X user under the pseudonym\"Fearturnip\" tweeted in January about the program's pending expiration, saying, \"Not only is the national Affordable Connectivity Program tanking in April, the Maryland Broadband Benefit is also ending.\"\n\"I guess we're back to 'normal,' where the digital divide ravages America.\"\nOver 23 million households nationwide have benefitted from the program, according to the software company WhistleOut, with most of the program's beneficiaries being low-income, veterans, minorities, and seniors.\nMore than 77% of discount internet program users said losing their benefits would force them to change their internet plan or drop internet service entirely, according to an FCC survey last year.\nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, met with St. Mary's County leaders and county stakeholders last month to discuss his plans for keeping the internet accessible to low-income households and securing funding for the internet program.\nHoyer said he is committed to \"narrowing the digital divide\" and enabling everyone in Maryland's 5th District with internet access, according to the Lexington Park (Maryland) Leader.\n\"The Affordable Connectivity Program has transformed St. Mary's County and communities across the country,\" Hoyer said. \"Education, health care, and our economy rely on America's workers, students, seniors, and families being connected to the internet.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The vote followed what the union called \"over a year of negotiations with Apple management that yielded unsatisfactory outcomes.\"\nAccording to the statement, the workers are seeking changes in what they call \"unpredictable\" scheduling practices and wages that align with the local cost of living.\n\"We deeply value our team members and we're proud to provide them with industry leading compensation and exceptional benefits,\" Apple said in a statement provided by a spokesperson. \"As always, we will engage with the union representing our team in Towson respectfully and in good faith.\"\nWorkers at the store in the Baltimore suburbs voted by a nearly 2-to-1 margin to unionize in June 2022, joining a growing push across U.S. retail, service and tech industries to organize for greater workplace protections. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "‘Worst in Generations’: Plenty of barriers confront affordable and workforce housing efforts\n\n May 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: Business \n \n 1003\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n David Dworkin doesn't sugarcoat the housing situation currently facing too many American households.\"Housing affordability is the worst it's been in generations,\" said Dworkin, president and CEO of the National Housing Conference (NHC), a Washington D.C.-based affordable housing advocacy group.\nHe points to the chronic, ongoing lack of new affordable housing units, and exponential increases in home prices and apartment rents since the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2019, NHC said buying a median-priced existing home required an income of $54,200 and affording a new home needed, on a national average, an income of $61,700.\nThose days are long gone after the price hikes and socio-economic resets of the pandemic that hit in 2020\nNow, that income threshold stands at more than $110,800 nationally, according to an April analysis by New York-based financial firm BankRate LLC.\nHomebuyers need to make more than $100,000 in 22 states, including Montana ($131,357), Florida ($114,771), Idaho ($114,386) and Oregon ($129,129) to buy a median-priced home. In January 2020 (before COVID), only six states required incomes north of $100,000 to buy a house.\n\"You would have had to have doubled your income since the beginning of the pandemic to afford the same house now,\" Dworkin said, noting similar upward trends for apartment rents.\nAverage apartment rents are now approaching $2,000 per month nationally and more than $2,500 per month in western states, according to Rent.com. That is double pre-pandemic levels.\nWHAT'S BEHIND THE INCREASES\nSo what's driving the home purchase and rental cost spikes? The lack of supply, Dworkin says.\nDworkin said there simply hasn't been enough new construction or redevelopment of affordable and workforce housing since the Great Recession and real estate market crash of 2007-09.\n\"The law of supply and demand is never repealed,\" he said.\nThere are efforts underway to address that dearth. The Biden administration, for instance, announced earlier this month $5.5 billion in grants to states, local governments and housing groups to bolster affordable housing efforts.\nEarlier this year, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bipartisan tax bill that includes financing and tax credits for developers and housing groups to build 200,000 new affordable units nationwide. The measure — which has backing from a bevy of affordable housing groups — has stalled in the U.S. Senate, however.\nA DEEP HOLE\nThe affordable and workforce housing hole is deep, and there are numerous obstacles to addressing the problem.\nDelia Hernandez, who heads the Oregon Department of Housing and Community Services' public outreach efforts, said her state needs 584,000 new housing units over the next 20 years to meet affordable housing needs, but utilizing low-income housing tax credits to spur construction and development have run into obstacles related to caps on bond financing.\nThe Internal Revenue Service announced in late April that it is raising bond caps related to those housing tax credits for 2024.\n\"There are other external factors that can serve as impediments, such as setting up the foundational infrastructure to build more housing, the volatility of the market, which impacts construction costs, or zoning/permitting processes that can impact project timelines,\" she said.\nInflation and labor continue to impact the costs of housing starts and apartment development, and interest rates — which were low and helped spur record home sales and price and rent increases during the pandemic — are now higher, adding to the mortgage costs and consumer debt.\nU.S. household debt hit a record $17.7 trillion in the first quarter — up $640 billion from a year ago, according to the New York Federal Reserve Bank. Mortgage balances are up $190 billion from Q4 2023 and $398 billion from Q1 2023 and now total $12.4 trillion. Credit card and loan delinquencies are also up, according to the New York Fed.\nHannah Edwards, assistant director for Habitat for Humanity for KeyWest and the Lower Keys, said the housing situation in Florida has seen short-term rentals and second homes eating into supplies, and higher insurance costs fueled by premium hikes in areas prone to hurricanes, tropical storms and wildfires adding to cost burdens.\n\"It really makes a difference,\" she said of the increase of second-home buyers and short-term rental landlords along Florida's coasts. \"It makes the housing we do have so much more expensive.\"\nHomeowners insurance rates increased 19.8% between 2021 and 2023, and are projected to go up another 6% this year, according to insurance firm Insurify. Higher insurance costs, along with increased property taxes, make it especially tough on many seniors, who live on fixed incomes.\nSmaller towns and rural areas also are presented with specific housing challenges. They frequently don't have the market size or scale to attract national builders and developers who can bring more higher density projects or more affordable subdivisions on smaller lots, according to Scott Hoversland, executive director of the Wyoming Community Development Authority.\n\"It's very difficult to get developers to come here and do affordable housing here,\" said Hoversland, referencing Wyoming's small population of 581,300, which is smaller than the metropolitan areas of Daytona Beach, Florida, and Madison, Wisconsin.\nTHE NIMBY FACTOR\nDworkin said \"not in my backyard\" (NIMBY) resistance to new apartments and less-expensive and denser housing continues to be one of the biggest impediments to addressing the housing shortage.\nHe said there is an \"intimidation factor\" frequently associated with NIMBY opposition to new development. \"They show up in force at zoning hearings and other public meetings, and they make a lot of noise,\" Dworkin said.\nHe said NIMBY impacts on needed new housing construction are felt across communities encompassing urban, suburban, rural, conservative and progressive areas.\nDworkin underscored the economic importance of bolstering affordable and workforce housing stock and who is losing out when there is community opposition to new apartments and more affordable units. Those impacted include not only service workers but also teachers, health care workers, public safety employees and others.\n\"These are folks who make our coffee in the morning, who serve us lunch, who take care of our kids all day, who take care of our parents and grandparents, and come and rescue us if we get in a car accident,\" he said.\nIn part three of our series, we'll look at some of the potential solutions to America's affordable housing dilemma. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Rogers' niece Morgan Lapp, who is from Hawaii, rounds out the trio. She apprenticed for two years with Rogers.\nThe three of them each have a chair in the news salon and each bring their special touch to cutting, coloring and styling hair.\n\"We do everything hair related — color, cut, highlighting, blonding and perms. We do men's cut, men's color, facial waxing. A lot of men get a color that blends,\" Mauk said.\nMauk and Rogers bonded over their love of hairstyling while at Delmarva Beauty Academy school together. Mauk said even then they talked about going into business together.\n\"The moment I started cutting hair, I just embraced all of it. I just loved it so much that Cameron and I would talk about owning our own shop together. And now that we do, we say how much we love it. We don't care if we have to work extra hours or if you are cleaning up at the end of the night for an hour. It just means something totally different when it is actually yours,\" Mauk said.\n\"Cameron and I have been working together for about 20 years and Morgan is Cameron's niece. The three of us had always wanted to open our own place together. We were just waiting for the right time,\" Mauk said.\nAfter a couple of months of searching, the perfect location for their Salon revealed itself at 341 North Aurora Street in Easton.\n\"We have two extra rooms in the back that are empty that we would have availability to rent out to add something extra,\" Mauk said.\nThey also have an extra styling chair.\n\"For now I don't think we are really looking to fill our other chair. But we would be looking to fill those extra rooms with an aesthetician or massage therapist,\" Lapp added.\nLapp came up with the salon's uplifting name.\n\"We are all blooming out into our own and branching out into our own and liked 'Bloom' so we decided to stick with it,\" she said.\nThe name has carried over into the space's decor.\nThere is a distinct, organic vibe in the salon. The floors are blond wood, and there are exposed wood shelves. There is botanical art on the walls.\n\"I would like to say that we are bright and welcoming and try to have a serene and a calm atmosphere,\" Lapp said.\nThe salon's founders said they are motivated by a love of hairstyling. But it isn't just about hair, they said. It is about people.\n\"You can almost see sometimes when people are leaving, they are just standing taller. Like they are grinning from ear to ear. It is just the best,\" Rogers said.\n\"We are constantly getting to know people and different personalities and trying to make everyone feel the best they can when they leave our door. Being available to someone not just to do their hair but listen to them is important,\" Lapp said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said he's been wholesaling for the past three years. He started in high school.\n\"I had one of my buddies come and buy crabs,\" he said in an interview. \"And then after I got off school at 12 — I had work release — I'd come down here, and I'd run the truck at night. And that's how that started.\"\nIn some ways, it's something of a no-brainer that Little started the retail aspect of Choptank River Crab & Oyster Co. It's in his blood.\nLittle's grandfather, David Nickerson, owned Kool Ice and Seafood for five decades. Nickerson sold the business right before Little graduated high school.\n\"It's the only thing I really know,\" Little said about the business. \"And so we started this.\"\nNickerson has been a mentor for his grandson.\n\"He's taught me everything I know, and I wouldn't be able to do it without him, that's for sure,\" Little said.\nAt the event on Thursday, attendees gathered outside the shop to congratulate Little and enjoy the blue catfish, shrimp and, later on, cake that was offered.\n\"That catfish is delicious,\" said state Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) before wishing Little the best of luck.\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said that every time he has come in to Choptank River Crab & Oyster Co., he has gotten the best service and some of the best seafood.\n\"You can't ask for a better place to come directly from boats to market,\" Hutchinson said. \"You guys are doing a great job.\"\nLocated right on the water, watermen can deliver seafood directly to the establishment.\n\"You really can't get it any fresher,\" Little said. \"You can see the crabs come in that you're about to eat. Coming right in off the boat. They're not being hauled in a pickup truck and sitting out in the heat. It's right to you.\"\nLittle said business has been good.\n\"People are starting to find out about us more and more,\" he said. \"So it's definitely picked up.\"\nDuring the ribbon-cutting, Dorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said he's known Little since Little was a kid.\n\"I'm so honored to be here today to see the man you've become, sir, and the business that you've brought here into Cambridge,\" he said.\nCounty Council member Ricky Travers remarked on Little's journey with the business.\n\"To take a dilapidated building like that and take a young man like you to start a business like this, it's not easy, but you've already found that out,\" Travers said. \"And I take my hat off to you.\"\nEven though he has reached a significant milestone, Little is keeping his sights on the future.\n\"It's kind of one of those things where I won't really be satisfied until I've hit five or 10 (years),\" he said. \"I'm always thinking about the next couple steps.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Paths forward: Can manufactured housing, adaptive reuse move the affordable housing needle?\n\n May 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: Business \n \n 1203\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The need to address affordable housing shortages and higher home prices and rents has prompted plenty of talk during and since the pandemic.Cody Filipczak — a home builder and developer in Eau Claire, Wisconsin — is translating those words into deeds.\nHe redeveloped a shuttered assisted living facility into new affordable apartments and has development plans to bring more manufactured homes to a region where real estate costs have roughly doubled.\nStill, those are just small bites at a very big and challenging nationwide apple.\nFilipczak partnered with the nearby city of Altoona, Wisconsin, and community nonprofit JONAH (Joining Our Neighbors, Advancing Hope) to turn the former assisted living center into a 25-unit apartment complex called Solis Circle featuring smaller studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments.\nRents range from $425 to $810 per month with square footage running from 280 to 620 square feet, according to John DeRose, owner/broker for Rental Resources of Eau Claire Inc., which manages the property. Units include efficiency kitchens with larger communal kitchens and on-site laundry facilities.\n\"It's the coolest project I have ever done,\" said Filipczak, co-owner of C&M Home Builders & Real Estate, who noted Solis' tenant roster includes seniors, younger tenants and persons with disabilities.\nAverage rents in the Eau Claire area 90 miles east of Minneapolis are more than $1,200 per month, according to real estate firm Zumper Inc. Filipczak said entry level housing prices in northwest Wisconsin have doubled in recent years going from $150,000 to $300,000.\nThe project was able to come to fruition via a deal that involved the city taking ownership of the land and an old zoning provision that allowed for an assisted living center to be transformed into apartments.\n\"It still cost $100,000 to get it updated,\" said Filipczak, who also builds duplexes and other housing options across price ranges.\nOther adaptive reuse efforts to help address needed affordable and workforce housing are not as easy, said Filizpczak, who started his career as a carpenter.\nZoning rules, building codes and higher labor costs discourage the redevelopment of office buildings, church campuses and other properties into needed housing.\n\"They are just driving the pricing up,\" he said.\nThe Solis project opened in 2019. Mike Golat, Altoona's city administrator, said it was financed via a tax incremental district, a financing structure that allows local governments to invest in, collect taxes and reinvest in a designated area. Golat said the Wisconsin town has another $6 million to invest in affordable housing from that district.\nHe also noted the different approach taken at the Solis Circle redevelopment\n\"We don't have income requirements. We didn't want to go to a voucher system,\" he said. \"We wanted a mix of people in there to give it a bit more diversity and sense of community.\"\nFilipczak also has plans to add 72 new manufactured homes to an existing 15-home community with the same type of housing stock. He said the new manufactured housing is slated to have prices between $160,000 and $200,000 with plans to allow homeowners to eventually purchase lots or former a homeowners association.\n'I THINK IT'S THE FUTURE'\nThe Wisconsin builder sees manufactured housing as the key to address the shortage of affordable apartments to rent and homes to buy across the country.\n\"I think it's the key to be honest. I think it's the future,\" he said. Golat said Altoona — which has a population of 9,100 people and has seen its population grow by 36% since 2010 — is looking at manufactured homes, tiny homes and zoning changes to lift barriers to new affordable construction. \"We are looking at things like reducing minimum lot sizes, reducing setbacks, reducing infill requirements,\" he said.\nThat is welcomed by local housing advocates working to get more developers, landlords and property owners (including churches) on the affordable bandwagon.\n\"The zoning update is huge,\" said JONAH organizer Paul Savides.\nStill, many affordable housing efforts — including apartments and manufactured homes — face stigmas about their impacts on the surrounding community and property values as well as 'not in my backyard' opposition from existing residents.\n\"We have that in spades here,\" Golat said.\nOther affordable housing advocates see merits in manufactured homes because their pricing and square footage work better for families and multi-person and multi-generational households\nThe average price of a smaller manufactured home came in at $79,600 at the end of last year while larger ones more akin to a single-family home cost $149,600, according to numbers released earlier this month by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.\nThose are up 62% and 53% from Aug. 2019.\nStill, that is lower than the current median single-family home price nationally of $433,558 according to real estate firm RedFin.\nManufactured housing accounts for 11% of new housing starts with the median income of manufactured homebuyers coming in at $35,000, according to the Manufactured Housing Institute, an industry group. That compares to a $107,000 median income for single-family homebuyers, according to the National Association of Realtors.\nDavid Dworkin, president and CEO of the National Housing Conference, said manufactured homes have seen marked improvements in construction quality and offer homeownership potential to households priced out of single-family markets.\nBut Dworkin also said new climate change-inspired energy efficiency rules from the Biden administration will drive up costs on manufactured homes and in turn seniors and lower income households.\n'I{strong style=\"font-size: 1em;\"}NSANE FOR OUR AREA'{/strong}\nAnn Malfavon, executive of the Klamath Housing Authority in southern Oregon, said while there is broad support for addressing the need for more afford-\nable housing, \"it still carries a stigma with it and the belief that this type of housing decreases surrounding property values.\"\nManufactured housing also faces stereotypes of rundown trailer parks and how they will stand up to extreme weather such as hurricanes and tornadoes.\nMalfavon said higher costs for labor and materials before and since the pandemic and lack of inventory of apartments and homes for sales have increased prices.\n\"The median listing home price of Klamath Falls is $350,000 to $360,000, which is insane for our area, where the area median income is $75,200. This prices out a lot of individuals and families who would like to own a home,\" said Malfavon, whose group owns and manages 324 units in Klamath and Lake counties near the California border with new efforts slated to add another 99 units across four projects.\nShe said there are statewide efforts to streamline and quicken funding and financing and approvals for affordable projects.\nThe Oregon Department of Housing & Community Services also has a $10 million program to help co-locate child care facilities within new affordable housing developments and has given $20 million to four modular home builders to help spur affordable construction.\nModular homes are built in segments at centralized manufacturing facilities and then transported to property sites.\nDelia Hernandez, a spokesperson for OHCS, said the modular homes can be used as temporary housing after wildfires and other disasters and the builders \"will also prioritize low-income and middle-income housing construction.\"\nThere are concerns about developers and builders gaming the system of federal, state and local affordable housing grants, tax breaks and other incentives by designating small slices of new projects as affordable and workforce units while still charging rents that aren't helping address the larger problem.\n\"I see so much money going out from the federal government, from state and local governments for projects that are deemed affordable. They are nowhere near affordable,\" Filizpczak said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

They were judged on clarity of idea and solution, the viability of their business idea, how well the identified problem or opportunity is addressed by their plan, the impact -either socially or the community and on innovation.\nKent County Director of Economic Development and Tourism Jamie Williams was an exhibitor and presented the event results.\nOut of 15 applications this year, 10 were selected to pitch and eight pitched. Four were from Kent County, and two were chosen to pitch, Williams said.\nThis event is important not just to the businesses involved, trying to gain extra funds for their startups and small businesses, but for those who work closely with the businesses to help them find resources.\nLike Williams and her staff.\nEconomic development teams in Kent, Queen Anne's and Cecil displayed how closely they work together. This project was just one of the examples of that.\nSusan O'Neill, the executive director of USRC sees that partnership as vital for these rural areas.\n\"We were proud to be a sponsor of the Upper Shore STRT1UP Roadshow event this year. It was wonderful to see the Economic Development Offices in Cecil, Kent and Queen Anne's team up for this event to inspire growth in the Upper Shore region of Maryland for years to come.\"\nThis is their first stop on the tour.\nThe event is being marketed in all three communities of Washington College, Cecil Community College and Chesapeake College.\nDepartment Chair and Associate Professor of Business Management at Washington College Caddie Putnam Rankin added, \"We were thrilled to host the first stop of the annual tour to support the ideas, goals, and objectives of local emerging businesses.\"\nAlong with the business pitch portion, the event featured two panel discussions.\n\"Where Are They Now,\" with Binko moderating and Scott Budden owner and founder of Orchard Point Oysters and Tyler Abbott, entrepreneur and director of Land and Materials Administration, MDE, as the panel.\nAnd \"Bootstrapping Your Business,\" with Karen Zuccardi, manager of the Rural Business innovation Initiative TEDCO, as the moderator.\nThe event provided ample opportunity for entrepreneurs to network with business resource partners while sharing ideas.\nTo learn more about the USRC and other projects, visit https://usrcmd.org/. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Paths forward: Can manufactured housing, adaptive reuse move the affordable housing needle?\n\n June 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: News \n \n 1205\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The need to address affordable housing shortages and higher home prices and rents has prompted plenty of talk during and since the pandemic.Cody Filipczak — a home builder and developer in Eau Claire — is translating those words into deeds.\nHe redeveloped a shuttered assisted living facility into new affordable apartments and has development plans to bring more manufactured homes to a region where real estate costs have roughly doubled.\nStill, those are just small bites at a very big and challenging nationwide apple.\nFilipczak partnered with the nearby city of Altoona and community nonprofit JONAH (Joining Our Neighbors, Advancing Hope) to turn the former assisted living center into a 25-unit apartment complex called Solis Circle featuring smaller studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments.\nRents range from $425 to $810 per month with square footage running from 280 to 620 square feet, according to John DeRose, owner/broker for Rental Resources of Eau Claire Inc., which manages the property. Units include efficiency kitchens with larger communal kitchens and on-site laundry facilities.\n\"It's the coolest project I have ever done,\" said Filipczak, co-owner of C&M Home Builders & Real Estate, who noted Solis' tenant roster includes seniors, younger tenants and persons with disabilities.\nAverage rents in the Eau Claire area are more than $1,200 per month, according to real estate firm Zumper Inc. Filipczak said entry level housing prices in northwestern Wisconsin have doubled in recent years going from $150,000 to $300,000.\nThe project was able to come to fruition via a deal that involved the city taking ownership of the land and an old zoning provision that allowed for an assisted living center to be transformed into apartments.\n\"It still cost $100,000 to get it updated,\" said Filipczak, who also builds duplexes and other housing options across price ranges, including in Rice Lake to the south of Moon Lake Park.\nOther adaptive reuse efforts to help address needed affordable and workforce housing are not as easy, said Filizpczak, who started his career as a carpenter.\nZoning rules, building codes and higher labor costs discourage the redevelopment of office buildings, church campuses and other properties into needed housing.\n\"They are just driving the pricing up,\" he said.\nThe Solis project opened in 2019. Mike Golat, Altoona's city administrator, said it was financed via a tax incremental district, a financing structure that allows local governments to invest in, collect taxes and reinvest in a designated area. Golat said the Wisconsin town has another $6 million to invest in affordable housing from that district.\nHe also noted the different approach taken at the Solis Circle redevelopment.\n\"We don't have income requirements. We didn't want to go to a voucher system,\" he said. \"We wanted a mix of people in there to give it a bit more diversity and sense of community.\"\nFilipczak also has plans to add 72 new manufactured homes to an existing 15-home community with the same type of housing stock. He said the new manufactured housing is slated to have prices between $160,000 and $200,000 with plans to allow homeowners to eventually purchase lots or form a homeowners association.\n'I think it's the future'\nThe Wisconsin builder sees manufactured housing as the key to address the shortage of affordable apartments to rent and homes to buy across the country.\n\"I think it's the key to be honest. I think it's the future,\" he said. Golat said Altoona — which has a population of 9,100 people and has seen its population grow by 36% since 2010 — is looking at manufactured homes, tiny homes and zoning changes to lift barriers to new affordable construction. \"We are looking at things like reducing minimum lot sizes, reducing setbacks, reducing infill requirements,\" he said.\nThat is welcomed by local housing advocates working to get more developers, landlords and property owners (including churches) on the affordable bandwagon.\n\"The zoning update is huge,\" said JONAH organizer Paul Savides.\nStill, many affordable housing efforts — including apartments and manufactured homes — face stigmas about their impacts on the surrounding community and property values as well as 'not in my backyard' opposition from existing residents.\n\"We have that in spades here,\" Golat said.\nOther affordable housing advocates see merits in manufactured homes because their pricing and square footage work better for families and multi-person and multi-generational households\nThe average price of a smaller manufactured home came in at $79,600 at the end of last year while larger ones more akin to a single-family home cost $149,600, according to numbers released earlier this month by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.\nThose are up 62% and 53% from Aug. 2019.\nStill, that is lower than the current median single-family home price nationally of $433,558 according to real estate firm RedFin.\nManufactured housing accounts for 11% of new housing starts with the median income of manufactured homebuyers coming in at $35,000, according to the Manufactured Housing Institute, an industry group. That compares to a $107,000 median income for single-family homebuyers, according to the National Association of Realtors.\nDavid Dworkin, president and CEO of the National Housing Conference, said manufactured homes have seen marked improvements in construction quality and offer homeownership potential to households priced out of single-family markets.\nBut Dworkin also said new climate change-inspired energy efficiency rules from the Biden administration will drive up costs on manufactured homes and in turn seniors and lower income households.\n'Insane for our area'\nAnn Malfavon, executive of the Klamath Housing Authority in southern Oregon, said while there is broad support for addressing the need for more affordable housing, \"it still carries a stigma with it and the belief that this type of housing decreases surrounding property values.\"\nManufactured housing also faces stereotypes of rundown trailer parks and how they will stand up to extreme weather such as hurricanes and tornadoes.\nMalfavon said higher costs for labor and materials before and since the pandemic and lack of inventory of apartments and homes for sales have increased prices.\n\"The median listing home price of Klamath Falls is $350,000 to $360,000, which is insane for our area, where the area median income is $75,200. This prices out a lot of individuals and families who would like to own a home,\" said Malfavon, whose group owns and manages 324 units in Klamath and Lake counties near the California border with new efforts slated to add another 99 units across four projects.\nShe said there are statewide efforts to streamline and quicken funding and financing and approvals for affordable projects.\nThe Oregon Department of Housing & Community Services also has a $10 million program to help co-locate child care facilities within new affordable housing developments and has given $20 million to four modular home builders to help spur affordable construction.\nModular homes are built in segments at centralized manufacturing facilities and then transported to property sites.\nDelia Hernandez, a spokesperson for OHCS, said the modular homes can be used as temporary housing after wildfires and other disasters and the builders \"will also prioritize low-income and middle-income housing construction.\"\nThere are concerns about developers and builders gaming the system of federal, state and local affordable housing grants, tax breaks and other incentives by designating small slices of new projects as affordable and workforce units while still charging rents that aren't helping address the larger problem.\n\"I see so much money going out from the federal government, from state and local governments for projects that are deemed affordable. They are nowhere near affordable,\" Filizpczak said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The national average price of diesel has fallen 1.8 cents in the last week and stands at $3.82 per gallon.\nAccording to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $3.09 per gallon yesterday while the most expensive was $4.29 per gallon, a difference of $1.20 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has fallen 5.8 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.50 per gallon Monday. The national average is down 15.9 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 1.9 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nJune 3, 2023: $3.43 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.52 per gallon)June 3, 2022: $4.78 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.81 per gallon)June 3, 2021: $3.02 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.04 per gallon)June 3, 2020: $2.02 per gallon (U.S. Average: $1.99 per gallon)June 3, 2019: $2.71 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.80 per gallon)June 3, 2018: $2.93 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.94 per gallon)June 3, 2017: $2.37 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.37 per gallon)June 3, 2016: $2.33 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.35 per gallon)June 3, 2015: $2.72 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.76 per gallon)June 3, 2014: $3.64 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.67 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.59 per gallon, down 7.0 cents per gallon from last week's $3.66 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.65 per gallon, up 1.9 cents per gallon from last week's $3.63 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.59 per gallon, down 10.0 cents per gallon from last week's $3.69 per gallon.\n\"The calendar has closed on May, and so too has the door closed on rising gas prices, with the national average declining to its lowest level since March. Thankfully, gas prices are unlikely to be moved by OPEC's meeting and agreement to extend production cuts into 2025, leading the national average to fall below $3.50 in the next week,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"With GasBuddy data showing gasoline demand plummeting after Memorial Day, and refiners inputting the largest amount of oil into their facilities in years, it's very likely we'll continue to see gas prices fall as we approach July 4. Diesel prices also continue to decline to their lowest level in nearly 11 months. The future looks bright for falling fuel prices across the board, though we'll have to keep our eyes on hurricane season.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "It's time for Mid-Shore regional planning\n\n June 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Activate \n \n 588\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Recently, the Greater Baltimore Committee (GBC) released a new 10-year strategic plan calling for (in their words), a \"sea change,\" to boost economic opportunity in Baltimore city and five Maryland counties adjacent to Baltimore — Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford and Howard.Founded in 1955, GBC is a not-for-profit organization with approximately 400 members.\nTheir membership includes large, mid-size and small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, foundations, educational providers and health care institutions in the Baltimore region.\nAll the geographic areas served by GBC are unique, but all recognize the value of mutually beneficial collaborative efforts on economic development matters.\nIn an ever-changing world, GBC 's new strategic plan acknowledged a pressing need for changes on a better definition of their traditional purposes and their traditional goals.\nAccordingly, their new plan includes new purposes and new goals to guide private and public investment and regional collaborations designed to result in transformational positive change in the Baltimore region.\nSpecific GBC goals are included in three broad areas of economic development. They are:\nIndustry and innovation.Place and community.Talent and people.\nUltimately, GBC's vision is to position the Baltimore region's residents, businesses and quality of life amenities, as a globally recognizable and competitive brand.\nThe overall success of GBC's new plan is based not only on new purposes and new goals. It also depends upon on a continuing commitment to collaboration from businesses, political leaders, developers, educators, workforce providers, nonprofits, entrepreneurs, current economic development organizations and other key stakeholders in Baltimore City and the five surrounding counties.\nBased on past measurable successes with GBC, they understand they do best by not competing against each other but by working together to compete globally for current and emerging economic engines that provide good jobs, good wages, good benefits and economic stability.\nThey also understand the needs of the leaders such economic engines. These leaders are much less interested in artificial human-made geographic boundaries that delineate county and municipal borders and are much more interested in what a region can provide in terms of a long-term, reliable and positive business environment along with a supply of skilled workers.\nNo doubt any discussion of any changes leading to a new regional approach to economic development for the Mid-Shore region may be unsettling to some. It is new, and it is different.\nI suggest now is the time for the leaders in Talbot, Dorchester and Caroline counties (at a minimum) to immediately engage in meaningful discussions on the feasibility and benefits of launching a Mid-Shore version of a regional economic development organization comparable to the GBC.\nThe key words are comparable to the GBC, not identical to the GBC.\nI am not suggesting Mid-Shore leaders adopt GBC's purposes and goals without modifications that work best for the Mid-Shore now and going forward. I further suggest we already have an outstanding organization in place to serve as a new leader in regional economic development.\nThat organization is Chesapeake College.\nThe college has served the Mid Shore region with distinction since it was chartered as Maryland's first regional community college in 1965 and opened in 1967.\nOffering a wide range of adult learning opportunities, they have extensive experience in developing and conducting workforce-training programs. The availability of these programs is great selling point for economic development prospects.\nI also suggest that in addition to a new regional economic development organizational model, the Mid-Shore must have an open and transparent process for developing regional economic development goals based on citizen input to maintain and advance the Mid-Shore's position in Maryland as the \"Land of Pleasant Living.\"\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

With the declines, Americans will spend roughly $425 million less per week on gasoline than a year ago. In addition, the price of diesel has fallen alongside gasoline to its lowest level since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. This price decline party is ramping up, and I expect additional declines ahead of July 4 for both gasoline and diesel prices. Six states now have average prices below $3 per gallon, and more will join soon, with the number of U.S. stations at $2.99 or lower already nearing 25,000.

Prior to the store's opening, Trappe residents had to drive to Easton or Cambridge to shop at a liquor store.\nThe Talbot County Council in January approved a change to the county's alcoholic beverage code, paving the way for a liquor store to be considered and established in Trappe.\nPrior to the County Council's vote, the county code included restrictions on the issuance of off-sale licenses, or licenses that allow the sale of alcohol for off-premises consumption.\nCork & Bottle Trappe's home is 4016 Main St. in Trappe. Its hours are 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Mondays to Saturdays, and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sundays.\nFor more information, call 410-476-4330 or follow Cork & Bottle Trappe on social media. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 5.3 cents per gallon higher than a month ago and stand 18.2 cents per gallon higher than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has fallen 1.6 cents in the last week and stands at $3.73 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $3.05 per gallon yesterday while the most expensive was $4.29 per gallon, a difference of $1.24 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 1 cent per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.41 per gallon today. The national average is down 18.0 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 13.8 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nJune 17, 2023: $3.41 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.55 per gallon)June 17, 2022: $4.97 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.99 per gallon)June 17, 2021: $2.98 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.07 per gallon)June 17, 2020: $2.12 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.11 per gallon)June 17, 2019: $2.61 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.67 per gallon)June 17, 2018: $2.85 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.89 per gallon)June 17, 2017: $2.27 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.29 per gallon)June 17, 2016: $2.31 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.35 per gallon)June 17, 2015: $2.77 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.80 per gallon)June 17, 2014: $3.65per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.67 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.61 per gallon, up 10.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.51 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.56 per gallon, down 12.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.68 per gallon.Hagerstown: 3.36 per gallon, down 8.9 cents per gallon from last week's $3.45 per gallon.\n\"Since the national average price of gasoline fell to its lowest June level since 2021 last week, we've seen the drop in prices take a break, with some states seeing a small rise over the last week. Thankfully, I expect this to be more like a short timeout, with an eventual return to falling gasoline prices in most states,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"The decline in diesel prices continues, with the national average price of diesel now at its lowest level since January 2022. Both gasoline and diesel prices remain below their year-ago level, which is music to the ears of the Federal Reserve, as fuel prices are a significant component of the Consumer Price Index. Also factoring in gasoline demand that has been running a bit weaker than expected, market fundamentals look pretty good right now if you're a motorist.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "YMCA holds members-only meeting on fate of Cambridge facility\n\n June 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 800\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Members of the Pauline F. & W. David Robbins Family YMCA braved the heat of the facility's gym Tuesday evening to hear more about the YMCA of the Chesapeake's interest in moving its Cambridge location to Cambridge Harbor.The meeting was held less than two weeks after an email was sent out by the YMCA of the Chesapeake that led people to believe the organization had reached a deal with Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc. to build a new YMCA on the Cambridge Harbor site. On June 11, both CWDI Executive Director Matt Leonard and YMCA of the Chesapeake CEO Robbie Gill told the Star Democrat that there is no such deal to build on Cambridge Harbor at this time.\nThe YMCA is advocating the need to build a new YMCA, Gill said on June 11. He said the existing site is not sustainable over the next two decades and can't provide certain programs, amenities and services.\nOn Tuesday, Gill gave a presentation on a market study that tested three different sites for a new Cambridge YMCA facility. Two representatives from Triangle2, the firm that completed the market study, presented with Gill.\nThe three sites tested in the market study were the current YMCA location, Cambridge Harbor and a parcel on the corner of Maple Dam Road and Route 16, which is near Cambridge-South Dorchester High School. Triangle2 CEO Lori Swann said 814 households were interviewed for the market study.\nSwann said the current site and Maple Dam Road site did not test as well as the Cambridge Harbor site did.\nAccording to the presentation, 73% of the interviewed county residents that were interested in joining the YMCA would be \"very likely\" to participate in a YMCA at Cambridge Harbor. The presentation showed that 61% felt that way about the current location and 42% felt that way about the Maple Dam Road site.\nGill said the market study made it clear that the community is in need of amenities that the current facility cannot provide.\n\"In essence, what we want to do is address community need, and there's no community that's more deserving of a new YMCA than this one,\" he said.\nDuring the question and answer portion of the meeting held in the slightly cooler lobby of the YMCA, many members challenged the idea that Cambridge Harbor is the best site for a new facility. Questions about the consideration of other sites, rebuilding the current facility, funding new construction and the fate of the current YMCA location were raised.\nGill said Cambridge would lose its YMCA for at least three years if the current facility was torn down and a new one built in its place.\n\"We're not comfortable not serving this community for two-and-a-half (years), two years (or) even three months,\" he said.\nIn response, one member brought up the possibility of a new facility being built next to the old facility so the old facility could remain in operation until the new one is complete.\nAnswering a question about the market study itself, Swann said the goal of study was to get input from community members who are not currently supporting the YMCA. She said the organization can always send out email surveys and get information from members.\nYMCA member Dale Schrader stepped in front of Gill in response to this and asked, \"Does it matter to you what we want?\" This brought on applause from other members.\nGill said that it does matter, \"but you have 3,000 other people that don't access the Y and use the Y because there are amenities that are missing.\"\nIn an interview after the meeting, YMCA member Kathy Abend said that amenities can be provided at any of the sites. She said the waterfront project is intended to bring in revenue for the county, and putting a YMCA on the waterfront would not bring in that revenue.\nAlong with that, Abend said she doesn't think a YMCA on the waterfront would be safe.\n\"We don't even know what's coming yet on that waterfront,\" she said.\nDuring the question and answer portion of the meeting, member Phil Reed said his impression from the meeting was that Gill and the YMCA are sold on the waterfront site.\nAbend, who has been a member of the YMCA for several years, said in an interview that she didn't think Gill seemed open to rebuilding on the current site.\n\"He was shutting this down,\" she said.\nAs he ended the meeting, Gill shared his contact information and told the crowd that the YMCA of the Chesapeake isn't trying to upset people.\n\"We're just trying to make an impact and a bigger difference,\" he said. \"And whatever that path looks like, we'll continue to navigate it.\"\nAfter the meeting, Abend said she thought it was a good meeting and pointed out that multiple members had similar questions.\n\"I thought that was interesting,\" she said. \"Everyone had the same concerns.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Matute and her family bring old comforts to the Latino community in Easton and a fun new twist to desserts to Talbot County residents.\n\"We make everything natural,\" Matute said. \"The strawberry ice cream is made from real and pure strawberries. The agua fresca (flavored waters) are also homemade. It's the culture to do so.\"\nBorn in Guatemala and migrating to Maryland with her family at the age of 11, Matute said it was difficult to adjust to the changes in culture at first. Still, the community she found in Easton helped make this area her home.\nWithin her newfound community was her future husband and business partner Auner Ramirez Gonzalez. They met in middle school and immediately created a bond of support and love.\nTogether, they opened La Michoacana in May and brought Latino treats to not only their children but to families across the Eastern Shore.\nChristopher Zuasnabar, a customer, said it can be difficult to find culturally specific desserts in the area, and he loves having this place nearby.\n\"It's not your typical Baskin Robbins,\" Zuasnabar said. \"Now you can walk and go into a different vibe. It's something you don't see very often on the East Coast. I really, really like the fact that it's changing a lot of business ideas for a lot of people with our Latino Culture. It's starting to expand a lot more. That's what we need.\"\nZuasnabar bought \"Pepinos Locos,\" which consists of several peeled and carved cucumbers filled with sour and spicy Mexican candies and chips with a rim made of Tajin, a Mexican spice mix consisting of lime, chili peppers and salt, and Chamoy, a savory sauce made from pickled fruit.\nLa Michoacana resides next to the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, and people can be seen moving between the two buildings.\nVictoria Gomez Lozano, Hispanic outreach coordinator for Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, said its been great to have this new business next to the resource center, especially for the Latino immigrant community.\n\"The location seems to be a good location next to our center and near Angelica's Latin Market,\" Gomez Lozano said. \"Just to have some snacks you used to have in your country, like the corn and candies, it's really nice.\"\nTo residents who have never tried Latino desserts, Matute encourages them to come by and try something new.\n\"I feel that people can often feel a little uncomfortable trying something new, but the Hispanic culture contains so many different flavors that all different cravings can be satisfied,\" Matute said. \"The truth is I want new customers to feel comfortable as though it is their home … I just want people to be adventurous and to try what the Latino culture has to offer.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "‘Tip of the Iceberg’: The AI revolution is here; Will it take your job?\n\n June 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: Business \n \n 1320\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The artificial intelligence revolution is here.AI — which entails computers and machines simulating human intelligence and decision-making via sensors, machine learning, geo-technology and understanding natural language — could add as much as $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, with a potential extra 26.1% GDP gain for China and 14.5% for North America, according to an analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning are already showing up or are being developed in autonomous vehicles and military systems, digital assistants, GPS guidance, surveillance and generative AI tools (such as Open AI's ChatGPT).\nBut will the revolution and AI's innovations and disruptions cost you your job?\nThat's one of worries regarding the AI sea change — along with whether it will create some kind of dystopian science fiction state similar to those portrayed in books and movies.\nDerek Willis, a lecturer at the University of Maryland College Park, said AI will impact jobs where computers can be taught to handle more repetitive and uniform employment tasks via machine learning.\n\"It's only a matter of time for those tasks to be taken over by totally autonomous AI systems or a guided system,\" said Willis, who is looking at the technology wave's impacts on information, media, finance and other sectors.\nMOST AT RISK\nThe jobs most threatened by AI-driven automation include administrative posts, cashiers, data entry, accountants, bookkeepers, security guards, housekeepers and retail sales clerks, according to analyses by the World Economic Forum and ChamberofCommerce.org research firm.\nThe estimated job impacts of AI vary widely. The World Economic Forum estimates 83 million jobs could become automated globally by 2027, including more than 26 million recordkeeping and administrative positions. A 2023 analysis by Goldman Sachs puts AI-driven jobs disruptions at 300 million.\nIn the U.S., more than 10.1 million jobs — including office, restaurant, food service and manufacturing workers — in the 50 largest employment markets could be lost to AI, according to the Chamber of Commerce.\nWillis said the drumbeat for AI and its potential innovations, cost savings and ability to address persistent labor shortages will be hard for employers to eschew.\n\"It's going to make you faster, more efficient. It's going to increase your capacity. A lot of people are going to make a lot more money because it's going to make them better,\" Willis said of the promised AI upside.\nWorkers are concerned about how AI will affect the world of work, however.\nAccording to a February survey by Rutgers University, 71% of U.S. workers are concerned about AI's impact on jobs, including employers' hiring and personnel decisions, and 67% believe AI will eliminate more jobs than it creates.\nBut only 30% of workers in the 1,008-person survey worry about their job specifically being eliminated — including just 18% of those making $100,000 per year or more — though 81% say they know little or nothing about how artificial intelligence will change the nature of jobs.\nBenjamin Toff, a journalism professor at the University of Minnesota, has recently held focus groups related to AI.\n\"Concerns were wide ranging. Some talked about specific threats to jobs (their own or others in other industries),\" Hoff said.\nOthers voiced concerns about privacy and worst-case science fiction scenarios \"about machines taking over and becoming so advanced that humans are incapable of controlling these technologies.\"\nToff said some saw the upside of AI efficiencies in their work and personal lives.\nHEADED TOWARD 'THE MATRIX'?\nThe Pentagon — including DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), which fostered creation of the internet — and other military and intelligence agencies across the world are spending billions of dollars on AI and machine learning for robotic and autonomous weapons, as well as defense, security and surveillance systems.\nThe world of warcraft — which has historically driven innovation — is leading the AI charge, even with Pope Francis and others calling for restrictions on autonomous weapons.\nThe U.S. Defense Department has awarded more than $4.7 billion in AI contracts so far this year, and China has deployed 600 million security cameras as part of its AI-driven surveillance network called Skynet (an ominous real-life allusion to the \"Terminator\" movies).\n\"I'm sure we don't know the tip of the iceberg of what is going on behind the scenes,\" said Christina Henderson, executive director of the Montana High Tech Business Alliance.\nHenderson said she is seeing AI upend or force pivots to business models, and she understands worries about where the world and jobs are headed.\n\"I think people feel a bit overwhelmed,\" Henderson said of the economic and ethical considerations of AI. \"Where are we OK with humans being replaced, and where does it give us an uncomfortable sense we are losing our humanity and heading toward 'The Matrix'?\"\nHenderson said AI has the potential to magnify digital divide issues — or it could help erase them.\nGlobally, the PwC analysis sees almost 89% of AI's economic benefits in the U.S., China and Europe and other wealthy countries.\nHenderson also sees the upsides, including speed of work, aiding research, generating ideas and helping smaller firms scale up, especially in \"rural America and flyover states\" to compete globally.\n\"Those things are really helpful,\" she said. \"AI can really add some talent to a relatively small team.\"\n'GOOD AI, BAD AI'\nCoral Hoh sees both sides of the AI coin.\nHoh is a clinical linguist who is part of a team of researchers who developed an AI tool to better evaluate and help kids, teens and adults with dyslexia.\n\"There is good AI, and there is bad AI. It's just how people are using it,\" said Hoh, whose New York-based company, Dysolve, uses artificial intelligence to address students' reading challenges.\nHoh said the U.S. spends $120 billion annually on special education, including on learning challenges such as dyslexia, with poor results and a system that wears on kids' psyches and self-esteem.\nDysolve — which took 10 years to develop — utilizes AI to help identify dyslexia among students and then helps correct those challenges via online academic games.\n\"Every brain is different. The AI just responds to each person,\" Hoh said. \"The child just plays game after game.\"\nShe said trials and test efforts have shown results, and the product costs between 1% and 10% of traditional per-student special education expenditures.\n\"After several months of these continuous corrections, the brain somehow breaks through, a lot of pathways get cleared,\" she said.\nThe AI product is web-based.\n\"They don't need new hardware. They're not integrated into the systems. Students just log into the website,\" said Hoh, who also sells Dysolve directly toparents and home-schoolers.\nStill, she said the effort has to navigate educational bureaucracies and stand out among bevies of AI vendors marketing their products.\n\"Everyone wants to use the AI bailiwick now,\" Hoh said.\nWillis wonders about how the AI wave will drive energy usage and efforts to reduce footprints because of climate change.\nThe International Energy Agency estimates AI will consume 10 times more energy by 2026. Data centers driving technology waves will double their global consumption — the equivalent of Japan's annual electricity usage.\nAI FOR MAYOR?\nIn Wyoming, Victor Miller sees AI as a way to better governance — and he is taking a novel and controversial approach.\nMiller has developed an AI candidate he's trying to run for mayor of Cheyenne in this year's elections. Miller said he programmed the AI dubbed VIC via OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nWhile VIC can't run for office, Miller can, and he said would turn over his votes to the AI bot whose programming looks to shed political ideologies and biases and would be supplemented by citizen feedback.\nOpenAI — which receives major funding from Microsoft— is pulling the plug on the AI candidate, though, saying Miller is violating the platform's terms related to political campaigns. Miller could turn to another AI engine for VIC, which stands for 'Virtually Integrated Citizen.\"\nMiller acknowledges AI skeptics' \"Skynet\" worries,but he wants AI widely accessible and not overregulated or restricted.\n\"I think there is a danger if these siloed big money places control this new technology and don't let it out amongst the people,\" said Miller, who sees the potential medical and other breakthroughs if AI is unleashed. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 5.9 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stand 7.3 cents per gallon higher than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has risen 1.4 cents in the last week and stands at $3.77 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $3.15 per gallon yesterday while the most expensive was $4.29 per gallon, a difference of $1.14 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 5.0 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.46 per gallon Monday. The national average is down 6.0 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 5.4 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nJuly 1, 2023: $3.47 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.52 per gallon)July 1, 2022: $4.75 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.83 per gallon)July 1, 2021: $3.01 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.12 per gallon)July 1, 2020: $2.19 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.18 per gallon)July 1, 2019: $2.68 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.72 per gallon)July 1, 2018: $2.79 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.84 per gallon)July 1, 2017: $2.21 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.23 per gallon)July 1, 2016: $2.26 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.27 per gallon)July 1, 2015: $2.74 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.76 per gallon)July 1, 2014: $3.69 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.67 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.56 per gallon, up 7.5 cents per gallon from last week's $3.49 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.65 per gallon, up 2.9 cents per gallon from last week's $3.62 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.47 per gallon, up 16.9 cents per gallon from last week's $3.30 per gallon.\n\"As we approach July 4 later this week, motorists have seen the national average price of gasoline inch up ever so slightly for the third straight week,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"While the increases have been fairly tame, with oil continuing to hold above $80 per barrel, we could continue to see the national average climb slightly. Other areas that see price cycling saw prices shoot up early in the week, but those areas are now starting to see prices fall back down. For many Americans hitting the road for the July 4 holiday, prices in most areas are very comparable to what we saw last July 4. However, with Hurricane Beryl now formed in the Caribbean, we're reminded that gas prices could experience some jolts in the second half of the summer should a storm threaten refining capacity in Texas or Louisiana.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It wasn't until his mother, Maggie Miller, learned of Kona Ice and encouraged him to look into it that he considered the idea.\n\"I always had a passion for cooking, and I always wanted to start a food truck or some type of food business,\" Christian Miller said. \"My mother had found out about it, actually, at an event she was at, and she saw this and told me about it and said, 'This is the next big thing.' Just looking at the truck was almost overwhelming. She said, 'This is something you have to get into.'\"\nThree years later, Christian Miller owns three mobile shaved ice vehicles and has become a staple in the community.\nMaggie Miller said the trucks have become a family business, and everyone pitches in to support Christian in accomplishing his dreams. However, in the beginning, many people were surprised by Christian's choice of career and would have never thought that it would have been as successful as it has become, she said.\n\"My husband laughed at him. Now, three trucks later, he's no longer laughing,\" Maggie Miller said. \"He thought it was a fleeting thought, and it wasn't. And when I told Christian about it, it really struck a chord. He was so excited by it. And I think it was just one of those feelings you have when all the stars align, and everything comes together.\"\nChristian Miller is excited to announce that he has purchased a fourth truck to serve coffee, hot teas, hot chocolates, lemonades and over 200 beverage options to the community during the upcoming winter months, when people are less inclined to want shaved ice.\nThe truck will be called Travelin' Tom's Coffee Truck.\nAlong with his success, Christian Miller said he is proud to use his business to support different organizations and nonprofits in the area. His company gives back 20% of the sales whenever it is asked to attend an event for a nonprofit.\nThe business has been used to help raise funds for different little leagues, schools and churches.\nMaggie Miller said her son's community work extends beyond nonprofit events. He offers free shaved ice to police officers in uniform, EMTs and firefighters.\nMore than anything, Christian Miller said he is just happy that he was able to start a business on the Eastern Shore. His trucks serve Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne, Talbot and Caroline counties.\n\"That's what I love, just giving back to the community,\" Christian Miller said. \"The Eastern Shore is my home, and I've always wanted to stay here. I love it so much, and it's great that I can give back to my community at the exact same time.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Eastern Shore Brewing was built on love and beer\n\n July 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Business \n \n 478\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS — Lori and Ace Moritz, owners of Eastern Shore Brewing, began their love story over free beers, which soon kicked off a life of shared commitment, family, dreams and yes, more beer.After a while of being friends, Ace couldn't contain his crush on Lori and began visiting her every week during her shift as a bartender. She said he was not good at being subtle, and she knew he liked her immediately.\nOne day, her boss and longtime friend began to ask her why the numbers were off for Sierra Nevada pale ale. Lori had been giving Ace free beer every time he visited her, which was her way of encouraging him to keep coming back.\n\"There was just a really good chemistry, and I knew he was in love with me because he couldn't stop staring at me,\" Lori said. \"And I really loved him. He's a good person. I had a good feeling.\"\nSoon, they started dating, got married and began daydreaming about owning a brewery.\nDuring Lori's first pregnancy, she took a leave of absence from work, and Ace got laid off. The safety net that they had relied on was gone.\nThough worried about the future, they took it as an opportunity to chase after their brewery dream.\nThey decided to move out of their home in Rochester, New York, and after a time of searching, they found the town of St. Michaels during a family visit.\n\"The owner of the building (that would become Eastern Shore Brewing), Tad duPont, was racing on a log canoe, and we were introduced to him, and somehow the brewery came up, and he said, 'I have this perfect spot for you,'\" Ace said.\nDuPont showed them what would soon become the Eastern Shore Brewing. Toward the end of the tour, duPont told them that there wouldn't be a need for a lease and instead made a deal with the couple.\nHe wouldn't charge them for rent until they sold their first beer.\nNow, 17 years later, Lori and Ace's award-winning beers and electric presence in the community have helped grow St. Michaels. The Moritzes' beers are sold throughout Maryland, Delaware and Washington, D.C.\nLori and Ace are part of the board for the annual St. Michaels BrewFest, a festival to help support local businesses in town.\nThe couple said they pride themselves on building connections and community with the town.\nJay Hudson, a former employee and longtime friend of the couple, said Lori and Ace motivated him to move to the area and find his home in St. Michaels.\n\"What they do there is more than just great local brew, but Eastern Shore Brewing is a testament to hard work and perseverance,\" Hudson said. \"They convey how a local brewing can be so important to a community.\"\nLori and Ace said that their partnership has grown over the years, and more than anything, they are happy to be together. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If the merger clears the necessary federal and state regulatory hurdles, the four Maryland stores would be taken over by C&S, a private wholesale grocery supply chain that operates Grand Union grocery stores and the Piggly Wiggly franchise.\nKroger and Albertsons previously announced they intended to sell stores in Maryland, but had not identified which of the state's 18 Harris Teeters would eventually change hands.\nKroger and Albertsons are facing strong opposition to the merger from some states and the Federal Trade Commission, which is charged with enforcing antitrust laws and promoting consumer protections. The agency along with nine states including Maryland filed a lawsuit in February challenging Kroger's $24.6 billion bid to purchase Albertsons.\nAuthorities have said such consolidation across the grocery retail industry, which has accelerated substantially since 1990, contributes over time to higher prices for consumers, producers and especially low-income households with food accessibility challenges.\nKroger and Albertsons' plan to sell its stores to C&S may help ease regulatory concerns ahead of a possible consolidation.\nLillian Reed is a reporter with the Baltimore Banner.

According to box office records, theaters in the U.S. and Canada earned an estimated $4.48 billion in 2021 compared to $11.32 billion in 2019.\nOver time, as other theaters began to recover, Triton Entertainment looked into why Cambridge wasn't.\nWenger said they discovered it had to do with money.\n\"People were really having to make some difficult decisions about whether or not they could take the family out for a night of entertainment at the movies,\" he said. \"We understood that what was probably impacting Cambridge specifically was the economic hardship.\"\nAnd so Triton Entertainment came up with a plan to improve the theater's amenities while also offering prices that make it easier for a family to spend a night at the movies. Now, at any time of the day, customers of the Cambridge theater can sit back in a power recliner and enjoy a film with popcorn and soda with free refills for $14.\nWenger said the new concept, which was rolled out in mid-June, makes it so that admission tickets are always $7 — no matter what day or time — and a popcorn and soda combo is $7.\nAlong with the new concept, Triton Entertainment also made some changes to the Cambridge movie theater itself. Along with a facelift to the lobby, the theater now boasts power recliners and a self-serve popcorn station.\n\"We could have simply just slapped $7 on the admission price all day, every day and $7 on concessions and left the old facility the way it was,\" he said. \"But we didn't want folks to come in and go, 'Well now we know why we're only paying $7.'\"\nThe success of these changes are evident in the numbers. Wenger said that the week of July 1, attendance was up 169% compared to the same week last year. The week before that, attendance was up 273% compared the the same week last year, he said.\n\"The variable is there were some really good films,\" Wenger said. \"But we have the ability to look at our other locations and compare those. They're not seeing those kinds of percentages.\"\nWenger said there is \"no doubt\" the community is responding positively to what Triton Entertainment is calling \"cinema redefined.\" Along with increased attendance rates, the company is noticing — through a zip code study — that people are traveling to the theater from farther away than before.\n\"So the concept is working,\" he said. \"And we're happy to see that.\"\nAndrea Kelley-Freeman, the founder and CEO of Life's Energy Wellness Center, said the nonprofit has been bringing its summer camp to the Cambridge theater for three years now. She said the new ticket price model has been a benefit, as the nonprofit raises money to take its campers to the movies every week.\nWith an increase in customer volume, the new ticket price model isn't hurting the theater's profits, Wenger said. This success is something Triton Entertainment hopes is here to stay.\n\"We need to make sure that this isn't just simply a flash in the pan,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Governor proposes $149 million in cuts to state budget\n\n July 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: State News \n \n 578\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Maryland Gov. Wes Moore's administration proposed nearly $149 million in midyear spending reductions last week to steer more money to help fund child care and Medicaid as state officials continue to wrestle with budget challenges.Moore will present the cuts this week to the state's Board of Public Works, which has the authority to cut up to 25% of the state's operating budget. The powerful three-member spending panel is comprised of the governor, the treasurer and comptroller, all of whom are Democrats.\n\"This morning, my administration submitted a plan to make targeted and strategic spending cuts and grow our economy while simultaneously protecting the programs and projects that Marylanders care about most,\" Moore wrote in The Baltimore Sun on Wednesday.\nHis administration decided to propose budget changes early in the fiscal year, which began July 1, to help for future planning. Both the child care program and health care are priorities for the administration.\n\"We've taken a disciplined, data-driven approach that prioritizes investment in areas that connect Marylanders with employment and build new pathways to work, wages, and wealth for all,\" the governor wrote.\nThe need for the spending adjustments has arisen due to larger-than-projected participation in a state program to help pay for child care and higher-than-expected retention of Medicaid participants as Maryland, like other states, has undergone post-pandemic eligibility reviews.\nFor example, when Moore entered office in January 2023, there were about 24,000 children enrolled in the state's child care scholarship program. By late 2023, that figure had grown to about 33,000 children, the administration says. When the governor prepared the budget for the state's current fiscal year, it was anticipated that 38,000 to 40,000 children would participate, but as of June, that number already had grown to over 40,000.\n\"Already, we've increased the number of children enrolled in the state's Child Care Scholarship Program by 70% since Inauguration Day,\" Moore wrote. \"That means an additional 16,000 children and their families are now receiving the support they need.\"\nThe governor also noted that the proposed budget actions \"won't cut a penny for critical priorities, from transportation to K-12 education.\"\nMaryland's Medicaid enrollment is currently close to 1.7 million statewide, which is just below the state's peak enrollment during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAll states are reviewing their Medicaid rolls after a three-year, pandemic-era prohibition on ending coverage expired.\nThe budget reductions are being characterized mostly as trims across state agencies and grants, with a focus on new initiatives that won't have as much of an impact on services currently delivered to residents.\nMoore submitted a balanced $63 billion budget in January for the current fiscal year. It did not include tax increases, but the General Assembly changed the legislation to take in new revenue, including a variety of transportation-related user fees to help pay for transportation projects and tobacco tax increases to help pay for education.\nDebate to address longer-term budget shortfalls is expected to resume when the General Assembly convenes in January.\n\"Every state is dealing with fiscal challenges without federal COVID funding,\" House Speaker Adrienne Jones, a Democrat, said. \"Today's budget announcement is part of an ongoing process where we'll look at every option to continue to balance our budget and protect our priorities.\"\nSenate President Bill Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat, said he appreciated the administration's thoughtful approach \"to addressing difficult fiscal realities while protecting core values.\"\n\"As new data emerges in the coming months, the Senate of Maryland will continue to make the best budget decisions to invest in our residents and grow our economy,\" Ferguson said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

For now, we'll continue to see small price fluctuations as we await news of any hurricane-fueled refinery disruptions or other supply challenges as we head into the busiest weeks of the summer travel season.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Leggett said the creamery is in a unique position to have events like this because they are able to create all their flavors of ice creams.\n\"We can be so creative,\" Legget said. \"And the fact that we can make this event happen by having all of these unique breakfast-themed flavors sets our business apart.\"\nPrior to its start, countless customers would ask if the creamery ever made breakfast-themed flavors. At first, the creamery would try to design breakfast-adjacent flavors, but after a while it decided to really commit to the theme.\nIt was through this commitment that the \"Ice Cream for Breakfast Day\" event was created. Now, customers eagerly await the event all year to see the new flavors and potentially win a prize for best \"just woke up\" look.\nWorkers at Scottish Highland Creamery scooped up \"breakfast themed\" flavors such as fruity pebbles, blueberry muffin, coffee donut and strawberry pop tart to eager customers of all ages Tuesday morning.\nMichele Etherton, accompanied by her daughter and two young grandchildren, Axel and Sofia Etherton, said she looks forward to this day all year.\n\"It's our favorite day of the year,\" Michele Etherton said. \"And we get a sticker that says 'Ice Cream for Breakfast,' and we get bragging rights at school.\"\nAxel and Sofia say their favorite flavors are chocolate and kool-aid ice creams. Their mother, Fillippa Etherton, said she enjoys the time to do something a little different during the summer.\nLeggett said she would bring her children to this event when they were young, and it would be the highlight of their summer. She hopes to do the same for other families.\n\"So many people come in and they think back to their summers as a kid, and this is one of those events that they remember,\" Leggett said. \"And it's a huge privilege for us to be able to be a part of that.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Guests can make reservations now.\n\"We have been working with Brampton 1860 for the last year; first in conjunction with a dinner cruise boat we operate (Chester River Packet) and more recently with the outdoor dinner program that Hilari has designed. It has been an ideal partnership. We have complementary strengths and bring them to these events. We believe that, in addition to benefiting both of our operations, we are adding an element to the Chestertown community,\" said Kelley McIntire, owner of Occasions Catering.\n\"It's a great example of the 'rising tide theory,' she adds. \"In addition, the 'crew' at Brampton (Hilari, Dave, Donna, et. al) has been fun to work with.\"\n\"Dinner guests can expect an elevated farm-to-table experience starting with a welcome glass of Crow Vineyard and Winery Sparkling Barbera and an appetizer-infused cocktail hour followed by dinner on the Renaissance Garden Terrace. The menu has been crafted to include a first course of heirloom tomato gazpacho, followed by a salad of baby greens including a Champagne vinaigrette. The main course will be a jumbo lump crab cake with lemon aioli and filet mignon with a reduction and corn salsa accompaniment. A dessert of sweet blueberry crumble with homemade ice cream will follow,\" according to an announcement from the inn.\nThe evening's wine pairings will be presented by James Glendinning of J L Beverage Marketing of Baltimore, (Glendinning Wine & Spirits) and the evening's piano entertainment will be performed by concert pianist Michael Casey of Rock Hall.\n\"We just started working with James Glendinning,\" said Hilari Reinhart. \"We were pleased to learn he supports several other small businesses on the Eastern Shore in their fine wine and spirit collections. He's extremely knowledgeable and has helped us select a great selection of wines and spirits not found just anywhere. He also helped us identify a great selection to pair with our Dining Under the Stars dinners. It's a fun pairing we have worked out.\"\nBrampton 1860 is located at 25227 Chestertown Rd., Chestertown.

Cristal explained that when you put pilings in, it's half in and half out, so at least 25 feet should be buried.\nWhen they are leaning, most likely they are cracked, she added.\nAnd Bramble pointed out no job is the same since the surface varies. Some surfaces are more sandy, or rocky, or like in parts up the river, there's mud.\nAlso there's the turbulence of the work. Waves are always pushing and pulling the boat and barge, which can lead to a highly dangerous situation. Workers could go overboard if not careful. The push barge with the excavator could tip, especially during the recreational months when people zoom by with speed boats and no consideration for the intricacy of their work.\nWhen the waves are too rough, they have no choice but to come to a complete stop and wait for waves to subside before going back to work.\"Our guys get frustrated,\" Cristal said. \"Summertime is not fun.\"\nDangerous, but in 41 years in the business, Bramble's had no incidents...knock on piling wood.\nAnd they stay busy all year round. After the Betterton job was completed at the end of June they were bound for Cecil County.\nBramble also keeps busy fielding questions from curious bystanders too who often stop and ask questions.\nHis wife of 26 years understands that fully, knowing the business in and out.\n\"What they do is pretty amazing,\" she said.\nFor a complete list of services they offer, visit www.bbpiledriving.com \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

GOTTO Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Business \n \n 533\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ROCK HALL — One of Kent's newer restaurants, Flying Decoy Bar & Grill, once home to the Bay Wolf Restaurant, was purchased last winter and updated to better reflect the tastes of its new owner and chef, Chris Golder, using a pleasing neutral palette to complement the colorful series of stained-glass windows that grace this building's main dining room.Golder steps in as a seasoned entrepreneur after his last full-time role in the kitchen of 98 Cannon Riverfront Grille in Chestertown. Taking a quasi-hiatus since its closing in 2021 due to a fire, Golder, who was a partner at 98 Cannon, says he had been looking into other opportunities but was not content to proceed until the Bay Wolf property came on the market.\nNot one to be a bulk restaurant supply shopper, Golder says he prefers to cook from scratch, and has crafted a menu that speaks to the seasonally appropriate and locally advantageous.\n\"I think we do simple food and, hopefully, present it well,\" Golder said. \"I spent eight years on private yachts and got to travel around. So, I think when I was over in Europe, you got to see the simple food just done really well, just using really good ingredients. We maybe just take a twist on some things.\"\nGolder's appreciation of scratch cooking has followed him since his solid start at Baltimore's Brass Elephant Restaurant. Nearly every step along his culinary path since then could best be described as an experience in \"Let's see what we have to cook with,\" as opposed to \"Let's order a bunch of this and cook it.\"\n\"I guess it's just the way that I was brought up,\" Golder said. \"A lot of people sit there and tell me I could take shortcuts, but at the same time, it's hard for me to do dishes that if you go to (a distributor) and you buy patties that are already made — frozen fish and stuff like that. It's just not me.\"\nWhile the menu is certainly elevated in its purpose to be flavorful and offer a little something for everyone, Golder said he is also conscious to keep an eye on price points for the inflation-weary and to source from as many local vendors as possible. His list includes Lockbriar Farms, Nice Farms Creamery and Crow Vineyard and Winery.\nThe current menu includes three seasonal salads, an ongoing crab cake special and a respectable wine list that he says will be improved upon as he goes. Golder is also an accomplished pastry chef and offers nightly dessert options.\nSomething that he is currently doing is offering a special Thursday Steak and Lobster night that features $7 martinis and a surf-and-turf-based menu that includes an eight-ounce Marinated Grill Bavette Steak with sides for $29 and a Stuffed Lobster with Crab Imperial for $38. All dinners come with a house or spinach salad and a baked potato, hand-cut fries or whipped potatoes.\nCurrently open for lunch and dinner Monday through Saturday, Golder said he is pleased so far with the dinner traffic and will give his lunch hours a chance to take hold over the course of the next year.\nTo that end, he is currently offering a three-course lunch special for $14. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The former abandoned doctor's office in Easton has been renovated into two apartment units with modern appliances.\nCraig Postlewait, president of Olde School Builders, said he is passionate about reconstructing old buildings and giving them new purpose.\nPostlewait said his business has the goal to reconstruct and improve historic buildings while maintaining their integrity.\nWhen choosing buildings to renovate, he says he seeks out buildings that other people feel are \"too much to do.\" Though he purchases the building for renovation, he sees himself as more of steward than an owner.\n\"I'm the steward of the building,\" Postlewait said. \"I take care of the building, and to me, that's the part that keeps me doing what I do. There's a lot of other jobs that I probably could have made a lot more money doing other things, but I found something that I love doing, and that's what keeps me in it.\"\nFor over 40 years, Postlewait has committed himself to the reconstruction of historic buildings. The former doctor's office now blends modern amenities while attempting to keep \"the charm of Easton's historic architecture,\" according to Postlewait.\nAmy Kreiner of the Talbot County Chamber of Commerce said Postlewait is dedicated to preserving buildings' histories.\n\"He understands that homes are more than just structures; they are reflections of their owners,\" Kreiner said. \"Through their standards of excellence and unwavering dedication, they create spaces that not only enrich our community's character but also bolster our local economy.\"\nPostlewait said he feels proud of all his finished projects.\n\"It's pretty amazing to be able to say not only did I do that, but I was a piece of the history,\" Postlewait said. \"I was never a big history buff, but I found that I'm actually now a part of history being made because somebody's kids or grandchildren are going to live in those buildings someday.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland gas prices drop 9 cents over past week\n\n July 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: State News \n \n 455\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Average gasoline prices in Maryland have fallen 9.0 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.48 per gallon Monday, according to GasBuddy's survey of 2,167 stations in Maryland. Prices in Maryland are 3.5 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stand 9.6 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has fallen 4.0 cents in the last week and stands at $3.79 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $3.15 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $4.29 per gallon, a difference of $1.14 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has fallen 1.9 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.47 per gallon today. The national average is up 3.5 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 9.9 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nJuly 22, 2023: $3.57 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.57 per gallon)July 22, 2022: $4.33 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.38 per gallon)July 22, 2021: $3.03 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.15 per gallon)July 22, 2020: $2.26 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.19 per gallon)July 22, 2019: $2.69 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.75 per gallon)July 22, 2018: $2.82 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.82 per gallon)July 22, 2017: $2.27 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.28 per gallon)July 22, 2016: $2.15 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.17 per gallon)July 22, 2015: $2.70 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.75 per gallon)July 22, 2014: $3.59 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.56 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.44 per gallon, down 10.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.55 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.66 per gallon, up 2.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.64 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.48 per gallon, down 8.0 cents per gallon from last week's $3.56 per gallon.\n\"Most of the country has seen a reprieve from rising gasoline prices, thanks to weaker-than-expected gasoline demand, building supplies and a quiet period in the tropics,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"While a good portion of the nation saw average gas prices decline, severe weather completely knocked out power to a major refinery outside Chicago early last week, immediately impacting gasoline supplies to Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana and Michigan, and pushing prices up considerably. We've often said how critical refineries are, and with a long power outage, we're seeing the impact very quickly, but relief will eventually arrive. For now, as we approach the end of summer vacations, I'm hopeful gas prices will continue to edge slightly lower in the week ahead.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Delmarva Balloon Rides: providing fun throughout the Eastern Shore\n\n July 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 594\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Todd Davis is in the business of amazing people.Whether it be providing people with hot air balloon rides across the Eastern Shore or entertaining people as a magician, Davis has made a life bringing unique experiences to people.\nFor over 20 years, Davis, owner of Delmarva Balloon Rides, has been providing countless people of all ages with not only the chance of flight, but a unique view of the Eastern Shore landscape.\nDavis believes the hard work he has put into his business have been more than worth it.\n\"I have the biggest balloon in Maryland,\" Davis said. \"I've already fulfilled my dream.\"\nFor Davis, his journey began when he was in his early 20s and a friend invited Davis to accompany him on a hot air balloon ride. He was hooked.\nDavis would spend the next decade working toward making that one experience with his friend his everyday life.\nBut the journey to piloting hot air balloons is no easy feat, Davis said. To pilot a hot air balloon, a person needs to get instruction from a commercial pilot, as hot air balloons are considered an aircraft that needs to be licensed and registered with the Federal Aviation Administration.\nAdditionally, a potential pilot is required to have a minimum of 10 hours in \"free balloons,\" which must include six flights under the supervision of an instructor. Potential pilots must also take various tests and obtain a license, similar to getting a license for an airplane.\nIt took about 10 years for Davis to fulfill all the requirements as well as earn enough money to buy the needed equipment. During those years, Davis said he was earning money by being a magician and providing people with a different kind of unique experience.\nToday, Davis says he knows his flying area like \"the back of my hand.\" He said he is confident of his piloting skills, ensuring even the most height-fearing flier an enjoyable experience.\nDuring flights, he provides experiences such as a 360-degree view of the Eastern Shore and picking leaves off the tops of trees.\n\"It makes you feel like a bird,\" Davis said. \"The whole process from set up to the end, and the landing is something that people don't realize what they've signed up for. They're always happy.\n\"... All those fears and worries of heights, all those worries go away after we take off,\" he said.\nTom McKnight, a chaser at Delmarva Balloon Rides, said in his role he handles the equipment, assists the pilot with flight preparation and follows the balloon during flight and packs up.\nFor McKnight, the opportunity to experience the world from an Eagle's point of view is one of the best parts of this line of work. Alongside the view, McKnight says he enjoys being a part of the hot air balloon community and working with Davis.\n\"There are no strangers,\" McKnight said. \"You are a part of the crew pilot, or have anything to do with the balloons, there are no strangers. I could go to any balloon company and start helping them, and it's just like we've known each other for years. It's just a good bunch of people.\"\nFor Davis, he hopes to continue his flights for years to come. He said if he one day retires from his career, he would look back at his years of work and feel satisfied bringing people joy and making them \"a part of nature.\"\n\"If I stop doing everything I've done to make people happy, I will have completed my mission on this planet,\" Davis said. \"(Because) at this point, I made thousands and thousands of people happy.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "2nd quarter housing statistics for the Eastern Shore\n\n July 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MID-SHORE BOARD OF REALTORS | Section: Business \n \n 624\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Low inventory continues to be the theme for the second quarter of 2024, according to Mid-Shore Board of Realtors President Shelby Roney.For Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties, 736 homes were sold during the second quarter of 2024, and these homes sold in two months or less.\nAnother positive indicator for sellers is the list price compared to the sold price. Homes are selling for 95% or better than the current asking price on average, which is great news for those looking to maximize their profits.\nFor the five Mid-Shore counties the second quarter of 2024 home prices averaged:\nCaroline County's average home price was $295,845, a 3.75% decline compared to second quarter of 2023.Dorchester County's average home price was $295,600, a 1.7 decrease compared to the second quarter of 2023.Kent County average home price for this quarter was $523,250, up 30.29% compared to the second quarter of 2023.Queen Anne's County average home price in the second quarter 2024 was $589,539, a 5.23% increase from 2023.Talbot County's second quarter 2024 average home price was $900,800, showing a 27.22% increase compared to the second quarter of 2023.\nWith interest rates still higher than many buyers are willing to pay, plus the lack of homes available for sale, it's not surprising that the number of homes sold in all but one county declined in the second quarter of 2024.\nIn Caroline County, 89 homes sold this quarter. This is 18 fewer homes than this time in 2023.\nDorchester County had 155 homes sold. This is six fewer homes than this time in 2023.\nKent County sold 97 homes. This is 17 more than in this time 2023.\nQueen Anne's County had 234 homes sold, 23 fewer than this time in 2023.\nIn Talbot County, 161 homes were sold. This is 23 fewer homes than in the second quarter of 2023.\nSellers usually ask how long it will take to sell their home, Roney said. In a balanced market, a five- to six-month supply of homes is typical.\nCurrently, the single-family home inventory has a four-month supply. However, some buyers are not waiting for interest rates to drop. Sellers can expect their home to sell in one to two months in our area.\nHomes for the second quarter of 2024 in Caroline County sold on average in 45 days, which is 20 days faster than in the second quarter of 2023.\nDorchester County homes took seven days longer to sell, or 56 days, compared to this time in 2023.\nKent County homes took 43 days on average to sell, nine days longer than the second quarter of 2023.\nQueen Anne's County homes sold in 35 days, seven days longer than this time last year.\nTalbot County homes sold on average in 30 days, seven less days than in the second quarter of 2023.\nBeginning Wednesday, Aug. 14, buyers will be required to sign a Buyers Representative Agreement with the realtor of their choosing before being shown property. This is a nationwide ruling from the Department of Justice and applies to all agents.\nIn this agreement, it will state the services the agent will provide to the buyer and the compensation due to the buyer's agent at settlement.\nFor Maryland, this is not new. Maryland has had buyers representation since 1999 and formal written agreements for the past 16 years that are continuously updated to comply with Maryland Code. What might be new to some is having this agreement signed before a home is shown, Roney said.\nThis agreement provides additional transparency and will help buyers understand who pays the buyer's agent and how much they are being paid. Just like it has always been, the commission is negotiable.\nWhen you are thinking of buying a home, it's important to speak with several Mid-Shore realtors before you decide which realtor is best for you. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Power hungry: AI is putting data centers on steroids, accelerating energy use, cooling needs\n\n July 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: Business \n \n 1089\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The warp speed developments of artificial intelligence are propelling exponential growth — but also ravenous power and cooling appetites — for data centers, which are driving the technology backbones behind the machine learning upheavals across the world.The AI-powered data storage market is projected to grow from $28.7 billion this year to as much as $217.3 billion by 2033, according to a market analysis by Precedence Research.\nThat's just one of scores of bullish and ambitious growth expectations for AI's impacts on server farms and other technology infrastructure.\nDell Computer founder CEO Michael Dell said at this year's South by Southwest (SXSW) conference that AI could drive 100 times more demand for data centers and their computing capacity over the next 10 years.\nDan Watts, CEO of US Signal (which operates data centers in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois and Indiana, and is adding others in Oregon, Colorado and Arizona via its recent acquisition of OneNeck) agrees.\n\"It's going to be a massive growth driver for data centers,\" said Watts.\nHe sees AI hyperscalers — big technology companies such as Microsoft, Google/Alphabet, Amazon, Oracle and IBM that provide cloud computing service and operate big data centers — driving approximately 60% of that growth in the short-term.\nNUCLEAR OPTIONS\nThose same big tech firms, along with private equity technology investors and data center developers, are also confronted with AI's voracious energy and cooling needs, potential strains on power grids and water supplies and their climate-change inspired promises to curtail carbon emissions.\n\"AI and machine learning are very power intensive,\" Watts said.\nAn analysis by Goldman Sachs projects AI driving a 160% increase in power demand from data centers by 2030.\n\"On average, a ChatGPT query needs nearly 10 times as much electricity to process as a Google search. In that difference lies a coming sea change in how the U.S., Europe and the world at large will consume power — and how much that will cost,\" reads the Goldman Sachs analysis released in May.\nAll that worries environmental groups concerned about climate change, droughts and rising temperatures already straining power and water systems.\n\"American energy consumption is going up for the first time in 20 years. Data centers are a huge part of what's driving that,\" said Michael Khoo, a program director with Friends of the Earth.\nKhoo foresees potential battles over power supplies and water allocations between high-intensity data centers and other users. Data centers require cooling — often in the form of water-based systems — to keep servers and processors from overheating.\n\"I see very real fights for power access for local communities versus data centers,\" he said.\nFor utilities to keep up with data center needs, U.S. power grids could need a $2 trillion overhaul, according to commercial real estate firm JLL.\nPrivate power grids — including some that could be powered by small-scale and micro nuclear reactors — could be developed to keep up with the capacity demands of AI data centers processing oceans of data and electronic transmissions.\n\"We're just using so much technology. That is not going to change,\" said Pat Lynch, executive managing director and global head of data center solutions for CBRE, a national commercial real estate firm.\nLynch said small modular nuclear reactors are being seriously explored by large data center operators with concerns about whether renewable sources and traditional grids can keep up with demand while also avoiding increased carbon emissions.\n\"The demand is migrating to the places where they can now find power,\" he said, noting potential natural gas and hydroelectric paths to powering and cooling high-volume data centers.\nSmall nuclear reactors to power and cool data center still have to gain regulatory approvals and could face community concerns. But there is interest in their development from big money players, including Microsoft, as well as its founder, Bill Gates — who is developing a new sodium-cooled nuclear power plant in Wyoming.\nThe nuclear energy segment for data centers could ramp up to a $38.3 million marketplace globally by 2028, and hit as much as $278.4 million by 2033, according to BIS Research Inc.\nSPACE INVADERS\nThere are more than 5,380 data centers currently in the U.S. and close to 11,000 worldwide, according to technology firms Cloudscene and Brightlio.\nData centers are currently located across the country. That includes near major internet and telecommunications hubs in Silicon Valley and Northern Virginia outside Washington, D.C., as well as other big cities and regions including the Pacific Northwest, Midwest and Mountain West (including Idaho and Wyoming).\nWatts said three components to data centers are being monumentally impacted by the AI revolution.\n\"You've got floor space. You've got power, and you've got cooling,\" said Watts, referring to space and power needs, as well as ways to keep servers and IT infrastructure from overheating.\nPOWER PLAYS\nData centers currently consume 3% of power nationally — a figure that could rise to 8% by the end of the decade.\nThat could be accompanied by a doubling or more of carbon dioxide emissions from data centers by 2030, according to the Goldman Sachs analysis.\nUtilities (large and small) are trying to navigate the new AI universe.\n\"In some areas of the country, the demand for electricity is growing faster than the available capacity,\" said Ben Fowke, CEO and president of American Electric Power, during a congressional hearing in May. AEP operates in 11 states, including Ohio, West Virginia, Tennessee, Texas and Louisiana.\n\"Just a few years ago, a large-scale industrial manufacturing facility might require 100 megawatts (MW) of electricity – enough to power about 100,000 homes. A facility that size would typically be one-of-a-kind in a region and would be a major source of economic activity for the area.\nNow, it is common for a single data center to require three times to up to 15 times this amount of power for a single site,\" Fowke said.\nLynch said AI-driven demand is driving limited supply for exponentially larger data center capacity, but sees technology infrastructure developments in Atlanta and Dallas. He also sees more projects landing in Ohio, Indiana, Nebraska and Nevada, as well as areas of Virginia and Maryland with ample power grids. Data centers avoid places with potential weather and other power disruptions.\n\"What we're seeing today is growing demand and very little supply — mostly limited by utility capacity,\" he said.\nLynch said some existing data center space could be retrofitted to accommodate AI needs, but said that can be challenged by the need to maintain existing operations, and some might eventually become obsolete.\nThe commercial real estate broker sees rural areas landing more data centers related to cryptocurrency (which have less intensive power needs than their AI counterparts).\n\"It seems like crypto is a more viable option for those communities,\" Lynch said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "BeeGeorge Honey: 'Every day keeping bees is a great day'\n\n July 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Business \n \n 679\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — According to his mother, when George Meyer was a baby, a swarm of bees flew in an open window and landed on his cradle.\"I was ordained since then,\" Meyer, now the owner of BeeGeorge Honey, said as four hives of bees buzzed a few feet away.\nAbout 12 years ago, Meyer made a career change. He left his job as a program manager at a computer company to spend his time caring for 150 hives and bringing joy to people throughout Maryland with his locally sourced honey.\nThough it was a big decision at the time, it was not a surprising one. Meyer said he had been preparing his whole life to make this popular hobby a full time job.\nAs a child he would find creative ways to obtain and care for hives, and as a young adult he spent a year and a half keeping Africanized bees and doing pollination work in Nicaragua.\nOver the years, Meyer has taught classes on beekeeping, given small tours of the hives and provided mentorship to bee enthusiasts of all ages.\nDuring a tour of his Oxford site, Meyer sought through the hives with his bare hands, thousands of bees swarming around him. In swift and quick motions he used a beekeeping smoker, a device designed to emit cool smoke when working with honeybee colonies, to help inspect the hive. Meyer said the device calms bees as the smoke interferes with the bees' primary form of communication, which is smell.\nThroughout the tour, Meyer made sure to explain the high functioning environment of a hive from the worker bees, brood (baby bees) in the pupa (cocoon) stage and closely pointing out the queen bee herself, who only mates once in her lifetime.\nAt some point, Meyer looked through the hive and excitedly pointed out glossy combs in the hive which he explained was honey. According to Meyer, nectar, honey, comes from flowers and nectar can be a high percentage of water but honey is 16% to 18% water, so the bees evaporate off the extra water by fanning away moisture with their wings before it is officially honey.\n\"Fortunately for us, honeybees aren't very good at figuring out how much nectar they need, and they way over produce,\" Meyer said. \"As a beekeeper, I've got enough experience to know how much they're going to need in the wintertime, and so I just take the rest.\"\nAnd that is where his profits come in. Meyer bottles up the extra honey and sells it to local businesses throughout the Eastern Shore.\nRicky Travers, owner of Simmons Center Market, said he has been selling BeeGeorge Honey for about five years now and says he is happy to work with local businesses.\n\"It's great having a local supplier, and just being able to pick up the phone and give him a call and the next day he drops him in here to us, takes good care of us, and his products are just really, really good,\" Travers said.\nKeith MacPherson, owner of Captain's Ketch Seafood, said BeeGeorge's local honey is not only popular along the Eastern Shore but provides many people with health benefits.\n\"It (BeeGeorge Honey) is very popular,\" MacPherson said. \"It has a very good following in the area with customers and very good customer service … A lot of our customers say they like it because it's local honey and it's good for their allergies.\"\nMeyer said he is proud with the work he does throughout the Eastern Shore and hopes to maintain a functioning small business so he can continue to have hands-on time with his hives. When asked about his future aspirations he told a story about a museum in Key West.\n\"There's a museum down there about a guy who spent his whole life trying to find the wreck from a Spanish galleon that was loaded with gold,\" Meyer said. \"And so every day he said, 'This is going to be the day,' And okay, that's cool I appreciate that. (But) this is the day for me. Every day is a great day. Every day keeping bees is a great day.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Baltimore are 12.7 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stand 30.2 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has fallen 1.2 cents in the last week and stands at $3.78 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Baltimore was priced at $3.19 per gallon yesterday while the most expensive was $3.99 per gallon, a difference of 80.0 cents per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 0.7 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.47 per gallon today. The national average is down 0.8 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 25.2 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Baltimore and the national average going back 10 years:\nJuly 29, 2023: $3.74 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.73 per gallon)July 29, 2022: $4.13 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.21 per gallon)July 29, 2021: $3.07 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.16 per gallon)July 29, 2020: $2.28 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.19 per gallon)July 29, 2019: $2.59 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.72 per gallon)July 29, 2018: $2.76 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.84 per gallon)July 29, 2017: $2.25 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.31 per gallon)July 29, 2016: $2.06 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.13 per gallon)July 29, 2015: $2.63 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.68 per gallon)July 29, 2014: $3.52 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.51 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nMaryland: $3.46 per gallon, down 1.3 cents per gallon from last week's $3.48 per gallon.\nWashington, D.C.: $3.64 per gallon, down 2.6 cents per gallon from last week's $3.66 per gallon.\nHagerston: $3.69 per gallon, down 4.5 cents per gallon from last week's $3.74 per gallon.\n\"We continue to see a mixed bag when it comes to gas prices across the country: states in the Great Lakes region are still being jolted by the Joliet, IL refinery outage, which has also impacted gas prices in some areas of Canada, while areas like the West Coast continue to see notable declines,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"With the summer winding down and GasBuddy data showing disappointing gasoline demand and struggling oil prices, we could eventually see the national average falling a bit more, especially once the refinery in Illinois restarts operations.

John B. Mustin, chief of Navy Reserve and commander of Navy Reserve Force, kicked off the event on board the America-class amphibious assault carrier USS Tripoli with welcome remarks and certificates of appreciation to the attendees.\nNERE is a Navy familiarization day sponsored by the chief of Navy Reserve to recognize employers who provide their Reserve sailors with superior support. Selected employers are chosen from nominations submitted by their Reserve sailor employees.\n\"We honor and recognize the many employers who support our Citizen Sailors, who are often called upon to leave their families and civilian jobs on short notice,\" Mustin said. \"Your support is critical to our bi-coastal nation's ability to maintain maritime dominance — and to protect our economic vibrancy, our security, and our prosperity, which depend upon the seas.\"\nThroughout the event, Steckel and the other employers had the opportunity to experience an up-close look at some of the equipment and capabilities that exist in the Navy Reserve, including a tour of USS Tripoli and a static display of Naval Air Force Reserve's Fleet Logistics Support Squadron (VR) 57. They witnessed demonstrations by the Navy Marine Mammal Program and Undersea Rescue Command. They saw displays by SEAL Team 17, Maritime Expeditionary Security Group 1, Naval Base San Diego Military Working Dog Division and NR Naval Information Warfare Systems Command at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, Turner Field.\nMustin concluded the event with an evening reception on board USS Midway Aircraft Carrier Museum.\n\"Employers like you, who support their reserve and guard members, are an important part of our national defense structure,\" Mustin said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hummingbird Inn: a bed and breakfast filled with love and community\n\n August 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Business \n \n 769\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Owning a bed an breakfast was not a dream Eric Levinson had on his own. The plan was created alongside his late husband, Kevin Woloshyn.The Hummingbird Inn, located on North Aurora Street in Easton, is a product of their shared love of traveling and hospitality.\nThe foundation of the inn and their love began many years ago online, when computer monitors had one color and there were no graphics, according to Levinson. Levinson, who at the time was working in Manhattan, New York, in IT management, went on Internet Relay Chat and began talking to Woloshyn, who was from Alberta, Canada. They connected and soon began sending letters to each other and talking on the phone.\nEventually, they made the decision to have Woloshyn move to New York. Same-sex marriage was not legal at the time, and the couple had to find alternatives to be together through work visas, but once they, did they did not want to be apart.\n\"He was one of these life-of-the-party guys,\" Levinson said. \"He would walk into a room, and everybody was just enamored with him. He was very charismatic, and outgoing, and funny and silly, but extremely intelligent. He spoke seven languages. He and I traveled the world together.\"\nLevinson said Woloshyn was determined to help him find his passion. Bit by bit, Levinson tried to hone in his interest of traveling, cooking and connecting to people. He enrolled in the New York Culinary Institute and began working in a couple of restaurants in Manhattan.\nEventually the idea of opening a bed and breakfast came to the couple, and they decided it would be a project they could do together in the future.\nAfter years of being together Levinson and Woloshyn moved to Canada, where same-sex marriage was legal, and got married. The plan was to wait for same-sex marriage to be legalized before moving back to the U.S., and at the time the issue was being presented to the Supreme Court.\nBut just before same-sex marriage was legalized, Woloshyn was tragically killed by a drunk driver.\n\"Ever since Kevin was taken away, I realized that tomorrow is not guaranteed,\" Levinson said. \"You have to live every life to the fullest.\"\nWith the help of his sister Brooke Drake and his realtor (and future best friend) Jana Mewedith, Levinson found what is now the Hummingbird Inn.\nIt has become a popular bed and breakfast where Levinson hosts events such as weddings, dark dinner experiences, annual Pride events, halloween parities, tea events and fundraisers for local nonprofits.\nDrake said she is proud of her brother and the success he has found in Easton.\n\"It was their dream, and he's done a great job to bring that dream to life,\" Drake said. \"We, me and my husband, have just been so happy for him to have him be able to change his life like this and move forward into a wonderful community that's embraced him and made his inn a success.\"\nLevinson is known as an \"ambassador of Easton\" by many of his guests.\nDan Schumacher, a former guest and current Easton resident, credits Levinson's hospitality for bringing him and his husband to the town.\n\"Eric and the Hummingbird Inn have been instrumental in attracting new residents to the town of Easton,\" Schumacher said. \"I know a number of couples who visited because the inn allows dogs, can host weddings or because it's LGBTQ friendly (the latter of which attracted my husband Rob and I) … Many of us have purchased homes here and now call Easton our home.\"\nThroughout the inn, hummingbirds can be found in every room, framed on many walls and tiny crystal birds floating on every ceiling. In the entrance, there is a wall of framed cards and art of hummingbirds sent by guests called a \"charm\" wall, since that is the official name of a group of hummingbirds.\nLevinson said that for the vast majority of his life, he had no connection to the bird. But after his husband died, he began receiving many sympathy cards with hummingbirds on them.\nFor a while, he was confused by all the hummingbird cards. After a bit of research, he learned of the lore associated with the bird.\nHummingbirds are thought to take on the spirit of people who were charismatic and full of life after they had passed, Levinson said.\n\"I used the hummingbird as a remembrance symbol after he died, and then when the inn started to actually come together, I knew I was going to rename it,\" Levinson said. \"… Knowing this was something that Kevin and I were originally planning to do together, that's why it's called Hummingbird Inn — because it's in his memory.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We have systems in place that are monitoring our network traffic in real-time looking for anomalies that may identify malicious actors' presence within our computing domain,\" said Christie, who is CIO for the local utility.\nHe said Easton Utilities' technology team is using generative AI tools to create source code for new applications reducing development times and getting products to market faster\nSimonson, who serves as director of corporation communications, said her department is using ChatGPT for internal communications as well as for video content going forward.\nLike many other businesses and organizations, Easton Utilities offers a customer service chatbot on its website.\nThe Eastern Shore is not currently a prime market for data centers — many of which are found in Northern Virginia. But the pair said while a data center would require local power grid changes Easton Utilities would be able to accommodate such a project.\nThey both see \"massive potential\" for AI helping with responding to demand trends and helping with energy conservation.\n\"We are always looking to provide information and tools for our customers so that they can better manage their usage and reduce their energy consumption,\" Simonson said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The national average is down 5.6 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 37.2 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nAugust 5, 2023: $3.78 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.81 per gallon)\nAugust 5, 2022: $4.05 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.06 per gallon)\nAugust 5, 2021: $3.07 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.19 per gallon)\nAugust 5, 2020: $2.27 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.17 per gallon)\nAugust 5, 2019: $2.64 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.70 per gallon)\nAugust 5, 2018: $2.84 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.86 per gallon)\nAugust 5, 2017: $2.35 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.34 per gallon)\nAugust 5, 2016: $2.07 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.12 per gallon)\nAugust 5, 2015: $2.62 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.63 per gallon)\nAugust 5, 2014: $3.50 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.48 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.35 per gallon, down 9.1 cents per gallon from last week's $3.44 per gallon.\nWashington, D.C.: $3.58 per gallon, down 5.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.64 per gallon.\nHagerstown: $3.38 per gallon, down 5.2 cents per gallon from last week's $3.43 per gallon.\n\"With oil prices plummeting due to new concerns over the U.S. economy after a poor jobs report, gasoline prices have seen downside in many states, with potential for more to join that trend this week as previous refinery disruptions in the Great Lakes region fade away and the restart process begins,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"Diesel prices have also continued to drop, and while Tropical Storm Debby drops buckets of rain on Florida and the Southeast, it poses low risk to refineries or refined product pipelines, so the storm is not a major concern. With the Middle East on alert after Israel's attacks on Hamas and Hezbollah, there could be an impact on oil prices; however, with an inability to predict the outcome, I for now expect gasoline prices in most states to gently decline in the week ahead, with the Middle East situation being a wildcard.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Entrepreneur tries to 'Make Trappe Great Again'\n\n August 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 660\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TRAPPE — Adorned in a red hat that read \"Make Trappe Great Again\" and carrying a book titled \"Trappe: The Story of an Old Fashioned Town,\" Tom Mitchell, president of Delmarva Management Group and a Trappe business owner, said he has put his faith in the growth of Trappe.Over the last five years, the town undergone significant development.\nMitchell's newest business venture, Cork & Bottle Trappe Liquor Store and the construction of Trappe's new Dollar General are testaments to the effort and strategic planning behind the town's growth.\nMitchell says it is easy for him to believe in the potential of Trappe because it has already been done. In the book on historic Trappe, there passages that describe Trappe as a once vibrant and busy community, one that outshone the majority of towns in Talbot County.\n\"What we're trying to do is we're trying to save the town, bring it back to life and keep it from being dominated by Lakeside across the road,\" Mitchell said. \"We want to maintain the identity of the town itself, because these old towns are very, very special.\"\nIn 2019, Lakeside at Trappe, a residential development began looking to build in the town. Across all six phases of the development's construction, 2,874 equivalent dwelling units are planned.\nAccording to Mitchell, the Lakeside development will draw the people needed to support new businesses in town. He knew that before Lakeside developed further, alongside town leaders and community members, he could help decide what direction the town's future took.\nThe first business he chose to establish was the Coffee Trappe in an old brick bank building on Main Street. To preserve the character of the town, Mitchell said he tries to maintain the historic look of the buildings he purchases even if it would be more cost effective to tear it down and begin new again.\nThe cafe became popular, and soon after came Momma Maria's Mediterranean Bistro across the street, then the Old Trappe Tavern and now Cork & Bottle Trappe.\nCork & Bottle Trappe, the town's first liquor store, was opened following changes in county zoning laws earlier this year that allowed for a liquor store to be opened in the area.\nCurtis Snyder, son-in-law of Tom Mitchell and general counsel for Delmarva Real Estate, said the support he received from local leaders, including the Talbot County Council, and residents when trying to establish The Cork & Bottle Trappe was wonderful.\n\"(The Talbot County Council) were awesome,\" Synder said. \"They supported trying to help all the local towns. There was no reason that Trappe should be denied a Class E license like every other town in Talbot County, and they all were extremely helpful, welcoming and supported every step of the way.\"\nNow, following the development of the Cork & Bottle Trappe, a Dollar General is being built in town.\nThe public relations team for Dollar General said every new store provides economic benefits, including additional access to affordable products for customers, the creation of new jobs, additional tax revenue for the town, and the ability for local organizations to apply for literacy and education grants through the Dollar General Literacy Foundation.\n\"Dollar General understands the unique needs of customers in rural areas and provides great values on products customers use and rely on every day in compact retail locations … we look forward to serving the Trappe community as a positive business partner and good community neighbor,\" an email from Dollar General said.\nDorian Mitchell, Tom Mitchell's son at the marketing director for Delmarva Management Group, said he is proud of the work his family has done to help Trappe, but particularly of the faith his father has in invested.\n\"It's been fabulous respecting townspeople's remarks, being the Town Council, being the County Council as well,\" Dorian Mitchell said. \"And that comes from dad's belief in the power of synergy. And that's something to admire about him. I noticed that he believes in potential. He believes in the power of synergy coming together to achieve greater good.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Inflation stress: Higher car and homeowners insurance premiums add to Americans' economic angst\n\n August 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: Business \n \n 1319\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Insurance costs — for both car and homeowners coverage — are up significantly across the country adding to Americans' financial stresses since the pandemic and ensuing inflation wave.New inflation numbers released Wednesday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed the price of car insurance is up 18.5% compared to a year ago and 75% since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. That compares to overall U.S. prices being up 23% since the pandemic, according to BLS.\nHomeowners insurance premiums have also increased.\nIn 2019 (before the pandemic and its economic upheavals and resets), the average homeowners insurance premium in the U.S. was $1,272 — now it is $2,511, according to consulting firm CAPCO.com and Marketwatch.com\nThat's a 97% increase.\nHomeowners insurance prices are even higher in some states. Some are eye popping.\nThe average homeowners insurance premium with $300,000 in dwelling coverages averages $5,531 annually in Florida — 144% higher than the national average for the same coverage ($2,270), according to financial firm Bankrate LLC.\nIn Nebraska, which has seen premiums rise amid increased claims from hail and wind storms as well as inflationary price pressures, the average premium is $5,655, according to Bankrate. That is 149% higher than the U.S. average.\nAlso driving up premiums were significant damages from hurricanes and tropical storms — which have grown stronger and more destructive in recent years with warmer water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. A number of private insurers have pulled out of the Florida market or gone out of business after big storms, which has increased the public's reliance on the state-run Citizens Property Insurance Corp.\nA growing number of residential property owners are bypassing homeowners insurance with that number increasing from 5% in 2019 to currently 12% nationally, according to Mark Friedlander, director of corporate communications with the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group.\nFriedlander said 15% of homeowners in Florida, which has a significant number of cash buyers — have eschewed insurance.\n\"Florida has always run higher,\" he said.\nHomeowners insurance premiums have also increased in other hurricane- and tornado-prone states such as Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Kansas with warmer gulf waters helping spark more and bigger storms. Areas prone to wildfires have also seen some insurance hikes.\nEarlier this year, Insurance firm Insurify projected homeowners insurance premiums to go up by 10% in Montana, 23% in Louisiana, 10% in North Carolina and 13% in Utah his year after previous national post-pandemic price hikes.\nHI\nGHER PREMIUMS, RECORD PROFITS\nAuto insurance premiums are also up across the country since the post-pandemic spike in prices.\nIn 2019, annual car insurance premiums averaged $1,470, according to a market analysis by insurance portal TheZebra.com. Now, they average $2,329 nationally — a 58% increase.\nSome states have seen even bigger increases and higher prices.\nAverage car insurance premiums average more than $3,000 per month in New York, Florida, Louisiana, Nevada and Michigan, according to Bankrate.\nPremiums for automobile insurance are up 29% in Wisconsin, 42% in Maryland, 54% in Washington state, 33% in Tennessee, 44% in Delaware and 31% in Montana, according to TheZebra.com.\nPremium increases come as the insurance industry reaps some big profits.\nThe American Association for Justice — which represents trial attorneys — points to data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners showing property and casualty insurance companies made a record $87.6 billion in profits in 2023 — up 126% from 2022.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, underwriting improvements helped the U.S. insurance industry earn $39.9 billion in profits up from $7.9 billion in the first quarter of 2023 — a 408% increase, according to the Insurance Journal and an AM Best Special Report.\nINFLATION AND CLIMATESo, what is driving the rise in insurance premiums?\nR.E. Hawley, a writer with Bankrate's research team, said wider inflationary trends and higher costs to repair homes and cars are helping drive premiums higher.\nThe average price of a new car is $48,644 — up 32% since 2019, according to Cox Automotive and TheZebra.com insurance information group.\nUsed car prices are up 27% since 2019, according to the two groups, with the average price of a used vehicle sitting at more than $25,200.\nMore expensive cars have more expensive parts and higher costs related to repairs and mechanic labor, which affects both consumers and insurance companies paying accident and other damage claims.\n\"Rates are going up in every state. It's been going up for a few years,\" Hawley said.\nHawley also pointed to more extreme weather events that cause more financial and property damage — which increase insurance claims and costs and, in turn, premiums.\n\"We're seeing increased wildfires in certain areas. We're seeing a lot of severe weather in areas that are not traditionally high risk,\" said Hawley, who also pointed to more severe hurricanes and tropical storms.\nSince 2019, the U.S. has seen 121 natural and weather disaster with a damages price tag of $1 billion or more. These disasters cost an estimated $667 billion, according to the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information.\nThe warmer waters in the Gulf of Mexico are not only percolating bigger and badder hurricanes, they are also part of the climate dynamics fostering more tornados and other storms in the Midwestern and Plains states.\nHawley said some states have seen increases in insurance fraud and there have been contemporary and post-pandemic increases in distracted and dangerous driving contributing to higher insurance premiums.\n\"There's been an increase in risky driving,\" she said.\nHIGHER REPLACEMENT, REPAIR COSTS\nFriedlander said higher costs of natural disasters have conspired with inflation — including higher repair and replacement costs — to drive up costs for insurers, and in turn, premiums.\nHe said worker shortages in construction and repair businesses have resulted in higher labor costs, which also put upward pressures on insurers. \"Legal system abuse\" also contributes to higher insurance costs via lawsuits and litigation, he added.\nFriedlander said replacement costs — such as materials and parts — shot up 55% during the post-COVID inflation wave — four times the inflation rate.\nHe also said more people are living in the paths of potential extreme weather events and natural disasters, pointing to population growth in hurricane-prone Florida, Texas and the Carolinas as well as weather factors that have resulted in more tornadoes and wind storms in the Midwest.\nThere's also more people living near wildfire-prone areas of the Mountain West, Pacific Northwest and area of California.\n\"We are seeing more storms that are major loss events,\" said Friedlander, pointing to the high costs of hurricanes and tropical storms and the increasing financial price tags of tornados and hail storms.\nAn increase in the number of uninsured drivers on U.S. roads can also translate into higher premiums.\nAccording to the most recent numbers from Insurance Research Council, 14% of U.S. drivers are uninsured, up from 11.1% in 2019.\nCar thefts and insurance fraud also contribute to how auto insurance premiums are priced.\nThere were more than 1 million car thefts nationally in 2023, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau. That is up from 794,000 in 2019 — a 29% jump. Auto thefts jumped 63% in Maryland and 64% in Washington D.C. between 2022 and 2023, according to NICB.\nThe insurance industry also blames a familiar foe for some of the rise in premiums — plaintiff attorneys who specialize in accident claims and lawsuits. In Florida Where are the blue ribs and other states, the insurance industry has pressed for legal reforms to reduce high tides of litigation.\nTOUGH TIMES\nHigh insurance costs continue to add to Americans' economic stress and pessimism headed into the November election.\nNew Consumer Price Index numbers released Wednesday showed overall year-over-year inflation at 2.9% — the first time the CPI has been below 3% since 2021.\nWhile Wall Street and big corporations have done very well since the pandemic, consumers and everyday households are still stressed and strained despite the macroeconomic reports and positive drumbeats.\nA poll released Wednesday by The Economist and YouGov shows 51% of Americans believe the economy is getting worse versus 20% who say it is getting better. Only 12% of those surveyed said their personal financial situation has gotten better, according the national poll. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bay Country Bakery owners celebrate 25 years of ownership\n\n August 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 680\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Neither Gena nor Dave Levy had lifelong goals of owning their own bakery.Gena said they fell into it. The couple had been working in fine dining before they took a leap and purchased Bay Country Bakery from Robert and Connie Minn in August 1999.\nThe pair had just learned Gena was pregnant when they decided to buy the bakery, a longtime Dorchester establishment.\n\"The bakery came up for auction at kind of the same time,\" Dave said. \"We got a little bit of help from our family to buy some equipment and ...\"\n\"... we just started,\" said Gena, finishing Dave's sentence.\n\"We just went for it,\" Dave added.\nTwenty-five years and 28 years of marriage later, the couple has found success in their business and been able to grow it, moving to a larger location and adding a cafe. The business is now located on U.S. Route 50 on the east side of Cambridge.\nIn that time, they've been able to take part in something generational. They've watched children and grandchildren come in to try the doughnuts that their parents and grandparents grew up on.\n\"It's very cool,\" Dave said.\nWhen they purchased the bakery, the Levys inherited the beloved doughnut recipe from the previous owners.\n\"They stayed with us for one week,\" Gena said about the Minns. \"And I remember thinking, 'Wow, OK that's nice.' And then now I'm like, 'A week, God, that was like nothing.\"\nWhen the Levys first took over, there were some people in the community that had concerns.\n\"We were strangers,\" said Gena, who grew up in Trappe. \"And any local community, they're like, 'Who are these people? What are they doing? Are things going to change?'\"\nThe Levys have kept the tried and true doughnut recipe from before their ownership for all these years. But they've added some of their childhood favorites to the menu. They use Gena's grandmother's peach pie recipe and some of Dave's grandmother's Christmas cookie recipes.\n\"She had Christmas cookies up the wazoo,\" Dave said about his grandmother. \"She would spend months making Christmas cookies.\"\nWhen Gena and Dave met in culinary school, one of the things they bonded over was their strong grandmothers.\n\"We had similar backgrounds,\" said Gena, who noted that they both came from food-oriented families.\nAlthough getting to work at 1:30 or 2:30 a.m. to make baked goods from scratch can be rough, the production team at Bay Country Bakery and Cafe keeps spirits high. Those especially early risers listen to podcasts together in the morning, and as more people trickle in, they switch it over to music.\nTaylor Warfield, who has worked in production at the bakery for nine years, starts her workday around 8 a.m., after she's dropped off her 5-year-old daughter, Luna, at school.\nAs she formed pie crusts, she said she learned to bake from her grandmother.\n\"She decorated cakes when I was growing up,\" Warfield said. \"So I wanted to bake.\"\nThough owning the bakery can be challenging at times — from dealing with changes in the economy (when they started, a dozen doughnuts cost $4.75 compared to $16 now) to juggling owning a business and raising two children to having to work unusual hours — Gena and Dave like what they do every day.\n\"I don't like waking up in the middle of the night and going to bed (early),\" Dave said. \"I miss a lot of life. I've sacrificed a lot in that respect but also gained a lot from it.\"\nFor the Levys, it's a rewarding job. Dave is reminded of that every time he sells their goods at the farmers market in Salisbury.\n\"People coming week after week, rain or shine, to stand outside and buy stuff,\" he said. \"That's what keeps me going.\"\nDave and Gena don't yet have a plan in place for when they decide to hang up their aprons and retire. They hope they can pass on the business, whether to their children or someone new, like when the Minns sold the bakery to them 25 years ago.\nThe couple doesn't know what the next 25 years will bring, but there's one thing Gena hopes will still be around: \"This place,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Chad Hill, the company's vice president, said the 82-room hotel stands out in more ways than one.\n\"This is not a prototypical Fairfield hotel,\" Hill said. He emphasized its cleanliness, customer service and customized designs that give the hotel a small-town, Eastern Shore feel.\nEvery year, Hill said Marriott checks into each hotel for a random inspection. Marriott assesses each hotel based on a set of standards, while separately soliciting feedback from recent guests. Based on these evaluations and guest review scores, a small percentage of hotels receive the Diamond Award, a recognition from Marriott of the highest performing tier of Fairfield hotels.\nOf the 1,118 hotels evaluated, the Easton Fairfield Inn & Suites was rated fourth in intent to recommend, fifth in staff service and seventh in cleanliness.\nThe Easton Fairfield was recognized with the 2023 Diamond Award, marking its second consecutive year and third since opening in 2015. However, this year, the hotel went a step further when Marriott recognized it as Hotel of the Year within the Fairfield brand.\nAccording to Cristina Shockley, Hill Hospitality's director of operations, the Easton hotel is a popular destination for corporate stays and those in town for weddings.\nShockley added that many of the employees are familiar with the Eastern Shore and its history and charm, a benefit for guests that are visiting for the first time. Some team members have been at the hotel since it opened, she said.\n\"We're so fortunate to have an incredible team,\" Hill said of the team that hovers around 23 employees.\nSince the hospitality group is based in Easton, Hill said it's special to have the hometown property recognized at such a high level. Hill Hospitality manages six hotels, two each in Maryland and South Carolina, and one each in Maine and New York. Two additional hotels are in the works, including one in Fruitland that will open in June 2025.\n\"Every guest is given the opportunity to enjoy the charming small-town atmosphere that the Easton team provides when staying at our hotel,\" Shockley said in a written statement. \"The Hotel of the Year award is a testament to the team's unwavering commitment to give the ultimate in guest service. When walking through the front door, the hotel has a feeling of timelessness and added pride that distinguishes it from other Fairfields in the brand.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The kitchen store Welcome Home, 29 E. Dover St., had its grand opening on Friday at 4:30 p.m.\"We're a lifestyle store. We help you cook, dine, entertain and relax at home. We believe that everything we touch should be beautiful, serve a function and make everyday life better,\" said shop owner Jennifer Baker.\nThis commitment to quality can be found in the products that line the store's shelves. From Nordic Ware pans, Casafina tableware and Garnier-Thiebaut table linens, there is a legacy product for every lifestyle. From sheet pans, to plates, to napkins and butter dishes, one never knows what they will discover when they walk through the door.\nEvery season the owners edit the cooking tools to reflect the foods and cooking style of the season.\n\"Our displays bring together elements of our two businesses. You'll often find an amazing French jam next to a fabulous sweater, next to delightful measuring cups,\" Baker said. \"We love bringing the process of living together, to showcase beauty and function together.\"\nThis is the third location for the specialty home store; Chestertown and Annapolis each claim a Welcome Home of their own. Chestertown is also home to Chester River Wine and Cheese Company, which Baker runs with her husband and business partner, John Laucik.\n\"We've long loved the vibrancy of downtown Easton and St. Michael's. Earlier this year the 'right' building opportunity popped up, and the time was right to expand our business,\" Baker said.\nIn honor of the newest location of Welcome Home, there will be a trunk show featuring 190-year-old French textile maker Garnier-Thiebaut with samples of fall patterns and 20% off their kitchen and bath linens. All guests may enter to win a $100 gift card and gift basket filled with bath and body products.\nWelcome Home's Easton location is open seven days a week: Sunday-Monday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.; and Wednesday-Saturday 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. For more information visit the website WelcomeHomeMarkets.com or find them on Instagram @welcomehomemarkets. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the study, the baseline system for the passenger ferry plan is estimated to handle approximately 50,000 riders per season. There are six potential passenger ferry routes, all branching out to different communities in the Chesapeake Bay including Baltimore, Annapolis, Easton and St. Michaels.\nDespite an estimated $2.5 million in revenue, the study states that without adjustments or additional funding the ferry system will operate with an anticipated loss of $2.5 million during its first year. But the study shows that the ferry system could stimulate economic growth in the region.\nHeather Tinelli, director of economic and tourism development for Queen Anne's County, said the study was brought together through a grant awarded to the Chesapeake Bay Passenger Ferry Consortium from the Economic Development Administration.\nAccording to Tinelli, if the study is implemented, it has the potential to have a more than $14 million annual economic impact and create over 140 jobs.\n\"It's certainly not something that's going to happen overnight, but it is feasible, and if it's phased in I think there'll be a lot of visitors and residents that would look forward to the opportunity of getting out in the water,\" Tinelli said.\nThe study found significant support from community partners and stakeholders for a regional ferry system, with 67% of survey respondents expressing interest in the ferry service and 62% of community partners interested in engaging activities for visitors as well as residents.\nKristen Pironis, executive director of Visit Annapolis & Anne Arundel County, said in a press release that the study and the consortium showcases the transformative potential of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\"Five counties across the state joined forces to work on this effort,\" Pironis said. \"As we explore next steps, this opportunity can expand to include partners across the Bay. We are optimistic about the study results and the path forward, which could better connect our Chesapeake Bay destinations and create economic impact across the entire state.\"\nThe five-counties consortium consisted of representatives from Anne Arundel, Calvert, Queen Anne's, Somerset and St. Mary's counties.\nTinelli noted the consortium worked hard to provide this information to the public and hopefully, if properly implemented, the results will benefit communities throughout the Shore.\n\"Tourism is a major economic development driver in the state of Maryland, and we feel that working in a regional approach as a consortium, and a Chesapeake Bay region is helpful, even if the ferry doesn't move forward,\" she said. \"To work together to boost the whole region as a whole is a way to move the state's economy forward.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 15.4 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stand 43.9 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has declined 2.6 cents in the last week and stands at $3.69 per gallon — the lowest level in 940 days.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.99 per gallon yesterday while the most expensive was $3.99 per gallon, a difference of $1 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has fallen 4.2 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.37 per gallon today. The national average is down 11.4 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 47.8 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nAugust 19, 2023: $3.79 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.84 per gallon)August 19, 2022: $3.89 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.89 per gallon)August 19, 2021: $3.04 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.16 per gallon)August 19, 2020: $2.25 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.17 per gallon)August 19, 2019: $2.55 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.60 per gallon)August 19, 2018: $2.79 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.82 per gallon)August 19, 2017: $2.30 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.32 per gallon)August 19, 2016: $2.11 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.15 per gallon)August 19, 2015: $2.52 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.66 per gallon)August 19, 2014: $3.42 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.44 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.31 per gallon, down 13.3 cents per gallon from last week's $3.44 per gallon.\nWashington, D.C.: DC- $3.59 per gallon, down 8.2 cents per gallon from last week's $3.67 per gallon.\nHagerstown: $3.32 per gallon, down 6.8 cents per gallon from last week's $3.39 per gallon.\n\"Gasoline and diesel prices continue to trail off across much of the country as summer demand fades away. Lower demand in other oil-consuming nations is also helping to lead the downward pressure on pump prices as we approach Labor Day,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"With little new action in the Middle East to rile up prices and Hurricane Ernesto remaining far out at sea, it looks like the downward trend could continue into the week ahead. As more schools begin to resume, gasoline demand will likely continue to ease. With the transition to winter gasoline less than a month away for the majority of the nation, gas prices will soon begin their seasonal cooling off— just as temperatures soon will as well.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They may soon have another option.Instead of driving around the Chesapeake Bay, or over it via a 2-mile bridge, why not let those visiting other regions of the state do so by plying its waters via new ferry service, according to a feasibility study released last week at the annual Maryland Association of Counties conference in Ocean City.\n\"It leverages the Chesapeake as a connector and I think it can really provide a special service to not only tourists, but also the resident community as well,\" Liz Mildenstein, the executive director of the Visit St. Mary's tourism group, said. \"It also connects communities that otherwise not have a connection.\"\nRoutes would begin as far north as Northeast and Chesapeake City all the way down to Crisfield. Eleven of the proposed stops are on the eastern side of the bay while 10 are on its western shores.\n\"The results of the Chesapeake Bay Passenger Ferry feasibility study mark a promising step forward in this project,\" Calvert County Commissioner President Earl \"Buddy\" Hance (R) said in a news release. \"The ferry service could provide a new transportation link for our community and has the potential to significantly enhance tourism and boost the local economy for not just Calvert County, but all of the Chesapeake Bay region.\"\nThe study examined a plan that would consist of seven baseline passenger ferry routes, including Route 5, which would carry visitors to Solomons Island-St. Mary's City-Leonardtown-Crisfield.\nBoth of St. Mary's stops are on the Potomac River.\n\"I just don't know there's enough people coming from Crisfield coming over to St. Mary's County to spend money to make it an economic advantage for us,\" St. Mary's commissioner Eric Colvin (R) told Southern Maryland News. \"I think in what I know about it, it doesn't necessarily look like there's a lot of benefit for St. Mary's County right now.\"\nBut Colvin also said one potential route that would be viable to St. Mary's would be one that went between the county and Washington, D.C.\n\"I think that would make more sense for us,\" Colvin said. \"If people were able to jump on a very comfortable, very fast ferry from Washington and come down to St. Mary's City or Leonardtown for the day and eat and shop and take the ferry back to D.C., that might be a good day for them.\"\nRoute 3 consists of Annapolis-Galesville-Chesapeake Beach-Solomons Island-Salisbury-Crisfield, while Route 4 would encompass Annapolis-Tilghman Island-Chesapeake Beach-Easton-Oxford-Cambridge.\nCalvert County Economic Development Director Julie Oberg said Chesapeake Beach would be considered an ideal location since \"they've got the restaurants and the parking.\"\nThe other Southern Maryland-based plan is Route 6, which would connect Solomons Island with Cambridge.\nRidership forecast is estimated at more than 291,000 passengers annually, with Route 1 (Baltimore-Annapolis-Matapeake-St. Michael's-Kent Narrows-Rock Hall) the highest route at more than 87,000 riders.\nRoute 4 is estimated to carry more than 51,000 passengers while Routes 3 and 6 are expected to carry more than 25,000 riders. Route 5, which encompasses Solomons Island, the St. Mary's sites and Crisfield, are expected to carry just over 16,000 passengers annually.\nThe vessels are expected to carry 149 passengers at a time and cost about $10/hour, which Mildenstein is based on \"surveys of what people would pay and the national averages.\"\nThe study added that the baseline season would be 26 weeks from about mid-April through mid-October.\nThe economic impact of the ferry stem is estimated to create more than 140 jobs and bring in $6.7 million in income.\nThe study added that a \"significant influx of capital will be required\" of at least $8 million in vessel acquisition costs, up to $5 million in station improvements, and about $5 million in annual operating costs.\nThe study also added that \"the financial analysis estimates a net operating loss in the first year of operations without a subsidy of any kind.\"\n\"It could potentially work,\" Colvin said, \"but there's still a lot that could be figured out in order to make it work, including where the money would come from, because we don't have room for it in our budget.\"\nColvin also added he didn't think \"all of the infrastructure is fully built out for it.\"\n\"That's the part that gives me the most pause, but not in a bad way. It just means we have to do a little more research to understand how are we going to fund this going forward,\" Mildenstein said. \"I think it would concern anybody, however there are various factors that can help that and change that.\"\nAt the Calvert County commissioners' staff session Tuesday morning, Oberg told the board the work on the feasibility study and the entire project \"is a great example of collaboration.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

DeKarske discussed the organization's efforts in improving the visitor center, which includes procuring quotes for new outside signage and providing an interior that follows Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility requirements.\nWard 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry asked if there was a holdup in the town's work on redesigning the interior of the visitor center.\n\"There was a design, we are now tweaking, changing the design slightly,\" Mayor Megan Cook said. \"Yes, there had been a holdup.\"\nDeKarske noted other updates, such as welcoming Tom Maglio as marketing and events manager in July, updating the website and continuing to market towards the Spanish-speaking community.\nShe presented a breakdown of the corporation's funding sources for the 2024 calendar year. 65.4% of funding comes from the Town of Easton, 22.1% comes from grants and 12.5% comes from sponsorships.\nFiscal year 2025 grant funding for the Easton Economic Development Corporation includes, but is not limited to, $300,000 in Project Restore funds and $25,000 in Main Street Improvement Program funds, both from the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development.\nThe latter goes toward marketing, DeKarske said, while the former was awarded to two downtown projects earlier this summer: a Dover Station project to revitalize a former roofing supply center on Dover Street and Dock Street Foundation's project to install a museum and visitor center centered around Frederick Douglass. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The national average price of diesel has declined 3.2 cents in the last week and stands at $3.67 per gallon, a multi-year low.\nAccording to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.89 per gallon Sunday, while the most expensive was $4.09 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has fallen 6.2 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.30 per gallon Monday. The national average is down 20.7 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 49.2 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average on Aug. 26 going back 10 years:\nAug. 26, 2023: $3.72 per gallon (U.S. average: $3.80 per gallon).2022: $3.79 per gallon (U.S. average: $3.84 per galon).2021: $3.01 per gallon (U.S. average: $3.14 per gallon).2020: $2.27 per gallon (U.S. average: $2.23 per gallon).2019: $2.50 per gallon (U.S. average: $2.58 per gallon).2018: $2.79 per gallon (U.S. average: $2.83 per gallon).2017: $2.30 per gallon (U.S. average: $2.36 per gallon).2016: $2.20 per gallon (U.S. average: $2.21 per gallon).2015: $2.46 per gallon (U.S. average: $2.56 per gallon).2014: $3.39 per gallon (U.S. average: $3.43 per gallon).\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.21 per gallon, down 10.1 cents per gallon from last week.\nWashington: $3.58 per gallon, down 0.5 cents per gallon from last week.\nHagerstown: $3.21 per gallon, down 11.0 cents per gallon from last week.\n\"It seems fitting that, in the run-up to Labor Day, the national average has fallen for four straight weeks to its lowest point since February, giving Americans one last chance to hit the road with gas prices being less of a factor,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"GasBuddy is now tracking eight states where average gas prices are already below the $3 per gallon mark, along with nearly 20% of gas stations in the country selling gasoline at $2.99 or lower. These numbers will continue to look better every week as we move into fall.

GOTTO Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Business \n \n 586\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n QUEENSTOWN — Building on her more than eight years of experience as owner of the unique gift and upcycled vintage furniture store Bee Crafty Collectibles on High Street in Chestertown, Helen Cowley has expanded her enterprise to include a second location on the high-profile Outlet Center Drive of Queenstown Premium Outlets.The well-crafted Bee Crafty Collectibles sign created by her husband's enterprise, Bee Crafty Metals, was affixed atop Cowley's suite number 17 in early August in anticipation of the soft opening, which occurred on Aug. 8.\nCowley said she had been thinking of opening a second location for a relatively short time before choosing to move forward.\n\"Well, I thought about it last year and (then) dismissed it. And then, I thought about it again, just this past May and poof, here I am,\" she said.\nFor the last two months, Cowley has been a merchandising, machine ordering and working to fit out the 3,000-square-foot retail space, which she feels will give her core customers more opportunities to find more of the goods and products they already love from her Chestertown location.\n\"When I looked at the space, I thought, well, this is really big, but then it just kind of clicked. I wanted it to be 'bridge to beach,'\" she said, in reference to the distance visitors often travel between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Maryland and Delaware beaches.\n\"So, in the middle of the bridge and the beach is Bee Crafty Collectibles, and I'm going to provide whatever the clientele needs, like kitchen wares, clothes, gifts, purses and socks, and many of the same things I have in Chestertown,\" Cowley said. \"I just try to provide my customers with what I think they'll need so they don't have to go to a big box store.\"\nHer signature product line from Maryland-centric Route One Apparel has been wildly popular in Chestertown, so she is expanding that at the Outlet to be able to fulfill the demand of the growing, tourist-based customer profile in Queenstown.\nSome new merchandise she is stocking is the Happy Crates line of apparel and festive crates. Filling crates with fun activities for kids with cancer has been the mission of another local business — Happy Crates — since its inception in 2009. Ten percent of the sale of every Happy Crates item returns to the organization to help support the mission.\nAnd in the fall, Cowley said, customers will discover that Bee Crafty Collectibles is the place to be for Baltimore Ravens sweatshirts and gear. Right now, the store is stocked with back-to-school essential backpacks, Foozy socks and Cowley's other new line of \"Swifty\" merchandise for Taylor Swift fans.\nThoughts of the grand opening a few weeks ago brought a tear of gratitude to Cowley's eye for all of her Chestertown customers who took the time to support her over those first few days.\n\"I am really trying to make it into an extraordinary gift store just like Chestertown is,\" she said. \"I mean, it is extraordinary, and this is going to make me cry. In fact, the first weekend I had more Chestertown people in here than anyone else.\"\nCowley sees both her enterprises as an extension of her own family, and that's how she wants customers to feel.\nAnd for anyone who may be wondering about the future of her store in Kent County, Cowley simply replied, \"I am not leaving Chestertown in any way.\"\nStore hours for the Queenstown location follow regular outlet mall hours; Monday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Let's celebrate the laborers.The willing workers of America have been the backbone to making our country the greatest nation in the world. People from all over the world have come here in search of a better life by having the opportunity and the freedom to work hard in order to make their dreams come true. The will and the joy of working has made life better for millions who have realized their dreams in America.\nAn acquaintance of mine who has done very well throughout his life has always been a hard worker. He has said, \"The harder I work, the luckier I get.\" Good fortune has never just fallen on him accidentally but he has always worked hard and good things have come his way.\nThere is no way that Americans can stop working. Our government and all that we have and know flourishes or dries up based upon our work. Our work produces products, delivers goods, raises crops, provides fuel and feeds our families.\nA country cannot sit down and expect that all the people will be clothed, fed and medically cared for without a large group of working people. The nation who does not work will soon fold. Our government cares for a lot of people now. Millions of Americans receive Social Security checks and other types of government monetary support. This money does not grow on trees but is reproduced daily by America's laborers who have their nose to the grindstone.\nIf you have a job and are earning a paycheck, then rejoice for your good fortune. There are many less fortunate who would love to be working who no longer have the physical or mental ability to do so.\nWork is a good way to spend your time. Good honest work will keep you out of trouble and is helpful in keeping you out of a state of depression. In most situations, work is physically, mentally and emotionally healthy for people. There are always those dead-end jobs that may be very tough physically and mentally.\nSometimes you may have to change jobs. In America, you can change jobs or start your own business, but you have the option of making a new plan.\nMy dad was a hard-working coal miner. We would have starved if he hadn't been willing to work in underground coal mines for almost 37 years. My mother was a hard worker. Thus, we always had food to eat. Work has a payoff; you can go to the grocery store. Of course, in this economy, we haven't been able to buy as much.\nA dear friend manages a restaurant with 85 employees. Most of them are immigrants who have come into the country in the last three or four years. He said, \"Without them I couldn't operate the restaurant. They are faithful, work hard and do a good job. They also have a network of friends who want to work so I don't have trouble filling jobs. If I had to depend on the local American people in our community, then our restaurant would never survive. The locals don't want to work.\"\nSadly, I've heard farmers in Ohio and Indiana talk the same way. Their farming labor is dependent on the immigrants.\nAmerica will continue to be a strong and great nation if all Americans will keep working. When we hand all our labor over to others and quit working, we will lose our country.\nGlenn Mollette's appear in all 50 states. Learn more about his books, columns and music at GlennMollette.com.

    "date": "2024-09-05",

    "content": "Business owners weigh in on proposal to remove bag fee\n\n September 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 598\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — As the Easton Town Council is divided over a proposal to eliminate the town's 10 cent fee for paper bags, some local business owners are voicing that requiring the fee limits their ability to make decisions for their businesses.The law establishing the fee, which was put in place after Easton banned the use of plastic bags, requires that businesses charge customers 10 cents for every paper bag used. The idea was to encourage the use of reusable bags.\nSome members of the Town Council presented an ordinance to remove the fee at the council's Sept. 3 meeting.\nBusiness owners are divided in their stances on the fee. Some like it, as in reality a paper bag costs them more than 10 cents, and the law helps them to recuperate some of those costs. Others think charging a customer at the end of their purchase is bad for business. Several have said they feel they should be able to choose whether or not to impose the fee.\nJoe Petro owns Hair of the Dog Liquors on Marlboro Avenue.\n\"I don't think the 10 cents is a necessary cost to the consumer, especially in this day and age,\" Petro said. \"From a retail perspective, we already factor the cost of the bag into doing business. To pass that on to the customer — everyone is getting hit over their head with price increases everywhere they go. I think it is ridiculous.\"\nAs a businessman, he finds the rule invasive.\n\"If I want to give someone a paper bag as a retailer, why can't I just give them a bag? Why do I have to charge them 10 cents?\" he asked. \"If I give them a bag, it is my understanding of the law that I could be charged or fined for not charging 10 cents.\"\nBut Petro said he can see both sides of the issue.\n\"One thing good about it is it has made a lot of customers say 'I will just take it and walk out with it.' But say someone comes in and spends $500 on a bunch of really expensive wine or booze, and then I am going to charge them 10 cents on top of that. It is kind of ridiculous,\" he said.\nThere is another business owner who has given up on paper altogether.\n\"I don't think the environmental impact providing paper or plastic isn't going to do justice. It is either all or none. What we are doing with reusable bags is essentially passing on the cost to our consumer,\" said Eat Sprout owner Ryan Groll.\nHe also noted the economics of scale, with large business often getting a better deal on purchasing these bags because of the number they purchase at a time. Profitability is further from reach for small business, he said.\n\"We want to continue to do the right thing, so we buy the reusable bags. We buy 3,000 to 4,000 at time, sometimes 6,000 to 10,000 at a time. In order for us to get these bags at the price we are selling, for $1.50, do the math. As a small business, we have to fork out $12,000 to $15,000 of upfront expense,\" Groll said.\nAs far as the 10 cent ban on paper bags, he is thoughtful about the goals of that policy.\n\"What are we trying to incentivize? Are we trying to eliminate it? Or are we trying to punish people for taking a single use bag. You should, I think, give the business the chance to choose whether or not they want to charge for a bag. I don't charge people to use my WiFi,\" Groll said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "A better option for promoting Chesapeake Bay tourism\n\n September 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 827\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A consortium of five Maryland counties — Anne Arundel, Calvert, Queen Anne's, St. Mary's and Somerset, recently released results of a $250,000 feasibility study on a new Chesapeake Bay passenger ferry system.The study concludes that passenger-only ferries — not vehicle-carrying ferries — serving Annapolis, Baltimore and the Eastern Shore destinations of Easton, Cambridge, Rock Hall, Kent Narrows, St. Michaels, Oxford, Chestertown and Crisfield are feasible.\nMembers of the consortium and other supporters of this new ferry system are well intentioned. The ferry feasibility study looks good on paper.\nUpon closer scrutiny of the Aug. 24 executive summary of the consortium's feasibility study, there are a number of unanswered questions. There is also one alternative that should be thoroughly evaluated before proceeding further. The questions and alternative include:\nWhy does the consortium only have two Eastern Shore counties — Queen Anne's and Somerset?\nWho will pay for projected start-up costs for a base line system requiring at least $8 million in ferry boat acquisitions and up to $5 million in necessary infrastructure improvements such as docks, passenger shelters, restrooms and attraction shuttle services at system destinations before ferry operations can begin?\nWho will pay for projected $5 million in annual operating costs for a baseline system that will be only partially offset by the feasibility studies \"suggestion\" that 50,000 ferry passenger riders will generate $2.5 million in revenue in the first season of operation?\nWhat is this suggestion of 50,000 riders based on?\nWho will cover this deficit if passenger revenue is below projections?\nWhat assurances are there this new venture will not replicate the historical record of cost overruns during start up and post start overruns on new transportation projects?\nWhere do the 67% of individuals live, who responded to a consortium-sponsored survey who expressed interest in the ferry service?\nWhere do the 62% of community partners live and/or operate, who have expressed interest in engaging activities for visitors to and residents of proposed ferry destinations?\nWere survey respondents made fully aware that a new ferry system would not carry vehicles and would thus likely have a minimal impact at best on enormous amounts of vehicular traffic going to and from Ocean City every year?\nAre consortium partners and supporters planning on state or local or government funding, for start-up and post start-up operating expenses? If so, how much?\nAre they acknowledging the following current and projected fiscal realities in Maryland? The state and local governments in Maryland are facing significant challenges in funding current programs including the Blueprint for Maryland's Future (Kirwan Plan). Current projections are the state deficit will be $1 billion in 2026 and 2027, $3.5 billion in 2028, and $4 billion in 2029. Maryland also has a deficit in the state six-year transportation plan deficit that does not yet reflect the loss in toll revenue after the Key Bridge collapse and the yet to be finalized amount of state funding needed to rebuild that bridge. Earlier this week, the state proposed new cuts of cutting $1.3 billion from the six-year transportation plan after previous cuts of $ 3.3 billion to the plan a year ago, cuts that were partially restored by tapping the state's \"rainy day\" fund and increasing vehicle registration fees. Gov. Moore recently told Maryland Association of Counties Summer Conference attendees, all new state spending will be facing \"extreme scrutiny.\"\nIs it realistic to assume state and local funding for the launch and operation of a new Bay ferry service will be a priority or even considered in Annapolis or with local governments in the near future, if ever?\nHas the consortium and supporters of more ferry service on the Chesapeake Bay given serious evaluation of an alternative to meet the goal of a new ferry service to promote tourism that could also help an endangered Chesapeake Bay way of life to survive and hopefully thrive?\nThere are over 400 charter boats registered in Maryland.\nOperators of these charter boats have been and are dealing with extraordinary hardships due to new state regulations limiting the size and number of rockfish that can be caught by recreational fishing enthusiasts who historically come from within Maryland and beyond.\nCharter boats could be more heavily promoted by destination marketing organization in the Chesapeake Bay region for Bay pleasure cruises. Charter boats can take clients anywhere they want to go, whenever they want to go, and for as long or as short a time as they want to go.\nCharter boat operators also can provide data on the actual demand for Bay cruises that may or may not match data from the consortium's surveys on the demand for passenger ferry boats.\nThe next best step for the consortium is to meet with a representative group of charter boat captains to discuss their interest in, capacity for, and feasibility of providing more pleasure cruises on the bay. Charter boats could be a cost-effective alternative to a new, costly and unproven Chesapeake Bay passenger ferry system as the way to generate more tourism and economic benefits for the Eastern Shore and the entire Chesapeake Bay region. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The transfer agreement gave CWDI roughly 22 acres of land — including about 2.6 acres of land subject to a lease agreement between the city and Yacht Maintenance — for $5.\nCWDI has hoped to sell part of those 22 acres to Yacht Maintenance, but with the lawsuit that requested temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctions stopping defendants from transferring any portion of that property, CWDI had been unable to sell the land.\nWith the lawsuit settlement, the city and CWDI have entered into an agreement that allows CWDI to transfer property from the 2021 transfer agreement to Yacht Maintenance.\nAt the CWDI Board of Directors meeting on Sept. 11, Board President Angie Hengst said the sale of that property to Yacht Maintenance is scheduled for Monday, Sept. 16.\nDuring the meeting, the board unanimously voted to allow Hengst or board Secretary-Treasurer Frank Narr to execute any documents necessary for the property transfer.\nNarr said as part of the lawsuit settlement, CWDI has opened a separate bank account for the net proceeds from the upcoming property sale. He said CWDI will report how those dollars are being spent to the city and county once they receive that money.\n\"That was the spirit of the agreement so that the city and county are just aware of where those dollars are being spent,\" he said.\nNarr said it was agreed with the city that none of the money from the property sale will be used for expenses incurred from litigation.\nAt the CWDI Board meeting on July 31, Narr brought up the need for CWDI to sell property so that it can use that money to pay for other expenses. During the Sept. 11 meeting, Narr said that CWDI's finances will look \"a lot more favorable\" once the sale is made.\nAt the end of the meeting, Hengst and Board Vice President Shay Lewis-Sisco expressed excitement and gratitude for the dismissal of the lawsuit with the city. Hengst said the board is looking forward to having a better working relationship with Cambridge and Dorchester County.\nCambridge Mayor Stephen Rideout, who attended the meeting, agreed with Hengst.\n\"So hopefully that'll continue and we can see really good things happening in the future,\" Hengst said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 31.0 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stand 61.2 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has declined 3.4 cents in the last week and stands at $3.57 per gallon — the lowest level since January 2022, more than 900 days ago.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.69 per gallon yesterday while the most expensive was $3.89 per gallon, a difference of $1.20 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has fallen 6.9 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.15 per gallon today. The national average is down 26.2 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 70.5 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back ten years:\nSeptember 16, 2023: $3.68 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.85 per gallon)September 16, 2022: $3.44 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.67 per gallon)September 16, 2021: $3.04 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.18 per gallon)September 16, 2020: $2.24 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.17 per gallon)September 16, 2019: $2.46 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.58 per gallon)September 16, 2018: $2.83 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.84 per gallon)September 16, 2017: $2.64 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.61 per gallon)September 16, 2016: $2.19 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.19 per gallon)September 16, 2015: $2.30 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.30 per gallon)September 16, 2014: $3.34 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.37 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.01 per gallon, down 10.2 cents per gallon from last week's $3.12 per gallon.\nWashington, D.C.: $3.34 per gallon, down 15.1 cents per gallon from last week's $3.49 per gallon.\nHagerstown: $3.03 per gallon, down 15.3 cents per gallon from last week's $3.18 per gallon.\n\"Gasoline prices continue to crumble across nearly the entire nation, with average prices below $3 per gallon in 18 states, with some 65,000 stations selling below that psychological mark. Diesel prices are also falling and are at their lowest level in nearly 1,000 days,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"With the change to winter gasoline happening today at most stations across the country, the outlook is bright for the national average to continue to make a run at falling to $2.99 per gallon for the first time since 2021. But while nearly all states are seeing prices drop, refinery maintenance and some outages at California refineries have led to tight supply and rising prices — a situation I hope can be remedied by the end of the month and help California join in on the decline.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We were able to take on some partnerships and get some grants. We started out with a partnership with the state and partnership with University of Maryland Shore Regional Health, many partners including DHCD (Department of Housing a Community Development).\"\nKidd is not so much a chef as a community connector. Many of the speeches given at the ribbon-cutting event spoke of her tenacity, vision and grit.\nIn front of the crowd, Kidd said, \"I want you to know Four Eleven Kitchen is not just about me. It is about every food entrepreneur, every food business, restaurant owner. We want to be a support system for them. We want to connect not only the dots for the entrepreneur but also connect the community to the food.\"\nShe also said she wants to create a safe place for \"foodpreneurs\" to grow and scale their businesses so that the community can thrive.\n\"Food is one of the things that drops all barriers,\" she said.\nThe facility was equipped with gleaming stainless kitchen machinery. There is a professional-level bakery with mixers and convection ovens. The equipment will be available for community members to book in advance.\n\"There will be a booking portal that will allow them to go in and select their time, their day, what pieces they want to use so there isn't much overlap. We look for a lot of collaborations and synergy to start to happen,\" Kidd said.\nAlyssa Boyd, owner of Humble Hearts Catering and Events, is catering about 80 events a year.

    "content": "'This is hard. It is history': Barber shop closing after more than a century\n\n September 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 988\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After more than a century of serving Delaware, the Main Street Barber Shop in Newark will close its doors for the final time on Friday.Kim Teti, the sixth owner of the shop, is retiring after 31 years and moving to Florida. The shop, which is part of the Klondike Kate's building, will be turned into a merchandise shop for the restaurant or possibly be used as a dedicated place to pick up to-go meals.\nIt's a bittersweet moment for Teti, who has spent the past few weeks saying goodbye to longtime customers, many of whom have become like family.\n\"I am very sad, a little choked up right now,\" Teti said. \"This is hard. Because it's closing after 100-some years, it is history.\"\nThe barber shop is located in the iconic Exchange Building, which was built in 1880 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It was originally built as a grange hall and has housed a meat market, post office, pool hall, general store, movie theater, courthouse, jail, skating rink, gas station and — since 1979 — Klondike Kate's restaurant. One constant through the years has been the barber shop, which according to Newark Post archives, has been there in one form or another for at least 130 years.\nTeti's long association with the barber shop began on a whim.\nAfter growing up near Wilmington, she learned to be a barber while attending Delcastle Technical High School. She honed her skills working at a barber shop in the Hotel DuPont, where she learned from old-school Italian barbers working there, and then worked at a barber shop in Greenville.\nTeti was driving through Newark one day when she saw the Main Street Barber Shop and decided to stop in and ask about part-time work. The owner at the time, Ralph Burchard, spent summers in Maine and was planning to close the shop for the summer unless he found someone to fill in for him.\n\"A week later, he gave me the key to the shop,\" Teti recalled. \"He went from Memorial Day all the way to Labor Day, and I worked the entire summer all by myself.\"\nShe filled in for Burchard a couple more times and then, in the summer of 1993, a fire damaged Klondike Kate's and the barber shop. Burchard, then 81, decided to retire instead of dealing with the expense and stress of repairing the damage.\nTeti decided to take over the business full time and her husband, a tile contractor, worked to restore the historic shop, which reopened a few months later.\nOver the years, she has strived to keep the business in the style of what she calls an \"antique barber shop,\" with a barber pole outside, high ceilings, large windows, original cabinets, old-style barber chairs, pictures of Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando on the walls and a tile mural depicting Main Street of yesteryear.\n\"I never wanted to modernize it,\" Teti said. \"I always wanted it to stay like turn of the century.\"\nThough the barber shop hasn't changed much, Main Street has, Teti lamented.\n\"When I first came here, it was Jimmy's Diner, the Post House, and Eagle Furniture was up there. It was a mom-and-pop town,\" she said. \"And then it changed. I liked the way it was. It was awesome.\"\nWhen Teti took over the shop, she charged $7 for a haircut. Now, she has to charge between $20 and $25 to keep up with rising costs.\nThe addition of a covered deck for Klondike Kate's a few years ago made the barber shop a lot less visible, making it harder to draw in foot traffic.\n\"You can barely tell it's a barbershop,\" Teti said. \"Back in the day, it stuck out like a sore thumb, and then they built the deck.\"\nShe has also seen the type of customer change. She used to get a lot of university students, but \"now they go to the shops where they play the loud rap music and stuff like that,\" she said.\nStill, the shop serves an eclectic mix of customers, some of whom started coming decades ago when Burchard was still in charge. At least one older customer recalls getting his hair cut at the shop when he was a kid, Teti said.\n\"We get all walks of life in here, everybody from politicians to construction people, lawyers, doctors, everybody comes here,\" she said, noting that she even cut the hair of future Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco when he played for the Blue Hens.\nTeti has kept the shop going as Klondike Kate's changed hands twice, each time promoting worry that the new owner might want a different use for the barber shop space. She expressed gratitude to current owner Gianmarco Martuscelli, who told her when he bought the restaurant in 2016 that she was welcome to stay for as long she liked.\n\"Gianmarco was nothing but happy for the barbershop to go on,\" she said. \"But he did tell me a long time ago when he bought the building that when I was done, he had plans for it.\"\nTeti had planned to keep the shop going even longer, but her husband recently suffered an injury that forced him to retire, so the couple decided it was time to move to Florida and take advantage of the second home they bought a few years ago.\nShe's looking forward to the warmer weather but doubts that she's hung up her barber shears for good.\n\"Most barbers work until they're in their 80s and can't work no more. I'm too young to really retire at 64 years old,\" she said, adding that she may find part-time work in Florida.\nTeti said she'll miss her customers the most.\n\"It's not a hard job, and you make friends along the way. You don't get rich off of it, but it's a good career,\" she said. \"I can honestly say that I never got up and said, 'Oh God, I gotta go to the job today.' It was always a happy place to come to.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Conroy said she had the realization after her sister's dog got sick, and they had to travel over 2½ hours to get care.\n\"We need better vet care on the Shore,\" Conroy said. \"The vet care is just so few and far between on the Shore. So we finally, kind of decided to lock down servicing this whole Shore area.\"\nRoberts said they were both working at an emergency room in Laurel, Maryland, prior to owning the clinic together. They became friends while working overnight shifts. Conroy worked as a technician, and Roberts worked as a veterinarian.\nConroy said they worked really well together and became best friends due to their similar levels of commitment to their work and expectations of themselves.\nConroy said that though they were passionate about their work, it is a \"thankless job,\" and working in emergency room services can make workers lose their love for their work due to being \"beaten down all the time.\"\nThe idea of a mobile clinic restarted a passion for Roberts and Conroy.\nNow, their clinic provides a variety of services to people throughout the Eastern Shore, including urgent care services, hospital transport, wellness services and emergency care.\nFor Roberts, it's important that they treat the whole patient. With their personalized care, they can provide services to cater to the individual needs of the animal and to the needs, wants and limitations of the owner.\n\"This is a way that we could really control all the components (from) the standard of care, the prices, and when you need to mark things up, and when you don't,\" Roberts said. \"There's a time and a place to mark things up more significantly than other things. And we really think it's important that we're not profiting significantly off of the essential vital services like euthanasia.\"\nJamie Romph, client of AnywhereVet, said when her yellow lab Dixie got sick she turned to the AnywhereVet to provide Dixie with the most comfortable care she could. Even going as far as providing Dixie with pain medicine at 10 p.m.\n\"Those girls will be there for you, whether it's on video, answering a text message or (saying) 'hey, you're right. This is a real we'll be right out and we'll come help you through it,'\" Romph said. \"All the vets are great, but they work business hours. These girls have upped it a notch.\"\nRoberts said they look forward to continuing to work across the Eastern Shore and hope to one day establish a brick and mortar clinic to better serve all their patients' needs.\n\"Every pet deserves care,\" Roberts said. \"Every pet deserves that no matter what, even if they are fear aggressive and they want to bite my hand off, they still deserve care, and I will find a way. Holly and I are really good, and we still love them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

We celebrate not only their accomplishments but also the bright futures that each of them is carving out in our community,\" she said.\n\"META is a six month intensive business development and coaching program aimed at providing a cohort of small minority businesses with the resources they need to scale,\" said Sam Shoge, cofounder and partner of Rivers and Roads Consulting, who served as program facilitator and coach.\nThe program intends to close the knowledge resource and funding gap between minority-owned and non-minority owned businesses, he said.\nData is applied across all minority businesses including women-owned and veteran-owned, he said, and the importance of the program is noted in the disparities between minority and non-minority owned businesses, he said.\nThe average revenue of black sole proprietorships versus non-minority sole proprietorships is $22,000 versus $50,000 respectively, according to Shoge.\nOn average non-minority owned businesses are six times larger than black-owned businesses, he said.\nA total of 15 applications from women and minority owned businesses were received in 2023 and five Queen Anne's County businesses were selected to participate in the inaugural program, he said.\nParticipants included Moniesha Baynard, owner of Three Guys and a Girl Personal Chef and Catering; Diane Moorman-White, owner of DMW Soul Fitness; Timeka Wheeler, owner of Long Live Assisted Living; Deayna Ewell, owner of Onyx Beauty Supply Salon Barbershop; and Ebony Johnson, owner of Tips and Toes Nail Studio.\nThe six-month program at the Kent Island Library began its first seminar in February 2024 and concluded in August.\nMETA entailed monthly business development seminars including a variety of topics such as market strategy, business planning, sales and customer service, bookkeeping best practices, licensing and regulation as well as personal coaching, Shoge said.\nA key aspect of the program was how entrepreneurs can partner and collaborate and support fellow community small businesses, he said.\n\"Our secretary of commerce Secretary (Micheal) Gill always said that economic development is a team sport and that is very much reflected in this program here,\" Shoge said.\nOfficials were very happy with the outcome and success of the program, with many participants reporting increased revenues, Shoge said.\nTransitioning from a 36-year veterinary career, participant Moorman-White, credited the program with giving her the push and the confidence to prove to herself she could turn her \"side-gig\" into a full time career.\n\"Probably the biggest thing the META program has done for me was it changed my mindset. I am now recognizing the power I possess to achieve my goals both big and small,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore, who used to run his own small business helping underserved students navigate college.\n\"When people would tell me it's really hard to build a business in Maryland, my response to them was always the same: I know, I had to do it myself,\" Moore said in a Monday press call announcing the grant.\n\"This is going to help more Marylanders turn ideas into jobs and businesses,\" Moore said, \"and turn individuals into job creators.\"\nThe money is meant to fuel local growth and provide innovative resources to disadvantaged start up businesses in the state, according to a Treasury press release.\nThis federal funding will go to the Maryland Technology Development Corporation, an independent instrument of the state that provides funding, insight, resources and connections to early stage companies.\n\"There are three 'T's' that every entrepreneur faces: they face a challenge of time, a challenge of talent, and a challenge of treasure,\" said Troy A.

Prices in Maryland are 23.8 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stand 55.5 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has declined 2.1 cents in the last week and stands at $3.55 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.77 per gallon yesterday while the most expensive was $4.19 per gallon, a difference of $1.42 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 1.2 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.16 per gallon today. The national average is down 18.8 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 67.4 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nSeptember 23, 2023: $3.60 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.83 per gallon)September 23, 2022: $3.43 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.67 per gallon)September 23, 2021: $3.09 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.18 per gallon)September 23, 2020: $2.22 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.19 per gallon)September 23, 2019: $2.59 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.66 per gallon)September 23, 2018: $2.80 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.83 per gallon)September 23, 2017: $2.56 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.56 per gallon)September 23, 2016: $2.26 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.21 per gallon)September 23, 2015: $2.25 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.28 per gallon)September 23, 2014: $3.31 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.33 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.01 per gallon, down 0.7 cents per gallon from last week's $3.01 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.21 per gallon, down 13.0 cents per gallon from last week's $3.34 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.02 per gallon, down 0.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.03 per gallon.\n\"With oil prices jumping after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a larger-than-expected half percent, we've seen some states where gas prices have inched back up, while others have continued to decline. Most of these increases should be temporary with declines returning in the days and weeks ahead,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"In addition, for California and areas of Nevada and western Arizona, areas that had been left out of the recent drops, refinery issues are improving and gas prices should start moving lower. While the future looks good for gas prices to continue trending lower for most in the weeks ahead, oil's jump may mute the downside potential just a bit — for now.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

GOTTO Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 639\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — \"Let's open a brick-and-mortar bookstore,\" wasn't exactly the phrase on many entrepreneurs' lips in 2004 when a newcomer to Chestertown saw the potential in a storefront in the 100 block of Cross Street.As owner Tom Martin tells it, he and wife Lizzie had only been in town a couple of times when they started exploring real estate with the intention of having a weekend home option.\nAnd then Lizzie's hairdresser turned Martin's attention to a commercial property, an empty storefront on Cross Street.\nSince leaving a political post in his mid-50s, Martin said, he set out on a personal journey that would hopefully have him figuring out what he wanted to do with the rest of his life. In the current vernacular, this \"pivot\" included working in both small- and large-scale bookstores in Washington, D.C.\nThe plan was to spend six months in this particular sector of retail, which he said he took to, \"like a fish to water.\"\n\"When I got that job, it took me two days to say, 'Man, this is fun,\" Martin said.\nAnd yet, when the storefront opportunity presented itself, he was not quick to put two and two together.\n\"How this all happened was very strange,\" he said. \"It didn't happen by design; I was not looking for a bookshop.\"\nBut eventually he signed lease at 112 Cross Street, despite Lizzie's best efforts to dissuade him. Martin vividly recalled their exact conversation, which took place at Bethesda's Tastee Diner over breakfast one morning.\n\"You're going to what?\" he said was his wife's reply when he revealed that he had decided that he wanted to move forward with opening a used bookstore in Chestertown.\n\"What would you even call it?\" she replied skeptically. Martin relayed that he looked down at the beautiful breakfast on the table before him and replied, \"I'm going to call it The Bookplate.\"\nAnd so it began, with the books from his own vast collection, finds from local outlets like Dixon's Auction at Crumpton, and the good will of many who wished to donate either personally or from estate collections.\nFast-forward 20 years, and The Bookplate is thriving. The place is now home to some 50,000 old and new volumes, give or take, and has seen its fair share of customers, cultural events and milestones.\nSince opening in 2004, Martin has not stressed over the effect technology has had on reading habits. Rather, he balances his approach to tome-centric retail by leaning into the sense of community he can build around books and reading.\nThis connection to the community goes way back, he said. Prior to the pandemic, the store had a small stage and was the place to be for local music, plays and impromptu poetry festivals.\nThat is the state of play at The Bookplate; there is always something going on in and around the store.\nMartin said as a bookseller he chooses not to be influenced and prefers to cast a wide net when it comes to genres and titles.\nWhen the occasion of the store's 20th anniversary on Sept. 11 came around, Martin said, the staff thought to recognize the day with some sort of celebration. At first, Martin said he downplayed the idea because of the way he approaches every day in his life. As a member of an alcohol recovery program for several decades standing, Martin said he is more than grateful for what he has been able to accomplish, in part, because he has been successful in maintaining his sobriety. He also feels it's important to convey the message to others who may be struggling that they should take heart that there is longevity in the program.\n\"Because of who I am and where I'm coming from, I'm just grateful to have the store. Life was turned around and it worked out well. And so, every time somebody comes through that door, I mean, that's a celebration.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Volunteers donate $10K to Chesapeake Housing Mission\n\n September 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 645\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Chesapeake Housing Mission board member and project engineer Dave Mayonado knew he would be building a ramp for a Cambridge resident Thursday morning with the help of a group of volunteers from Regal Rexnord. But he didn't know the volunteers would be donating more than their time.As the group gathered outside Ben Parks' home early Thursday morning to build a ramp, Mayonado was handed a check for $10,000 to be put toward the nonprofit's mission of offering home repair services to low-income families in Dorchester, Somerset, Wicomico and Worcester counties.\n\"This is super timely because it really is needed at this point,\" he said to the volunteers. \"Particularly in this county here.\"\nThis is the third year that Regal Rexnord, an international manufacturing company with a facility in Cambridge, has organized a volunteer day with Chesapeake Housing Mission. Regal Rexnord's human resource business partner Beth Hancock said the company offers 16 hours of paid volunteer work and sets up multiple volunteer opportunities for employees each year.\nMayonado told the group that when COVID-related funding was available, it was easier to build ramps and offer other home repair services to families in need.\n\"But that's gone now,\" he said. \"So we're having some funding agencies telling us they don't have the money.\"\nAlthough Chesapeake Housing Mission is made up of volunteers, the organization needs money to buy materials for the projects they complete. Mayonado said every project costs about $2,000 to $3,000. He said the money comes through funding agencies and donations.\n\"So a situation like this (where) we have an opportunity for them not only to do the job, but then they're going to pay for these materials and maybe two more jobs, or maybe even three — it's pretty cool,\" he said.\nHancock said one of the reasons Regal Rexnord chose to donate money to Chesapeake Housing Mission was because there are many people in Dorchester County in need of health care services. She said there are people who can't get to doctors appointments because their family members can't get them out of their homes.\n\"So this is something that just goes so much further,\" she said. \"And it just could be life-changing for someone who needs to get to the doctor.\"\nRegal Rexnord materials manager Aurora Arriaga, who was volunteering with Chesapeake Housing Mission for a second year, said for people who have difficulties walking, a ramp affects not only where they can go, but how they feel. She said not being able to leave your house can feel isolating.\n\"So I think being able to help the people not feel so isolated, especially nowadays, is just an amazing thing to do,\" she said.\nThe group built a ramp outside of Ben Parks' front door. Parks, a retired waterman, hasn't been able to leave his home in about three months due to medical issues. The ramp built on Thursday will allow him to get in and out of his home safely.\nAs 14 of the Regal Rexnord employees moved and sawed lumber, the 15th employee, Cole Collins, removed vegetation from Parks' driveway. Although that task was not a part of the Chesapeake Housing Mission project, Collins — who owns Peninsula Dirt Works LLC along with being the manufacturing engineering manager at Regal Rexnord — noticed during a pre-construction meeting that the Parks' driveway is not level and is hard to walk on. He decided to bring his tractor to redo the driveway on Thursday.\nCollins, who is a Dorchester County native, talked about the importance of giving back to the community.\n\"It's huge when businesses are able to give back to our local community,\" he said. \"... And I'm glad to be able to give back as well. It's not much, but it's something.\"\nMayonado talked about the rewarding feeling of getting a hug from someone \"who has been locked in their house and now is free.\"\n\"That's the reason we do it, honestly,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "‘Ahead of the curve’: Maryland realtors not as affected by NAR settlement\n\n September 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 632\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A $418 million settlement by the National Association of Realtors has brought forth changes to traditional practices of how broker commissions are paid. Maryland realtors, however, aren't having to adjust as much as their counterparts.The settlement was reached in May after class-action lawsuits by home sellers alleged antitrust violations stemming from requirements placed on listing brokers. The NAR denied any wrongdoing in connection to those claims.\nIn the wake of the settlement, two key changes from the NAR went into effect in August. First, homebuyers must sign a written agreement with an agent before that agent provides any services to the buyer. Second, offers of compensation from a seller to a buyer's agent may no longer be shared on multiple listing services, which are marketplaces for realtors.\nThe Mid-Shore Board of Realtors' stance on the changes is that there is now an increased sense of transparency for homebuyers and sellers.\n\"The lawsuit was really about transparency and how (buyer's agents are) getting paid,\" Shelby Roney, board president, said. \"And it kind of makes you reiterate why you should be paid.\"\nRoney, a realtor for Benson & Mangold Real Estate, said Maryland won't be feeling that first change as much as other states. She pointed out that Maryland has had buyer's agency since 1999, noting a law enacted in 2016 that required written buyer agency agreements.\nMaryland realtors representing potential buyers are used to signing those written agreements, detailing to the buyer what services the agent will provide and at what cost. The national rule will reinforce that routine and force buyers and agents to sign agreements that are even clearer in outlining how much commission will cost for the agent.\n\"We've always been very proactive and ahead of the game, ahead of the curve,\" Roney said of Maryland.\nMeanwhile, other states that did not have clear buyer's agency law had to quickly adjust to the new requirements.\n\"They were already freaking out before March,\" Roney said of other states. \"When I was in California, there were agents from all over the country, and most of them did not have anything resembling buyer's agency. And it was very concerning for them, that they were nowhere prepared. How to explain it, how to even enforce it, how to word it, their state laws were going to have to change.\"\nThe increased focus on explicit buyer's agency agreements only furthers the advantages of a buyer paying their own agent rather than relying on a sub-agent during the buying process, Roney said.\nSub-agents are agents unaffiliated from the listing real estate broker but paid by the seller or seller's agent to assist prospective buyers. They do not work for the same company as the seller's agent.\nSub-agency is still alive in the state, according to Roney. However, sub-agents are only able to provide so much help to buyers since their loyalties are only to the seller. For prospective buyers, having a dedicated buyer's agent is beneficial.\n\"It's the biggest investment that you're going to make in your lifetime,\" she said of buying a home. Roney did note that many first-time homebuyers have benefitted from the seller paying the commission for an agent.\nThe option for a seller to offer compensation to a buyer's agent is still available, Roney said, though not through multiple listing service databases. Now, it'll be clear to buyers before any agreement is signed.\nThe benefits of having a buyer's agent are significant for buyers, especially when housing prices rise, the Mid-Shore Board of Realtors says. It'll also help realtors understand their value and be upfront about what \"tier\" of services they will offer depending on the compensation rate.\n\"You have to know your value and you have to explain your value, and you also have to decide what your tiers (of service) are,\" Roney said. \" … Where do you want me to work for you?\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "More questions on the Chesapeake Bay ferry service\n\n September 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 839\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Recently, numerous media outlets provided updates on a proposal for a new Chesapeake Bay ferry service.The proposal suggests a fleet of passenger-only ferries connecting Annapolis, Baltimore, Kent Island, Easton, Cambridge, Rock Hall, St. Michaels, Oxford, Chestertown, Tilghman Island, Betterton, Havre de Grace, Solomons Island, Chesapeake Beach, North East, Leonardtown, Salisbury, Galesville and Crisfield.\nThe proposal suggests this new ferry service would help boost tourism and economic development in the Chesapeake Bay region of Maryland.\nPrevious media updates reported consultants for five Maryland counties that comprise the Chesapeake Bay Passenger Ferry Consortium — Anne Arundel, Calvert, St. Mary's, Somerset and Queen Anne's concluded a new passenger ferry system was feasible and cost effective.\nThe most recent media updates on this project report that Anne Arundel County alone has received a $3.9 million federal grant, a grant amount far less than a requested $7.2 million.\nAccording to their grant application, Anne Arundel County plans to use the available federal grant money for new ferry service between Baltimore, Annapolis and Kent Island.\nLater this month, a 17-person delegation will be traveling to Sweden. Their itinerary includes a tour of an electric passenger ferry factory and learning more about ferry planning.\nThe delegation includes representatives from the Maryland Departments of Commerce and Natural Resources, the Anne Arundel County Executive, Anne Arundel County senior staff members, Anne Arundel County Council members, Annapolis Mayor, Annapolis City Council members, Annapolis City senior staff, executive director of Visit Annapolis and Anne Arundel County, CEO of the Anne Arundel County Economic Development Corporation and executive director of the Resilience Authority of Annapolis and Anne Arundel County.\nFunding for attendee costs on this trip includes donations of $25,000 from the Denker Foundation and an unspecified donation from the MHE Foundation.\nWhile this most recent update is somewhat informative, it does not provide answers to a wide range of critical questions about this project, some of which were included in my recent commentary on this proposal.\nIn this commentary there are new unanswered questions.\nWhy are all the individuals going to Sweden from state government or Anne Arundel County?Why are there no attendees on the trip from Calvert, St Mary's, Queen Anne's and Somerset counties, all of which are members of the Chesapeake Bay Passenger Ferry Consortium?Do the donations from the two foundations cover all the attendee costs for the trip to Sweden? If not, where will the balance of funding come from?Why was one of their first priorities in the Anne Arundel County grant application ordering two electric ferry boats for service between Baltimore, Annapolis and Kent Island?Why is another first priority the placement of an order for boats before the end of 2024 when no ferry service is expected to start until 2027?How do these priorities impact the feasibility of and timeline for previously announced consortium plans to launch new passenger-only ferries serving all the locations listed above in the Chesapeake Bay Passenger Ferry Consortium proposal?What is the status on efforts securing a public/private partnership to operate the proposed new ferry system?\nTo date, money spent or approved on this new ferry proposal include a $250,000 federal grant for a feasibility study, another federal grant commitment of $3.9 million, another possible federal grant commitment for the balance of the original $7.2 million grant request that was recently denied.\nWhile all of the above questions merit answers, I suggest there are two questions that merit immediate answers before any more money is spent or requested for this new ferry proposal.\nHave members of the Chesapeake Bay Passenger Ferry Consortium spoken to, or will they speak to owners and operators of Chesapeake Bay tour boats to discuss the impact on their business of a new ferry system operated by a public and private partnership?\nA number of these charter tour boat operators already offer regularly scheduled Bay tours. They regularly go to and from Baltimore, Annapolis, St. Michaels, Crisfield, and Cambridge among other Bay locations. Some tour operators also offer customized tours to anywhere clients want to go on the Bay, whenever they want to go, and for as long a time or as short a time they want to go. Recently, a local small business in Easton recently chartered a tour boat for a customized roundtrip between Kent Island and Baltimore for an Orioles game. By all accounts, this trip was a great success.\nHave members of the Chesapeake Bay Passenger Ferry Consortium spoken to, or will they speak to owners and operators of recreational fishing charter boats to discuss on if and how they can expand their services to meet the increased public demand for Bay tours as projected in the consortium's feasibility study on a new ferry? These charter fishing boat operators especially need help as their livelihood and way of life is currently seriously threatened by new state regulations on rockfish fish harvesting limits.\nAnswers to these questions could accomplish two things.\nThey can avoid reinventing the wheel. They could also allow for a more fully informed decision on whether or not this proposed new ferry system is the best and cost-effective program to help increase tourism and economic development in Maryland. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 3.7 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stand 28.9 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has declined 1.2 cents in the last week and stands at $3.54 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.75 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $3.89 per gallon, a difference of $1.14per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 1.4 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.17 per gallon today. The national average is down 15.4 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 63.8 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nSeptember 30, 2023: $3.52 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.81 per gallon)September 30, 2022: $3.43 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.75 per gallon)September 30, 2021: $3.08 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.18 per gallon)September 30, 2020: $2.22 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.18 per gallon)September 30, 2019: $2.54 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.65 per gallon)September 30, 2018: $2.79 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.87 per gallon)September 30, 2017: $2.49 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.54 per gallon)September 30, 2016: $2.24 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.22 per gallon)September 30, 2015: $2.23 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.28 per gallon)September 30, 2014: $3.31 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.33 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.24 per gallon, up 23.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.01 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.25 per gallon, up 3.7 cents per gallon from last week's $3.21 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.11 per gallon, up 8.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.02 per gallon.\n\"Another week brings a mixed bag at the gas pump, with gas prices declining in slightly more than half of U.S. states while others have seen increases due to some refinery snags and maintenance that have emerged, temporarily delaying declines in some areas. Meanwhile, GasBuddy data shows 18 states with sub-$3 per gallon average gas prices, a count that should certainly rise over the next few weeks,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"While Hurricane Helene left feet of rain behind and some states are seeing challenges in getting gasoline to stations, the storm did not broadly impact fuel production. For now, with oil prices falling back below $70 per barrel, the national average may be a bit stuck in the low $3s until fall maintenance wraps up, which could help bring a sub-$3 national average later this fall.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He will be traveling to APG Chesapeake offices in Chestertown, Chester, La Plata, California, Prince Frederick, Dundalk and Elkton for the rest of the week.\nBaez was APG's Southern Wisconsin regional president from August 2020 through 2022. A decade before that, he lived on the western shore of Maryland as the CEO of the Maryland Pennysaver.\nIn 2010, Baez entered the news industry when he took a job with Tribune Publishing Company in Newport News, Virginia.\n\"I joined newspapers in 2010 and have been with them ever since,\" he said.\nAs regional president, Baez will oversee the Chesapeake market.\n\"I'm excited,\" he said about his new role. \"Adams is a great company. They've been really good to me.\"\nBaez — who won the first ever APG Regional President of the Year award in 2021 — said one of his favorite company memories is when the company asked him for his opinion and they supported him.\n\"And they let me go do that,\" he said. \"That speaks volumes for the kind of culture that the company has.\"\nBefore taking on the new role with APG, Baez was the CEO of TravelHost, a publication connecting businesses with travelers. He said that during his time in the news industry, he's enjoyed getting to connect businesses with audiences that desire the products and services of those businesses.\n\"That's the creative part,\" he said. \"That's the energizing part.\"\nBaez, whose family immigrated to the United States as political exiles from Cuba, said he is a big fan of free speech.\n\"From that standpoint I think journalism plays a great part,\" he said. \"I think journalism has evolved a lot, and we continue to evolve it along with what people want. I think we have to get smarter about how we write (and) what we write about because it is something that we have to eventually monetize to sustain.\"\nAPG CEO and President Mark Adams said in a news release that Baez brings \"familiarity and experience\" to this position.\n\"It's always rewarding when we can have an executive like Orestes return to our organization,\" he said.\nWhen he's not working, Baez can often be found on the pickleball courts. The three-time national champ is currently playing on the pickleball Senior Pro Tour.\nHis love for pickleball blossomed after decades of playing tennis. Since picking up a tennis racket at the age of 9, he has won over 300 tennis doubles titles. While in college, Baez played tennis for Clemson University. He also coached the Clemson team while in graduate school there.\nIt wasn't until he was in his 50s that Baez's friend convinced him to give pickleball a try. Since then, Baez has gone from playing the sport recreationally to playing in tournaments.\nAs he settles into his new role on the Chesapeake, Baez is looking for houses in Annapolis with his wife, Donna. He said he is excited to contribute to the Chesapeake team.\n\"It's about removing obstacles and helping guide,\" he said about his role. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 243\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — A new report shows the state of Maryland collected more than $22.3 million in cannabis sales tax revenue between April and June – a 52 percent increase over receipts of the prior three months.As Marylanders take advantage of legalized personal use of cannabis over the age of 21, the recent spike shows the industry's potential impact on the economy, Comptroller Brooke Lierman said in a press release announcing the report.\n\"The market for cannabis continues to grow in Maryland and has shown capacity to create new jobs, new investment and new opportunities, particularly for areas that are marginalized and left behind by a changing economy,\" Lierman said.\nMaryland voters approved a ballot referendum in 2022, supporting legal possession and use for people age 21 or older. Then the Maryland General Assembly passed the Cannabis Reform Act in 2023 and Gov. Wes Moore signed it into law that same year.\nNow it's Lierman's job to collect the taxes and disperse them to different funds supporting public health, business assistance and other public purposes.\nThe new industry is growing, the report shows, and state officials see the potential for more public benefit.\nFor example, 5 percent of the quarterly sales tax revenues go to a fund helping small, minority-owned and women-owned businesses break into the industry.\n\"These revenue numbers are a clear indication of the potential for Maryland's cannabis industry to drive economic growth while prioritizing equity,\" said Audrey Johnson, executive director of the Office of Social Equity. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chestertown antique electrical appliance museum sparks interest\n\n October 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Business \n \n 654\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Saturday, as residents and visitors to Kent County enjoyed the farmer's market on High Street, high school freshman Ryan Helgerman of Gaithersburg walked into Chestertown Electric, curious.The store's name might sound like a place to pay a utility bill, but what he found was something entirely different — a place where time, technology and culture merge.\nIn every corner there's something interesting to see, from Victorian-era clocks to a hand-crank vacuum cleaner.\nAbove Helgerman, spun a 105-year-old copper-plated ceiling fan, operating with fluid efficiently. A space heater from the early 1900's hummed in the corner, generating heat immediately.\nOwner of the establishment, David Hoatson describes his shop as a museum where you can buy the items.\n\"It's like walking into the Smithsonian and being able to purchase a fossil,\" he said, grinning.\nHelgerman pointed to what he thought, understandably, was a music box, which turned out to be a Little Edison high voltage coil from 1900.\nHoatson explained it was probably used as a generator for a spark plug in an old farm engine.\nBeside that was a Carl Zeiss Carbon Arc lamp from the 1920s. That consists of two carbon rods of differing sizes that create a consistent flame when they touch.\nThe customer and shop owner had a great time deciphering its uses, browsing online for German words, trying to track the mechanism's origins. Hoatson is a knowledgeable guide to do so with.\nAs a mechanical engineer for 35 years, working at AAI corporation out of Cockeysville, throughout his career, he's conducted military simulations, working on computer graphics. He's worked on F-35 airplanes, spending much of his time on military bases.\nFor the past ten years he's been into sales, restoration and running his museum. After fixing up his first fan, an Emerson from 1918 he bought on eBay, he's had a steady stream of customers, learning as he goes.\nHe explained that when he disassembles an item he can see not only how it functions, but insights into the time and culture it was built in.\nCase-in-point, Helgerman presented a light socket. There was nothing out-of-the-ordinary really, except it had a key hole on the side.\n\"So if somebody tries to unscrew it, they can't steal it,\" Hoatson remarked.\nLight bulbs in the late 1800's were a day's wages for most people, and so like with anything valuable, protective measures were taken.\nAnother point of fascination was where old technology combined with new technology. For example Hoatson's Nixie tube clocks are all hooked to the internet.\n\"I'm using modern electronics using old tubes,\" Hoatson said.\nThe Nixie tubes were made in the '60s and '70s to put in computers and expensive electronics when they didn't have LEDs and LCDs. It was the only way people could do numbers, Hoatson explained.\nThese tiny clocks flashed the time of the day and date.\nIn the back room, a slot machine from the 1930s caught Helgerman's interest. While he tried his luck pulling the lever, Hoatson explained that inside the machine are separate shelves with varying thickness for the coins that drop down in mathematical sequence.\nAs the young man and store owner talked over inventions, Helgerman's father came in. He too was caught up in the intricate world of the museum. Not only are there inventions, but old maps of the region, Chestertown's history, documents from the 1800s and much more.\nHelgerman told his father, \"I'm fascinated by this stuff. What he's showing is some of the greatest minds of the 1800s. All of this is 130 to 150 years old, and it all works.\"\nHoatson shrugged.\n\"Alot of it just works without having to to fix it up. If I buy a 100-year old ceiling fan, there's probably a 95 percent chance it still runs,\" he said. He added he probably wouldn't have that luck with a 5-year-old one that has plastic parts and is imported.\nHoatson invited the father and son back, as well as the public, to see him at 324 Cannon St. every Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 236\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — State officials revised their estimate of general fund revenues upward this month, making what state Comptroller Brooke Lierman called a \"slight positive adjustment.\"But the change is \"not a dramatic revision,\" Lierman said. \"Our economic performance has been really in line with our previous estimates.\"\nBased on their analysis, the Board of Revenue Estimates submitted a revised estimate of general fund revenues for fiscal year 2025 of $25.1 billion and an estimate of $25.3 billion for fiscal year 2026 — a minor change, though a positive one.\n\"The Board and the Revenue Monitoring Committee will continue to meet and analyze revenue and economic trends in anticipation of December's estimates,\" the board said in its September letter to Gov. Wes Moore. The board updates its numbers three times a year.\n\"Today's presentation represents a moderate increase in our revenues, our economy remains stable, and we are not in a recession,\" said State Treasurer Dereck E. Davis, a member of the board. \"And that's not a small thing to say. There have been predictions, and we've been able to largely avoid that, so to me that's good news.\"\nDespite the positive news, though, the state continues to face massive budget challenges. The state's Department of Legislative Services fiscal said last January that Maryland will start running a structural deficit in fiscal year 2025 that will multiply nearly sixfold by fiscal year 2029, when it is projected to hit $2.93 billion. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 3.5 cents per gallon higher than a month ago and stand 20.0 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The national average price of diesel is unchanged from a week ago and stands at $3.54 per gallon.\"While the national average dipped slightly in the last week, Iran's attack on Israel has at least temporarily caused oil prices to surge to the highest level in months, which could cause the declines to cease for now and could lead to a rise in gas prices for many Americans,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.\nAccording to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.75 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $3.99 per gallon, a difference of $1.24 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has fallen 4.6 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.13 per gallon today. The national average is down 11.6 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 56.2 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nOctober 7, 2023: $3.42 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.69 per gallon)\nOctober 7, 2022: $3.61 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.90 per gallon)\nOctober 7, 2021: $3.16 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.24 per gallon)\nOctober 7, 2020: $2.26 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.18 per gallon)\nOctober 7, 2019: $2.50 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.65 per gallon)\nOctober 7, 2018: $2.84 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.91 per gallon)\nOctober 7, 2017: $2.43 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.48 per gallon)\nOctober 7, 2016: $2.24 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.26 per gallon)\nOctober 7, 2015: $2.23 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.29 per gallon)\nOctober 7, 2014: $3.26 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.27 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.22 per gallon, down 1.6 cents per gallon from last week's $3.24 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.18 per gallon, down 6.3 cents per gallon from last week's $3.25 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.14 per gallon, up 2.9 cents per gallon from last week's $3.11 per gallon.\n\"In addition to the escalation in the Middle East, hurricane season remains active, with Hurricane Milton now heading toward a likely landfall in Florida,\" GasBuddy's De Haan said. \"As a result of potential evacuations, GasBuddy's Fuel Availability tracker will remain online for areas likely to be affected by Milton.

It is designed to better support the local business community.\n\"We worked with contractor Maven and Smith, who really built this new website for us. We put lots and lots of hours into considering how it would look, the message we are trying to send,\" Zimberhoff said.\nHe tailored the site not only for function but also for the people who could use the site.\nThe new site includes sections like relocate and expand, business planning and startup, key industries, and life and leisure. There are aerial photographs of available commercial real estate.\n\"We wanted it to be more useful for anyone doing business in Caroline County — new businesses that would like to come into Caroline County or businesses that are already here,\" he said.\nHe noted farmers and agricultural sector as being a focus of the new design.\n\"We have a lot of folks who are innovating in the industry. Really paying mind to best practices and environmentalism. Another one is manufacturing, they are some of our biggest employers,\" Zimberhoff said.\nHe said there is opportunity to grow with unfinished properties in Denton and Federalsburg. There is warehouse space that is not being used. He wants the county to grow without creating sprawl. He also looked at the retail sector, and empty storefronts indicate that there is room to grow.\n\"We wanted to make sure it was an improvement over the old site. Kendall (Teague) and I put a lot of time into the actual writing, into finding the right pictures and into making sure the messages were clear,\" he said.\nHe said he was excited about the new resources that are on the site and that they are helpful to the business community. Like workforce development and training to how to start your business to working with a lender.\n\"Another tool I am excited about is Resimplifi. It is driven towards commercial and industrial real estate. And agricultural real estate. It is a tool that produces a map and other data of all the properties that are available in Caroline County. It lists them in a way that is easy to find,\" Zimberhoff said.\nHe said Teague has been a huge help and the Caroline County Chamber of Commerce has helped by spreading the word.\nTo check out the new site, go to carolinebusiness.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2024-10-12",
    "author": "DAVID REEL",
    "content": "Raging against the machine is a poor strategy\n\n October 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 835\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Starting in 1991 and still active today is an alternative rock band that named themselves Rage Against the Machine. That is not surprising since their musical messages consistently promote rage against the machine. For them, the machine is defined broadly as businesses and corporations.In the most recent strike by the International Longshoremen's Association, their public messaging strategy included rage against the machine. Longshoremen defined the machine much more narrowly as the United States Maritime Alliance, an industry trade association whose members are container cargo ship carriers, marine terminal operators and ports.\nAmong other member services, the alliance does labor contract negotiations with union leaders on a range of matters including wages and the use of artificial intelligence powered robots.\nTo generate support for their negotiations with the alliance on those two issues, the union leadership launched a rage against the machine messaging and negotiating strategy.\nInternational Longshoremen's Association leaders regularly issued profanity-laced messages directed at container cargo ship carriers saying they are unappreciative of dock workers role in their success and are indifferent to the concerns of dock workers future in an ever-changing world.\nThe leadership also vowed their strike would continue until all their demands on wage increases and the future use of automation on the docks were met.\nDespite that rage against the machine my way or the highway messaging, there were immediate and widespread concerns that a strike would cause enormous harm to America's economy, including more inflation and possibly an economic recession.\nEven some union members in Baltimore expressed concern about a strike. They had just endured not working for two months after the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse and closure of the Port of Baltimore.\nThree days after the strike began the union president abruptly reversed course on his previous rage against the machine messaging and agreed to suspend the strike until Jan. 15, 2025.\nHe acknowledged a tentative agreement with United States Maritime Alliance on wage increases, which were only slightly more than originally proffered by the alliance, and a return to negotiate other outstanding issues.\nThe outstanding issue is a ban on artificial intelligence-powered robotic automation on the docks.\nAfter pausing the strike, the union's leader issued the following statement: \"The ILA is steadfastly against any form of automation — full or semi — that replaces jobs or historical work functions.\"\nHe also said in his statement that the preservation of historical work functions is \"non-negotiable.\" Job security for members and resisting modern technology have been union priorities for decades. In 1977, the last time Baltimore dockworkers went on strike, they strongly opposed the introduction of another modern technology — large metal standardized shipping containers.\nDespite their 1977 strike, the International Longshoremen's Association lost the battle against the use of containers. Containers are now standard operating procedure. Somewhat ironically, last year the Port of Baltimore set new records on handling multi-modal containers using longshoremen workers.\nWhen a railroad tunnel expansion project is completed (scheduled for 2027), Baltimore will be well positioned to send even more containers by rail into the Ohio Valley and on to Chicago.\nOn the yet to be negotiated issue of a ban or limits on artificial intelligence-powered robotic automation on the docks, I predict the future will be a repeat of the 1977 outcome. More automation is imminent and inevitable for three reasons.\nFirst, robots are more efficient and dependable for repetitive and routine jobs.\nSecond, there are decreasing numbers of individuals willing to work on the docks. Even with technological changes on the docks, dockworker jobs can still be dangerous, tedious, and dirty.\nThird, the unions stance that \"the preservation of historical work functions is non-negotiable\" is a message that will not stand. Everything in life is negotiable. In a recent Baltimore Sun article, Will Brucher, a port labor expert at the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said \"Protections are already in place. To keep labor relations smooth, the employers conceded that this was something that was negotiable. It's possible they [ILA] could put a stop on new automation, but what historically has happened is they have job protections around it.\"\nFor a view of the future of technology in supply chain management, look no farther than two massive Amazon warehouse fulfillment centers at Sparrows Point. They were built on the site of the former Bethlehem Steel plant, not far from where Baltimore dockworkers were striking and picketing. At one time, this plant was the largest steel plant in the world and was one of the largest employers in the Baltimore region.\nUnable to compete efficiently it is now gone.\nToday, at Sparrows Point, in indoor climate-controlled Amazon warehouses, robots are helping humans meet the order fulfillment demands of Amazon customers.\nGoing forward there are key lessons on messaging management that should be embraced by the International Longshoremen's Association leaders, other labor unions and many comparable organizations.\nRaging against the machine has not been and will not be an effective messaging strategy in generating public support for your organization's goals whatever they may be.\nRaging against the machine will likely diminish your value to and support from your constituents whoever they may be. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Electric vehicles not quite ready for mass markets\n\n October 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 780\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Ford Motor Company, the second largest car maker in America recently announced it was making major changes in their production of electric vehicles, commonly referred to as EVs.Ford has put a hold on plans they announced last year to spend $1.8 billion to transform an assembly plant in Canada into a hub for electric vehicle manufacturing.\nNow their plan is to shift production at that plant to Ford's gas-powered F-Series trucks which have been the best-selling truck lineup in America since 1977 and Ford's best-selling vehicle overall since 1981.\nIn its coverage of Ford's decision to pivot on EVs, the New York Times noted, \"The move is the latest example of how automakers are pulling back on aggressive investment plans in response to the slowing growth of electric vehicle sales.\"\nThis decision by Ford comes with a measurable impact on its bottom line and on 2,700 auto worker jobs at their Canadian plant.\nThat plan alone will cost the company at least $400 million as they write down the costs for the manufacturing equipment they had put in place to build the EVs. Ford estimates the change in plans could ultimately cost them upward of $1.5 billion.\nThose costs pale in comparison to Ford losing $4.7 billion on EV sales last year, which is approximately $40,525 per electric vehicle sold.\nFord's latest pullback from EVs is no surprise.\nThe economic reality is that Ford, other car makers and advocates for electric vehicles made unrealistic and unsustainable projections on consumer demand for EVs.\nThe two most likely factors for less than projected consumer demand are purchase price and reliability concerns.\nThe July 2024 edition of the Kelley Blue Book reports the average price for a new EV was $56,520, with some models costing more than $100,000.\nReliability is a concern due to a relatively limited number of EV charging stations.\nNationwide, there were 68,475 private and public charging stations at the beginning of this year, according to the U.S Department of Energy. While that's more than twice the number in 2020, it's still just a third of the number of gas stations and well below projections.\nA 2023 survey by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago reported that 77% of those polled voiced concerns about how they would charge an EV if they bought one.\nThis concern is not limited to potential EV buyers. Some current EV owners share it.\nEarlier this year, the New York Times profiled a purchaser of a Ford F-150 Lightning EV. The purchaser said it was the \"coolest vehicle he'd ever owned\" and \"it is unbelievably fast and responsive.\" He also said, \"the technology is amazing.\" High praise indeed.\nThe problem for this otherwise enthusiastic EV owner was the EVs range or, more importantly, lack of range.\nWhen the weather grew colder, this owner found that the distance his vehicle could travel fell dramatically. His faith in the $79,000 truck diminished to a point where he found himself wondering if he should sell it.\n\"People say 'range anxiety' — it's like it's the driver's fault,\" he told the Times. \"But it's not our fault. It's actually they're not telling us what the real range is. The truck says it's 300 miles. I don't think I've ever gotten that.\"\nSuch observations are not a positive branding moment for electric vehicles or for Ford.\nSo, does all this news mean electric vehicles will never be more widely accepted?\nIn a word … no.\nHistory is full of stories where the acceptance of new technologies grew slowly but steadily over time following initial acceptance by early adopters.\nEarly adopters are individuals who buy and try a new product or technology soon after it is available. Early adopters eagerly embrace change, are often (but not always) young, often (but not always) highly educated, and often (but not always) having robust disposable income.\nWhile early adopters are among the first to purchase and use new products and services, they often become public opinion leaders over time.\nWidespread public acceptance of their opinions can be accelerated when producers and marketers of a new technology listen to, accept suggestions from, and address legitimate concerns brought to their attention by early adopters.\nFord appears to be on track to do that. Their president and CEO recently said, \"As the No. 2 brand in the U.S. for the past two years, we are committed to scaling a profitable EV business, using capital wisely, and bringing to market the right gas, hybrid and fully electric vehicles at the right time.\nFord currently anticipates the right time will not occur until 2027 when they plan to resume EV production at their Canadian Assembly plant.\nFor now, it is clear that electric vehicles are an idea whose time has not yet come. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Team effort' is what it takes to build and retain businesses in Kent\n\n October 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 912\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — In a recent interview, Jamie Williams noted that in Kent County, businesses are coming and going regularly.\"It's a churning process,\" she acknowledged.\nFor instance, Rock City Cafe's last day was Oct 12. Then Oct. 15, at that same location, 21536 Rock Hall Ave., Little Lemon Leaf Diner is advertising a hiring event, for kitchen and dining room.\nSome new businesses moved in recently as well. Starbucks is now open for business, and It's Masala Time, an Indian restaurant at 3 Washington Square, had its soft opening on Wednesday, Oct. 2.\nAs director of Kent County Department of Economic and Tourism Development for 11 years, Williams sees this turnaround daily, offering support and creating opportunities for businesses to thrive.\nWhile working with the Economic Commission, business owners and leaders in the community appointed by the county commissioners provide guidance and insight.\nTheir goals line up with the county's comprehensive plan: to retain and expand businesses while supporting start-up businesses.\nWith a hefty schedule to close out the week, Williams, highlighted some projects her staff is working on.\nMillington Senior Housing: The Millington Senior Village is a project that will provide 52 one-story apartments for people age 62 and up.\nThe project is located on land once part of the Millington Elementary School property.\nThe county is working with Millington during the grant search process. If successful, they hope to build a community resource center, food pantry, church and daycare center, centralizing services in one location.\nWith all that activity, Williams hopes to have Delmarva Community Transit services to accommodate residential needs.\n\"The more density we have the more services we can build there,\" Williams commented.\nRailroad Upgrade: Williams pointed out the Worton railroad system, services five companies and was in a state of disrepair for quite a while. The county had received funding from the state to fix the tracks in May of 2020.\nWilliams was happy to announce that in September 2024 that project is finally completed.\nThe fact that from the time they had received the funding to the actual repair was four years, she said, should give an indication to the public of how slow-going these processes sometimes take.\nBrownfield Properties: Williams and staff has identified 12 brownfield properties — places contaminated and needing remediation.\nMost of these properties, the director said, were dry-cleaning establishments, dealing with chemicals. One of these is in Chestertown, Admiral Cleaners, located across from the 7-Eleven on 212 Maple Ave.; a building that sits dormant with graffiti on the walls.\nWilliams asked, is it worth the county adopting a brownfield credit, a state program. Is it worth going through that kind of process to redevelop the properties?\nThey are seeking answers to those pressing questions.\nRecreational Cannabis: Beginning July 1, 2023, individuals in Maryland at least age 21 could legally use and possess the personal use amount of cannabis. Licensing is issued by the State for those who aim to start a dispensary.\nCurrently, Williams said the county issued only one micro-license, for a cannabis dispensary in Millington.\nAccording to earlier reports, the establishment is under Rahul \"Rocky\" Dutta and if meeting all the requirements, will be located in the vacant Truist Bank building at 400 Cypress Street.\nIn talking with Dutta earlier in the week, Williams reported everything is moving forward.\nShort-term rental tax:The county has been working with the municipalities to collect short-term rental tax from properties where AirBnb's or Vrbo properties or other rentals of that nature are located.\nWilliams acknowledged that is an extensive process involving lots of moving parts.\nShe had worked with her administrative specialist Rose Osborn to locate the properties throughout the county. They purchased software to track these properties more efficiently as well as send out notices.\nNow it seems like they are seeing positive results.\nAccording to the July report, Williams said \"64 percent of properties are in compliance.\"\nThe director expects higher in the future.\n\"We feel we're going to see the biggest impact after the September numbers.\"\nOther than using the tracking software, they worked closely with the municipalities to coordinate their memorandum of understandings for short-term rental tax, so they are all on the same page.\nThe county collects the taxes monthly and remit it to the towns. The towns receive 90 percent of the revenue with 10 percent going to the county for administrative costs.\nEven before they purchased the software, Williams and Osborn have been working steadily on this issue since November 2022.\nShe was thankful for the cooperation that occurred since then.\n\"Getting all five towns together is an example of what we need to be doing for a lot of other projects,\" she said.\nBusiness Retention and Expansion: Williams maintained they have always responded to the needs of business owners. However, now, that attention and focus is being formalized as they launch their Business and Retention Visit Program, starting last week.\nThe department has reached out to 10 or 11 businesses so far, refining their data-gathering process and consulting with business owners.\nThey've been all over the county, visiting KRM Development, Hickory Stick and Blue Heron Oyster House to name a few.\nThe qualitative information they gather will be assessed and used to help the community.\nAll of this would not be possible without Economic Development Manager Katie Abbott, the Kent County Chamber of Commerce and many others, Williams noted.\n\"It takes a collaborative effort from everyone; that's how economic development happens.\"\nAs a team, they are helping businesses find their niche area to succeed in a region specific to rural concerns.\n\"We're not an area to put up a big distribution center,\" Williams said.\"We're here to promote businesses focusing on what's unique and special in Kent County.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland unions seek influence in election beyond membership numbers\n\n October 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KATHARINE WILSON Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1329\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — When Darlene Butler-Jones, a 66 year-old shop steward for Giant, walks into a store, people listen.Butler-Jones is part of a group of grocery store workers assigned by her union — United Food & Commercial Workers Union Local 400 — to explain the organization's political endorsements to her fellow employees.\nAs she walks through the store, talking to employees at cash registers and counters, Butler-Jones hears their concerns about fair scheduling, retirement, and dignity in the workplace.\n\"People want change,\" Butler-Jones said.\nAs Democrats and Republicans argue over which party truly represents working people and who will secure their vote, Maryland union leaders say it's not about party, it's about policy.\nCapital News Service spoke to six Maryland-based union presidents and political leaders to better understand how union endorsements work and the impact of unions on politics in Maryland.\nWhat the unions wantMaryland union leaders said they are focused on improving the lives of their members, which most said comes down to their ability to organize.\nDonna S. Edwards is the president of the Maryland State and D.C. AFL-CIO, a federation of more than 50 unions.\nTo get union backing, Edwards said, politicians need to support the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, commonly known as the PRO-Act, and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, a bill to guarantee the right to organize for public sector employees.\nThe PRO-Act, a bill promoted by the labor movement, aims to protect the right to join and form a union by prohibiting common employer intimidation tactics and requiring employees represented by collective bargaining units to pay their fair share of representation fees.\nThis Congress, 263 Democrats, three Republicans and two independents sponsored the PRO-Act. The bill has not been put up for a vote in either chamber. The Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act has seen no action.\nTo get an endorsement from the Maryland State and D.C. AFL-CIO, candidates must first fill out surveys detailing their stances on nearly every issue in some way related to labor. Then top candidates are interviewed by union members and leaders before a final selection is made.\nThe top three factors union officials making the AFL-CIO endorsements consider are the candidate's views on issues, viability and voting record, according to Kayla Mock, the political and legislative director for the local food and commercial workers union, which falls under the state's AFL-CIO.\nUnions are focused on fundamental issues important to working people, like healthcare, child care, and the right to organize, Mock said. These issues, many union leaders say, typically favor Democratic candidates.\nIn the 2024 election, the Maryland State and D.C. AFL-CIO only endorsed Democratic candidates for Congress.\n\"I tell my members this all the time, please bring me a pro-labor Republican. I would love to talk to them. I would love to endorse them,\" Mock said.\nWhile many major unions in Maryland endorsed Democrats for local and federal office, as they have continuously done for decades, this isn't true among all unions and union endorsements aren't always followed by rank-and-file members.\nMaryland-based Teamsters Joint Councils 55 and 62 endorsed the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, breaking from the national union's decision to not endorse a candidate. However, in a Teamsters member poll from July 24 to Sept. 15, 49.4% of Maryland members wanted the national union to endorse Trump, compared to 46.5% for Harris.\nIn the 2020 election, around 60% of union households voted for President Joe Biden, Axios reported.\nJason Ascher, the Mid-Atlantic Pipe Trades Association's political director, said he has some union members who will vote for former President Donald Trump regardless of what Ascher and other union leaders recommend.\nThis trend, particularly among the building trades, Ascher said, followed the 1994 implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement — a pact among the United States, Mexico and Canada — that the Economic Policy Institute, a non-profit think tank affiliated with the labor movement, says led to the loss of thousands of union jobs.\nThe trade agreement, combined with social issues promoted by Democrats, pro-gun attitudes and the populism of Trump, created hard-line Republican voters within the union base, Ascher said. Now he and others are working at the local level to draw more of their union members back into voting for endorsed Democrats.\n\"It's a fight every day,\" Ascher said. \"We have to convince our members, at least in the trades, that the Democrats are the ones helping us right now.\"\nRyan Whittington, the president of the Ocean City Career Firefighters Paramedics Association, leads one of a dozen first-responder unions endorsing the Senate candidacy of former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican.\nWhen his union's board of directors decides to get involved in a state or local election, Whittington said, they open up a poll to every member of the union to select their preferred candidate. In the 2024 Maryland Senate race, Whittington said only two members of his union, which has more than 70 people, did not want the union to endorse Hogan.\n\"Within our local we have individuals who are Democrats, we have individuals who are Republicans,\" Whittington said. \"For us, it's about looking at a candidate who is going to listen to the needs of our firefighters, our public safety officials, and make sure that they have our backs.\"\nWho looks at union endorsementsWhile union members made up just 10.7% of the Maryland working population in 2023, union leaders say their impact stretches beyond their membership.\n\"We are members of the same communities that we're working in and living in. We're the next door neighbors,\" said Paul Lemle, the president of the Maryland State Education Association. \"It's natural that people trust us.\"\nUnion popularity has seen record highs nationwide in recent years. In an August Gallup poll, 70% of Americans said they approved of labor unions.\nPart of this increase can be attributed to younger Americans.\nAround 88% of people under 30 supported unions in an August 2023 poll by the Democratic polling and research firm GBAO, conducted on behalf of the AFL-CIO.\nMock said she has seen first-hand a rise in young people embracing unions.\nHer chapter of UFCW — which includes 35,000 workers across six states and the District of Columbia — held two successful union membership votes for cannabis dispensary workers within one week in Montgomery County, Maryland.\nMock, who was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, said this attention from younger voters could be behind the Democratic strategy to boost the union vote.\n\"We're kind of the cool kids club,\" Mock said. \"Democrats, very smartly, are going 'oh yeah, we actually do need labor.'\"\nIn the 2022 statewide election, Maryland State Education Association members voted at a 24 percentage point rate higher than the rest of the state, according to the director of the union's political and legislative affairs, Samantha Zwerling. In every election, she said, politicians endorsed by the education association have more than an 80% chance of winning.\n\"Unions are inherently part of the democratic fabric of our society...That's what's meant by freedom of assembly and freedom of speech… they encourage participation and democracy,\" Lemle, the union president, said.\nWhat unions want the public to know\"Unions are not these big bosses. Look at me. I'm the union,\" Edwards, the Maryland State and D.C. AFL-CIO president, said.\nThe talkative, charismatic union leader was sitting in an emptying event space during the Democratic National Convention in August, showing her union friends in the Maryland delegation a photo of her holding a \"Union Yes!\" sign during the convention the night before.\nEdwards, a social-worker by trade, grew up in a union home. She first joined a union while working for the Baltimore City Department of Social Services in the 1970s.\nHer union leadership was able to get a pay raise for her unit of social workers — kicking off her passion for labor activism.\nThe union \"is the only institution, in my view, that holds the line on a democracy in this country,\" Edwards said. \"It allows for workers and their families to be involved in the political process, but it also gives you the financial security… to be able to be a contributing part of your community.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's great to see this space reactivated.\"\nOnce Short cut the ribbon outside the restaurant, attendees of the event went inside to enjoy lunch with a view.\nThe restaurant, which was previously located on Glasgow Street in Cambridge, opened at the airport in early September. Short and Wilson said the new location offers a great view where they can serve up food the community loves at an affordable price.\nAirport Director Steve Nuwer said the restaurant \"brings life\" to the airport, which he considers a gateway to Dorchester County. He said there are a lot of people from nearby states that fly to the airport just to have lunch.\n\"So it's a great opportunity for people that are not familiar with this area to come in and experience Dorchester County,\" he said about the airport. \"The restaurant helps bring them in here.\"\nNuwer joked that having a restaurant so close to where he works isn't good for his health.\n\"But they've got really good food,\" he said.\nAlthough the airport has had restaurants in it in the past, it has been without a restaurant since the beginning of 2022 when Katie's At The Airport closed.\nDorchester Chamber of Commerce President Bill Christopher said having a restaurant back at the airport is good because the airport is easy to get to and has great parking. Christopher said Carol's Kitchen serves up good portions of good food at a reasonable price.\n\"It's a good environment to be in,\" he said. \"I think they'll do well.\"\nChristopher called the restaurant \"a natural draw\" for people to come to the airport. He said sitting in the restaurant and watching planes take off could also spark career ideas for young people.\n\"Bringing them out so they can eat and see and start thinking, 'I might want to be a pilot someday,'\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 7.5 cents per gallon higher than a month ago and stand 22.0 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has declined 1.3 cents in the last week and stands at $3.56 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.77 per gallon yesterday while the most expensive was $3.89 per gallon, a difference of $1.12 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has fallen 3.3 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.13 per gallon today. The national average is down 6.2 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 39.7 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nOctober 21, 2023: $3.36 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.52 per gallon)October 21, 2022: $3.68 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.80 per gallon)October 21, 2021: $3.30 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.36 per gallon)October 21, 2020: $2.28 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.16 per gallon)October 21, 2019: $2.49 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.63 per gallon)October 21, 2018: $2.73 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.83 per gallon)October 21, 2017: $2.39 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.44 per gallon)October 21, 2016: $2.24 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.22 per gallon)October 21, 2015: $2.19 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.23 per gallon)October 21, 2014: $3.07 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.08 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.10 per gallon, down 11.2 cents per gallon from last week's $3.22 per gallon.\nWashington, D.C.: $3.23 per gallon, down 2.9 cents per gallon from last week's $3.26 per gallon.\nHagerstown: $3.23 per gallon, up 4.0 cents per gallon from last week's $3.19 per gallon.\n\"The median U.S. price for gasoline has just slipped below the $3 per gallon mark for the first time since early 2024, while the national average price of gasoline has returned to decline as oil prices have begun to cool off after Iran's attack on Israel, due in part to sources saying Israel has agreed not to attack Iran's oil infrastructure,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"With the potential of an attack on Iran's oil infrastructure decreasing as a result, the risk calculus for oil is decreasing, and with continued economic weakness in China providing bearish sentiment, oil prices late last week slipped back below the $70 per barrel mark, opening the door for a longer decline to potentially return to the national average. I'm hopeful that the downward trend will continue again this week for a majority of Americans as we see the average price of gasoline start to make a targeted effort to fall below the $3 per gallon mark for the first time since 2021.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County food pantries gear up for the holidays\n\n October 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Local News \n \n 370\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — With the holidays approaching, Talbot County residents are preparing to hold food-centered gatherings, many with the help of local food pantries.Catherine Poe is the chair of the Talbot County Hunger Coalition, a network of members, providers and individuals working to end hunger and improve access to healthy, nutritious food. For the holidays, there is a big effort by the food pantries to provide festive meals.\n\"It is always so special. People line up long in advance because it is so unusual,\" Poe said.\nCoordinating holiday plans for the food pantries begins months in advance, she said.\n\"The one (at the Senior Center) has already gotten their meals for Thanksgiving and Christmas. At Christmas it will come from The (Maryland) Food Bank,\" Poe said, describing the plan for one of the providers the organization works with.\nGiven the volume of food needed, the pantries get it at bulk prices and never buy from a supermarket. Sometimes donors help out.\n\"The other place is Mountaire Farms. It gives away thousands of free Thanksgiving meals. They are sending the Senior Center 100 boxes. All the pantries have to plan early where they are getting their meals from,\" Poe said.\nThey also get food from the Maryland Food Bank, a nonprofit hunger relief organization. Items from the food bank have to be purchased by the local providers, which Poe said gives citizens who want to help an opportunity to participate.\n\"We prefer cash (donations) because our money goes a long way,\" Poe said. \"... The larger pantries spend about $7,000 a month, so they have to raise that every month.\"\nSt. Marks and St. Vincent dePaul food pantries use funds from their associated thrift shops to support feeding the community. Some other providers have grant writers to try to raise money.\nAlthough the pantries take food from the public, it is more difficult to integrate it into their program than cash donations, Poe said.\nPoe says the best bet is to cut a check to any of the nine food pantries in Talbot County — CarePacks, Talbot County Early Head Start, Brookletts Place, St. Michaels Community Center, St. Marks United Methodist, BAAM (Building African American Minds), Talbot County Local Care Team, WIC (Women Infants and Children) and The Talbot Family Network. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bradford House Apartments under new management\n\n October 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Business \n \n 523\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — The Bradford House Apartments are under new management with a new principal owner.Nuveen — an asset manager and subsidiary of financial planning firm TIAA — has been made principal owner of the apartment complex on Race Street in Cambridge. Bradford House offers multifamily, subsidized housing for low-income individuals who are elderly or have special needs.\nPaths Management Services, a subsidiary of Nuveen, will manage the property.\nOver the past year and a half, residents have expressed concerns about the safety of the building, from bed bug infestations to call-for-aid systems not working to a lack of security.\nIn September 2023, the property — which was then managed by Cleveland-based company Millennia Housing Management — received a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development inspection score of 30c. The score indicated health and safety deficiencies and other problems identified with building systems, the building's exterior and individual apartments.\nIn an email, Justin Henry with Paths Management said that since taking over, the company has begun making \"significant repairs and improvements.\"\n\"Our top priority is residents' safety, so we currently are installing new security cameras, adding new indoor and exterior lighting, as well as updating the building's access system,\" Henry said. \"We are working around the clock to ensure residents feel safe, secure and comfortable in their homes.\"\nBradford House resident and the complex's tenant association chairperson Linda Johnson said new management is friendly and putting in work to address problems on the property. Johnson, who has lived in the building since May 2000, said Paths Management Services has painted her apartment, put new lighting in the hallways and cleaned up the back stairwells.\n\"I can finally really smile,\" she said.\nAccording to an Oct. 18 memo from Cambridge Assistant City Manager Brandon Hesson to the Cambridge City Council, Millennia is no longer responsible for the management of the apartment, but it will remain a \"minority partner\" on the property.\nThe memo says Millennia and its CEO Frank Sinito received a debarment order from HUD, which prevents the company from participating in any new business with HUD.\nIn an interview, Hesson said that while Millennia \"grossly mismanaged\" the property, the finger shouldn't be pointed at any one person. He said it's a partnership between ownership, management, the city and HUD.\n\"The way out of it is for us to get on the same page,\" he said. \"That's all we're trying to do is remind each other that we all benefit, but the residents have to be able to live in a clean, safe environment.\"\nIn the memo, Hesson listed nine areas where progress is being made at Bradford House. Progress includes plans to be completed within 120 days, including completed repair of building's second elevator, commitment from management to do a complete repair of the roof, new contracts for security and security cameras, and advertisement of a service coordinator position.\nHesson said 13 of the building's units have been rehabbed and a plan is being made to address the building's remaining units.\n\"At this week's meeting, 48 open violations were reviewed, and half of those violations were closed and completed,\" Hesson said.\nWeekly meetings between city code enforcement, HUD, management and ownership will continue, the memo stated. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Renovations including redoing the ceiling and floor in the dining area to make it more modern.\n\"Just bringing it up so we can actually make it into a reception area for weddings or functions,\" Willis said.\nRecently, the inn has come under new management. Willis said the inn's owner, David Snyder, has brought in Hambleton House Events and Catering.\n\"So we've come in with a new chef team — not necessarily a new chef — but a chef team and a new management team,\" Willis said.\nWillis said he isn't sure why the change in management was made. Snyder could not be reached for comment.\nDuring an Oxford Planning Commission meeting on Oct. 1, Snyder said the inn has faced economic challenges since he took ownership this past year. He told the Planning Commission that he is losing over $30,000 every month and said the current business is not sustainable.\nSnyder asked the Planning Commission for a text amendment that would allow him to create luxury villas on the property, which he believes will help make the business profitable. Synder said he also believes having villas as an addition to the restaurant and inn rooms will increase the value of the property.\nAt the meeting, Snyder said he knows rumors about him and his plans for his business have been \"swirling,\" but said he is \"here to stay.\"\n\"I'm not giving up on this property,\" he said at the meeting.\nThe Planning Commission voted to have the town attorney draft an ordinance for a text amendment that the Planning Commission can consider at the next meeting. If the Planning Commission approves the text amendment, it will go to the Commissioners of Oxford for consideration. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Water therapy is Chestertown’s healing business\n\n November 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LISA J. GOTTO Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 641\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — There is a relatively new small business in Chestertown that is combining the cutting-edge practice of sensory deprivation with the wonders and healing potential of water.Park Row Floats, located at 312 Park Row, has helped Kent County residents stress less and address certain ailments for more than a year now.\nIf the concept of sensory deprivation sounds harsh and uninviting, Mandi Silcox, the owner of Park Row Floats has dispelled that assumption with every tour she has given of her state-of-the-art facility since it opened in the spring of 2023.\nBefore she was giving these tours, Silcox had spent much of her career in education, teaching middle school in Kent County and then teaching and administrating at a private school in Delaware.\nWhile teaching, Silcox had always contemplated owning a small business—someday, although she was uncertain what type of business it would be. And then, while vacationing a few years ago, she was introduced to a unique concept.\n\"My husband and I were on vacation, and he asked if I wanted to do a float. 'Do you want to do this float spa thing, this sensory deprivation thing? he said.'\"\nSilcox said she tacitly agreed in her effort to be open to new things. The couple did two floats at the same time for 90 minutes and then a 45-minute sauna.\n\"And in the sauna, I turned to my husband and said, 'This is what I want to do. I want to open a float spot. This is amazing.'\"\nGoing from school-to-spa would not happen overnight. Silcox said she knew she needed comprehensive training and set out to do her research. She found an established and successful mentorship-oriented program and hit the ground running.\n\"I took a class on how to do the build out, how to do it safely, how to do it cleanly, how to do it so that the salt, which is super corrosive, doesn't eat apart your building,\" she said. Each float chamber utilizes 1,000 pounds of Epsom salts in its operation.\nHer husband, Jay, a structural engineer, helped conceive the build-out, and Holman Building of Chestertown executed the plans.\nWalking into the totally renovated space, there's a holistic, modern vibe. The facility is spotless, streamlined and light-filled.\nSilcox provides each client with comprehensive, \"pre-float\" instructions and a run-down of cabin particulars to maximize the benefits of the float session, and she is ready to answer any and all questions about what customers might experience during and after the session.\nSilcox has also schooled herself on the burgeoning research that is being conducted on the benefits of all the services she offers and is quick to share that upon request. Another question, she said she is happy to answer for prospective clients is how the facility's filtration systems work.\nThe system, which she said, is \"very robust\" and best-in-class, is designed specifically for float tanks, using a three-cycle filtration process, and an optimal micron filter. The water is then exposed to UV light and goes through an additional process where the water is injected with ozone.\n\"We have all these things combined to make sure that the water is perfect, and then we add an optional process where we add one-third of an ounce of 35% hydrogen peroxide to the water between every single client.\"\nAnd at the end of every session, each client is invited to transition back to the real world by spending time in the facility's refreshing communal space, which Silcox calls the \"plant room.\" This area is infused with natural light and offers a cozy respite with complimentary water and tea, and electrolyte beverages for purchase.\nSilcox is pleased to report that feedback on her business model has so far been very positive, as more and more people are looking for ways to enhance their health and totally unplug from life's daily stressors.\n\"Everyone walks out of here asking, 'When can I do that again?'\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The facility will have a gym, tech lab, game room and classrooms. It will also have a museum and cultural center to honor the area's African American history during and following segregation.\n\"We have a lot of work to do,\" Jeff Breslin, president and CEO of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Metropolitan Baltimore, said during a Dorchester Chamber of Commerce luncheon on Oct. 29. \"We're still fundraising every single day.\"\nWith about $8 million raised so far, Breslin said there is a $4.5 million funding gap. He said they feel confident in getting $3 million of that funding and so they are pushing for the final $1.5 million.\nBreslin said so far, the building — which is the vacant Mace's Lane High School — has had its roof and windows replaced and its facade updated. He said there have been remediation efforts inside, including asbestos removal.\n\"But really, we're just about shovel-ready to get the inside done,\" he said in an interview.\nBreslin said the start of the project's third phase, which they hope to begin in early 2025, is dependent on funding.\nThe Rev. Keith Cornish said raising the remaining funds for the project will ensure \"everyone wins.\"\n\"Every part of our society will be impacted,\" he said about the community center.\nCornish is board president of Mace's Lane Community Center, a nonprofit that was formed by the Good Shepherd Association and the Mace's Lane High School Alumni Association. He compared the Boys and Girls Club at Mace's Lane Community Center to fertilizer for the school system.\n\"When they come alongside and help the school system, everyone benefits,\" he said.\nBreslin said across the country, every dollar invested in the Boys and Girls Clubs returns $10.32 in economic benefits to club members, their families and society. He said in Maryland, every dollar invested in the Boys and Girls Clubs returns $7.64.\nBreslin said that since opening the Boys and Girls Club at Leonards Lane in Cambridge in 2021, there has been a 35% decrease in juvenile crime within 0.3 miles of the club. He said that percentage has been controlled for recent juvenile reform laws.\n\"Ultimately it just means that when kids have somewhere safe and predictable and hopeful to go, we know what it does for the community,\" Breslin said.\nDuring the lunch, Breslin introduced Leonards Lane Club Manager Gabe Butler and the organization's Manager of Community and Youth Support Kentavius Jones.\nButler said when kids come into the club, they are given dinner and time for homework help and tutoring before going through Boys and Girls Club programming. Programs deal with health and wellness, career and workforce readiness, social emotional wellness, and more. After programming, the children are given time to \"just have fun and play,\" Butler said.\nJones talked about the importance of focussing on social emotional learning. He said COVID-19 had a negative impact on the social emotional wellness of this generation of kids.\n\"So learning healthy connections, how to relate to people, how to express what you're thinking, what's going on — our kids are struggling with that,\" he said.\nThose who are interested in donating to the Mace's Lane Community Center project can donate at bgcmetrobaltimore.org/donate or maceslanecc.org/. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Chesapeake Bay and Choptank River are the waterways that initially attracted settlers to the region seeking to establish themselves on the waterfront, participate in a marine trade and raise a familyTilghman Island Day is a unique maritime festival sponsored annually by the Tilghman Island Volunteer Fire Company. Tourists enjoyed a unique opportunity to experience the ambiance of maritime Maryland when skipjacks ruled the Chesapeake Bay. Small businesses, historic residences, a maritime museum, an elementary school, a post office and Dogwood Harbor coalesce to validate the hometown charm of Tilghman Island.\nSaturday, Oct. 19, highlighted perfect sailing weather under sunny skies for visitors to walkabout the Tilghman Island neighborhood.\nTilghman Island Day celebrates Maryland's Eastern Shore watermen and their livelihood. Tilghman Island embodies the ongoing traditions of a nautical industry that thrives on Maryland's Eastern Shore.\nMarried couples, young families, groups of friends and single parties turned out in numbers to spend their afternoon enjoying all that Tilghman Island Day has to offer. The Tilghman Country Store provided a special menu in addition to real Maryland crabs. Besides seafood, there was a barbecue pit available in the rear of the park and a fresh squeezed lemonade stand.\nTourism, marinas, agriculture, crabbing and oyster harvesting exemplify the broader activities of Maryland's watermen community. Seafood dining and hospitality are major attractions. Tilghman Island is the picture-perfect weekend getaway destination. No hustle, no bustle, just appreciate the easy-going atmosphere of the close nit village. A splendid time was guaranteed for all.\nSeth Foster was granted the island in 1659. Tilghman Island was recognized by Talbot County as Great Choptank Island in 1707. Other names included Foster's Island and Ward's Island before Matthew Tilghman obtained the island in 1741. Early industry on Tilghman Island showcased steamboat service and seafood harvesting employing watermen and establishing a vibrant maritime community.\nThe Chesapeake Bay was a hotbed of activity during the War of 1812. The British fleet was busy raiding and occupying colonial communities along the shorelines of the Eastern Shore. Tilghman Island itself was subjected to British military interference during 1813 and 1814. The Red Coats had erected a barracks on the island that was later abandoned. Bennett's Point 1813, Caulk's Field 1814 and James Island 1815 each experienced hotspots of engagement.\nLater in the 1800s, Gen. Tench Tilghman purchased lands beyond the busy drawbridge that constitutes the locality representing the businesses and residences that signify Tilghman, Maryland. A distinguishing house construction known as the \"W\" is now a scarce structure on the island. Employment opportunities welcomed relocation to Tilghman Island following the Civil War.\nMy father drove me and my sister to attend the 1988 Tilghman Island Day celebration. I have returned to sightsee at Tilghman Island, St. Michaels and Oxford infrequently over the years. Specifically, I collect round iron postal cancellations from these post offices occasionally. I bought a couple of Tilghman Island postcards that now promote the date of 1752.\nPresident Ronald Wilson Reagan visited the Tilghman Island Volunteer Fire House during a tour of Maryland's Eastern Shore on July 10, 1984. Residents speak fondly of the presidential visit and are happy to share their personal memories four decades later. Capt. Wade Murphy recalls three helicopters flew onto the island to obfuscate his arrival. Fifty local watermen attended the luncheon.\nConsider visiting the village in August as bountiful monarch butterflies descend upon the island before migrating to Mexico. Several restaurants offer top-quality seafood and there are numerous choices to reserve a good night's rest. Tilghman Island scenery offers visiting guests an idyllic vacation. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Local brewer collaborates with brewery to unveil beer for Waterfowl\n\n November 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 599\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Some people keep lists of potential baby names. Doug Greene keeps lists of potential beer names.\"I have a whole list on my phone of beer names,\" he said.\nThe Bird Nickel Brewing Company owner's passion for making beer started with a home brewing kit in 2009. Eight years later, Greene took a beer business course, and 10 years later, he incorporated Bird Nickel Brewing. In 2021, he graduated from American Brewers Guild, a brewing school in Vermont.\nAlthough he's still looking for a brick-and-mortar brewery, Greene has done contract brewing, where he employs another brewery to brew beer for him. Through contract brewing, he has created brews with names like \"Slick Calm Chesapeake Ale\" and \"Quite the Mixture.\"\nGreene said the beer names often come from observation or overheard phrases. Slick calm, he said, is a term for when water is \"smooth like glass.\"\nBird Nickel Brewing's latest creation — a limited edition collaboration with Salisbury-based Burnish Brewing Company and Waterfowl Festival Inc. — is \"In Flight,\" a winter lager.\nThe beer will be released for the Waterfowl Festival so that attendees can sip on the limited edition brew while they throw back oysters and chow down on other Eastern Shore fare.\nThe lager has subtle notes of cinnamon, nutmeg and pear. Greene said different people might pick up on different notes.\n\"What we didn't want to do is overwhelm people with cinnamon,\" he said. \"We want to make it enjoyable for everyone.\"\nWaterfowl Festival Executive Director Deena Kilmon said the beer goes perfectly with hors d'oeuvres like oysters.\n\"Like when you're getting ready to eat dinner and you just really have something special to start,\" she said.\nGreene, an Easton native, has \"always wanted to do a beer for the Waterfowl Festival.\" The festival has been a part of his life for years, whether volunteering as a \"duck sitter\" in high school or walking the festival on the hunt for food trucks as an adult.\nGreene's favorite memories of the event are walking down Harrison Street and seeing all the different vendors.\nIn the summer, Kilmon reached out to Greene about making a beer for the festival. This is the first year the festival is collaborating with brewers to make a special beer. The idea was one Greene had brought up to Kilmon years ago.\n\"When I became executive director in March, it was one of our first conversations about how we finally felt like it was the right year to launch it,\" Kilmon said.\nOnce Greene got Burnish Brewing on board, it was all systems go.\nThe label wrapped around the can is also a local effort. Maggii Sarfaty, an Easton artist, designed the label. On it, the festival's mission of conservation, education and research to protect local wildlife and habitats is written.\nA portion of the proceeds from beer sales will go toward the Waterfowl Festival to fund education and conservation, Kilmon said.\nGreene said having his beer at the festival is an important milestone.\n\"Especially for my business,\" he said. \"And being able to create something for the festival instead of just being a resident or a ticket holder. I'm actually a part of it.\"\nIn Flight will be available at the festival's Premier Night on Nov. 7 in all the art pavilions. It will be free to VIP ticket holders while supplies last. Throughout the weekend, VIP ticket holders can request In Flight in the VIP hospitality suite. In Flight can be purchased at the new Duck Blind Bar located within the Avalon Theatre. Festival participants will also be able to sample the beer in the tasting pavilion located on Dover Street with the purchase of a tasting pavilion ticket. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Community members ambled the PNC Pavilion on Harrison Street, mingling with each other and gazing at art.\nWaterfowl Festival Executive Director Deena Kilmon said the breakfast, hosted by The Arc Central Chesapeake Region and Talbot County Economic Development and Tourism, is a venue for the community and business leaders to meet and talk about the festival as well as what's going on in town.\n\"What economic development things are happening in the community, what's going to impact us coming up in the next few months,\" Kilmon said.\nKilmon called the relationship between the festival and local businesses \"incredibly important.\"\n\"We're symbiotic,\" she said. \"So if they succeed, we succeed and vice versa.\"\nThe three-day festival has an economic impact of more than $3 million each year, Kilmon said. It benefits hotels, restaurants, retailers and even local nonprofits.\n\"It's typically one of the biggest fundraising events of the year because a lot of the food vendors and people involved in the festival, they are nonprofits,\" Kilmon said. \"And they're allowed to keep their proceeds, so it's extremely important to a lot of people.\"\nJonathon Rondeau, president and CEO of The Arc Central Chesapeake Region, said this is The Arc's fourth year sponsoring the breakfast event.\n\"As a provider that's focused on housing and services, we believe strongly in investing in the communities where we serve,\" he said. \"And the Waterfowl being a signature event for the town that connects conservation and art and economic development, (it) aligns to the work that we do.\"\nAddressing attendees of the breakfast Friday morning, Rondeau talked about the importance of that involvement in communities.\n\"And so we're incredibly proud to partner The Arc around this and to align the connection of art, conservation, economic development and, most importantly, community,\" he said. \"In this day and age, that's what each of us are looking for.\"\nThe breakfast's keynote speaker, Carl Anderton, who is currently serving as the director of rural economic strategy in the Maryland Department of Commerce, talked about the importance of the business community. He called the opportunity to provide jobs a \"generational blessing.\"\n\"When you employ someone, you're giving them an income, yes, but you're also letting that trickle down to the generations behind them,\" he said, \"and it's just truly amazing.\"\nVanhooser thanked attendees for doing business in the county. She said it's the business community that makes the \"wonderful things\" that happen in the county possible.\n\"It's that private investment along with the public investment that builds the community,\" she said. \"And it's the festivals like the Waterfowl Festival — the granddaddy of them all — that weaves that fabric of the quality of life that we all love so much.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Infrastructure spending needs to use common sense\n\n November 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 730\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In late October, President Biden visited Baltimore to announce that the Maryland Port Administration will receive $147 million in federal funds for infrastructure improvements.During his visit, Biden did not acknowledge or address serious issues with another much larger federally funded infrastructure project in Baltimore.\nThat project is construction of a new $6 billion Frederick Douglass Tunnel in Baltimore for Amtrak, America's quasi-public rail passenger company.\nThe current tunnel is over 150 years old and is a major bottleneck on Amtrak's high-speed northeast corridor passenger rail service between Boston and Washington, D.C.\nAs a long-time, staunch supporter of Amtrak, I understand the need for this long overdue tunnel replacement project.\nThat said, I am stunned and disheartened by how much this project has been mismanaged.\nIn early October, Amtrak's Office of Inspector General released a scathing report on this project.\nThe mission of Amtrak's inspector general is simple and straightforward.\nConduct and supervise independent and objective audits, inspections, evaluations and investigations relating to agency programs and operations; promote economy, effectiveness and efficiency within the agency; prevent and detect fraud, waste and abuse in agency programs and operations.\nConsistent with their mission, in the inspector general's report on the Baltimore tunnel project, they noted that Amtrak did not establish a program management structure early enough. As a result, they struggled to complete the necessary planning in scheduling, communications, document management and risk management for this project on a timely basis.\nThe inspector general criticized Amtrak's initial assignment for project management responsibility of a $6 billion dollar project to a single individual.\nEventually, the program team was expanded to seven members, but five told Office of Inspector General auditors that they were still overwhelmed by their workload.\nAmtrak officials have since acknowledged staffing was insufficient and said the Capital Delivery team should have been staffed before it received responsibility for the program.\nAmtrak later decided to hire a \"delivery partner\" to provide management and oversight, but that contractor wasn't engaged until the spring of this year. Amtrak officials agreed that the decision \"should have been made earlier\" to \"maximize the benefits the delivery partner was intended to provide.\" As a result, the new contractor has to plan a management structure as it also prepares for construction.\nThe Office of Inspector General report made three recommendations:\nComplete program management planning for the tunnel project.Establish processes to ensure the a project's management structure is established early enough to produce strong oversight for the life of the project.Establish processes to ensure program teams have sufficient staff before projects are assigned to the Capital Delivery department.\nAmtrak management, in their response to the report, agreed with the recommendations and outlined how it is acting to meet those goals.\nThe inspector general's report concludes the project now \"faces a significantly increased risk of cost overruns and additional delays as it proceeds into major construction.\" The report does not include projections for future cost overruns and additional delays.\nOn a $6 billion construction project, one thing is almost certain. Cost overruns and completion delays will likely be substantial. As a result, funds needed for other Amtrak service improvements to increase ridership and reduce their government subsidies will not be available.\nI am sure this colossal mismanagement of federal funding by Amtrak is not unique.\nUnfortunately, conventional thinking is public infrastructure projects completion delays and cost overruns are standard operating procedure. In other words, this is the way it has always been and the way it will always be.\nThat thinking needs to change especially when the federal budget deficit is at record levels, currently at $1.83 trillion and growing.\nFormer U.S. Sen. Everett Dirksen once observed, \"A billion dollars here and a billion dollars there and pretty soon you are talking real money.\"\nMany Americans are carefully monitoring their budgets and adjusting their spending habits on a regular, even daily, basis in order to pay their bills for basic living expenses.\nGoing forward, we need and deserve elected and appointed officials at every level of government to take appropriate steps to ensure funding for all government funded infrastructure improvement projects is spent efficiently and effectively.\nThey need to address the fact the current audit process is largely reactive, not proactive.\nConcurrently, government project managers must be fully aware of and committed to best practice project management policies and procedures prior to and during large scale and complex infrastructure improvement projects.\nIt is common sense to help ensure things go right in the first place as opposed to learning what went wrong after the fact. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The new store opened on Ocean Gateway near the U-Haul Moving & Storage earlier this month.The Dollar General is ready to serve new and established residents in Trappe who previously had to drive to Cambridge or Easton to secure groceries and other household goods.\nThe Dollar General's Public Relations team said the store believes in providing positive economic benefits including additional access to affordable products for customers; new job opportunities for local residents; generation of additional tax revenue for the town; and the ability to support local nonprofits, schools and libraries through the Dollar General Literacy Foundation.\n\"Dollar General is deeply involved in the communities it serves and is an ardent supporter of literacy and education through the Dollar General Literacy Foundation, which awards grants each year to nonprofit organizations, schools and libraries within a 15-mile radius of a Dollar General store or distribution center to support adult, family, summer and youth literacy programs,\" said an email from the Dollar General.\nThough the Dollar General's Public Relations team stated that the store chain is not a grocer, there is a public investment in the health of \"our hometown communities.\" Emphasizing the fresh produce stocked in more than 5,400 Dollar General stores.\nThe Dollar General was constructed by local entrepreneur Tom Mitchell, president of Delmarva Management Group and a Trappe business owner. Mitchell's previous business ventures include the Coffee Trappe, Cork & Bottle Trappe Liquor Store and Momma Maria's Mediterranean Bistro.\nMitchell said in a previous interview that he seeks to invest and add new businesses to the town in the upcoming years. Additionally, Mitchell said that the two lots next to the Dollar General are in discussion of new development, including a potential quick-service restaurant franchise.\nThe public relations team for the Dollar General said they are excited to invest in towns like Trappe and plan to employ approximately 10 to 15 employees in the upcoming months.\n\"As part of our mission of 'Serving Others,' we look forward to serving the Trappe community as a positive business partner and good community neighbor,\" the email from Dollar General said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This was the site of lunch and learn for the Caroline County Women in Business.\nIt was a fun moment of delight to see and touch these creatures from the Andes.\n\"Look at them following her. This is hilarious,\" Tracey Snyder, director of the Caroline County Chamber of Commerce, said.\n\"We love the alpaca farm. This is the second time the chamber has been here. Women in Business meets quarterly. We're going to eat a sack lunch from the Culinary Center. We are going to do a little sip and shop and we have Michelle Hammond as our guest speaker. She is going to show us how to be a little more zen in our hectic lives,\" Snyder said.\nOwner of Outstanding Dreams Alpaca Farm Phil Liske gave a talk on the animal's behavior.\nAfter the animal interaction, it was time to listen to the keynote speaker, healer Michelle Boulden Hammond.\n\"We are talking about mindfulness today. It is a peaceful forum and how to handle stress today. Some spiritual message like how to learn about frequencies. Learn about how to get yourself grounded. We will learn stress management techniques,\" Hammond said.\nShe said it is even beneficial for the animals and their frequencies. She specializes in sound healing.\n\"We are going to do a little breath work. I have got my sound bowls. I got my tuning forks and I have my ocean drum. So I will give a little demonstration. I have a brass and I have a crystal bowl,\" Hammond said.\nShe also had a comment on the current moment.\n\"In these times of high stress, there is a lot of hostility. You have got to learn to get grounded and centered. Always reflect the negativity with the goodness,\" Hammond said.\nOne participant was Nikendra Bordley, who runs the hair salon Scalp Reveals in Federalsburg. She specializes in dreadlocks.\n\"I love it. It is a new experience,\" she said about the event Tuesday. \"I have never seen alpacas. I have only known of llamas. I like seeing everybody getting together and the other Chamber members.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Following eight weeks of meetings and assistance, those businesses completed the academy.\nTwo business leaders spoke Tuesday at Talbot County Council, reflecting on how the academy helped them expand their ventures. Stefanie DiFiglia, founder of Two Tree Integrative Health, said \"the program couldn't have come at a better time.\"\n\"I had grown pretty slowly, organically through word of mouth, and that only works until it doesn't,\" DiFiglia said. \"I found myself in a situation where I had hired new staff and was really trying to figure out how to use them in the best way possible.\"\nShe said she feels she's in a \"much better position now\" than where she was before entering the program.\nAnijah Wilson, owner of home health care service Libby's Loving Hands, also spoke to the council.\n\"We have had great benefit from this program,\" Wilson said. \"I've learned a lot about numbers, marketing, laws, HR. And I'm so excited to see what comes from this, and grow my business and community.\"\nThe training program was created by Will Holmes Consulting, a Baltimore-based business management firm. Founder Will Holmes shared details of the program with the County Council.\n\"We focus heavily on cash flow projections as a foundation of the program to make sure that people understand their numbers so they can plan ahead when to hire people, when to expand and how much it will cost,\" Holmes said. \"It helps them with their pricing. It helps them with understanding how to access capital.\"\nCassandra Vanhooser, Talbot County's director of economic development and tourism, said funding from the Maryland Rural Economic Development Fund helped launch the program, which graduated its first cohort of 15 businesses earlier in the year.\nVanhooser added that the Mid-Shore Regional Council is funding a third cohort this winter. She said the county contributed American Rescue Plan Act funds for cohorts in the future.\n\"I just want to say thank you again to the County Council, to all of you for your support,\" Vanhooser said. \"(Council Member Keasha Haythe) especially, for your idea of bringing this to me.

However, her mother commented she should own a coffee shop and then she noticed Little Lamb was closing.\n\"It was a full circle moment and now here I am,\" Upp said. \"It was just one of those things that kind of happened.\"\nUpp had help from family and friends to give the shop a new coat of paint and new decor including pictures of her as she grew up, and furniture from the family home.\n\"I wanted people to get a grasp of who I am,\" she said, adding, \"I wanted to communicate that you can come here and everyone can feel like family.\"\nThat family feel includes using products from nearby businesses and giving shelf space to local entrepreneurs.\n\"I use regional bakeries in Middletown, Delaware and the breakfast sandwiches made fresh come from 410-Seafood,\" Upp said, referring to the eatery a few doors down. Lockbriar in Chestertown is where she gets honey and ice cream for the menu, but also has their pasta sauce for sale on the shelf.\nIn the short time she's been open Upp said it's been fun to share her coffee knowledge with her customers. She offers hot and iced coffee, with or without espresso and already has customers returning to order a specific flavor called The Cortado.\n\"It's an espresso shot and steamed milk,\" she said, explaining the unique flavor blend. \"Our coffee is traditional and authentic.\"\nIzzy's Coffee House is open 6 a.m. until 2 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 7 a.m. until 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Use the Clover app to order in advance.\nFind the menu online at: https://www.izzyscoffeehouseccity.com\nCall 410-885-7012 for more information.\nSpeaking of menu, feel free to bring your canine companion because there's a Pup Cup on the independent local coffee shop's menu too. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hundreds of laid-off miners mull their futures as winter begins\n\n November 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JACI WEBB Outlook Editor | Section: News \n \n 1206\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Eric Giesick thought he hit the jackpot when he landed a job at Sibanye-Stillwater mine in 2011. Growing up in Billings, he and his family often camped at Woodbine Campground near Nye, and Giesick would watch the big trucks go rumbling down the mountain loaded with ore from the mine. He told his folks he planned to work there one day.The last 13 years at the mine have had a permanent impact on Giesick, now 49 and living in Columbus. There were good times, challenges with historic flooding in 2022, new mine owners to adjust to, and now this — the layoff of as many as 700 miners, including Giesick. Giesick's last day at Sibanye-Stillwater was Nov. 8. He picked up his gear and walked away just after sunrise that morning.\nIt came as somewhat of a relief. The months of uncertainty were over.\n\"I'm kind of sad. I'm going to going to miss being underground. Mining gets in your blood.\"\n'Looking for people to blame'\nGiesick joins hundreds of others who worked at the mine, all trying to figure out what the next step is. The Montana Department of Labor & Industry organized a rapid response information event the week of Nov. 12, which was when the layoffs were finalized, and experts in employment, education, training and insurance helped miners consider their next move. Sibanye-Stillwater mine announced in September that it was laying off up to 700 miners from its workforce of 1,900 miners.\nElizabeth and Mitchell Ramba, of Red Lodge, started their career with Sibanye-Stillwater right out of college. The married couple graduated from the University of Colorado in Boulder with geology degrees, and were excited to begin their careers in hard-rock mining in 2020. Their first day on the job was Nov. 2, 2020, and on Sept. 12, they were notified that their jobs were being eliminated.\n\"There has been a lot of mistrust and hate. You want to look for people to blame, but it's the market shifts and other factors. I don't think it was any individual's fault,\" Elizabeth said.\nThey built a life in the mountain town of Red Lodge, fell in love with Montana, and got hooked on mining. They each worked with a team of miners and went in to inspect the operation between the drilling and the blasting.\nAfter taking a break to go back home to Ohio and visit their families, the couple will begin the process of looking for work, most likely in the mining industry. But there is one thing that holds them back.\n\"A lot of places that have mines aren't as pretty as Montana,\" Mitchell said.\nNew job, new mine\nGiesick starts his new job Dec. 12 at the Montana Resources open pit copper mine in Butte, but that's 185 miles away from his family back home in Columbus. He'll cross the Continental Divide on his commute to work, and start a new chapter in open pit mining.\nThere were many good years working at Sibanye-Stillwater mine. Giesick enjoyed the work and forged friendships with miners from all over the world. Miners are a tight brotherhood and sisterhood, connected now mostly through social media.\nGiesick and some of his carpool buddies gathered for one last Taco Tuesday at the 5 Spot bar in Absarokee on Nov. 12. Like other businesses in the area, the 5 Spot will suffer with the loss of hundreds miners and their families.\nGiesick counted all the ways he felt the company mismanaged funds, including buying equipment that wouldn't fit the tracks, and his favorite: putting in heated sidewalks at the mine.\nAngry miners have been spray painting derogatory messages toward some of the management on the walls of the mine. Giesick said that is why some miners were invited to leave early. He heard about the offer, and asked if he could leave a few days early as well. His last day was originally scheduled for Nov. 12.\nAnother job, another layoff\nDustin Stanfield started his job with Sibanye-Stillwater in July, after a contractor he worked for, Moran Mining and Tunneling lost their contract with the mine. He feels like he was hired to be laid off to protect another miner's position.\n\"There were several of us hired on so the miners with seniority could stay. It's just part of it,\" Stanfield said.\nStanfield knows about layoffs. Originally from Oklahoma where he started working in the oil fields in Texas and Oklahoma, he was transferred to Douglas, Wyo., where he worked in the oil fields for 11 years before he got laid off. At Sibanye, he drove the muck truck. He missed his work with Moran on the raise crew where he helped with blasting for a little over a year, but he did like driving the truck through the slippery tunnels.\nNow Stanfield is stuck. he doesn't have the 3-5 years of mining experience to transfer to another mine, and he doesn't want to battle the elements again in the oil fields of Wyoming. He hopes to get some training for a new career path.\n'I needed two more years'\nAnnette McFarland, of Columbus, was the chief mining engineer until the November layoffs. She has spent 32 years working in mining, the last five at Sibanye-Stillwater. She was near the end of her career.\n\"I needed two more years,\" McFarland said.\nMonths before she was informed in September that her job was gone, McFarland got nervous.\n\"In April, I put my property on the market and sold it in May.\"\nShe bought property in Byron, Wyo., and is building a house there as she continues to look for work. McFarland worries about agism as she navigates the application process searching for another job in mining.\n\"There is a camaraderie, a fellowship in mining. People who mine are the hardest working, most dedicated people I know. It's a high-risk job, and you're doing everything you can to make sure everybody goes home safe,\" McFarland said.\n'It's just sad'\nBetty Kilburn, of Livingston, worked as an underground operator at the Sibanye-Stillwater East Boulder Mine for 22 years. She took a voluntary layoff to save someone else's job.\n\"It was so fast. You had a job one day, you didn't know if you had one the next,\" Kilburn said.\nShe talked the options over with her husband, Paul Rugh, who is a salaried supervisor at the mine. Rugh kept his job.\n\"It breaks my heart, it really does,\" Kilburn said. \"There are a lot of people living paycheck to paycheck. My husband said, 'Babe, we're not hurting as much as other people are. If you take this layoff, you can give somebody else a job that probably really needs it.\"\nSo that's what she did.\n\"Everybody is sad,\" Kilburn said. \"Everybody is just going to be uprooted. Now you're splitting up families. The husband is on the road, and the wife is home raising the kids.\"\nDan Beluscak, president of the United Steelworkers Local 11-0001, said there are many fathers and sons, and husbands and wives, who work at the mine. It's a proud legacy that miners passed on to the next generation.\n\"We were promised that our kids' kids could work at the mine,\" Beluscak said. \"What happens when half of us have to leave? It's the schools and the businesses that are going to hurt the most. We built up these towns of Absarokee, Nye and Fishtail. We've raised our kids here.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Maryland chocolatier takes part in NYC. competition\n\n November 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Reid mreid@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 618\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n She may not have emerged as the overall winner of the recent Grow-NY Food and Ag Summit held recently in New York City, but Bon AppéSweet owner Thereasa Black is killing it on seemingly every other front from her Leonardtown chocolate shop.Bon AppéSweet uses simple, ethically sourced ingredients free of added sugar and artificial sweeteners to make date-sweetened chocolate products such as chocolate bars, trail mix, chocolate-covered almonds, raisins and espresso beans. The products are all organic, vegan and non-GMO.\nThe winner of the 10-week Grow-NY business development program and live pitch at the Grow-NY Summit, which was held in early November and offered a $1 million first prize, went to New York City's Unibaio, which offers naturally derived particles that trap the active ingredients of pesticides, fertilizers and phytosanitary, enabling them to penetrate plants more efficiently.\n\"Grow-NY finalists and symposium speakers brought their fresh ideas about strengthening our food system and building our regional economy to life at the summit,\" Grow-NY Program Director Jenn Smith said in a news release. \"Anyone who wants to see solutions in the food and ag landscape can be a force for change.\"\nLeonardtown-based Bon AppéSweet was one of 20 start-ups — among 312 applicants — in the competition, which awarded $3 million in total prize money to \"advance innovation in food, agriculture, and sustainable technologies,\" according to a news release.\nBlack said the application process was \"long and intensive\" and added the two required trips to New York were \"hectic.\"\nBut while there, the 44-year-old Leonardtown resident met with industry representatives to find a dairy manufacturer to partner with to start putting her chocolate syrup into milk.\n\"This is a whole new opportunity I can take advantage of,\" Black said.\nBon AppéSweet has a brick-and-mortar location in Leonardtown. Part of the business is Better Black Coffee, which is owned by Black and partner Justin Carter, while the other half is comprised of Black's Bon AppéSweet chocolate shop.\nThe idea for Bon AppéSweet came about when Black was looking for less sugary treats for her daughter, Isabella.\nAt the time, Black was making date-sweetened gelato and limiting the amount of sweets she gave her daughter. But, while on deployment — Black spent 14 years in the U.S. Navy and had five deployments and is currently in the Reserves — Isabella stayed with a relative and was fed sweets.\n\"Once they've had it, it's difficult to take [sweets] away from them, so I made a compromise and made the desserts that she loved with the ingredients that I love,\" Black said. \"Because my ice cream needed chocolate, I needed to figure out a chocolate to put in it that didn't have sugar.\"\nShe said high-fiber dates with vitamins and minerals and natural sweetness were the food to use instead.\nEverything changed during the pandemic when shipping companies could not guarantee next-day delivery, critical in the case of shipping ice cream.\nWhen she won a competition with a local grocer and her chocolate products — which she learned to make through YouTube — began outselling better brands, she made a business decision.\n\"I pivoted to the chocolate because it was much easier to ship,\" she said, \"and the rest is history.\"\nAn added benefit was that her daughter is allergic to soy, and regular chocolate has soy lecithin, so she wasn't even supposed to be eating it.\n\"When I made my chocolate, I used her as my taster because if she didn't like it,\" Black said, \"obviously no one else was going to.\"\nBon AppéSweet products are now in more than 500 stores, including Walmart and Whole Foods.\n\"When people come up to you and say, 'Hey, Thereasa, I saw your chocolate in the store,'\" said Black, who thanked her neighbors for their support. \"It makes you understand what you're doing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It has grown to serve over 1,000 people in need.\nScott Eglseder, president of Eglseder Wealth Management Group, said this event is dear to him because of the connection he developed with Scotty after his little brother Kurt Wilson Eglseder died in 2016.\n\"About two weeks after Kurt died, I was walking past his shop, and Scotty just looked at me with a kindness and sincerity that touches me all these years later, and he just says, I'm sorry about your brother, Kurt. And that just obviously stuck with me,\" Eglseder said.\nScotty died in 2020. Operation Christmas Spirit was revived by the Rotary Club of Easton in 2021, but due to lacking funds, it was expected to only provide for half of the people the program had in the past.\nElgseder said when he heard of the problems with funds he decided help. On behalf of his financial planning company, he pledged to the Rotary Club to post a dollar-for-dollar matching contribution in order to raise enough funds to serve the 1,000 people in need.\nOn top of the dollar-for-dollar matching contribution, Elgseder's organization has organized 15 events, including the Fresh Pit Beef/Turkey fundraiser. Since 2022, Elgseder has raised over $37,000 for Operation Christmas Spirit.\nDuring the barbecue fundraiser, Elgseder's and his company presented a check for $6,200 the Easton Rotary Club for Operation Christmas Spirit.\n\"Doing this frequently, it doesn't solve the problem of why we have 1,000 people showing up, but it's a reminder to those of us that have that there are plenty of people who don't,\" Eglseder said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Moore faces budget dilemma in upcoming session\n\n November 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 896\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Almost immediately after Gov. Wes Moore was elected in 2022, political pundits in Maryland and beyond proclaimed Moore is destined to be a president of the United States.Moore, in turn, is doing what one would expect from a potential future presidential candidate.\nHe supported President Joe Biden for re-election until Biden pulled out of the race. He then threw his support to Vice President Harris. He traveled regularly to speak on her behalf. He gave a prime-time speech at the Democratic National Convention. He helped Democratic Sen.-elect Angela Alsobrooks defeat Larry Hogan in a race previously deemed critical to Democratic Party efforts to retain control of the U.S. Senate.\nAll these efforts may be overcome by events in Annapolis next year when the General Assembly is back in session.\nPrior to adjourning they must approve a state budget and send it to Gov. Moore. Before that happens, the General Assembly will again engage in dialogue, deliberations, and decisions on unfinished business from the last session on state spending and tax increases.\nLast session, a compromise was eventually reached on select tax increases, select fee increases, spending cuts, more state borrowing and drawdowns from the state's \"rainy day\" fund.\nThis compromise was approved over strong objections of progressive legislators who viewed this outcome as a temporary deal and a short-term delay on future decisions to reject spending cuts and approve tax increases.\nProgressives maintain tax increases are essential for full funding of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future (the Kirwan Plan) and for a mass transit system extension in Baltimore.\nAs often happens in the General Assembly when state spending and tax increases are debated, those debates are overcome by events.\nNext year this will be especially true given a recent bleak report from the General Assembly's independent Department of Legislative Services.\nThat report projects that Maryland is heading into a severe fiscal crisis that could be the worst in 20 years. The report projects a gap between state tax revenues and state spending that is more significant than the outlook the state faced during the Great Recession in 2008-2009.\nBudget analysts suggest full funding for the Kirwan Plan is by far the biggest driver of the state's long-term budget problems. They note that starting in the 2028 fiscal year, about $2 billion for Kirwan needs are unfunded, a figure that grows to $3.2 billion in the 2030 fiscal year.\nComplicating matters further is uncertainty about how much and when Maryland will get federal funds to replace the former Key Bridge in Baltimore.\nWhatever the General Assembly does on the spending budget and taxes, Gov. Moore will have a major and highly visible role starting with submitting a proposed state budget in January. Following General Assembly approval of a budget bill, Moore can agree to it, make line-item vetoes or veto the entire bill. The General Assembly can in turn override those vetoes.\nI predict another contentious General Assembly session as there are still deep divides on budget priorities and tax increases between Gov. Moore and the Democratic legislative leaders and progressive Democratic legislators who want tax increases now and who are increasingly unwilling to take no for answer.\nResolving these differences will be even more challenging with a president and Congress planning on significant cuts in federal spending and federal jobs. Both plans will reduce historical levels of federal money coming into Maryland.\nLast week, a Baltimore media outlet published a response from the governor's office on two questions — Should Marylanders anticipate any tax or fee increases in the coming years? Does Gov. Moore plan to make any major spending cuts, and, if so, where they might be?\nHis office responded with this written statement: The budgetary challenges that Maryland faces are as tough as they've ever been, and while the challenges have been years in the making, Governor Moore is committed to continuing to work in collaboration with the dedicated leaders of the state legislature, including Senate President Ferguson and Speaker Jones to fix them. The Moore-Miller Administration has a high bar for increasing the tax burden on Maryland families, and the governor knows the next leg of the mission to address our fiscal challenges will be harder than the last. We will continue the work of prioritizing our expenses and reviewing our revenue model to determine how it aligns with our objectives. Marylanders have come to expect fiscal responsibility from the Moore-Miller Administration and the governor will continue to move forward into the next session with that at the top of his mind.\nThese are his words now.\nThe question is, what will his actions be next year and beyond?\nI suggest voters should be ever mindful of an answer by Richard Nixon's presidential campaign manager after Nixon's election in 1972. When asked what to expect from the Nixon administration he replied, \"Watch what we do, not what we say.\"\nIf voters do so that could be problematic for Gov. Moore in pursuit of a presidential bid.\nDemocratic primary voters may not embrace a Democratic candidate they see with a record of blocking or limiting progressive policy initiatives and higher taxes to pay for them. At the same time, general election voters may not embrace a Democratic candidate they see with a record of supporting progressive policy initiatives and higher taxes to pay for them.\nIn either case, voters may make voting decisions after deciding if what Gov. Moore said on his intended actions on government spending and tax increases matches what he actually did. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So it's really important to remember that our farmers and ranchers, like our consumers, are also dealing with inflation, so the cost of supplies to grow food has gone up, while USDA predicts that net farm income is going to be down nearly 25 percent compared to just two years ago,\" said Bernt Nelson, a Farm Bureau economist. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Denton food pantry provides food for more than 1,000 families\n\n November 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 354\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Aaron's Place, a food pantry and soup kitchen just northeast of downtown Denton, provided crucial meals, food and drinks to more than 1,000 families last week.On Thursday, volunteers stacked open trunks full of fresh fruit, vegetables, perishables, canned sodas, Thanksgiving desserts and, of course, turkeys. They began distributing the groceries just after 11 a.m., though cars were lined up hours in advance.\nAaron's Place Executive Director Cheryl Beulah said volunteers handed out food until around 7 p.m. Around 1,115 families were served, according to Beulah.\nFrom seeing residents come into the food pantry every week, Beulah says \"food insecurity is real.\" Mary Lou Russ, an administrative assistant at the food pantry, said the amount of need is \"overwhelming.\"\nDuring the pandemic, Beulah says they served around 2,500 people for the Thanksgiving giveaway, an all-time high. The work done by Aaron's Place, which is partnered with the statewide nonprofit Maryland Food Bank, hasn't slowed down at all since 2020.\nAccording to Maryland Hunger Solutions, more than 6,000 Caroline County residents participated in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in fiscal year 2022. 2020 census data shows 13.2% of Caroline County residents were below the poverty line, above the then-state average of 9%.\nAnd according to a new survey of holiday meal costs by the American Farm Bureau Federation, the price of a Thanksgiving dinner has risen 29% from 2020. Beulah sees those rising food prices, and says it's a \"challenging\" time.\nShe said many of the residents in need, particularly during Thanksgiving and the holidays, are families and people from Caroline County. She also sees growing concern with hunger for the senior community.\nBeulah said while discussions pertaining to food insecurity are important, action matters. In part, that's what drives her to lead the Denton food pantry and soup kitchen.\n\"That conversation's not putting food on that person's table,\" Beulah said. \" … Your neighbors could be starving.\"\nAaron's Place's food pantry is open Tuesdays from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., Wednesdays from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., and the third Thursday at 11 a.m. in January, March, May, July, September and November. The soup kitchen opens on Tuesdays at Noon. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Heartfelt hospitality is 'baked in'\n\n November 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LISA J. GOTTO Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Business \n \n 1071\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Fall brings about the busiest time of year for Alicia Boyd, proprietor and head chef of Humble Hearts Catering & Events based in Queen Anne's County.With six years of experience as a small business owner, Boyd relishes this busiest of seasons catering weddings, baby showers and various autumnal celebrations.\nBoyd is one of those people who goes about her business day with a genuine smile on her face and a sense of joy in her heart that resonates. She believes she's one of the lucky ones who gets to do what she loves for a living and happily shares that passion with others by sharing what she knows and continues to learn about food.\nAs she was preparing lunch in Queen Anne's at the Ruthsburg Community Hall — a chicken focaccia with her locally famous chimichurri sauce — she said the facility has been a godsend to her. It offers the key ingredient to the larger recipe for her small business, a licensed commercial kitchen, which she rents.\nBoyd, 39, a wife and mother of two, has a culinary degree from Baltimore International College and some rich, Maryland-flavored roots.\n\"The reason why I'm here, the reason why Humble Hearts is a thing, is because our family grew up here. My family's originally from Virginia, and my grandmother moved down here with her children and she worked on the water,\" said Boyd. \"My whole family worked in oyster houses and shucked clams … my grandmother, my aunt … they worked with the local watermen, and they would make the crab cakes and the oyster fritters and all those different things.\"\nHospitality, she said, was a way of life in her family, where everyone was welcome at her grandmother's table.\n\"Food has been my whole life being able to welcome people in, being able to connect with the community. That really has been my whole life,\" she said.\nThis extension of her formative years would eventually bring her to Chestertown, where she spent several years honing her skills in the catering departments of Washington College. She has also developed some solid working relationships through its vast network of professors, including Modern Stone Age Kitchen's Bill Schindler.\n\"While I was at the college, Bill was a professor there, and he was inviting me down to these intimate chef demonstrations,\" Boyd said. \"He was having these different chefs come in from all over the world, and my heart was just jumping out of my chest.\"\nInspired by these experiences, Boyd felt strongly that after five years with the college, and a couple years of side catering hustles, she was ready to make the leap into catering full-time.\nThat was in 2020 and one month prior to the pandemic changing the way people would be living and eating. After making such a commitment, Boyd felt there were two possible responses: panic or pivot. Boyd and her team chose the latter.\n\"We started doing meal deliveries. We were doing deliveries from Cambridge and all the way to Annapolis. And that's what sustained us,\" said Boyd, who added they also saw this potential game-changer as an opportunity to make an impression and name for themselves in a business that was robust with established competition.\n\"So, we were coming in [to Ruthsburg Community Center] making meals and delivering everywhere. \"For Mother's Day, we did brunch boxes that we were delivering to moms that had greeting cards in the boxes. They had a full-on brunch with a mocktail mixer. We did that for Father's Day, too. We did 'Sweet Success' graduation boxes with four different cupcakes for the kids that were graduating. We just were using ingenuity and grit to be able to say, 'we have to make it.'\"\nBoyd's approach and unique outreach was obviously successful, and she is happy that her team has been able to grow and build on that. And she is just as committed today to delivering those unique culinary experiences as she was back in 2020.\n\"I'm a creative and I like doing fun things with food. I like being able to see what's the farthest extent that I can go to with any food that I work with.\"\nCase in point, her team regularly works with community-based organizations and resources to enhance her business's level of expertise and to check-in with the network of regional partners that the business has built. Last summer, Humble Hearts partnered with the Shore Rivers organization and Wildly Native Flower Farm in Chestertown to create a delicious sensory experience with edible flowers for the participants of a talk on the subject that the farm and Shore Rivers was sponsoring.\nBoyd's out-side-of-the box, lunch box menu consisted of a focaccia with whipped basil ricotta and heirloom tomatoes accompanied by a fresh watermelon and aronia berry salad, showcased the topic in a deliciously creative way, much to the delight of the attendees.\nBoyd said she spent hours with Wildly Native's owner, Liza Goetz, just walking through the vast plots of flowers to learn from Goetz which ones to work with and which to avoid. She revels in these learning experiences and seeks to take on others, so that she can also fulfill a role as a resource to the community that means so much to her.\n\"I am in this place where I want to learn more about what is out there in my field… so, I am at Cornell University right now working on a Food Product Development Certificate.\"\nOnce she acquires that knowledge, she said, she would like to be able to share what she knows with her network of businesses and farms who may be interested in bringing products to market.\nIn addition to continuing her education, raising her family, and managing a staff of nine on-call employees, Boyd also maintains key relationships with those in the community that have impacted her along the way. You can currently find Boyd already sharing what she knows as a guest chef back at Modern Stone Age Kitchen's Eastern Shore Food Lab where she teaches hands-on cooking classes.\nBoyd said she has the utmost respect for the level of innovation and the business acumen she sees going on at Modern Stone Age Kitchen.\n\"I will call them with questions, or say, 'Can you please come look at this?' and when I have done that, they've been there,\" she said. And it's that sense of reciprocity that Boyd is ever grateful for and strives to emulate.\n\"I would not be able to do what I do every day without the community,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She and her family wanted to try something different for holiday shopping this year.\n\"We were trying to do more thoughtful and more local stuff instead of just ordering online,\" James said. She said they wanted to spend their money in a way that would benefit the local community rather than filtering more money into corporations.\n\"If you want to live in a town that has so many thriving businesses, you have to put your money where your mouth is,\" James said.\nPatricia Adkins, also from Washington, said she liked the unique selection from the shops in downtown Easton.\n\"We were here for Thanksgiving and decided after the dinner and enjoyment here to come and walk the streets of Easton,\" Adkins said. \"We've heard good things about the shopping here in Easton. There are very unique pieces of furniture and clothing as well as handbags.\"\nThe local businesses in downtown Easton appreciate the customer support over the holidays and going into Small Business Saturday.\nBarbara Ranson from Oxford owns Oxford Vintage & Trade, which recently opened its Easton location on Dover Street during the Waterfowl Festival.\n\"It benefits all of us to shop local,\" Ranson said. \"We get to support local businesses and by doing that we ensure their sustainability and their longevity.\"\nThe local shops provide a unique variety of items that are unlikely to be found in brand-name and big-box stores.\n\"You can't find our things in the usual stores,\" said Diane Towers, co-owner of La De Da, a clothing shop in downtown Easton.\n\"All of the different stores bring a lot of different things into the town,\" Towers said. \"We each have a different vibe so it makes it really nice as far as people shopping.\"\nLocal businesses depend on community support to keep them running.

Trump has also previously had modeling and talent agencies, published magazines, owned the Miss Universe pageant and the United States Football League's New Jersey Generals.\nReal estateThose products are on top of Trump's longtime business bread-and-butter real estate ventures, including hotels, golf courses and office buildings.\nThe main driver of that has been the Trump Organization, which is currently headed by the president-elect's sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.\nEric Trump also runs Trump Winery (which includes a hotel, wedding venue and cidery) in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nThe Trump Organization and Trump Winery did not respond to requests for comments on their business approaches during a second Trump administration.\nThe Trump Organization has announced deals this year for real estate developments (including golf courses, residences and hotels) in Oman, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Vietnam.\nDevelopments in the three Persian Gulf states are part of a partnership with Dubai-based Dar Global PLC. (The development firm is an arm of Saudi-based Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development Company, which recently hired Rothschild & Co. to help it explore more deals.)\n\"We are thrilled to expand our footprint in the Middle East and bring the Trump standard of luxury to the region through our longstanding relationship with Dar Global,\" Eric Trump said in a statement on the venture earlier this year.\nThe Oman development totals $4 billion, while the deal with Kinh Bac City Development Holding Corp. in Vietnam is worth $1.5 billion, according to reports.\nTrump's flagship Mar-A-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, generated $56 million for Trump, according to financial disclosures filed this summer. Trump's golf courses in Florida and New Jersey have also hosted tournaments from the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Tour.\nTrump has promised to end the Middle East war that ignited after the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks inside Israel and broker an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine after the former's 2022 invasion.\nSocial mediaTrump owns 57% of the shares in Sarasota, Florida-based Trump Media & Technology Group (Nasdaq: DJT). The company operates the Truth Social media platform and is launching a streaming platform.\nTMTG, which launched in 2022, lost $363.2 million through the first nine months of the year on revenue of $2.6 million.\nCompany executives have said TMTG's trajectory is tied to Trump's reputation and popularity. Trump said after the election that he has \"no intention\" of selling his $3.5 billion stake in TMTG.\nTrump's business deals and real estate ventures — large and small — worry watchdog groups and progressives frequently critical of the populist president-elect.\n\"By maintaining his business life during his time in office, he's giving business associates, investors and others leverage over him and his personal financial health. The American people need to know if President Trump is looking out for them or for his own financial interests,\" said Tony Carrk, executive director of Accountable.US, a liberal watchdog group.\nCarrk wants Trump to distance himself from some of his business and real estate holdings while serving as U.S. president.\n\"He needs to divest,\" Carrk said.\nHe's concerned about the Trump administration's future intersections with Truth Social, which is publicly traded.\n\"Those seeking influence over Trump could theoretically buy up Trump media shares to support the stock price, which is a major source of Trump's estimated $5.6 billion fortune,\" Carrk said.\nTrump Media and Truth Social officials have not yet responded to requests for comment.\nLicensing dealsTrump and his family's more contemporary business deals include a slew of merchandise licensing deals between vendors and Trump entities such as CIC Ventures LLC and CIC Digital LLC.\nTrump is the president, secretary, treasurer and corporate manager of those two Palm Beach, Florida-based entities. Details of the licensing deals are not disclosed, but Trump licensing entities generated $12 million in annual income for Trump, according to financial disclosures.\nTrump-endorsed and licensed \"God Bless the USA Bibles,\" marketed via music singer Lee Greenwood, now include a $1,000 version signed by the president-elect and a special $69.99 Inauguration Day Bible.\n\"GodBlessTheUSABible.com is not political, and has nothing to do with any political campaign.

GodBlessTheUSABible.com uses Donald J. Trump's name, likeness and image under paid license from CIC Ventures LLC,\" the website reads.\nFreedom Park Design and 16 Creative, which are both based out of the same offices in Alabama, are part of the distribution and marketing of the Trump Bibles and the new Trump guitars, respectively.\nGetTrumpGuitars.com is operated by 16 Creative and offers Trump-backed guitars for $1,500, as well as autographed models for $10,500.\n\"These are the only guitars endorsed by President Donald J. Trump!\" the website reads.\nGibson Guitars has sent 16 Creative a cease-and-desist letter over the Trump guitar's design, according to reports. 16 Creative, which has a.product disclaimer distancing the Trump guitars from Gibson on its website, has not yet responded to a request for comment.\nTwo Sheridan, Wyoming-based limited liability corporations — 45Footwear LLC and TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC — (which share the same address) are the marketers and distributors of Trump Sneakers and Trump Watches.\nThe sneakers are priced at as much as $499, and the watches as much as $100,000.\n\"45Footwear is not owned, managed or controlled by Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization, CIC Ventures LLC or any of their respective principals or affiliates. 45Footwear uses Donald J. Trump's name, likeness and image under paid license from CIC Ventures LLC,\" the company said on its website GetTrumpSneakers.com.\nIn a lawsuit filed in Arizona earlier this year aimed at alleged counterfeit sellers, 45Footwear said it also had a sneaker product license through DTTM Operations LLC, a New York-based Trump entity.\nWyoming-based 45Footwear also operates GetTrumpFragrances.com with a licensing disclaimer on the website. GetTrumpWatches.com also has similar licensing deal language on its website.\nAnother popular item, Trump digital trading cards, are marketed and distributed by Utah-based NFT Inc. LLC via CollectTrumpCards.com. The company has a licensing deal with Trump's CIC Digital.\nOrlando-based Unicorn Wealth LLC operates the ProudPatriots.com, a site that sells a host of merchandise, including coins and $2 bill emblazoned with Trump's face, as well as bobbleheads, ball caps and Christmas ornaments. The company says on its website it is not directly affiliated with Trump or his presidential campaign, but does not reference a licensing deal.\nTrump gear was popular at campaign rallies and is offered by various vendors online.\nNone of the companies have yet responded to requests for comment or details about their deals with Trump.\nPublic information on the shell companies partnering with Trump varies. The Montana LLCs, for example, share a Sheridan, Wyoming, address with other shell companies, with a law firm listed as the contact.\nTrevor Potter, founder and president of the Campaign Legal Center, a progressive watchdog group, promised oversight and scrutiny of the incoming Trump administration in a post-election statement.\n\"One priority in this respect will be to combat the public perception that officials are not held accountable for their unethical behavior,\" he said.\nMelania Trump, who is returning as first lady, published a memoir titled \"Melania\" in October. She is selling a $90 Christmas ornament and a $195 digital photography collection at MelaniaTrump.com. Trump is also promoting a new book, \"Save America,\" priced at $99 and $499 for a signed copy. The new book is from Winning Team Publishing. Donald Trump Jr. is one of its co-founders.\nThere will be more focus on another Trump family member's business ventures.\nInvest\nMent fund\nJared Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and served as a top White House adviser during a first Trump term, operates a $3 billion investment fund, Affinity Partners.\nA big chunk of Affinity's funding — $2 billion — comes from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund.\nThat has drawn attention from U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and other Democrats.\nWyden (who currently chairs the Senate Finance Committee) and U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland (a frequent Trump critic and ranking member of the House Oversight Committee) wrote U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in late October, asking that a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate Kushner's foreign business and investment dealings, including with the Saudis, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, to see if they have violated laws governing those working on behalf of foreign governments and entities via the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\nWyden and Raskin said Kushner's investment firm has received $157 million in fees from foreign clients, including $87 million from Saudi Arabia.\n\"Mr. Kushner is simultaneously serving as a political consultant to former President Trump and acting as a shadow diplomat and political advisor to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and other foreign principals,\" Wyden and Raskin said, arguing Trump's son-in-law has not made needed FARA disclosures.\nThey argue Kushner still serves as a political advisor to Trump. The odds of a special counsel being appointed to on the matter are likely nil with Trump's election win.\nMiami-based Affinity Partners has not yet responded to requests for comment. Earlier this year, Kushner defended his tenure in the White House and investment work after Trump's loss in the 2020 race.\nKushner and Ivanka Trump were not publicly involved with Trump's win over Harris. It is not clear what kind of roles, if any, they might have in Trump's new term.\nBut Kushner stirred some scrutiny earlier this year over the future of Gaza after the devastating Israel-Hamas war.\n\"Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable if people would focus on building up livelihoods,\" Kushner said in March, according to the Associated Press.\nTrump has named Charles Kushner (Jared Kushner's father) his pick for the U.S. ambassador to France.\nCharles Kushner is the founder of the Kushner Cos. Trump pardoned Charles Kushner of tax evasion and witness tampering charges in 2020. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 0.8 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stand 16.8 cents per gallon lower than a year ago.\"Millions took to the road for Thanksgiving, and while some regions, like the Great Lakes, saw gas prices rise just in time for travel, most of the nation saw prices hold mostly stable or decline slightly as the national average remains near the lowest level we've seen since 2021,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.\nThe national average price of diesel has risen 1.1 cents in the last week and stands at $3.514 per gallon.\nAccording to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.65 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $3.79 per gallon, a difference of $1.14 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has fallen 0.6 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.00 per gallon today. The national average is down 7.7 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 23.2 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nDecember 2, 2023: $3.21 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.23 per gallon)December 2, 2022: $3.42 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.39 per gallon)December 2, 2021: $3.34 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.38 per gallon)December 2, 2020: $2.32 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.17 per gallon)December 2, 2019: $2.49 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.60 per gallon)December 2, 2018: $2.38 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.43 per gallon)December 2, 2017: $2.46 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.47 per gallon)December 2, 2016: $2.24 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.17 per gallon)December 2, 2015: $2.09 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.03 per gallon)December 2, 2014: $2.80 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.75 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.00 per gallon, down 8.2 cents per gallon from last week's $3.08 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.14 per gallon, down 5.5 cents per gallon from last week's $3.20 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.04 per gallon, up 0.6 cents per gallon from last week's $3.03 per gallon.\n\"The weeks ahead should feature slight drops in gas prices in most areas, with over 100,000 stations now offering a gallon for $2.99 or less, which should stick around through the holiday shopping season,\" GasBuddy's De Haan said. \"While the potential impacts from tariffs are something to watch, they would have no effect until late January, if implemented at all. For this week, all eyes will be on the previously delayed OPEC+ meeting on Thursday.

    "content": "Talbot County business owners push back against potential hotel tax spike\n\n December 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 784\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — During a public meeting at the Talbot County Free Library Tuesday, a number of business owners and managers pushed back on a proposed increase to the county's accommodations tax rate.Talbot County's current public accommodations tax rate, or hotel tax rate, is 4%, the lowest of any county in the state. The tax is levied on those staying in hotels or short-term rentals, collected by the business and then paid to either the county or one of three towns.\nEaston, Oxford and St. Michaels collect revenues from such properties within one mile outside town limits. The county collects revenue from all other properties.\nA potential increase to 6%, which would raise total revenue collected by around $1 million per fiscal year based on FY2024 numbers, requires approval from lawmakers in Annapolis.\nCassandra Vanhooser, director of economic development and tourism, and Judy Bixler, the Tourism Board chairman and Oxford-Bellevue Ferry captain, outlined the benefits of raising the rate to 6% for the county's marketing efforts, such as adding staff and being able to market more businesses individually.\nHowever, local business owners had mixed reactions, with some \"open-minded\" but hesitant, and others in complete opposition.\nScott Wagner, owner of Oaks Waterfront Hotel in St. Michaels and a former Republican member of the Pennsylvania State Senate, said he wants to know where exactly the additional $1 million in revenue would be spent.\nWagner added that he doesn't \"feel the love\" from the county or its marketing efforts.\n\"Candidly, tonight, I can't support this tax, because I don't feel that Talbot County is supportive of our industry or at the Oaks,\" Wagner said. \"You have not been supportive. Nobody's come out and visited us.\"\nVanhooser acknowledged Wagner's negative opinion of the tax as fair, but disputed his claim that the county doesn't support his hotel.\n\"We have sent you many travel writers. … We have sent international tour operators there,\" she said. \"So it's not true that we haven't been to your property and we haven't supported you and marketed your property as one of our new assets. I will totally call you out on that one.\"\nEaston, Oxford and St. Michaels have all voted in support of the tax increase, which Vanhooser and Bixler stressed is the first time in years has been the case.\nAlfred Mercier, president of the Commissioners of St. Michaels, explained during the meeting why St. Michaels voted in favor of moving along with a hotel tax increase, noting its importance in funding services such as police and trash disposal.\n\"There's infrastructure that we have to support, and the accommodations tax is something that, it's a tax on transients that come from outside the town inside the town,\" Mercier stated. \"I think that is the overwhelming reason why St. Michaels (and) the residents were in support of this.\"\nMercier added, \"when it comes to an increase in a tax, if it's a destination location, people don't care. They really don't.\" Not all St. Michaels businesspeople and residents, though, agreed.\n\"I completely disagree with you Al,\" Travis Johnson, manager of the Old Brick Inn, responded. \"My guests complain about rates. St. Michaels is very competitive.\"\nChad Hill, vice president of Hill Hospitality in Easton, was one of the \"open-minded\" representatives that spoke Tuesday. But Hill expressed that any increase in accommodations tax, which is passed onto the customers, will be substantial.\n\"Easton is a very low occupancy market, and it is a very, very … rate-sensitive hotel market,\" he said. \"Two or three or four dollars is huge to slap on top of somebody's hotel bill. … Let's be careful not to be flippant that that doesn't make a difference. It makes a huge difference.\"\nHill, along with others, said they would like to see \"transparency\" and specifics of what the accommodations tax collected by the county funds more than just the marketing in general.\nWhile no official decisions were made at Tuesday's public meeting, County Manager Clay Stamp told attendees that the County Council \"is very interested\" in what everyone has to say and is \"all ears.\"\nOn Dec. 9, the Talbot County Council is expected to vote on whether it will send a letter to state delegates requesting they bring the tax legislation to the General Assembly this cycle.\nAt the end of the meeting Tuesday, Vanhooser said she thinks the county needs the increase \"to stay competitive.\" The Talbot County Tourism Board had voted unanimously in favor of the increase.\n\"Regardless of what Mr. Wagner thinks, I'm appreciative of all of you who are my tourism partners,\" Vanhooser said, \"and the work that you do, because it gives us a beautiful, wonderful, awesome destination to promote. I am proud of Talbot County, I think it is the premier destination in all of the state of Maryland and in the mid-Atlantic.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Artificial intelligence won't replace reporters\n\n December 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SISCO The Daily Times | Section: Columns \n \n 429\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When I first received an invitation to attend a seminar concerning artificial intelligence in the newsroom, I had mixed feelings. There was a bit of excitement — I am a bit of a computer and technology geek, after all — about exploring some of the tools that are available. I was also a little wary. Most of us have read or have heard about some of the more cringeworthy attempts to bring AI into journalism, and I was more than a little hesitant to entertain the notion here at The Daily Times.Now that the course has completed, though, I came to a startling two-part revelation. The first phase of my resolution was pretty basic. These tools can help — a lot.\nWe've started experimenting with AI technology, focusing primarily on routine data processing tasks. Marriage reports, real estate transactions and business licenses are the kind of data-heavy work that has traditionally consumed hours of valuable reporting time. Now, they can be completed in a matter of minutes.\nThe second part of my personal revelation came after I spent more time experimenting with available tools — from programs that can help streamline your email inbox, create possible story outlines and reveal areas of inquiry to audio tools that can simulate human voices (and even clone your own voice) to read text. These tools can be scarily good. I cloned a snippet of my voice, read a two-sentence script and played it for my younger brother. He could tell the difference only after listening several times.\nBut here's the thought that began the second part of that revelation. As good as these tools are, they can never replace a living, thinking, feeling reporter. AI can immediately tell one of our reporters how much money agencies like The Empty Pantry Fund has raised over the past five years. It cannot, however, describe the dedication of its volunteers, or put into words the joy of being able to help out a neighbor in need.\nSo no, AI will not be writing our stories. It will not conduct interviews. It will not replace our reporters. They are our nerdy assistants, doing some of the more time-consuming data entry so reporters can focus on what matters most — getting out, talking to our neighbors, attending local government meetings and telling the important stories about our lives.\nThe future of journalism will be shaped by how we choose to implement new technologies. I think we're choosing a path that puts our community first, supports our journalists and ensures that technology serves our mission of delivering reliable, comprehensive local news coverage. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Diners may request spicy or mild when ordering their dishes.\nThe interior ambiance is chic and modern with saffron-colored walls bedecked with canvas photos of foods from across India. The building itself was previously a rough empty shell, which the Mohar brothers helped to renovate into its elegant atmosphere.\nPrateek's wife Vedika Patel and the men's father R.N. Mohar also work there, making it a family affair.\nThe restaurant is open seven days a week, giving locals ample chance to \"dive into a world of spice\" as often as they like. In addition, catering for up to 50 people is available, as is online ordering for take-aways at itsmasalatime.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The national average price of diesel has declined 1.8 cents in the last week and stands at $3.472 per gallon.\nAccording to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.63 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $3.79 per gallon, a difference of $1.16 per gallon.\nThe falling prices may be coming to an end.\n\"As we edge closer to the end of the year, we're seeing momentum for falling gas prices weaken, which is typical as the national average generally bottoms out between Thanksgiving and Christmas,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"With oil prices rising back above $70 last week, gas prices may have less potential to drop much further, though there may be a second window of lower prices in January or February in some areas, but even that won't last long.\"\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 0.8 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $2.98 per gallon today. The national average is down 7.5 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 7.1 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nDec. 16, 2023: $3.10 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.05 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2022: $3.18 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.13 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2021: $3.31 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.32 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2020: $2.34 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.20 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2019: $2.45 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.56 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2018: $2.33 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.36 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2017: $2.43 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.43 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2016: $2.28 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.23 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2015: $2.02 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.01 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2014: $2.63 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.51 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $2.84 per gallon, down 5.5 cents per gallon from last week's $2.90 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.15 per gallon, down 0.5 cents per gallon from last week's $3.16 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.00 per gallon, down 6.1 cents per gallon from last week's $3.06 per gallon.\n\"While several states saw gas prices cycle last week, marked by a big jump in prices after a large decline, those that did see hefty jumps should see prices drift a bit lower, potentially making a second run at the season's lowest prices,\" De Haan said. \"The West Coast, including California, should continue to see prices drift lower, but with just a few weeks left in 2024, all attention turns to 2025. GasBuddy's 2025 Fuel Outlook, among the nation's most accurate fuel price forecasts, will be released in the coming weeks, offering motorists a glimpse into gas prices for the coming year.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "QLarant Foundation: an Easton-based philanthropic organization with widespread reach\n\n December 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Business \n \n 498\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Established out of a need to improve healthcare quality, QLarant Foundation has made part of its mission to provide nonprofit and grassroots organizations funds to better assist underserved communities nationwide.Over 20 years, the foundation has distributed an estimated $8 million to 145 nonprofits with grants ranging from $5,000 to $50,000. As the foundation continues to grow, its leaders are proud to have their Easton headquarters in support of the Eastern Shore communities.\nRonald Forsythe, chief executive officer of QLarant Foundation, said the QLarant company began in 1973 as a peer review organization for physicians in the healthcare field, and over time the company expanded beyond just quality improvement healthcare. Forsythe said the QLarant company has been one of the main contract holders with the Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\"We have expanded into program integrity, which is kind of the fraud, waste and abuse part of healthcare,\" Forsythe said. \"And as we continued to work and grow our footprint, we also saw a need to be able to find a way to use the excess reserves that we had coming in, so we actually established the foundation to support emerging healthcare nonprofits in the area as well.\"\nAmanda Neal, executive director of QLarant Foundation, said the foundation was launched over 20 years ago. Since its beginnings, its philanthropy efforts have been a part of the DNA of the organization.\nAccording to Neal, the grants top out at $50,000 because that kind of money could really move the needle for a local nonprofit doing grassroots work.\n\"There's not a single nonprofit out there that isn't underfunded, overworked, doing good stuff and moving the needle in the communities that they serve,\" Neal said.\nPrevious grant recipients included Epoch Dream Center, a student and social-emotional wellness center; Food and Friends, an organization addressing health and food security challenges; and Horizon Day Camp, a free summer camp providing joy to children with cancer and their siblings.\nAccording to Forsythe, the foundation goes out of its way to support Eastern Shore based nonprofits and the work they do for rural communities.\n\"There's a great benefit to making sure that you have an anchor tenant within the community, particularly on the Eastern Shore, where a lot of the businesses are geared toward agriculture, seafood or tourism,\" Forsythe said.\nBut as the foundation continues to expand throughout the United States, Neal says it continues to stay strong on the reason the foundation was developed: to support communities in need.\n\"Any time that you can invest in a nonprofit that is raising up individuals within our community,\" Neal said, \"the ripple effect of that is just extraordinary, helping one person, one family, whether it's stopping bullying, or helping a new mother, or a young family connect with services. The ripple effect of helping just one person always has a benefit for the community.\"\nQLarant Foundation's current 2025 grant period opened on Dec. 2 and runs through Jan. 16. Eligible nonprofits from the states of Maryland, Washington, Texas, Florida and Georgia are can apply. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

No steep slopes, woodlands, or endangered wetlands or species are located in the vicinity, Summers said.\nThe property will be served by public water and sewer.\nWith the existing beach club and restaurant, the project is posed to be an \"attractive mixed-use community that really blends in well with adjacent properties,\" according to Alan Hyatt, counsel to Bay Bridge Marina LLLP.\nThe project has undergone several iterations over its years of planning, he said.\nThe property will not have public roadways but easements and maintenance expenses will not fall to the public, Hyatt said.\nThe Department of Public Works is in support of the proposal, determining that existing and proposed road designs meet the public road standards for the pavement sections, according to Hyatt, Utilities will be privately owned, with no utility easements required.\nEnvironmentally speaking, the project will include a significant number of plantings as well as new stormwater management techniques, Hyatt said.\nAt public comment Jay Falstad of the Queen Anne's Conservation Association encouraged the Planning Commission to insist all development plantings be native species.\n\"Planting native is important for promoting local biology,\" he said.\nThe commission approved Bay Bridge Marina's preliminary and major subdivision request, finding it consistent with the Queen Anne's County 2022 Comprehensive Plan and zoning and subdivision regulations.\nThe commission also agreed with the applicant's request for the elimination of 35 feet frontage requirements for nonresidential lots for improved traffic flow, pedestrian connections and overall site design. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "We'll soon see how high the bar is on taxes\n\n December 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Columns \n \n 775\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Next month the Maryland General Assembly convenes in Annapolis for a 90-day session.All indications are the discussions, deliberations and decisions on the state budget will be drawn out and divisive.\nThe reason is simple.\nRecently the General Assembly's bipartisan Affordable Spending Committee received a most sobering report on the state's current and projected fiscal conditions.\nThe report included some of the worst state budget revenue and expense projections since the state endured pandemic lockdowns.\nThe committee staff is currently projecting a budget deficit of $3 billion. That amount is even larger than the one a reported several weeks ago, which was then $2.7 billion.\nAll the debate on the budget will include a wide range of key players with starkly different and strongly held opinions on the best way to address projected short term and long-term deficits.\nAt this point, the most likely options include spending cuts, fee increases, tax increases, revisions to the Blueprint for Maryland's Future (the Kirwan Plan) and maintaining or increasing the flow of federal dollars into Maryland.\nWith a new Republican president and Republican majorities in both houses of Congress, it is almost a given that federal dollars flowing into Maryland from jobs, and funding of huge infrastructure projects such as the Red Line mass transit expansion in Baltimore and Amtrak tunnel rebuild, also in Baltimore, will run dry.\nOne exception is final bipartisan Congressional and White House approval of full federal funding for rebuilding and replacing the Key Bridge in Baltimore. Beyond that one-time massive level of federal aid, such outlays are gone at least for the next four years and maybe forever.\nDespite all the above news, Gov. Wes Moore has repeatedly said he has a \"high bar\" for tax increases. He more recently stated that he supports revisions to the Kirwan Plan including, but not limited to, delays in the current schedule for full implementation.\nMoore has also said regularly that Maryland must attract more higher paying jobs to Maryland and must stem the number of high-income taxpayers leaving Maryland.\nTo do that, Moore has issued executive orders prefaced with the following messages:\n\"Maryland has an opportunity to change the trajectory of the downward decline that our state's economy has experienced over the past several years. For Maryland to win the decade, we must be clear-eyed about the impediments to growth, develop strategies to deliver short-term and long-term sustainable success, and create the climate that is necessary for businesses and talent to grow and relocate in our state.\"\nHis executive orders create a Governor's Office of Business Advancement, a Maryland Coordinated Permitting Review Council, a Certified Sites Program and a Governor's Economic Competitiveness Subcabinet.\nHis orders also provide for a government-loaned executive program; an all-of-government approach to supporting priority industries and sectors; the Department of Commerce to coordinate economic development, marketing, and branding efforts with local governments; directing a comprehensive review of the Business Tax Credit; Financial Assistance and Incentive Programs; and a review of Certain Business Licensing Programs.\nMaryland Senate President Bill Ferguson has been less direct in his opinions on tax increases.\nFerguson has said, \"We are going to have to look at revenues in certain areas because when we look at the budget overall, the gap cannot be accomplished by cuts alone.\" Ferguson has echoed Moore's position that a decision on tax increases will have a high bar for his support.\nThe current views of Moore and Ferguson put them at odds with two high ranking and influential leaders in the House of Delegates — Majority Leader David Moon and Appropriations Committee Chair Ben Barnes.\nBoth are unapologetic progressives who believe strongly that substantial state tax increases are long overdue. They oppose suggestions to delay or revise the implementation of schedules or mandates in Kirwan, including mandates opposed by some local school boards.\nDel. Barnes took a page from the messaging book of Gov. Moore and Senate President Ferguson by saying he has a \"very high bar for any rollback of education reforms.\"\nI predict when all is said and done, the Democratic super majorities in the General Assembly along with Gov. Moore will reach agreement on and approve a mixture of spending cuts, tax increases, fee increases and revisions to Kirwan.\nI also predict the Republican minorities in the General Assembly will continue efforts already underway to strongly oppose tax increases.\nAs always, the minority will have its say, and the majority will have its way.\nThe General Assembly's regular session ends in April. Barring any subsequent special sessions, only then we will know how Gov. Moore chose to define a high bar on tax increases.\nEventually, we also will know how that choice impacted his political future that many believe includes a run for president, assuming he is reelected to a second term as governor. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ground was broken earlier this year, and Matt Dahl says he hopes the brewery will open sometime in 2025.\nThe more than 8,000-square-foot project is an exciting one for the Dahls and also their first major business venture.\n\"It's kind of one of those things you talk about but it never happened,\" Matt Dahl said. \"It kind of just kept coming up. Sarah, my wife, she had had her eye on this property for a while. She was like, 'That would be like the perfect place to do one.'\"\nAfter living in North Carolina for five years, they moved back to Denton, Sarah Dahl's hometown, where they reside now with two sons, James and Luke. But their time in the South left a lasting impression — particularly due to the brewery scene.\n\"Where we lived in Raleigh, there were breweries everywhere,\" Matt Dahl said. \"And people loved going to them. It was kind of the heyday of breweries.\n\"We moved up here and said, 'Oh, it would be cool if we could build a brewery in Denton.'\"\nEden Town Brewing harkens back to the town's previous name before it was shortened to Edenton, then Denton. It will have a brewing production facility and a brewmaster, Matt Dahl said, along a large taproom, patio and event space.\nHe hopes they can work with local food trucks on a rotation basis or even find a full-time partner.\nThe property was bought from the owner of the former Nuttle Lumber warehouse. The Dahls had to go through a zoning amendment process with the town before construction could begin.\nDenton Mayor Abby McNinch said they presented at several Planning Commission and Town Council meetings, adhering \"to all our planning and zoning requirements as any other business would.\"\n\"I am excited. They are great people,\" McNinch said of the Dahls. \"They've done their research well, they have. They're not doing this lightly.\"\nMatt Dahl said while other potential properties for the brewery wouldn't need the zoning changes, placing the business in town was a priority for him and his wife.\n\"One of our primary motivations was to bring something to town,\" he said. \"There's already a lot of stuff out on the highway. So this is in town. Even if it was going to take longer, we'd rather have it be in town.\"\nMcNinch said she appreciates that aspect of the venture and the fact that the Dahls are town residents who care about the community as a whole, not just starting a business.\nThe brewery will be in close proximity to Denton's Market Street, which is host to many local businesses, including popular restaurants. Matt Dahl envisions the brewery anchoring the side of town across from the Market Street hub once it opens.\nDenton's mayor is excited for the possibility of growth in the area near Gay Street. Eden Town Brewing has the makeup of a \"cornerstone project\" for what McNinch says is an \"underdeveloped\" part of town.\n\"To bring an area alive again is really exciting,\" McNinch said. \"And yes, that it's walkable. It will highlight an area of our town that hasn't been highlighted in a long time.\"\n\"One of the things that we are very proud of is our sense of community,\" the mayor continued. \"And I think that the model that they've presented, and how it's not just a place to go drink beer, but the whole concept, it's going to be great for that community aspect, I think.\"\nMatt Dahl said the brewery will have a wide range of options available, including beer, cocktails, wine and non-alcoholic beverages. Thus far, reception from locals has been great, he said.\n\"The town, council (and) the town staff have all been super supportive and excited about it,\" Dahl said. \"We really have had nothing but positive feedback on the idea. Now we just have to keep that excitement going for another year until we're actually open.\"\nTo stay up to date on Eden Town Brewing Company's progress, visit edentownbrewing.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "The Meyer Plan: Governor-elect plans Delaware zoning reform, financing for cheaper housing",
    "date": "2025-01-02",
    "author": "Nick Stonesifer Spotlight Delaware",
    "content": "The Meyer Plan: Governor-elect plans Delaware zoning reform, financing for cheaper housing\n\n January 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Nick Stonesifer Spotlight Delaware | Section: News \n \n 1390\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n With three weeks until Governor-elect Matt Meyer takes office, he will assume the role at a time when housing in Delaware is more expensive and harder to build than in recent decades.New housing growth has exploded in Delaware after the pandemic, but most are priced at $400,000 or more, well above affordability for the median household, and increasingly targeting a growing number of new arrivals and retirees.\nMeanwhile, the overall state housing market has also risen in cost, reaching a median sale price of about $388,000 in November – about 5% higher than a year ago and almost 50% higher than five years ago.\nThe booming price of real estate has subsequently led to workforce shortages, especially in Sussex County where the effects are more acute.\nThat's led lawmakers around the state to begin trying to tackle the issue, and this summer the General Assembly passed multiple bills in an effort to lower housing prices and ease availability.\nMeyer has also proposed his own plans to accommodate the needs of a rapidly expanding state and emphasize consistent regulations across all three of Delaware's counties.\nThe plan to address affordability and housing is broad and covers issues from preventing homelessness to supplementing affordability. His full housing affordability plan can be accessed here.\nYet one theme is consistent in the plan: it starts before projects break ground.\nZoning reform\nAt the top of Meyer's plan are zoning reform proposals that would allow for more density in development codes and create a more diverse housing stock. He would also push for more accessory dwelling units (ADUs), which are smaller housing options already built on an established lot, and higher-density options.\nIn a seven-bill package put forward last session by State Sen. Russell Huxtable (D-Lewes), one bill would have allowed property owners to build one ADU on their properties without going through local government approvals. It would have also compelled those governments to enact laws that allow ADUs under 1,000 square feet to be built.\nThe bill was the only one of the seven bills to not see a vote before the end of the legislative session.\nMeyer's plan doesn't expand on how he'd achieve this other than saying he'd direct the Office of State Planning Coordination (OSPC) to work with local governments to encourage zoning reform.\nFor those unfamiliar with the planning process in Delaware, OSPC is usually one of the first hurdles developers overcome. Developers will take their proposals before the Preliminary Land Use Service, better known as PLUS, which is run by OSPC.\nIn those meetings, multiple state agency leaders outline code or environmental roadblocks in projects before they go to the county for more intense scrutiny.\nWhile its recommendations to the developers are only advisory, OSPC plays a key part in targeting growth across the state. But in similar fashion to its recommendations on projects, its targeted growth areas are also recommendations.\nMike Riemann, the president of the Delaware Home Builders Association, explained that zoning density is low in the state, meaning it's harder to build more homes on specific lots depending on its zoning district.\nRiemann pointed to a recent ordinance adopted by New Castle County that would allow \"pocket neighborhoods,\" or dense neighborhoods of single-family lots, in areas targeted for growth, but situated on difficult-to-build parcels.\nBut Riemann said incentivizing growth is difficult when the regulations for developing in a rural area and an urban area are similar like they are now.\nLowering construction costs\nNext in his plan, Meyer would try to bring down the cost of building a home in Delaware. According to the plan, he'd \"relax regulations\" for affordable housing developments, create a faster approval process for those projects, and waive certain fees and taxes.\nOne piece of that plan is to create a new state program called the \"New Housing Production Fund,\" which would subsidize projects in a similar fashion to current federal tax credit programs that affordable housing developers rely on.\nRich Przywara, the CEO of the Todmorden Foundation, an offshoot of the Woodlawn Trustees that develops affordable housing, praised this idea, saying it makes building much easier.\nA new state fund would allow developers to have access to low-financed construction loans, meaning less money spent on interest, he said.\nThe waiver of fees and different taxes is also an idea he'd want to see move forward. Currently, Przywara said outgoing Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki waived many different permitting fees on affordable housing projects across the city.\n\"You still have to apply for the permit, you still have to post your permit, but [Purzycki] waived the fee,\" Przywara said. \"That's one less thing I have to pay for upfront and borrow money for.\"\nWhile much of Meyer's plan is targeted at creating more incentives for affordable housing, it's impossible to ignore an increased growth of single-family homes downstate.\nEstimates from the Delaware Home Builders Association say it can cost up to $474,000 to build a single new, 2,400-square-foot home in Sussex County. A third of those costs, according to Riemann, simply boils down to time.\nThe cost of land, the interest on owning that land, as well as carrying costs on a single plot of land begins to add up the longer it takes to get a home built.\nTwo ways that Riemann said the state could get homebuilding costs lower across the state is reducing the time needed for approvals and allowing for higher lot densities.\nLowering that approval time at the state level could mean streamlining state agency reviews from the Departments of Transportation and Natural Resources and Environmental Control – two of the biggest hurdles for developers – to make them more predictable for builders to save time, without compromising the integrity of a project.\n\"You don't have to sacrifice the integrity of the regulatory requirement because it's efficient,\" Riemann said. \"And that is a mindset that I think we need to have as a state.\"\nIn the final weeks of his time as a county executive, Meyer vetoed a New Castle County Council ordinance that would have increased a fee on new construction projects to go toward services like fire departments and emergency medical services.\nHis reasoning boiled down to trying to keep housing costs in the county low at a time when the market is becoming harder to break into.\n\"Now is not the time to increase the cost of housing in New Castle County,\" Meyer wrote. \"This county is facing an unprecedented housing crisis, not only for the most vulnerable among us, but also for so many working families across our community.\"\nYet multiple county council members saw the veto as an acquiescence to developers' desires.\nAffordable housing\nWhen it comes to the Meyer plan on affordable housing, it includes a wide-sweeping analysis of areas to be improved upon.\nJim Purcell, a director with the Milford Housing Development Corporation (MHDC), said one part of affordable housing that's overlooked is thinking it needs to be all about building new units. In his eyes, there should be equal attention paid to repairing the current housing stock, and therefore preventing the unnecessary loss of available units.\n\"We've got a tremendous amount of substandard housing, which simply needs a little TLC, but there are a lot of costs that go along with that,\" Purcell said.\nThe MHDC specializes in affordable housing development and emergency home repair. It also owns multiple rental communities across the state.\nPurcell said he believed support of alternative housing like ADUs or tiny home villages allows people to find housing options that don't exceed 30% of their income. But he said in Delaware, it's more common to see people spending above that monthly benchmark, especially in urban and rural areas.\nFor all his proposals, there are some who like the governor-elect to take a more progressive stance on housing.\nShyanne Miller, a Wilmington affordable housing advocate with the H.O.M.E.S. Campaign, said she would have liked to see Meyer's plan include rent stabilization, which would limit how much a landlord could increase their rent each year.\nShe added that Delaware needs one, unified state housing agency that can focus on all of the state's housing issues in the governor's Cabinet. Currently, there are five public housing authorities operating across the state, with Wilmington, Dover and Newark operating their own.\nThe Delaware State Housing Authority (DSHA) is often in a tricky position to make decisions regulating rent since they are also landlords for Kent and Sussex counties, Miller said.\n\"I'm hoping that he'll consider taking the advice of people to just be ready to start a housing agency [on] day one,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Budget, Blueprint, energy are top issues for Shore legislators this session\n\n January 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: General Assembly \n \n 710\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — As Eastern Shore legislators prepare to cross the bridge and return to Annapolis for the first day of the Maryland General Assembly's 2025 legislative session on Wednesday, the state's budget is top of mind.\"It's just a tough time right now, and we're going to have to be very cautious and very thoughtful of the citizens and the impacts that our citizens are feeling,\" Del. Jay Jacobs (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline) said in an interview with the Star Democrat.\nThe state is facing a predicted $2.7 billion budget deficit in fiscal year 2026. Jacobs said when it comes to the budget process this year, he thinks everything will be on the table. \"The devil is in the details,\" he said.\n\"We're certainly — on the Shore — fiscal conservatives concerned with any cost increase, any tax increase or any cost toward citizens,\" Jacobs said.\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said he hopes state Democrats realize that some state goals, such as the Blueprint for Maryland's Future and some climate initiatives, are unrealistic and need to be reexamined.\n\"So I hope there's some reality checks,\" he said.\nDel. Jefferson Ghrist (R- Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline) said the state has overspent. He said although House leadership seems to be ok with raising taxes to balance the budget, the governor might not be \"comfortable\" with that.\nGhrist said he expects to see a \"clash\" in the Democratic Party regarding the budget.\nSen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) sees this legislative session as a \"defining\" one for Gov. Wes Moore (D).\n\"He's going to have to balance this out within his own party,\" Mautz said about Moore. \"Because the policies that are in place now that have caused these economic problems largely come from the Democratic Party and Democratic leadership.\"\nBLUEPRINT FOR MARYLAND'S FUTUREThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future is another issue that legislators on the Shore expect to be one of the top issues this legislative session.\nThe Blueprint — a plan passed by the Maryland General Assembly in 2021 that aims to improve student outcomes and education quality across the state — has garnered some concern across the state due to funding challenges.\nHutchinson said that with a budget shortfall, the state should be \"pulling back\" on the Blueprint. He said the plan has \"been devastating\" to counties across the state.\nJacobs said he thinks this legislative session will result in adjustments to the timeline of certain Blueprint goals.\n\"I don't think that they're going to do away with Blueprint by any means,\" he said. \"I just think that there may be some changes in the timeline of different parts of it.\"\nMautz said \"something has to happen\" with the Blueprint. He said he isn't sure if legislators will create bills \"to address the damage that's been done\" or create bills that put pauses on the plan.\nENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTFrom solar energy to electric vehicles, Eastern Shore legislators see energy and environment issues as important heading into this legislative session.\nGhrist called the state's renewable energy goals \"virtually impossible to achieve.\" He said he has concerns about who is controlling where solar energy systems are being placed in the state. He plans to put out \"several\" bills that address solar energy.\n\"Our number one industry is agriculture and it's being threatened right now by solar,\" he said.\nJacobs said he has heard that there have been some \"serious conversations\" about expanding nuclear energy in the state. He said he hopes state leadership and legislative committees that deal with energy issues will look more into nuclear energy and figure out if it's a direction the state should be going in.\nWhen it comes to electric vehicles, Hutchinson said he doesn't think the state has the capacity for its electric vehicle initiatives.\n\"There's not enough power stations to be able to charge them,\" he said. \"And based upon what I'm hearing from our local dealers, there's not a market for them and they want to stay with combustible engines.\"\nHutchinson said he expects a lot of debate this session.\n\"And again, I hope that we see some reality coming that we can't continue to afford to spend and that we have to make sure we address this $2.7 billion short fall that's going to get worse and worse each year if we don't do anything today,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Residing on Elliot Street, this new store provides curated gifts and jewelry to all those searching for one-of-a-kind items for their loved ones.\nOcampos, native to Costa Rica, moved to the Eastern Shore from New Jersey with her husband Brayam Herrera and young daughter about four years ago. Back in Costa Rica, Herrera and she were auto mechanics and had a shared love of working with their hands.\nOcampos said it was always a dream of hers to open her own business where she can connect with and talk to tourists and community members alike.\n\"I love talking to people. I love making connections with people,\" Ocampos said. \"I've always worked in occupations that center people and service to fulfill their needs. I feel that I've been called to share and help curate objects that bring people together.\"\nHerrera said his wife, as an artist and a creator, goes above and beyond for all her customers.\n\"It's really impressive for me what she got going on,\" Herrera said. \"A couple years ago, she made and accomplished a goal, and everything came with a lot of effort, of course, but it turned out to be bigger than I thought. She's been working really, really hard to have this, and she's so happy to have it. It's her first business here, and it's not easy. It's really, really, really tough, really hard, a lot of work. But she made it. And now she has this store, and she deserves it.\"\nAccording to Herrera, Ocampos started making customized gifts a couple of years ago. She began with research and quickly put her knowledge to action.\nAfter a few years, what was once a hobby developed into a full-fledged business that quickly outgrew her workplace in their home.\nNow with an established location for her business, Ocampos has been met with an array of support from her community.\nVictoria Gomez Lozano, deputy director for the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, said supporting Latino-owned businesses on the Eastern Shore is a core mission of the center. For Gomez Lozano, as the Latino population continues to grow, it has become more and more important to support economic growth within the community.\n\"First of all it was an honor that ChesMRC was invited to the Acero 506 inauguration,\" Gomez Lozano said. \"It was a pleasure and important for ChesMRC to be there because that is an accomplishment of our mission, 'empower people from different cultures to become successful and engaged members of our community.' Dedication and hard work shows us a great story of success.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "New reality, ‘can of worms’ or real estate play?: Trump looks at U.S. Postal Service privatization\n\n January 6, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: News \n \n 977\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House has given new vigor to conservative efforts to privatize the U.S. Postal Service.Some conservatives have long wanted to privatize the U.S. Post Office, citing its financial losses spurred by retirement obligations and a changing competitive landscape with delivery and parcel services from Amazon, FedEx and UPS.\nEfforts to privatize the Postal Service will have to overcome worries about impacts on smaller and rural communities and what happens to (and who might benefit from) USPS' vast real estate holdings from small town post offices to valuable properties in big cities and affluent areas.\nThe Postal Service has more than 33,000 locations nationwide with more than 235,400 delivery routes. It leases some space from private real estate groups and owns more than 8,500 properties.\nThose owned properties comprise more than 195.6 million square feet of space, according to USPS' latest annual report to Congress. The USPS real estate portfolio sits on more than 836,100 acres of land nationwide.\nJesus Salas, a finance professor at Lehigh University (who has examined the prospects of privatizing the U.S. Postal Service) said some of its real estate holdings \"are very valuable\" including in big cities such as New York.\n\"That's significant value. Those are good locations,\" Salas said.\nTrump, whose business fortune and public notoriety have been driven by his real estate development ventures, renewed USPS privatizing chatter last month during a post-election press conference from his estate in Florida.\n\"There is talk about the Postal Service being taken private, you do know that — not the worst idea I've ever heard,\" Trump said. \"It's a lot different today between Amazon and UPS and FedEx, and all the things you didn't have. But there is talk about that. It's an idea that a lot of people have liked for a long time. We're looking at that.\"\nUSPS lost $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2024 on $79.5 billion in revenue and lost $6.5 billion on $78.2 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2023. The fiscal year 2024 losses reflect declining traditional mail volumes, USPS CFO Joseph Corbett said in a USPS announcement in November.\nPostmaster General Louis DeJoy, who was appointed by Trump in 2020, has been undertaking a $40 billion restructuring effort that has worried some rural lawmakers over plans to reorganize mail processing and deliveries.\nChris Edwards, an economist and fiscal policy analyst for the conservative Cato Institute, favors privatization, citing similar efforts in Japan and Germany.\n\"I think that they have to wake up and face reality,\" Edwards said, pointing to USPS financial losses.\nFrom a business and efficiency perspective, the USPS does not need all of its more than 31,000 post offices, according to Edwards.\n\"Some of them only get like only one or two customers per day,\" Edwards said, noting those are not just rural locations.\nHe points to other countries where mail services are offered at grocery stores as a potential alternative.\nEdwards also argues younger generations are less and less reliant on mail and that a privatized USPS could go to every-other-day deliveries instead of its currently mandated 6 days per week.\n\"The world has changed,\" he said.\nBut Salas is not sure there is a political appetite to close local post offices across the country, noting the potential for problems if hometown post offices were to be closed by some new corporate parent.\n\"Trump's base is in the rural areas,\" he said.\nIn Montana, for example, federal lawmakers have objected to USPS plans to move mail processing from Missoula and Spokane, Washington.\nOpposition from lawmakers from both sides of the aisle to local post office closures as well as other operational challenges makes Salas question how much political capital Trump might expend on the matter.\n\"I think it is a big can of worms,\" Salas said.\nPostal workers unions representing many of USPS' just under 640,000 workers — along with direct mail and other groups and industries that still rely on traditional mail — are also poised to oppose a privatization push which will have to navigate narrow GOP majorities in Congress.\nSome Democrats and advocates on the political left also are opposed to privatization of the post office and other federal agencies.\n\"The USPS is the nation's lifeline, ensuring delivery to every corner of the country. We cannot allow it to be dismantled, sold off, and handed over to Wall Street billionaires for profit,\" said Robert Reich, a liberal economist and former U.S. Labor Secretary.\n\"Privatization would increase costs, reduce access, and be an utter disaster,\" he said.\nGoing to every-other-day deliveries isn't necessarily good for business and USPS, and Washington still needs to figure out mammoth retirement obligations that have been a financial albatross, according to Salas.\nUSPS had previously covered the health care costs of retirees — which financially burdened its bottom line.\n\"The USPS is still performing poorly — in great part because of the retirement obligations it has toward the employees (related to health and pension). Some of those concerns have fallen because of the 2022 regulation that forces USPS retirees to opt into Medicare Part B first,\" Salas said. \"There are still huge holes in the retirement-related liabilities (upwards of $100 billion).\"\nPrivatization and potential sales of real estate and land holdings could help alleviate some of that burden, but it is still an obstacle to overcome.\nSalas said privatized post offices would likely be treated like a regulated utility with government oversight of its operations and prices, although he does worry about how assets would be privatized.\nEdwards is more optimistic about the odds of some sort of privatization in a second Trump term and with a Republican Congress.\nThe Cato analyst is also hoping for some unlikely allies in the push.\n\"There are green arguments,\" Edwards said.\nTrump could rescind Biden administration efforts to convert more USPS vehicles to electric.\nBut Edwards said the groups concerned about climate change should also welcome efforts to make deliveries more efficient and reduce USPS' real estate footprint.\n\"31,000 locations — It's just a waste of energy,\" Edwards said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Eastern Shore legislators return to Annapolis ready to tackle budget\n\n January 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: General Assembly \n \n 623\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — As Eastern Shore legislators returned Annapolis for the first day of the 2025 General Assembly Wednesday, they brought goals of keeping taxes from increasing and a readiness to work with those across the aisle to ensure that.\"I think it's going to be an interesting session where everything's on the table, and I have a good feeling — I like to be an optimist — that we're going to work together more this year on behalf of Marylanders,\" said Del. Jay Jacobs (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline) in an interview with The Star Democrat.\nThroughout the first day of the 2025 legislative session, the state's budget deficit was a leading topic of discussion. The state is facing a predicted $2.7 billion budget deficit in fiscal year 2026. Gov. Wes Moore (D) needs to submit a balanced budget proposal to the legislature by Jan. 15.\nFor Maryland's Republican legislators, which includes almost all of the Eastern Shore's legislators, the budget is the number one concern.\nDuring a Wednesday morning media event held by the General Assembly's Republican leadership, Eastern Shore legislator and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline) said that the governor had announced his budget proposal would address $2 billion of the $2.7 billion deficit. Hershey said the remainder of the deficit would need to be addressed by the General Assembly.\n\"And that can either be done through additional cuts or through revenue enhancements and increases,\" Hershey said. \"The Republican Caucus stands firm that we are not going to be supporting any type of tax or fee increases at all.\"\nAfter saying that Democratic policies are the reason for the state's fiscal situation, Hershey said Republican legislators \"stand ready to work with (Democrats).\"\n\"We will offer vigorous debate,\" he said. \"At the same time, we will look for compromise in situations that we can. But we are optimistic that we will be able to find a solution that balances the budget without adding any additional taxes or fee increases.\"\nIn her speech to the House of Delegates, Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) said she knows there's be a lot of discussion about the state's \"fiscal limitations.\"\n\"And there should be,\" she said. \"We can't deny our difficult fiscal reality. But instead of talking about what our budget can't do, I'd like to talk about what it can do. Most importantly, our budget has the power to protect the most vulnerable Marylanders.\"\nSeveral Shore legislators voiced that the state's budget dilemma may put Republicans, who only make up about a third of the state's legislature, in a better position to negotiate for their goals.\nJacobs said he thinks the Republicans and Democrats are going to have to work together \"to some degree.\" He said he thinks finding compromise might be easier this year compared to past years as a result.\n\"I think a lot of us agree on not taxing the citizens any more,\" Jacobs said.\nDel. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said the session isn't going to be an easy one for Republican legislators.\n\"But I do think we'll be listened to,\" he said. \"And I'm looking forward to some hardy debates on the floor about some of these issues.\"\nDel. Jefferson Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, and Caroline) said he thinks this could be the \"most contentious\" legislative session that he has been a part of in the last decade.\n\"I'm hoping that we can persuade the leaders that be in the State of Maryland that we're not going to raise taxes this session,\" he said.\nAt the Republican leadership media event Wednesday morning, House of Delegates Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-1B, Allegany County) said that Republican legislators are ready to come up with \"constructive ideas\" to address the budget deficit.\n\"We cannot tax our way to prosperity,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore (D) made a strong push for beer and wine sales in grocery stores in Maryland last month. But he changed his stance before the Maryland General Assembly convened for the start of this year's legislative session.\"This is not going to be one of my administration's priorities,\" Moore said to The Daily Record's Eye on Annapolis summit just a few hours before legislators gathered for the opening day of the 2025 General Assembly.\nTalbot County is the only county in Maryland where beer and wine can currently be purchased at a grocery store. Maryland is one of five states where the sale of beer and wine is not permitted in grocery stores and similar establishments. Other states include Alaska, Delaware, Minnesota and Rhode Island.\nLast month, Moore told news outlets around the state that he would push legislators to pass a bill permitting beer and wine sales in grocery stores during this year's General Assembly.\nEven when Moore pushed, legislators from the Eastern Shore believed a potential bill on the matter would be overshadowed by state money matters.\n\"We have a $2.7 billion deficit this year, and I would think that the governor would have more important things to be worried about than beer and wine sales,\" Del. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said.\nBoth Adams and Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said this issue has come up every year they have been in office.\n\"I'm on the committee jurisdiction for alcohol,\" Adams said. \"Our committee has heard this bill in years past, and we've not supported it because it would be devastating to small business owners that many of which are in my district and here on the Eastern Shore and have been very vocal about their concerns about this kind of legislation.\"\nWhat has stopped this bill in the past, the legislators said, is the effect competition beer and wine sales in grocery stores will create for small business owners.\n\"Even in Talbot County, where they sell beer and wine and even liquor in grocery stores. If you speak to those vendors that are liquor stores, they will tell you that while they've been able to survive, that those grocery stores are an economic competitor to them,\" Mautz said. \"So the idea that, well, this works in Talbot County, or works throughout the state, I think is a big assumption as far as not putting these stores out of business.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore signed an executive order Friday directing his administration to scour the state's spending for waste and inefficiency, with a goal of producing $50 million in savings.Moore announced the effort, called the Government Modernization Initiative, two days after promising to propose a budget with $2 billion in cuts, an attempt to address a projected $3 billion deficit.\n\"It's finding the breakage in the systems and fixing them so we're not papering it over in more expensive ways later on,\" Moore said of the initiative in a Friday announcement.\nThe initiative is aimed at finding inconsistent or unnecessary spending throughout state government, fixing \"things that have long been broken.\"\nMoore went on to mention inefficiencies including under-utilized state vehicles and inconsistently-priced technology and equipment that, if addressed, could save the state $50 million \"this year alone.\"\nChief Performance Officer Asma Mirza and the performance cabinet will spearhead the effort. Elisabeth Sachs, a longtime nonprofit and state and local government leader, will also contribute to the project.\nBoston Consulting Group will also be brought on to aid in the analysis. In a pay-for-performance contract approved in October, the state will pay the firm, one of the \"big three\" in strategy consulting, a 20% share of the savings achieved, with a maximum payout of $15 million.\nThe study will begin this year, with a goal of implementing changes by fiscal year 2026, which begins in July.\n\"We know the challenges that exist,\" Moore said. \"It's created a chance for this team to show what we're made of, because we will address it, and Maryland will grow.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In their hands are sleek trays, cups and other products receiving careful changes under heavy machinery.Each person, in protective gear, carefully works to create countless commemorative products engraved with Americana symbols for the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.\nMore than 600 products were sent to Washington earlier this week, where they were received by members of Trump's team as part of a longstanding tradition at Salisbury.\nThe company has a rich history of providing engraved commemorative gifts for presidents and other government officials.\nFor over 30 years, Salisbury has crafted engraved pewter trays, picture frames, jewelry boxes and 700 other products showing appreciation for the country.\nIn preparation for the 2025 inauguration, the Salisbury team has been crafting items featuring Trump's signature and other symbols of the presidency.\nJoseph Bernstein, sales manager for Salisbury, said they are proud to continue the tradition of pewter work.\n\"Pewter in itself has a rich history,\" Bernstein said. \"Paul Revere was a pewter smith. Pewter was brought over from England to America, and we made it our own. So we have a rich tradition of making pewter smithing in this country.\n\"It is, in itself, Americana. They're valuable keepsakes and commemoratives that can be passed down for generations.\"\nBernstein said the company started crafting items for politicians during the Ronald Reagan presidency. During his time in office, Reagan had his presidential seal with his and first lady Nancy Reagan's signatures turned into Americana products.\nSince then, the company has made similar products for U.S. senators and representatives, other presidents and for commemorative events.\nThe products being prepared with engraved signatures will have several uses, Bernstein shared. Some of the products are in preparation for the president-elect, who, according to Bernstein, purchases the products from Salisbury with donations and uses them as gifts and for personal use.\nDuring Trump's last term in office, his team would order between 50 to 100 pieces from time to time, sometimes putting in orders for additional products when he was traveling to visit other leaders nationally and internationally.\nAdditionally, different organizations will purchase the products to use for events.\nAccording to Bernstein, Salisbury's products are in no way a political statement, and the company has gone out of its way to stay out of politics due to polarization. The company is proud to serve Republicans, Democrats and other parties \"all with the same respect.\"\nFor Bernstein, appreciation for Americana goes beyond political lines. He shared that julep cups, a drinking vessel traditionally used to serve mint julep, is his favorite type of product. Bernstein describes it as \"if you were drinking from a fine leaded crystal, just one of those things that enhances the experience.\"\nOverall, Bernstein said as they prepare for the inauguration of President Donald Trump, the company is working hard to provide its best products and is excited to continue to serve every political representative in the future.\n\"Salisbury has been around since 1979, and we are proud to be, to serve, we are proud to be on the Eastern Shore and commemorated, and proud to be a small part of commemorating our American heritage,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 14.2 cents per gallon higher than a month ago and stand 3.9 cents per gallon higher than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has increased 3.7 cents in the last week and stands at $3.525 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.39 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $3.79 per gallon, a difference of $1.40 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has fallen 1.1 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.02 per gallon Monday. The national average is up 0.9 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 3.2 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nJan. 13, 2024: $3.06 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.05 per gallon)Jan. 13, 2023: $3.28 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.26 per gallon)Jan. 13, 2022: $3.24 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.31 per gallon)Jan. 13, 2021: $2.44 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.37 per gallon)Jan. 13, 2020: $2.54 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.58 per gallon)Jan. 13, 2019: $2.21 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.24 per gallon)Jan. 13, 2018: $2.54 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.53 per gallon)Jan. 13, 2017: $2.37 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.34 per gallon)Jan. 13, 2016: $1.94 per gallon (U.S. Average: $1.95 per gallon)Jan. 13, 2015: $2.27 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.11 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.09 per gallon, down 3.1 cents per gallon from last week's $3.12 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.11 per gallon, down 1.8 cents per gallon from last week's $3.13 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.08 per gallon, down 1 cent per gallon from last week's $3.09 per gallon.\n\"It's been a relatively quiet week for the national average price of gasoline, with little overall movement. However, colder weather has pushed diesel prices higher and could also impact gasoline prices if refiners face disruptions,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"While gas prices haven't shifted significantly yet, oil prices have climbed to their highest level since October, driven by President Biden's new sanctions on so-called dark vessels, which have slowed countries like Iran's ability to sell oil. This could soon lead to more noticeable increases in gas prices. Seasonally weak demand may help soften the impact of any increases for now, but with refinery maintenance season just weeks away—when refiners typically reduce gasoline production—motorists should be prepared for the spring rally to kick off.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

By 2028, the population is expected to be around 55,000, she said.\nMoving forward, the largest industries in the county look to include wholesale trade, government, education, manufacturing and food services, according to Tinelli.\nAgriculture and maritime industries continue to be foundational aspects of the county's economy and history that will always be supported, she said.\nHighlighting key performance indicators, Tinelli noted year to date, Queen Anne's County has had approximately $30 million in commercial property sales and $77.8 million in new commercial construction. In 2023, the county had the fifth-highest per capita income in the state, she said.\nThe county saw a 19% growth in businesses overall in 2024, and Commissioner Patrick McLaughlin noted it is the resiliency of residents and local businesses taking risks that keeps the county thriving with jobs and revenue.\n\"You are the engine of our county, you create the jobs,\" he said.\nPanels of experts led discussion on key economic development topics, including providing an overview of the recently adopted Queen Anne's County Economic Development Five-Year Strategic Plan.\nFive priorities of the economic development commission include: maintaining a sense of community and enhancing quality of life; championing the increase of accessible workforce housing; diversifying and expanding transportation; facilitating business growth and attraction; and elevating tourism throughout the county.\nTackling infrastructure, housing, health care and education, another panel discussed the county's achievements, challenges and opportunities facing core priorities.\nQACETD in partnership with Queen Anne's County Public Schools (QACPS) has implemented career development programs for students and established Direct Work Experience Curriculum. More than 145 businesses have provided career awareness learning opportunities through classrooms, career fairs, field trips and directed work experience.\nQACETD continues to coordinate apprenticeships and internship opportunities for high schoolers in fields such as culinary, engineering, technology and trades with partnerships with QACPS career coaches.\nRealtor experts led another roundtable addressing different types of future development in the county including commercial, residential and real estate and alignments with broader regional goals of infrastructure, housing and economic growth.\nThe demand for housing is strong in Queen Anne's County, with the median price of housing at $543,000, said Barry Waterman of Waterman Realty.\nThe demand for office space is shifting away from just cubicles and more toward flexible and smaller spaces including lounges to both serve as an incentive to bring people into the office and address remote work, according to Mason Popham, commercial realtor.\nCounty accomplishments include 4-H Park improvements, Kent Island branch library expansions, public sewer extensions and supporting local nonprofits, County Commissioner Chris Corchiarino said.\nFuture plans and developments of the region include supporting the state-of-the-art regional hospital, finalizing plans for a new Bay Bridge crossing, ratifying an agreement for the mid-shore regional detention center and expansion of pedestrian trail systems, Corchiarino said.\nJack Wilson, county commissioner and recently appointed Maryland Association of Counties (MACo) president, noted MACo is the largest lobbying group in the state and ensures rural counties have a voice across all jurisdictions.\nFrom a legislative side, Wilson noted state budget shortfalls come from the Blueprint for Maryland's Future. MACo focuses on senate or house bills that directly affect the fiscal or autonomy of counties such as mandated policies or spending, he said.\nThe state is in a huge budget deficit going into the legislative session, and the governor has stated economic development as a priority to increase revenue, Wilson said.\nEconomic development takes into account who is moving to the area and what amenities and services resources are needed to continue to be a thriving community, Tinelli said.\nLegislative leaders are now noting the crucial role economic development plays, and it is imperative to have tools to continually support these incentives, she said.\nQueen Anne's County gets the best of both worlds, according to Tinelli, with an economy that more mirrors Western Shore neighbors while enjoying a quality of life that is all Eastern Shore.\nFor more information about QACETD and the Economic Development Commission, visit choosequeenannes.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moore is pledging to make Maryland the \"quantum capital of the world,\" proposing a significant investment into the industry of super-fast computing amid a budget crisis in the state.Speaking at the College Park headquarters of IonQ, a leading quantum computing company, Moore said Tuesday he believes quantum is one of the industries in which Maryland has a competitive advantage, industries that could help grow an economy he said has been stagnant for too long.\n\"I refuse to have, in this moment, with the talent we have in the field, for Maryland to be a state that is just simply going to manage decline,\" Moore said. \"Maryland, if we grow, we win. We're going to grow.\"\nIn his address to the crowd, which included representatives from IonQ, the University of Maryland and other industry leaders, Moore announced a $27.5 million investment in the new \"Capital of Quantum\" initiative. Moore described the project as a joint venture between the state, the University of Maryland, IonQ and \"other partners in the quantum computing space.\"\nMoore described the goal of the investment as a simple one: \"to make Maryland the capital of quantum of the world.\"\nThe announcement of the initiative follows a week of financial volatility in the quantum industry. Stock for IonQ and other companies in the field have seen dramatic rises and falls over the past several days after figures like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg questioned the idea of quantum computing being ready in the near future.\nDespite this, Moore believes investing in the industry is a good short-term bet, and an even better one in the long-term.\n\"I think this is actually a smart bet for our GDP growth early,\" Moore told CNS in a gaggle with reporters, \"and I think it's an incredibly smart bet for our long-term prospects of having something that Maryland can really pride itself on as having one of the leading spaces in the industry.\"\nQuantum computing, a rapidly-emerging industry in the technology space, involves using quantum mechanics to produce answers to problems far faster than current computers can. The applications of such technology are wide-ranging, including artificial intelligence, pharmaceutical research and cybersecurity.\n\"Quantum computing doesn't just bend reality,\" Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller said at IonQ headquarters. \"It redefines it, solving problems in ways we never, ever thought possible.\"\nAlong with the focused spending in quantum computing, Moore also announced a larger $750 million investment in \"economic growth and workforce development,\" with a focus on leveraging the assets that Maryland has to grow the state's economy.\n\"Oftentimes,\" Moore said, \"we have been asset-rich and strategy-poor. We haven't prioritized the areas that need to be prioritized. Well, today that changes.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The photo caption reads, \"Cheers to the New Year, and new projects.\"\nThe Cambridge-based brewery currently has a taproom and restaurant, Chessie Burger, located on Poplar Street in Cambridge as well as a taproom and restaurant in Annapolis called Chessie's Wharf. RaR has been brewing beer since 2013, according to its website.\nIn an email to The Star Democrat, RaR Brewing chief financial officer Ryan Belton said he could confirm that RaR is working on a project at the old Snappers location. Belton said RaR couldn't share more information at the moment, but would in the future.\nSnappers opened its doors to the Cambridge community in 1994. Along with a tiki bar on the water, the spot offered local seafood and Caribbean-inspired food.\nOn Dec. 14, the restaurant closed its doors.

    "content": "Mid-Shore residents face sharp energy bill spikes despite modest rate increase predictions\n\n January 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: HANNAH COMBS hcombs@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 840\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Delmarva Power customers across Maryland's Eastern Shore are reporting dramatic increases in their utility bills, with some seeing their December charges double or triple despite the company's October prediction of an estimated 3% rate hike.Delmarva Power, a subsidiary of Illinois-based Exelon Corporation, provides electric service to 208,000 Maryland customers throughout the Eastern Shore, as well as in Delaware.\nThe utility operates in a unique market position where regional energy consumption significantly exceeds local production capacity, forcing reliance on out-of-state power generation.\n\"Maryland and Delaware use a lot more energy than those states are able to produce, necessitating the purchase of out-of-state generated energy,\" said Zach Chizar, senior communications specialist with Delmarva Power.\nThe cost of purchased energy remains a supply and demand situation, Chizar said.\nDelmarva Power's cost structure differs from nonprofit cooperative companies like Choptank Electric, which operates under a different business model as a member-owned utility.\nA Queen Anne's County resident who tracks daily usage through Delmarva's monitoring system reported paying premium rates between 6 a.m. and midnight, with lower rates only available during overnight hours. On Kent Island, another customer struggling with tiered billing discovered they were being charged higher rates after exceeding baseline usage levels, a pricing structure designed to encourage conservation.\n\"Tier 2 electric charges refers to a higher electricity rate applied when a customer exceeds a certain baseline usage level,\" the Kent Island resident explained. \"Essentially, it's a higher price for electricity once you use more than a set amount within a billing cycle.\"\nIn Betterton and surrounding Kent County, customers have shared documentation showing projected January costs approaching 200% higher than their November charges, even after implementing energy-efficient upgrades. These increases far exceed Delmarva Power's projected rise from $144 to $147 for average monthly residential bills.\nThe rate structure breaks down into several components: a distribution rate of $0.069815 per kilowatt-hour, which covers 87% of distribution costs for average customers, a monthly customer charge of $9.19, and a supply cost of $0.09961 per kilowatt-hour as of January 2025. An additional EmPOWER surcharge of $0.0085 per kilowatt-hour is also applied, based on monthly consumption of 900 kilowatt-hours.\nThe utility's cost structure is divided between distribution and supply charges. Distribution involves the infrastructure costs of moving electricity from power plants like Dominion Energy through transmission lines and substations to end users. Supply charges reflect the actual cost of purchasing energy plus administrative fees — costs that are particularly significant for for-profit utilities like Delmarva Power.\nThe company's last rate case in 2022 established a multi-year rate plan, with 2025 marking the conclusion of the federally approved three-year distribution rate increases. This regulatory framework has shaped the utility's pricing strategy, though Chizar indicates future rates remain unsettled but trending upward.\nSome customers report receiving conflicting information about the causes of rate increases. \"Delmarva is claiming new regulations put in place by state government officials and the Governor are forcing them to purchase more electricity from out of state,\" one customer said. Another reported receiving notice that their third-party supplier would no longer serve Maryland due to new state regulations.\nCustomer frustrations extend beyond rate increases. Residents report estimated bills not being corrected to reflect actual meter readings, particularly affecting seasonal properties and homes temporarily disconnected from utilities. Some existing customers have received unexpected demands for security deposits ranging from $800 to $845, an issue Chizar was not able to immediately address.\nA lack of knowledgeable help only adds to the frustration felt by a Federalsburg woman who saw her December bill hit $786. Reaching out to customer service and explaining they had recently replaced their home's windows to more energy efficient ones, she was told regarding the rising bill \"I don't know what else to tell you.\" She fears her next bill will only be higher.\nOne former power company worker raised concerns about the lack of real-time usage monitoring for consumers. \"The power company is in the position of only having their side where the consumer can't respond with actual usage,\" he said. \"As consumers, we don't have real-time knowledge of how many amps our appliances are using.\"\nDelmarva Power has expanded its assistance programs in response to mounting customer concerns. The company's new Assistance Finder tool, accessible through customer accounts, helps identify suitable financial assistance and bill management programs. The utility also offers a Time of Use Rate option, allowing customers to opt for lower rates during off-peak hours.\nAdditional assistance options include:\nPayment arrangements with flexible terms.Budget billing to spread costs evenly throughout the year.Energy assistance programs for income-qualified customers.Free home energy assessments.Rebates for energy-efficient equipment upgrades.\n\"We want to be unearthing any stone that might help customers save any energy they can,\" Chizar said. He encourages customers with unusual billing situations to contact Delmarva's customer care team at 800-375-7117.\nThe company recommends several energy-saving measures, including setting thermostats to 68 degrees when health permits, utilizing natural sunlight for heating during the day, and maintaining heating equipment regularly. According to Delmarva Power, lowering the thermostat by just one degree can reduce heating costs by up to 5%.\nCustomers seeking additional information about energy conservation and assistance programs can visit delmarva.com/WaysToSave. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — Brandon Yost did not have plans to open a Subway. He was originally looking to buy a house in St. Michaels when his real estate agent told him the Subway in town was up for sale and suggested he take a look at it.In an attempt to provide affordable and quick meals to the residents of St. Michaels, Yost, a graduate of St. Michaels Middle High School, has taken over ownership of the sandwich shop with the intent to reinvest in his community.\nAccording to Yost, the previous owner was ready to retire and had been operating the store for about five years.\n\"Initially I said, 'No way. This isn't my cup of tea. I'm not going to do it,'\" said Yost, who has a background in commercial insurance brokerage.\nHe changed his mind after sitting in the restaurant and watching the people coming in for a meal.\n\"It was a lot of local people, a lot of high school teachers and things that I hadn't seen in a while, policemen, firemen, just people I really resonate with,\" he said.\nWith new ownership will come changes for this sandwich store, including changes to store hours and days of operation.\nYost said the previous owner would open the store for only a few days out of the week. Yost plans to have the store open seven days, expand the menu and grow the Subway team.\nBruce \"JR\" Burkhardt, a school guidance counselor at St. Michaels Middle High School, said he used to coach Yost when he was at the school. Burkhardt describes Yost as not only a three-sport athlete but also a hardworking and intelligent person.\nBurkhardt said he enjoys seeing graduates of St. Michaels come back as adults and give back to their community, whether it be owning a business, helping with a nonprofit or volunteering in the community.\n\"The thing that makes small towns special is that sense of community and everybody supporting one another and giving back, especially down here in St. Michaels,\" Burkhardt said. \"The community is heavily involved in the school and helping one another, whether it's a family that is in need, or sponsoring the local baseball team, or whatever it is. It's great to see everybody pitch in and help one another.\"\nYost said reinvesting in the people of St. Michaels through affordable meals has been the biggest motivator in taking over ownership, and he hopes he can provide a space for locals to enjoy.\n\"Obviously, I wanted to make money like anybody,\" Yost said. \"You buy business to make money, but at the same time I really wanted to give back to the locals and have a good resource for them to go and eat at an affordable meal.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "State's budget could come at small biz expense\n\n January 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARY D. KANE Maryland Chamber of Commerce | Section: Columns \n \n 683\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Gov. Wes Moore's newly released fiscal year 2026 budget presents a paradox for Maryland's economic future. While the governor rightly prioritizes economic growth and job creation, his proposed tax policies threaten to undermine these objectives.As a business leader deeply invested in Maryland's prosperity, I've watched countless businesses weather economic uncertainties while remaining committed to our state. These community cornerstones — local restaurants, family-owned retail shops and businesses you rely on daily for energy, health care, construction and essential services — form the backbone of Maryland's economy.\nNow, they face a new challenge: a slate of tax proposals that could make it harder for them to survive and provide critical services to every Marylander.\nThe governor's budget proposal includes personal income tax increases, but this isn't just about wealthy individuals paying more. In Maryland, 99.5% of businesses structured as pass-through entities — LLCs, sole proprietorships, partnerships and S-corps — pay taxes at individual tax rates.\nUnder the governor's plan, small businesses could be forced to pay higher tax rates, which will increase the cost of goods and services upon which every Marylander relies. Additionally, when we raise these rates, we're effectively telling a small business owner in Baltimore, a growing HVAC company serving multiple counties or a family restaurant in Annapolis to think twice before expanding.\nThe budget proposal also includes combined reporting — a volatile and complex tax policy that would force businesses operating across state lines to navigate an intricate maze of compliance requirements. This impacts businesses of all sizes — from restaurants to retail shops that cross state lines — and multiple studies suggest the policy could result in the state losing revenue.\nBeyond being an administrative burden, combined reporting discourages investment in Maryland when we most need to attract and retain businesses. Importantly, Maryland already has tools like the 2004 \"add-back\" rule, which, if fully enforced, would achieve similar goals without introducing new burdensome policies.\nSome might argue these measures are necessary for fiscal responsibility. But true fiscal responsibility means creating conditions where businesses grow, generate more revenue and create more jobs — naturally expanding our tax base. The governor's budget gets this partially right. Its provisions for streamlining regulations, improving permitting processes and investing in critical industries like ports, manufacturing and cybersecurity are commendable.\nBut that positive step forward would be undermined by tax policies that discourage growth, investment and economic opportunity.\nAmong the 50 states, Maryland is currently the third most expensive to do business in, ranks 37th for business friendliness and 46th for business tax climate. Our job growth statistics are equally concerning — we rank 49th for overall job growth and 48th for three-year compound growth as of July 2024. Maryland already ranks 44th nationally in new business applications and has experienced the sixth-slowest growth in new business formation since 2019. Finally, we're losing existing residents at an alarming rate, ranking 46th in domestic migration.\nThese are warning signs. Adding new tax burdens would further discourage entrepreneurs from choosing Maryland as their launching pad, disincentivize existing businesses from expanding, and more quickly drive workers to our neighboring states.\nAs other states aggressively compete for business investment and talent, Maryland stands at a crossroads. We can either create an environment that welcomes growth and innovation or sacrifice long-term prosperity for short-term revenue gains.\nThe good news is that this budget proposal is just the beginning of the conversation. As the proposal moves through the legislative process, we have an opportunity to work together — business leaders, lawmakers and the administration — to craft a final budget that truly serves Maryland's future. The path forward requires careful consideration of alternative approaches: creating economic opportunity through growth-oriented policies, simplifying our tax code and empowering small businesses are achievable goals that we should all share.\nMaryland's future prosperity depends on making our state a destination of choice for businesses and families. We can achieve fiscal stability without sacrificing economic growth. But first, we must recognize that squeezing more from our existing businesses will harm Maryland's economy.\nThe stakes are too high to get this wrong. Let's work together to ensure Maryland's budget supports, rather than hinders, the economic growth we all seek. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mid-Shore legislators express concern over tax hikes in governor’s budget proposal\n\n January 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 793\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n With the state facing a significant deficit, some Mid-Shore legislators are raising concerns that the governor's proposed budget may negatively impact local constituents and businesses.In his fiscal year 2026 budget proposal presented Wednesday, Gov. Wes Moore (D) suggested both tax cuts and increases, as well as spending cuts, to tackle the state's looming $3 billion budget gap.\nMoore's proposal lays out two new tax brackets for high-income households: a 6.25% rate for those who make more than $500,000 and a 6.5% rate for those who make more than $1 million.\nMeanwhile, it consolidates the state's bottom four tax brackets and doubles the standard deduction on tax returns, two measures expected to provide tax breaks to Marylanders, Moore says. The governor plans to reduce corporate taxes \"to entice more businesses and drive growth.\"\nBut local legislators aren't fully on board with Moore's plans to offset the deficit. Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) shared his reaction after watching Moore's live press conference on Wednesday.\n\"My initial reaction was a little jaw-dropping,\" Hutchinson said. \"I felt like it was a little bit of smoke and mirrors on the way that he was presenting the budget.\"\nHutchinson says while lower corporate taxes look \"nice on the surface,\" he's most concerned for local small businesses with the new tax brackets.\n\"That's where it's really going to hurt the small business owners because they pass through a lot of their small businesses through their personal income taxes,\" Hutchinson said. \"So it's going to be detrimental, actually, to small businesses in my opinion.\"\nDel. Sheree Sample-Hughes (D-Dorchester, Wicomico) noted Moore's proposal to eliminate the inheritance tax as a positive. However, she's worried some of the spending reductions will burden counties, such as the expectation that counties will supplement proposed state reductions in teacher retirement funding.\nHutchinson and Del. Jeff Ghrist (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) both likened Moore's tax hikes for the wealthy to tax increases seen under former Gov. Martin O'Malley (D).\nSample-Hughes and Ghrist are worried the tax increases will drive Marylanders elsewhere, specifically the \"half-millionaires\" and above.\n\"One of my fears is is that if we continually tax the upper bracket, they're going to … move to Delaware or move to other neighboring states,\" Sample-Hughes said.\n\"The folks who have the money, they reinvest in the economy with their wealth,\" Ghrist said. \" … We're just shooting ourselves in the foot is what we're doing. It's terrible economic policy.\"\nHutchinson is optimistic the tax cuts in the lower brackets may help local residents, but he shares the other legislators' worries about the increases for wealthy residents.\n\"I think a lot of the local residents on the Shore will have a positive effect on the change to the lower tax bracket,\" Hutchinson said. \"But my fear is sometimes we rob Peter to pay Paul. While we'll all stay because we love it and we want to be here, again, those high-income earners have the opportunity to go multiple places when there's a tax increase on their personal income tax.\"\nMOVING FORWARDSince the Democrats have a firm majority in the legislature, some Republicans understand that there's limited ability to push forward their spending and tax policies.\n\"There's really not much we can do. We're outnumbered two to one,\" Ghrist said. \"The only thing we can do is inform the public about what's going on, inform the public about what these impacts are going to be.\"\nGhrist believes it will \"be an ugly session for taxpayers.\"\nHe and Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) say a better way to address the budget gap would be to find savings in government efficiency efforts.\n\"I look for things that are consensus ideas,\" Mautz said. He believes this year's budget will undergo more scrutiny than recent ones and potentially see \"significant changes\" during the legislative session.\nHutchinson says Republicans will be \"very vocal,\" adding that some of his Democratic colleagues have their own concerns about the budget proposal.\n\"What was laid out on Wednesday — I am sure — is not going to be the final version that we see when we move forward in early April,\" Hutchinson said. \"And we will be having a lot of debates over this issue. It is the number one issue.\"\nSample-Hughes said it's important for legislators to comb through ways in which government agency cuts can help reduce the budget gap. She wants to see that diligent work done before counties assume any more of the burden.\nAs for tax increases on Marylanders, Sample-Hughes is hoping that can be avoided given the current economic landscape.\n\"That's not something I'm supportive of because I know that the constituency is already grappling with a lot of financial burdens,\" Sample-Hughes said.\nA final version of the state's 2026 budget must be passed by both chambers of the Maryland legislature before the end of this year's General Assembly in April. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Board of Directors isn't changing much for the year of 2025.\"Because our board (is) so new, our current officers just agreed to stay on for another year if that was acceptable to the board,\" Board President Angie Hengst said in an interview with The Star Democrat Friday.\nHengst will remain president for 2025. She said it feels good to be able to continue to serve in the role.\n\"I feel like I was very new when I became president last year,\" she said. \"So now I feel like, after having another year with the board under my belt, and with our new relationship with the city and the county going forward, I'm feeling very optimistic about this year. And I think we have some really exciting things that are going to be coming soon.\"\nBoard member Mike Frenz will take on the role of vice president. Hengst said she nominated Frenz to the role during the board's meeting on Jan. 15 because he is one of the \"longer-standing\" board members on a board where half of its current members are new.\nThe vice president position was previously filled by Shay Lewis-Sisco, who resigned from the board after being elected to the Cambridge City Council in October.\nFrenz, who is the executive director of the Maryland Stadium Authority, was appointed by the governor to the CWDI board in 2018. He could not be reached immediately for comment.\nThe board will keep Frank Narr as its treasurer. However, instead of Narr being the secretary-treasurer, the role will be split in two and new board member Natalie Chabot will take on the secretary position.\nHengst said her goal as president for 2025 is to increase community engagement.\nThis past week we had a really great kind of open dialogue,\" She said. \"Almost more like Q&A-style, instead of just public comment, with some of the public that was (at the meeting).

The national average is up 4.5 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 1.8 cents per gallon higher than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nJan. 20, 2024: $3.11 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.07 per gallon)Jan. 20, 2023: $3.45 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.40 per gallon)Jan. 20, 2022: $3.26 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.32 per gallon)Jan. 20, 2021: $2.47 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.40 per gallon)Jan. 20, 2020: $2.48 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.54 per gallon)Jan. 20, 2019: $2.24 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.24 per gallon)Jan. 20, 2018: $2.57 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.53 per gallon)Jan. 20, 2017: $2.34 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.31 per gallon)Jan. 20, 2016: $1.88 per gallon (U.S. Average: $1.87 per gallon)Jan. 20, 2015: $2.17 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.04 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.35per gallon, up 25.6 cents per gallon from last week's $3.09per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.20per gallon, up 8.6 cents per gallon from last week's $3.11per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.33per gallon, up 24.8 cents per gallon from last week's $3.08per gallon.\n\"It was only a matter of time before the national average began to rise, with oil prices last week reaching their highest level since July. Diesel prices have also jumped, driven by cold weather that has boosted heating oil demand,\" GasBuddy's De Haan said. \"In addition, with President Trump's inauguration, ... there could be price impacts depending on the executive orders he is preparing to sign. We'll be closely monitoring potential impacts from any orders, while the threat of tariffs and possible retribution from Canada remain top of mind.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Mid-Shore home sales, prices up in 2024 from 2023\n\n January 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MID-SHORE BOARD OF REALTORS | Section: Local News \n \n 598\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Overall, the housing market on the Mid-Shore was solid in 2024, noted Mid-Shore Board of Realtors President Michelle Abplanalp.Nationally, 2024 provided interesting highlights. For example, the share of first-time buyers who are single women rose to 24%, a 5% increase in one year.\nAnother interesting discovery: first-time home buyers' median age is now 38, the oldest recorded in the annual survey. Factors that could account for this include student loans debt, home prices and marrying and having children at a later age. Only 27% of buyers have children under 18 at home.\nAll-cash buyers accounted for 26% of the home transactions in 2024. It is likely that these buyers are those with relatively high incomes, who feel secure in their own personal economic situations.\nNationally, Realtors are seeing more multi-generational homes being purchased. Seventeen percent of buyers purchased multi-generational homes in 2024, the highest rate recorded. This is up from 12% in 2021.\nAffordability is a high priority for 36% of buyers. Affordability is a major constraint for moderate-income buyers. With home prices rising and interest rates projected to remain around 6% or 7% through 2025, many buyers could be priced out.\nTurning to the Eastern Shore and focusing on the five counties of Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's, and Talbot, we see increased home prices, more homes sold in 2024 and homes sold relatively quickly.\nThe average home price increased in four of the five counties.\nCaroline County's average home price in 2024 was $319,165 compared to 314,874 in 2023.Dorchester County's average home price in 2024 was $300,210. This is a 1.46% decrease compared to the $304,646 average price in 2023.Kent County's average home price for 2024 was $443,078, up 10.11% compared to the year-end average price in 2023 of $402,413.Queen Anne's County's average home price in 2024 was $607,558, an 8.23% increase over 2023.Talbot County's 2024 average home price was $856,997 showing an 8.55% increase compared to 2023 of 789,471.\nEven with the low inventory and higher interest rates, there were more homes sold in 2024 in every county. A total of 2,641 homes were sold in the five-county area. This is an increase of 7%, or 175 homes, compared to 2023.\nIn Caroline County, 345 homes sold in 2024, 37 more homes than in 2023.Dorchester County had 544 homes sold in 2024, five more than in 2023.Kent County had 315 homes sold in 2024; seven more than in 2023.Queen Anne's County had 869 homes sold in 2024, 64 more than in 2023.Talbot County had 568 homes sold in 2024, 62 more than in 2023.\nOverall, it took 45 days to sell a home, only six more days on average compared to 2023.\nHomes in 2024 in Caroline County sold on average in 47 days, four days fewer than in 2023.Dorchester County homes took six days longer to sell, or 57 days on market, in 2024 compared to 2023.Kent County homes took 44 days on average to sell, three days longer than in 2023.Queen Anne's County's 2024 homes sold in 36 days, one day longer than in 2023.Talbot County homes sold on average in 41 days in 2024, the same as in 2023.\nAbplanalp noted, looking forward, uncertainty makes it hard to predict where interest rates will end in 2025. Home buyers are unlikely to see any substantial decrease in rates, even if the Federal Reserve does cut rates, she said, but that should not stop buyers because it is still a wonderful time to buy.\nThe Mid-Shore Board of Realtors' mission is to advocate for its members and the public to preserve the right to own, transfer and utilize real property.\nFor more information, visit midshoreboardofrealtors.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "'Heartbeat of Easton Utilities' legacy lives on",
    "date": "2025-01-25",
    "author": "JOHN ENGLEHART",
    "content": "'Heartbeat of Easton Utilities' legacy lives on\n\n January 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JOHN ENGLEHART | Section: Columns \n \n 1208\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On Jan. 13, Vicki Petro retired as vice president of human resources at Easton Utilities after 31 years of dedicated service. To some, this may seem like the closing chapter of just another HR career. But to those of us who had the privilege of calling Vicki a colleague, a mentor or a friend, this marks the end of an extraordinary era in the Mid-Shore community.Vicki began her journey with Easton Utilities on Nov. 2, 1993, as the organization's sole HR professional, reporting to the business manager. Over the past three decades, she has shaped the careers of countless employees, directly overseeing the hiring of 324 individuals during her tenure, guiding many through the retirement process and supporting the training and development of many more.\nShe's ensured payroll ran seamlessly more than 750 times, served as a trusted adviser to two CEOs and been the go-to resource for employees seeking guidance to navigate their careers. She has served as mentor to many at Easton Utilities and in the Mid-Shore community, having a profound impact on them both professionally and personally.\nI first met Vicki in 2021 when I interviewed for a position with another organization. She had been invited to serve on the interview panel to lend her expertise and help them make an informed decision. From the moment she spoke, I was struck by her professionalism, warmth and rare passion for HR — a field where such genuine excitement can sometimes feel scarce.\nI remember thinking, If I ever have the chance to work for her, I'll take it, because there's so much I could learn from someone like her. That opportunity came in 2023, and over the past two years, I've grown immensely—not just as an HR professional, but also as a leader and as a person—thanks to her guidance.\nEaston Utilities, like any organization, can be thought of as a living body. The linemen could be viewed as the muscles, the water/wastewater operators perhaps viewed as the backbone, the customer service representatives perhaps the face, and—if you ask the engineers, they might claim to be the brain. But at its core, Human Resources is the heart. It keeps the organization alive and thriving, circulating energy and support to every part.\nFor 30 years, Vicki was Easton Utilities' heartbeat, sustaining the organization through storms, challenges, and triumphs alike.\nHer impact reaches far beyond Easton Utilities' walls. If a gas technician safely resolved a leak in your home, it's likely Vicki played a role in hiring them. If a Velocity technician helped you as a rural customers get connected to much needed high speed internet, chances are Vicki was there to interview them. When linemen braved ice storms to restore power to your neighborhood, she likely contributed to their onboarding. And when you've interacted with our professional and compassionate customer service staff, you've experienced the result of Vicki's discerning eye for talent.\nIn sum, if you've been impressed with Easton Utilities' service over the past 30 years, it's because Vicki had a hand in it — not only by selecting individuals who embody Easton Utilities core values but also by shaping the training that helped them excel. She has also been a great mentor to others through her Leadership Maryland classmates, impacting professionals around the State of Maryland.\nVicki's influence wasn't confined to hiring or compliance—it was deeply human. She understood that when employees face challenges, they carry those burdens home to their families. Time and again, she offered them support, showing them how to navigate their struggles so they could be present for their loved ones.\nAs her retirement approached, Vicki demonstrated the same grace and foresight that defined her career. This graceful departure reminds me of a lesson from sports. As a Baltimore football fan, I think of the legendary Johnny Unitas. He was the greatest quarterback of all time, but even he struggled to hang up his cleats. In a twist few like to remember, Unitas ended his career not in Baltimore but in a San Diego Chargers uniform, a move that seemed out of place for such an icon. It's a lesson in knowing when it's time to step aside. Vicki, however, has shown impeccable timing. She embraced the evolving needs of the organization, mentored her successors, and made way for the next chapter—all while ensuring Easton Utilities' heart continues to beat strong. Some leaders struggle to step aside, holding onto their roles even as the times and needs of their organizations evolve. But not Vicki. She embraced the opportunity to mentor and prepare the next generation, ensuring Easton Utilities' heart continues to beat strong long after she steps away.\nOne of my favorite movies is The Dark Knight. A memorable quote from that movie is Harvey Dent's reflection on heroes: \"You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\" In my years of observing HR leaders, I've seen this sentiment play out. Many HR Directors depart their roles amid controversy or burnout, others retiring from their organization leaving behind employees that are happy to see them go rather than admiration. But Vicki defied that trend. She is retiring on her own terms, as a universally respected leader—beloved by employees, admired by executives, and deeply respected throughout the mid-shore community.\nAfter Jan. 13, as the days, weeks, months and years go by, Vicki's name will be heard less and less around Talbot County and Easton Utilities. New employees will join, and those who knew her best will retire. The stories of the great things she achieved as the heart of Easton Utilities will fade, as the stories of legends often do. But I can guarantee her name will be spoken one more time, 20 years from now …\nWhen my time comes to retire, and I am the \"old-school\" HR director trying to understand the up-and-coming HR leaders looking to replace me, I'm sure I will observe them make some kind of mistake — fall flat on their face in a way that only experience can teach to avoid. And just like Vicki, I'll be there with some kind of sage advice to help them learn from it. When they ask me, \"Who taught you that?\" my answer will be simple: \"Vicki Petro taught me that.\"\nAnd with that the legend of Vicki Petro will continue.\nNo one asked or paid me to write this. I did so because some contributions deserve recognition, and Vicki's story is one of them. Over the past two years, I've had the honor of working with her and witnessing her remarkable leadership firsthand. Vicki has been an exceptional HR professional, a trusted advisor, a compassionate mentor, and an inspiring leader. She has not only shaped Easton Utilities but has left it stronger and better for the next generation in our mid-shore community.\nFor now, Vicki rides off into the sunset to begin the next chapter of a legendary life — as a grandma spending time with her grandbabies, traveling with her husband to new places across the globe and enjoying the fruits of her labor. And I'm sure in those new adventures, she will be the heartbeat of those moments, just as she has been the heartbeat for so many years at Easton Utilities and the Mid-Shore community.\nEnjoy your grandbabies, Vicki. Thank you for everything. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Reassessments show property values up 22% in Talbot County\n\n January 31, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 423\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Talbot County property values rose at a rate slightly above the statewide average, according to data from the Maryland Department of Reassessments and Taxation.The state's 2025 reassessments show the value of Group 1 residential and commercial properties in Talbot County increased by 22.1% from 2022, the last time they were assessed. Statewide, Group 1 property values increased 20.1% on average.\nEach year, one of three groups is reassessed, determining its property value change from three years ago. Last year, Group 3 properties were reassessed, with their values increasing by 18.4% from the previous assessment.\nHowever, the 20.1% mark statewide is down from 2024's reassessment average in Maryland, which was 23.4%.\nIn 2022, Group 1 property values rose by a higher rate of 6.2% in Talbot County.\n\"It's just where we are,\" said Jim Bent, an Easton-based realtor for Benson & Mangold Real Estate. \"I think we're going to have some kind of a reset in values at some point in the next few years. I don't think it's going to be what we saw in 2007. But different neighborhoods can only go a certain amount.\"\nHe added that \"it's awful hard once you get the price up to get it back down.\" Home values are sharply increasing due to construction costs, among other factors, Bent said.\n\"For someone to come in and purchase a piece of land that has no development on it and start the process with engineers, attorneys, architects, everything else, they've got a significant amount of money invested before they start digging in the ground,\" Bent said.\nProperty taxes will not necessarily increase at the same rate as the value reassessments do, since each year only one of three groups is reassessed.\nTalbot County Finance Director Martha Sparks added that the assessment's impact on property owners is \"more complicated\" due to Talbot County's revenue cap, which limits how much the county can collect from property tax revenue.\nProperty owners can receive credit through the Homestead Tax Credit program if their property is considered their principal residence. Those who received property assessment notices in the mail this month will see their tax credit status.\nLesley Jackson, Talbot County supervisor at the Maryland Department of Reassessments and Taxation, says those who have \"approved\" written in the box under the \"principal residence\" line on the notice are set to receive their tax credit.\nJackson says property owners with a box that reads \"denied\" should contact the department. Those who received notices reading \"Principal Residence: NO\" have not applied, and if it is their primary residence, they can apply online for the tax credit. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "There is nothing certain about Maryland's budget\n\n February 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Columns \n \n 687\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On Jan. 15, Gov. Moore presented his proposed $67.3 billion state budget to the General Assembly.His proposed budget includes the following:Approximately $2 billion in spending cuts.Approximately $1 billion in new revenue from select tax code changes and fee increases.Additional select tax code changes.A state initiative comparable to the new federal Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that will identify $50 million in savings that can be accomplished by implementing greater efficiencies in state government operations and programs.The proposed budget includes the following tax changes:Maintain an income tax rate of 5.75% for those earning over $300,000 annually.Increase an income tax rate to 6.25% for those earning up to $500,000 annually.Increase income tax rates to 6.50% for those earning $1.2 million or more annually.Add a 1% surcharge on capital gains for households earning more than $350,000 annually.A flat 4.7% tax rate for Maryland singles earning less than $100,000 annually.A flat 4.7% tax rate for married Marylanders filing jointly earning less than $150,000 annually.Doubling the standard deduction from the current $2,700 for single taxpayers and $5,450 for head of household, a surviving spouse and taxpayers filing jointly.Double the state take on sports betting from 15% to 30%.Raise the tax on casino table games from 15% to 20%.Increase the tax on recreational cannabis from 9% to 15% (effective in 2028).Eliminate the inheritance tax.Lower the estate tax threshold from $5 million to $2 million (except for agricultural property).A 75-cent fee for retail deliveries by companies with $500,000 or more in annual earnings.Increase the fee for vehicle emission inspections from $14 to $30.Double the late fees for vehicle emission inspections from $15 to $30.Limit the trade-in credit on car sales, which lowers the amount that can be taxed on a car purchase, to sales of no more than $15,000.Phase in higher vehicle registration fees in two years instead of the previously approved three-year schedule.Add a fee for motorists who pay their registration fees annually instead of biennially.\nFor existing or new businesses, Moore proposes to cut the corporate tax rate from 8.25% to 7.99% by the beginning of fiscal 2028.\nThis proposed change anticipates legislative approval of combined reporting for corporations headquartered in Maryland.\nThat is not a given despite the fact that combined reporting has been and is a top priority for progressive members in the General Assembly and progressive advocacy organizations. Preventing combined reporting has been and is a top priority for Maryland businesses and businesses advocacy organizations.\nLast but not least, Moore proposes tapping the state's \"rainy day fund\" for about $500 million, while leaving more than $2 billion in the fund.\nThat is a draw down that maintains the current balance requirements for that fund.\nAll these proposals as well as others will be subject to intense discussions and deliberations between now and April 7. The only certainty is April 7 is the last day for the General Assembly to approve a balanced budget and send it to the governor.\nThere are almost countless \"what if\" scenarios that could occur between now and then.\nI suggest they include:\nWhat if the General Assembly reduces or eliminates the governors' proposed budget cuts?\nWhat if the General Assembly adds or increases the governor's proposed spending levels coupled which requires their approval of a funding source for that new or increased funding?\nWhat if Gov. Moore uses line-item vetoes if either occurs?\nWhat if the General Assembly overrides those vetoes?\nWhat if the proposed tax increases result in \"wealthy\" residents leaving the state like it occurred when roughly 30% of Maryland's millionaires left the state after the income tax rate on more than $1 million of income was increased from 5.5% to 6.25%?\nWhat if low and middle-income taxpayers leave Maryland because of the projected fee increases which will offset any proposed modest income tax revisions?\nWhat if combined reporting is approved and businesses move their headquarters to other states?\nWhat if the $50 million in savings from the initiative to identify and implement greater efficiencies in state government operations come in lower than expected or not at all?\nWhat if, when all is said and done, Wes Moore's actions lead to negative impacts from Maryland voters and the media on his re-election and pursuit of a national office? \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You do not fact check letters to the editor, but someone must if we care about truth. Ms. Wieland's short letter contains false claims.She writes that we on the Eastern Shore need to be alert, so we don't turn into California. That state spends $22,821,903,942 on benefits to \"illegal immigrants.\" She claims California's budget deficit is $76 billion. And she writes regulations are driving insurance companies out of California.\nHer estimate of $22,821,903,942 probably comes from House of Representative Republicans. That group cites the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) as the source of their estimate. FAIR is a right-wing, anti-immigration lobbying group, but that number can't come from them as FAIR rounds off estimates to $100 million. They never get as absurdly specific as the number provided by Ms. Weiland. The estimate by House Republicans and repeated by Ms. Weiland lacks any credibility.\nHer claim that the budget deficit for California is $76 billion is inaccurate. The most reliable estimate is $38 billion, half of what Ms. Weiland claims. Regardless, any current estimate is irrelevant. At the end of California's fiscal year, their deficit must be no larger than $0. State law requires a balanced budget, just like in 48 other states.\nMs. Weiland letter states insurance companies are leaving California due to the state's regulations. Florida, notorious for a lack of building regulations, has a crisis because so many insurance companies are leaving that state. At the very least, this throws doubt on Ms. Weiland's claim.\nMust we in Maryland be terrified of becoming like California, even the false picture of California provided by Ms. Weiland? No. Maryland's financial situation is nothing like California and likely never will be. And insurance companies are not bailing out of Maryland, most likely because we don't have fires like California or hurricanes like Florida.\nMICHAEL DAVIS\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Are Trump's tariffs illegal? Lawsuits expected to challenge constitutional, legal authority\n\n February 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: National \n \n 1512\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n President Donald Trump's new blanket tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China are likely to face legal challenges as groups representing farmers, manufacturers and other businesses worry about their impacts and an international trade war.American consumers also are facing higher prices from the tariffs on top of post-pandemic inflation — with poorer households facing the brunt of the duties' regressive nature.\nTrump imposed 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff against China on Saturday, invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Trump cited the flow of illegal drugs, in particular fentanyl, into the U.S. from Mexico, China and Canada for issuing the aggressive tariff regime.\nThis is the first time a president has utilized the economic powers act to impose tariffs with past uses centered on freezing, restricting or seizing foreign financial assets.\nThat sets up a legal fracas over executive powers and who gets to set tariffs Trump or Congress and how that works.\n\"The Trump tariffs are illegal,\" said Tristan Snell, an attorney and former New York prosecutor who investigated Trump University and is critical of the U.S. president.\n\"He does not have the unilateral authority to amend trade agreements with Canada and Mexico. He needs congressional approval — and he does not have it. The tariffs should be challenged in court — and overruled by Congress. Now,\" Snell said in a statement.\nThe Progressive Policy Institute also argues Trump's tariffs push via the emergency powers law is unconstitutional because Congress has authority over \"taxes, duties, imposts and excises.\"\n\"No single individual, president or not, should have the power to create his or her own tax system out of nothing,\" the institute said, referencing Trump's talk of replacing income taxes with tariff revenue and traditional tariff procedures that include oversight and public comments.\nPeter Harrell, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, expects lawsuits to ask federal courts to weigh whether Trump can use the emergency powers law for tariffs.\nHarrell said the courts could require Trump to try to put the tariffs in place via existing trade laws or via Congress.\nThat \"would be consistent with IEEPA's history and practice,\" Harrell said.\n\"Arguments against IEEPA tariffs are particularly strong with respect to Trump's proposed 'universal tariff,' which courts should scrutinize under the Supreme Court's emerging 'major questions doctrine',\" Harrell writes in an issue brief.\nThe major questions doctrine stems from recent Supreme Court decisions that restrict the executive branch and its agencies from powers not more specifically authorized by Congress.\nWilliam Alan Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said tariff opponents will point to congressional powers and oversight over tariffs via Article 1 Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution: \"Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.\"\nThere also will be arguments that Trump cannot unilaterally change international trade deals involving the U.S. and the three countries.\nIn the other corner, Trump backers will say presidential emergency laws give him executive power to impose the unprecedented tariffs.\nTrump's new tariff regime will increase costs for U.S. households by $830 this year, could cost 344,000 jobs and take a 0.4% bite out of U.S. GDP, according to the conservative Tax Policy Foundation. Prices for food, energy, raw materials, industrial and consumer products are expected to increase if the trade war comes to fruition Tuesday when Trump's tariffs go into place.\nCritics on the left also say tariffs are regressive in nature and will hit poorer and working class households more than the wealthy.\n\"They are regressive because, in their role as a form of sales tax, they tax only goods, and less affluent families spend twice as much of their income on goods … as rich families,' according to an analysis by PPI.\nFINANCIAL HARDSHIPS\nThe American Farm Bureau Federation, a leading agriculture group, is \"concerned\" Trump's universal tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China will \"create financial hardships for U.S. farmers and ranchers who are already operating on very thin or negative margins.\"\nFarm Bureau President Zippy Duvall voiced those concerns in a Jan. 31 letter to Trump, who announced blanket 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports and 10% tariff on goods from China,\n\"Approximately 85% of potash fertilizer is sourced from Canada, along with other fertilizer products and energy supplies. Increases to the cost of these necessary products, with spring planting soon starting across rural America, would be a difficult and untimely burden on American farmers,\" Duvall said in his letter to Trump.\nHe also said \"over twenty percent of U.S. farm income is based on agricultural exports\" with $174.5 billion in 2024.\nCanada, Mexico and China announced retaliatory tariffs against U.S. exports in response to Trump's move.\nOn Monday, Trump and Mexico President Claudia Scheinbaum announced a month delay with the tariffs on Mexico. They said Mexico will send 10,000 troops to the U.S. border. Trump said he spoke with Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Monday morning and had another call scheduled Monday afternoon.\n\"Last year, the U.S. exported over $30 billion in agricultural products to Mexico, $29 billion to Canada and $26 billion to China — our top three markets by value combined for half of total agricultural exports,\" Duvall said, who wants Trump to consider some exemptions to his tariff push.\n\"A targeted approach, rather than a blanket tariff, or exemptions on necessary and critical products like fertilizer and fuel could be ways to minimize negative repercussions,\" he said.\nOther business groups also oppose Trump's tariffs and looming trade war.\n\"Tariffs are not the answer,\" reads a statement from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\"The president is right to focus on major problems like our broken border and the scourge of fentanyl, but the imposition of tariffs under IEEPA is unprecedented, won't solve these problems, and will only raise prices for American families and upend supply chains. The chamber will consult with our members, including main street businesses across the country impacted by this move, to determine next steps to prevent economic harm to Americans,\" U.S. Chamber of Commerce Senior Vice President John Murphy said in a statement. \"We will continue to work with Congress and the administration on solutions to address the fentanyl and border crisis.\"\nUPENDING SUPPLY CHAINS?The National Association of Home Builders and National Association of Manufacturers are also worried about Trump's tariffs.\n\"A 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico threatens to upend the very supply chains that have made U.S. manufacturing more competitive globally. The ripple effects will be severe, particularly for small and medium-sized manufacturers that lack the flexibility and capital to rapidly find alternative suppliers or absorb skyrocketing energy costs. These businesses—employing millions of American workers—will face significant disruptions. Ultimately, manufacturers will bear the brunt of these tariffs, undermining our ability to sell our products at a competitive price and putting American jobs at risk,\" said NAM President Jay Timmons.\nThe auto industry is especially at risk from the tariffs and trade war with supply chains and production and assembly plants cutting across North America.\nNAHB Chairman Carl Harris said Trump's tariffs contradict his executive order telling federal agencies to find ways to lower costs for housing and other items.\n\"More than 70% of the imports of two essential materials that home builders rely on—softwood lumber and gypsum (used for drywall)—come from Canada and Mexico, respectively,\" Harris said.\n\"Tariffs on lumber and other building materials increase the cost of construction and discourage new development, and consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices. NAHB urges the administration to reconsider this action on tariffs and we will continue to work with policymakers to eliminate barriers that make housing more costly and prevent builders from boosting housing production,\" Harris said.\nThe national business groups stopped short of saying they would join lawsuits challenging the legality of the tariffs against the United States' top three trading partners.\nTRUMP: 'SOME PAIN'\nOn Sunday, Trump said there could be some economic \"pain\" from the tariffs and looming trade war but defended his course of action.\nHere is Trump's social media post in response to worries over the tariffs:\n\"The \"Tariff Lobby,\" headed by the Globalist, and always wrong, Wall Street Journal, is working hard to justify Countries like Canada, Mexico, China, and too many others to name, continue the decades long RIPOFF OF AMERICA, both with regard to TRADE, CRIME, AND POISONOUS DRUGS that are allowed to so freely flow into AMERICA. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The USA has major deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes 36 Trillion Dollars, and we're not going to be the \"Stupid Country\" any longer. MAKE YOUR PRODUCT IN THE USA AND THERE ARE NO TARIFFS! Why should the United States lose TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SUBSIDIZING OTHER COUNTRIES, and why should these other countries pay a small fraction of the cost of what USA citizens pay for Drugs and Pharmaceuticals, as an example? THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA! WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!). BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID. WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE — AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Enormous hardship': Trump’s tariffs on Canada threaten ‘crisis’ for community newspapers, small towns\n\n February 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: National \n \n 1321\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping 25% tariffs on Canada could be \"devastating\" to newspapers, especially community publications in small towns.That is according to newspaper groups and publishers reacting to Trump's Feb. 1 announcement of universal 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada and 10% tariffs on Chinese goods.\nNewspapers and other businesses and industries fearing adverse impacts of the universal tariffs could join lawsuits challenging Trump's unprecedented use of International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the duties. Trump is invoking the tariffs in response to the flows of illegal drugs, especially fentanyl, into the U.S.\nIn a Jan. 31 letter to Republican congressional committee chairs, Martha Diaz Aszkenazy, chair of the National Newspaper Association, worries 25% tariffs on Canadian newsprint will create \"enormous hardship\" for newspapers, especially smaller community publications.\nAccording to the News/Media Alliance and Wisconsin Newspapers Association, 80% of newsprint, the paper product used by newspapers and other publications, is produced in Canada.\n\"All tariffs bring some measure of hardship to those affected but a 25% increase in the cost of newsprint will be devastating to America's small newspaper publishers that are already strained by the recent pattern of punitive twice-a-year postage increases and higher printing costs due to a trade action against importers of aluminum printing plates. This action will drive many small publishers serving rural communities out of business and will not serve the purpose of correcting perceived trade imbalances between Canada and the United States,\" said Diaz Aszkenazy, who is publisher of the San Fernando Sun.\nShe said there is not enough U.S. production capacity to fill the void.\nNNA has more than 1,600 members nationwide.\n\"Canadian sourced newsprint has been an essential component in allowing small publishers to stay in business. A 25% spike in costs will merely lead to unaffordable costs to publish as there is not enough domestic supply for our members to turn to,\" she said in the letter to Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee Chairman Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie, R-Kentucky.\nA prolonged trade war and newsprint tariffs could create a dire situation, newspaper groups warn.\n\"Higher prices and limited supplies are creating a crisis for small-town and rural newspapers. This will result in job losses and less access to news coverage. Some community and rural newspapers may have to permanently shut their doors, leaving news deserts. Once a paper shuts down, it does not come back,\" said the News/Media Alliance in an issue brief about the Trump tariffs.\nThe News/Media group has 2,200 members nationwide.\nDiaz Aszkenazy has similar concerns.\n\"Our surveys are indicating that most newspapers are contemplating layoffs, reduced publication days or page sizes, and even the closing of the company entirely. In many small towns, our newspapers are not only the critical link to civic activity but are the most viable means for local business marketing,\" she said in her letter.\n\"Small towns will feel the effects for many years if the tariffs continue because they will lose their local newspapers,\" the NNA letter continues.\nNational and state newspapers groups, including the Wisconsin Newspaper Association, are urging members, readers and local businesses to contact their members of Congress to press Trump to exclude newsprint and other items from his tariffs or to pass legislation restricting the trade war.\nWNA said in an issue alert that Trump's legal authority to impose sweeping tariffs is \"questionable\" and newspapers groups could join litigation to delay or stall their implementation.\nThe White House said in a statement Saturday that Trump is utilizing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which has never been used before to impose tariffs.\nUsing the Economic Powers Act could allow Trump to avoid more lengthy trade regiments or the need for congressional authority to impose the tariffs.\nBut it could also be challenged in court, according to Peter Harrell, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.\nHarrell said expected tariff litigation will ask federal courts to weigh whether Trump can use the emergency powers law for tariffs.\nThe 1977 law has previously been used to seize foreign assets related to wars, human rights abuses and national security concerns. The Biden administration most recently invoked the law to block financing for Israeli settler groups it said was responsible for violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. Trump is reversing that action.\n\"Forcing Trump to rely on trade statutes — or to go to Congress to seek new authorities — would be consistent with IEEPA's history and practice, and with Congress's long-standing practice of delegating trade power to the president only subject to more extensive procedural requirements. Arguments against IEEPA tariffs are particularly strong with respect to Trump's proposed 'universal tariff,' which courts should scrutinize under the Supreme Court's emerging 'major questions doctrine',\" Harrell writes in an issue brief.\nThe major questions doctrine stems from a 2022 Supreme Court decision that restricts the executive branch and its agencies from \"resolving questions of 'vast economic and political significance' without clear statutory authorization,\" according to a 2024 analysis by Samuel Buckleberry Joyce for the Stanford Law School.\nLegal experts said Trump's tariffs will test bounds of presidential powers under the 1977 emergency power law.\n\"The U.S. Constitution plainly grants the power to impose tariffs to Congress, not the president: 'The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, . . . To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations' (Article 1, Section 8). However, Congress has delegated extensive authorities that allow the president to impose tariffs if certain statutory conditions are met,\" said William Alan Reinsch, senior adviser for economics program and Scholl chair in international business for the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nTrump tried to put a 30% tariff specifically on newsprint during his first term. That was blocked by the U.S. International Trade Commission.\nAgriculture, manufacturing, small business and other groups also oppose the Trump tariffs, worrying about higher costs on top of post-pandemic inflation, a trade war with Canada, Mexico and China already announcing retaliatory tariffs and lost jobs.\nOn Monday, Trump and Mexico President Claudia Scheinbaum announced a month delay with the 25% tariffs on Mexico.\nScheinbaum said. Mexico will send 10,000 troops to the U.S. border. Trump said he spoke with Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Monday morning and had another call scheduled Monday afternoon.\nA number of industries and other groups could challenge the Trump tariffs in court.\nThe American Forest & Paper Association (AF&PA), which represents paper mills, is also concerned about the impacts of a tariff and trade war with Canada and Mexico.\n\"The American Forest & Paper Association supports free and fair trade practices, and we rely on Canada and Mexico as key trading partners. In 2024 alone, total two-way trade for pulp and paper products with Canada was over $14 billion and total two-way trade with Mexico was over $5 billion. These tariffs have the potential to seriously disrupt the U.S. forest products industry's complex, cross-border supply chains that employ more than 900,000 people,\" said Heidi Brock, president and CEO of the industry group.\n\"We strongly encourage the Canadian and Mexican governments to quickly come to the negotiating table to address concerns raised by the U.S. Government. It is imperative we return to normal free and fair trade soon to avoid longer term disruption to U.S. pulp, paper and packaging manufacturing operations. We look forward to working with the Administration to provide our industry's perspective and important data to inform these consequential discussions,\" Brock continued.\nOn Sunday, Trump pushed back against criticism of his tariffs, including on Canadian imports.\n\"We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don't need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!,\" Trump said in a social media post. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Family moves into newest Patuxent Habitat for Humanity house\n\n February 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Madison Bateman Special to Southern Maryland News | Section: State News \n \n 700\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Surrounded by friends and family, LaToya Carroll and her 10-year-old daughter Callie, with giant golden scissors, cut the ribbon on their new home in Lexington Park on a recent Saturday.The pair were overjoyed to now be owners of a new home built on Loudon Lane through Patuxent Habitat for Humanity.\nCarroll is a St. Mary's County native, educated in local public schools and has worked in the county her whole life. She said she enjoys her work at a local high school and watching her daughter grow up.\n\"This is so surreal for me,\" she said. \"I'm still waiting for it to sink in later tonight … I'm incredibly grateful.\"\nCarroll will spend this week moving into the home.\nShe said Habitat for Humanity works with the community to be able to help people get into homeownership.\nIn May 2024, the nonprofit hosted a groundbreaking ceremony on the site of their 22nd home build. Over the next eight months, local companies and organizations pulled together to complete the house.\n\"It is a humbling experience to be part of such an amazing organization,\" said Phyllis Trouard, president of Patuxent Habitat for Humanity. \"To watch the Carroll family cut the ribbon on their home was a joyful occasion. … I look forward to our next build and watching another family have the same experience.\"\nW.M. Davis Inc. general contractors worked to complete Carroll's house, which has three bedrooms and one and a half bathrooms. Sponsors included Jerry Lewis Roofing, Barron's Lumber, C & C Plumbing and Septic, KING Electric, B&D Siteworks, Hilltop Signs and Graphics, St. Mary's County commissioners and others.\n\"It is through our corporate sponsors and individual donors that we can build these wonderful homes,\" Trouard said.\nCatherine Shipman, executive director of Patuxent Habitat, explained people can apply to be chosen for this project via the nonprofit's website. The most eligible person is selected by a committee.\nIndividuals are eligible for a Habitat home if their present housing is not adequate and they are unable to obtain adequate housing through other conventional means. Lack of adequate housing may include problems with the present structure; water, electrical or sewage service systems; heating system problems; or failure to meet property maintenance standards.\nAlso taken into consideration are the number, ages and gender of children compared to the number of bedrooms in a family's current home, according to the organization's website.\nA family will be considered if their annual total income is between 30% and 50% of the median income for Calvert and St. Mary's counties.\nA Habitat house costs approximately $150,000 to $190,000 to build. A new Habitat homeowner will only pay what it cost to build the house through a mortgage. The average monthly payment is between $650 and $750, depending on house style, location and length of the mortgage; this includes an escrow payment for taxes, termite bond and insurance, but does not include any utilities.\nHabitat acts as a lender for a 30-year interest-free mortgage. The money that families pay back is channeled into the construction of more Habitat homes for other families.\nThe organization requires that a family puts \"sweat equity\" into the home build and that they earn enough money to pay the mortgage payments. While some Habitat homeowners may receive public assistance, most have jobs.\nHabitat for Humanity works in good faith with people who are at-risk financially, knowing that owning a home is not the answer to every problem, but can be an important step-often the first step-toward breaking the cycle of poverty.\nEvery year, Habitat for Humanity makes it their goal to complete one home build for a local family in need.\n\"We are currently exploring options for buildable land in Calvert County, potentially in the Prince Frederick area,\" Trouard said. \"We are looking for houses in need of repair, donated homes or a vacant lot. We consider purchases as well as receive donations of land/homes. It is common for children to inherit a home from their parents and then find the need to sell or donate the home. We accept these estate homes, remodel or update them, and then place a deserving family in them for a reasonable mortgage. We hope to have a location and timeline by this spring so we may begin the process of our next build.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore joined local, state and national leaders at Tradepoint Atlantic to unveil the design for the new Francis Scott Key Bridge: a 285-foot cable-stayed bridge, which will stand in the same place as the former structure.The new cable-stayed structure will be the first of its kind in the state, with two lanes of traffic in each direction, 10-foot shoulders and enough height to accommodate passing vessels. According to Moore, the rebuilding will employ \"many Marylanders\" and use the \"best materials\" available.\n\"We get cars from Michigan out to market. We bring sugars and spices to Louisiana. We haul farm equipment from the East Coast deep into the farmland. Commerce and trade are the bedrock of our state,\" Moore said.\nDuring the conference, Moore noted the hard work of Marylanders during recovery efforts following the bridge's collapse last year and the ongoing rebuilding process.\nAccording to the governor, initial reports estimated that it would take 11 months to clear the site of the collapse and reopen the Port of Baltimore. The recovery process took only 11 weeks.\nAlongside Moore, Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-Md.) remarked that the process would not have been possible without bipartisan cooperation.\n\"We are able to get here by being able to work together,\" the governor said. \"Without that level of bipartisan support, we wouldn't be here.\"\nMoore has high hopes that the rebuilding will strengthen the Port of Baltimore, turning the city into \"a maritime hub for the East Coast and a maritime hub for the nation.\"\nOther local leaders not in attendance weighed in on the pivotal point in the bridge's reconstruction.\nRep. Johnny Olszewski (D-Md.), who grew up in Dundalk and represented the area as Baltimore County Executive until last month, believes the bridge's reconstruction is a symbol of the area's resilience.\n\"The Key Bridge was symbolic of our community's grit and fortitude, and its collapse was deeply painful and personal for so many of us. We grieved the men who lost their lives in this unimaginable tragedy and suffered the pain of uncertain livelihoods in the weeks that followed,\" Olszewski said. \"Today, we celebrate an important milestone as we do what Baltimore always does in the toughest of times: rebuild bigger, better, stronger.\"\nDespite the solidified design, there are a number of elements still to be determined — namely the bridge's title.\nSince the bridge's collapse, the Caucus of African American Leaders, a coalition of Black activists across the United States, have called for the renaming of the span due to Francis Scott Key's history as an owner of enslaved people. Alternatively, the organization suggested the bridge be renamed after Rep. Parren J. Mitchell, the first Black Marylander elected to the House of Representatives in 1970.\nDuring the current legislative session, the Maryland Senate is set to hear Senate Bill 119, which \"will honor the history and legacy of Maryland\" by retaining Key's name.\nAdditionally, there are ongoing discussions about a memorial for the six men whose lives were lost during the collapse. Although Moore was asked about a potential memorial during the conference, he did not provide a clear answer.\n\"Once the bridge is complete, the memory of those lost on March 26 will not be forgotten,\" Moore said.\nFollowing the ongoing surveying around the site, the next step in the rebuilding process will be the demolition of the remaining pillars on either side of the former bridge. The demolition is anticipated to occur in May.\nConstruction on the new structure will begin \"immediately after,\" according to Moore, and is slated to be completed by 2028. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gov. Moore calls for courage in the face of Trump 'chaos'\n\n February 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Sasha Allen and Jack Bowman Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 685\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Gov. Wes Moore called on lawmakers Wednesday to \"confront crisis with courage\" in the coming months as they try to close their massive budget gap and navigate an unpredictable new administration in the White House.The state is being tested by unprecedented fiscal challenges, Moore said, while also by \"a new administration in Washington that sows uncertainty, confusion and chaos.\"\n\"While there are many opinions about how we ended up in this crisis,\" Moore told lawmakers, \"let's work together to make sure there is never a question about who solved it.\"\nThe remarks came as part of Moore's third State of the State address, where he recounted the successes of the first half of his administration and laid out the challenges to come. Those remarks were immediately met by critique from Republican colleagues dismayed by Moore's budget plan — and by his words about President Donald Trump.\n\"I didn't like the shots that he was taking at the new federal administration who's been in office for a mere two weeks blaming, somehow, our financial crisis on potentially what could come out of the federal government,\" Republican House Whip Jesse Pippy told reporters.\n\"I wish I would have heard some accountability from some of the policies coming out of Annapolis and the policies coming out of the second floor, and we didn't hear any of that,\" Pippy said. \"And that was disappointing.\"\nIt's not yet clear how much Trump policies will trickle down into Maryland and affect the state's budget crisis. Moore is intent on bridging an almost $3 billion budget deficit through program cuts and tax hikes, but the gap could grow much larger if the federal government suddenly decides to drastically cut Medicaid funding to Maryland, for example.\nMoore warned of tough decisions ahead, acknowledging the state's \"distinct reliance\" on D.C. and the need to break it.\nIn his address, Moore made a case to the legislature for tax code reforms and changes to state programs like the Blueprint for Maryland's future, measures that could pull the state out of the current budget crisis.\nThe Blueprint, passed in 2021, called for costly improvements to public education to be phased in over the coming years. As it turns out, those ambitious standards are set to cost the state more than it is taking in in revenue, and Moore urged to lawmakers adjust for that.\n\"Working together to make the Blueprint more successful and sustainable doesn't mean we're backing down,\" Moore said. \"It means we're stepping up.\"\nTo supplement the cuts, Moore would also raise taxes on wealthy Marylanders. Under the current Maryland tax code, someone making $30 million a year is in the same tax bracket as someone making $300,000, Moore said. Moore said the new tax code would require those in the top tax bracket to pay a quarter point more than others.\n\"As someone who will be affected by this change, I am okay with paying a little more if it means we don't have to lay off firefighters or police officers,\" Moore said.\nSenate Budget and Tax Committee Vice Chair and Democrat Jim Rosapepe said these changes would help families in Maryland.\n\"Governor Moore's State of the State showed he's the unTrump,\" said Rosapepe, who serves Prince George's County and Anne Arundel County. \"Wes focused on helping our working families.\"\nBut Republicans are skeptical.\nRepublican Senate Leader Stephen Hershey Jr. said that Moore's focus on eliminating this year's $3 billion dollar deficit is leaving larger issues unaddressed.\n\"I think everybody in Annapolis here is focused on the $3 billion deficit that we have this year,\" said Hershey, who represents Caroline, Cecil, Kent and Queen Anne's Counties. \"But it's important to note, with the full implementation of the Blueprint, we're looking at $5 and $6 billion deficits in the out years. And that's something I think all of us Republicans believe we should be trying to address this year as well.\"\nHouse Republican Leader Jason Buckel said that there was more style than substance in Moore's address.\n\"We're happy to work with him on areas where we can but a lot of that was sort of smoke and mirrors,\" said Buckel, who represents Allegany County. \"A lot of puffery.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "As avian flu spreads, local businesses grapple with increased egg costs\n\n February 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 460\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Steve Mangasarian's is paying double what he used to for wholesale eggs.He says the price has been rising steadily since the pandemic. The recent spread of avian influenza virus, or avian flu, is accelerating that trend.\nMangasarian, the owner and chef of Breakfast in Easton, buys eggs from a vendor that sources locally. Due to the avian flu threatening poultry flocks nationwide, egg shortages are impacting businesses.\n\"The entire supply, nationwide supply, has been curtailed because of this. There's a shortage, even though I'm using local, fresh eggs,\" Mangasarian said. \"Everybody's getting squeezed.\"\nMangasarian, like some other business owners, has been forced to raise prices. At Breakfast in Easton, he's added a 50-cent surcharge to an order of eggs and a 75-cent surcharge to an order of pancakes.\n\"It is my intention to make this temporary,\" signs in the restaurant read.\nAvian flu outbreaks across the nation have afflicted egg supply, with the worst impacts felt in western and midwestern states. But local flocks have been affected as well.\nPer the Maryland Department of Agriculture, five commercial poultry farms on the Eastern Shore have experienced outbreaks, including three just last month. Several other cases were reported in Delaware.\nThe virus can spread easily between flocks, though the risk for bird-to-human transmission is low at present.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average cost for a dozen eggs was $4.15 at the end of 2024. One year earlier, the average cost was $2.51.\nThe current mark is nearing record costs seen during the avian flu outbreak in 2022. And U.S. Department of Agriculture projections predict a 20% increase in egg prices for 2025.\nFor Mangasarian, the sharp rise in egg prices has been a significant challenge. In past years, lower egg wholesale prices helped him \"subsidize\" a low return on bacon. That's flipped, however, as his returns on bacon now make up for tight egg returns.\nAt the Easton Diner on U.S. Route 50, manager Tiff Haddaway says it costs around $1,000 more per week to purchase eggs due to the recent shortage and wholesale prices. As of now, customers aren't seeing an upcharge.\n\"The owner is trying to not pass it onto the customer,\" Haddaway said.\nSteve Andrews, owner of the Bagery, says customers aren't experiencing any increases since the business' local, free-range producer hasn't been hit by the avian flu.\nAndrews, a backyard chicken flock owner for more than 15 years, did note that egg production costs have risen in past years due to increasing feed prices.\n\"We foresee that all producers, which get their day-old chicks from just a handful of operations, will all be increasing their demand to replace the culled flocks,\" Andrews wrote. \"If any of the hatcheries themselves have an outbreak, this could indicate that egg prices have not peaked and could rise even further.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Peters said a customer service person told her to turn off the fans associated with her wood stove as a savings measure.\n\"I don't have fans,\" she said. She never uses the dishwasher, line dries her clothes and her washing machine is a year old.\n\"Last year, my bills were $145 to $245,\" Peters said. Her January bill was $542. \"They tell me the next one is $500.\"\nJoanne Meadows is a single mom in a one-bedroom apartment in Darlington, Md.\n\"My bill basically doubled. It was $150, now it's $300. I can't afford a doubled bill,\" Meadows said. \"I don't know how they expect someone to survive.\"\n\"I feel like we're all being punished,\" Peters said.\nAll across the Delmarva Power coverage area — which includes parts of Delaware and Maryland — customers are sharing their utility bill sticker shock. A Facebook group titled \"Delmarva Power Victims\" has more than 4300 members describing bills that increased exponentially. On that page one member shared a photo of his bill that rose from $653 to $942; with $398 of that billed for delivery.\nCustomers say calls to the utility indicate that the cold temperatures are to blame. Zach Chizar is a spokesman for Delmarva Power.\n\"What we're seeing is that comparably, systems worked 80% more in December than it did in November,\" Chizar said of the marked increases. \"It was significantly colder than during the period last year.\"\n\"The increase is likely due to the cold,\" Chizar said. \"Whatever system you have will have to work harder.\"\nAccording to Chizar, there are a number of factors affecting customer bills including surcharges, fees and delivery costs.\n\"Using a third party provider can change the bill,\" he said.\nTori Leonard, spokeswoman for the Maryland Public Service Commission, said that agency is monitoring the situation.\n\"The Commission is certainly aware that DPL customers are seeing bill increases — our Consumer Affairs Division has noted a big jump in the number of complaints regarding high bills,\" Leonard said Thursday. \"We would point out that recent cold weather is a significant factor — systems have to work increasingly harder the colder it is, which increases usage, particularly in older homes that may not be well-insulated. Almost half of Delmarva's customers use electric heating (adding) that percentage may be even higher in Cecil County.\"\nConstant YieldHowever, the likely culprit is a new method the utility uses to charge its customers.\n\"The rates change on a month by month basis,\" Chizar said. \"The Maryland Public Service Commission updates its rates monthly.\"\nSimilar to Constant Yield, a formula used by the Maryland Department of Assessments and taxation to set the tax rates each year for Cecil County and its eight incorporated municipalities, Delmarva changes its rates each month per the PSC under its \"Bill Stability.\"\n\"It's a checks and balances to ensure we aren't taking in more money than we are obligated,\" he said, but added there's a two-month lag in the billing for that formula. \"If we go over we give a credit.\"\nConstant Yield tells a town or county the tax rate to use to collect the same amount of revenue it collected the current tax year. Each can then decide whether to stay with the constant yield, or raise or lower its tax rate. Bill Stability does the same for the utility.\nChizar said that Bill Stability formula will give customers an average $6 credit on the next billing cycle.\nMany of the bills posted to the Delmarva Power Victims Facebook page point to wording on the bills: \"Reading Unavailable.\" Chizar would not comment on how the meters for each customer are read. He did say that some meters were read incorrectly.\n\"But it's not a widespread or known issue,\" he said. Customers can monitor their usage through an online account with the utility. \"Estimated readings are posted online but the bill is accurate.\"\nAnother post indicates a person whose home is currently unoccupied was billed $500. The post indicates that the thermostat was set in the home just enough to keep pipes from freezing. Delmarva officials said that they would not discuss individual bills with the Cecil Whig.\nChizar said customers should contact Delmarva to get help through budget billing but also to see what can be done to lower the amount of energy being used.\n\"Budget billing is a great way to avoid surprises,\" he said. \"We can also send out high usage alerts by text or email.\"\nEmPOWER is an energy efficiency and green energy initiative from the Maryland General Assembly, which was updated last year and requires utilities to \"add new incentives to help Marylanders make the switch from fossil fuel-powered heating and appliances to efficient, electric alternatives\" according to the EmPOWER website.\nDelmarva Power offers energy audits and other programs that provide energy saving materials such as weather proofing, low flow shower heads and energy efficient light bulbs to help customers lower energy usage.\nSeveral people on the \"Delmarva Power Victims\" Facebook page noted they have solar panels on their homes and still received high bills.\nThere is now a petition being circulated and officials at the local levels, state and federal levels are getting involved.\nMeanwhile, Chizar is urging customers to call them at 1 (800) 375-7117 and make arrangements to set up a payment plan. There is a plan that allows for a 24-month payment plan and non-payment of the February bill will not result in a disconnect. Anyone that goes get disconnected can apply to have the reconnection fees waived.\n\"Our representatives are here to help them understand their bill,\" Chizar said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Start saving early for a comfortable retirement\n\n February 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: GLENN MOLLETTE | Section: Columns \n \n 536\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The plight of the average American is about the same. We would have more if we had saved more.In 2022 the average median retirement savings for American households was $87,000. As of 2024, 25% of all American non retirees have no retirement savings. (Guardian Life Insurance)\nWe seldom see the big picture when we are in our early 20s. There is so much to do such as obtaining a desired degree, marrying, buying a house, starting a family and essentially getting started in life. Very few, if any of us, had a mentor who sat down with us and said, \"Here is where you can be if you start now.\"\nFew 18-year-old high school seniors has anyone writing numbers on the chalkboard for them.\nWhen I say numbers, I'm talking about what you can have in dollars if you start now. No one told me when I was 18 what I could have in 50 years if I could just put $1,000 into the right stock or investment fund during my 18th year. That amount would be about $117,000 at an annual average interest rate of 10 percent.\nOne thousand dollars is not easy for most 18-year-old high school seniors to put their hands on, but it would be so worth it to any and all farther down the road in life. Let's say you put $1,000 in a Roth IRA at 18-22 years of age. These are the years that many Americans are spending $100,000 to $200,000 on college. Year 1 you invest $1,000 with the prospects of its being $117,000 when you are 68. At age 19 you invest $1,000 with the potential of it being $106,000 in 49 years. At age 20 you invest $1,000 with the potential of it being $97,000 in 48 years. At age 21 you invest $1,000 with the potential of it being $88,000. In four years, you have potentially secured your financial future with an anticipated piggy bank loaded with $408,000. The majority of Americans do not have $400,000 to draw from in the retirement years.\nLet's say you keep up a trend of saving money until you are 68 by continuing to save $100 a month. Your projected nest egg could be about $1,270,000. This is because you started young and stayed with a faithful savings plan. Up your monthly savings to $300 per month, and you can anticipate about $3,171,181.28.\nObviously, interest rates will vary, but over the last 50 years the stock market has averaged making 10% per year.\nToo many people wait until their 30s or even 40s to think about retirement. So much more can be accomplished when the process is started early.\nThere is more to life than money. We can't take it with us. We can make the lives of our children and grandchildren a little easier if we can teach them that a little effort started early will bring about a big return down the road.\nCNBC reported President Joe Biden had a net worth of $9 million. If he had only invested $1,000 a month from his generous political earnings during his 50-year career, he would be sitting on $13,966,902.35. Biden will be fine but it goes to show you that all of us could do better. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It is at a gigantic ice target,\" DeKarske said.\nDowntown of Easton will feature icy art from the carvers at Ice Lab and music.\nThere will be ice skating at 11 S. Harrison St., free for all ages, on both days of the festival. Cascading Carlos will be juggling fire in Thompson Park from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. on day one and noon to 4 p.m. on day two.\nOn Saturday, Feb. 15, there will be a children's Ice House at the Waterfowl Building, located at 40 S. Harrison St. The house will feature free craft projects, games, hot chocolate and more.\nThere will also be free live musical performances from Anna Burgess, DJ E Shore, Poppy Blue Eyes and Jayla Elise.\nLocal restaurants and retailers will offer specials, exclusive cocktails, sales and limited-edition treats throughout the weekend, according to Easton EDC.\nFor the stores and restaurants that will offer sales during the event, it will give them a chance to get more customers in for the weekend and spike sales during the quietest economic time of the year.\n\"It could be the release of, people are getting in their spring line,\" DeKarske said. \"Some people are running sales to clear out some of their winter clothing that they have that type of stuff. And then our restaurants have different specials going on with special drinks they created just for the event, or special meals or appetizers, that type of thing.\"\nEaston EDC expects around 8,000 people to come to town for the event this weekend.\n\"The data that we pulled from this, we bring in about 8,000 people over that day and a half,\" DeKarske said. \"So that's a huge impact from a normal day. It also brings in hotel stays. We have a lot of people coming in to stay at the local hotels and spending the weekend. So they're here to visit, not just Easton, but they'll go check out the rest of the county.\"\nEaston EDC believes the event will continue to grow each year because organizers will add something special and different each year.\n\"We just continue to try to add a little something special, different to it each year and increase the format and reach of it,\" DeKarske said. \"Making sure that we're reaching all the outer points of our Main Street district and our arts and entertainment district.\"\nFor more information on the event head to discovereaston.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Its marketplace, The Market at Dover Station, brought together many local vendors and Easton community members Thursday for a ribbon-cutting ceremony.\nSo far, more than 100 artists, artisans and vendors are involved with The Market at Dover Station. It's become a destination for goods, services and antiques.\nKeri Topjian, who manages the market, said the feedback from the Easton community has been \"incredibly positive.\"\n\"I have people walk in that cry,\" Topjian said. \"They either cry, they get the chills or they start pinching themselves and dancing.\"\nDover Station sits on a Dover Road property that was formerly Easton Wholesale Grocery, built in 1912. It was recently a roofing supply center and fell vacant before Sevan Topjian began the revitalization process.\nSitting along the Rails to Trails and in an accessible area of town, the property, he felt, presented the perfect opportunity for a central hub tailored toward Easton residents and visitors alike.\n\"It is such an honor to work on this beautiful building,\" he wrote. \"We really wanted to showcase the incredible craftmanship of previous generations and to create a retail destination in town that features its original charm.\"\nKeri Topjian says anchor vendors such as The Zebra Gallery and Savington & Hill Floral Co., among others, have helped kickstart the marketplace as a local shopping destination.\nSpeaking to a large crowd Thursday, Sevan Topjian encouraged the community to come up with creative, interactive ideas for events and collaborations at the marketplace.\nAlready, the market is bringing businesses and people together. Keri Topjian said it's reminded some people of European markets and others remark that \"'this is what Easton needs.'\"\n\"There's a crazy amount of connections that happen here,\" she said. \"There's a lot of cross-collaboration among artists and artisans. There's just a lot of positive energy in the building.\"\nThe Market at Dover Station is open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from Noon to 4 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Attorney general's housing lawsuit will backfire\n\n February 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RAJSHREE AGARWAL | Section: Columns \n \n 709\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It's no secret that, to quote an early internet meme, \"the rent is too damn high.\" Maryland ranks as the sixth-most expensive state in the country, with a median monthly rent of $2,277.In such cases, it is important that our political and legal leaders focus not on finding a scapegoat but on actually fixing the problem.\nOn Jan. 15, Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown filed a lawsuit against a property management software and analytics company that Maryland property owners use to, among other things, help determine the value of their rental units.\nHis suit has faced significant criticism from a broad coalition of Maryland residents, including economists, housing experts and civil rights advocacy groups. And for good reason.\nSoftware doesn't drive up rents. It is merely a tool to analyze the supply and demand in local housing markets and make recommendations based on that analysis.\nBlaming software when rents rise is akin to blaming your local meteorologist every time it snows.\nBrown's lawsuit ignores fundamental principles from Econ 101 and the importance of \"information diffusion\" for markets to operate efficiency, when everybody has all the relevant facts.\nImagine a man is having a yard sale. He finds an old baseball in the attic with a signature that reads \"Cal Ripken Jr.\" Who's that? He doesn't know. Probably just some neighborhood kid. $1 seems like a good price. And sure enough, it sells almost immediately.\nOr recall the Seinfeld episode in which George Costanza overpays for a car because the dealer tells him its previous owner was Jon Voight. George assumes he means the Hollywood star, but a quick glance at the old registration reveals that the car actually belonged to a dentist named John Voight.\nIn both cases, the lack of relevant information led to distorted prices.\nThe best way to avoid that is to make sure all market participants know what they're buying or selling and how much other people are willing to pay for it. When it's harder to access that information, it forces buyers and sellers alike to rely on guesswork. You might come out ahead in a particular transaction (like George's car dealer or the guy who bought the baseball), but on a larger scale and a longer timeline, inefficiency in markets leads to the misallocation of resources. And that leaves everyone worse off.\nThis principle seems obvious, but seems to be missed by Brown, and also by the U.S. Department of Justice, and several attorney generals in other states who initiated lawsuits since last August against the same property management software company and expanded it to include rental management organizations for collusion and price gouging.\nIt's true that rental managers who use the software often end up charging similar rents for similar units. But that is because the software is providing a view into the underlying factors that determine rent.\nThis is similar to two people standing 10 feet apart from the person holding up a sign, and giving the same answers on what they read. It is not an evil conspiracy but equal access to the relevant information. The lawsuit's solution is akin to gouging their eyes out.\nThese reckless lawsuits don't just hurt the property management software and the rental management organizations by taking up their valuable time and energy. They hurt renters too.\nDiffusion of relevant information diffusion doesn't only make prices higher — it makes prices more responsive. If other rental managers are overcharging, it creates a lucrative opportunity to undercut them. And a good software algorithm would advise just that. In fact, research suggests that landlords who use pricing software are more likely to lower rents as market conditions improve.\nBrown accuses the software of \"making it hard for Maryland renters to put a roof over their heads.\" But the algorithms are not the enemy. If the goal is lower housing costs, the solution is to increase supply by building more housing.\nGovernment leaders may want to consider loosening zoning laws, repealing rent control ordinances (which discourage new construction in key markets like Montgomery County), and streamlining the permitting process. These common-sense solutions will address the root causes–the software is just a mirror held up to the broken housing market.\nConcealing the evidence rather than addressing the problem is like a mechanic who turns off your check engine light without bothering to fix your car. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The email stated that the new restaurant will replace the establishment's current Easton location on 8192 Ocean Gateway, which is between Jiffy Lube and Walgreens.\nThe new restaurant is currently under construction. It will be located at 8518 Ocean Gateway, which is just north of Royal Farms.\nEaston Town Planner Lynn Thomas said the new Burger King received site plan approval from the Easton Planning Commission and should offer an improved design.\nIn August 2021, the project received subdivision approval from the Planning Commission. The Commission voted to approve the restaurant's site plan, architecture and parking waiver request during a meeting the following month. According to meeting minutes from the September 2021 meeting, architect Robert Zappulla said plans for the new restaurant's look took inspiration from Easton's downtown. He said they wanted to make it look like a Burger King was placed in an existing building in Easton.\nThomas said he does not know what Burger King's plans for the location on 8192 Ocean Gateway are. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moore recommends raising the tax rate for families earning $1 million or more and lowering the estate tax threshold from $5 million to $2 million. This seems to be a short-sighted punitive act against Marylanders who have worked hard, sacrificed much, and already pay more than their \" fair share\" of state tax dollars.In addition lowering the estate tax threshold will lead to a new group of thousands of taxpaying citizens exiting the state in an effort to preserve some inheritance for their families and contributions to their favorite charities.The result of this forced diaspora will only increase the tax burden on those left behind.\nLYNN BAKER\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And he buys lots of cases.\n\"We get 150 eggs in a case,\" Rodgers said.\nHe said last year a case cost $60.\n\"This year, they are now $127 per case,\" Rodgers said.\nThat doubling of prices added an additional $1,300 in egg costs to the Montana restaurant's narrow weekly bottom line.\n\"We have pretty narrow margins. That is rough,\" Rodgers said.\nIn response, the Bozeman eatery has added a 95-cent extra charge on dishes with eggs.\nOther restaurants have raised prices because of higher eggs prices. Earlier this month, the Waffle House breakfast chain initiated a 50-cents-per-egg surcharge on its dishes.\nIn Cheyenne, Wyoming, Mike Moriarty owns the Epic Egg restaurant. He's feeling the pain.\n\"Our egg costs have risen over 200% since February 2024,\" said Moriarty, who also has Epic Egg locations in Colorado.\nThe eatery has put a temporary 8% extra charge on egg dishes.\n\"At this time, we have implemented a temporary surcharge on egg entrees to help offset excessive egg costs instead of updating and reprinting menus,\" he said.\nSTICKER SHOCKEgg prices have almost doubled since January 2024, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.\nThey reported the average price for a dozen eggs as $4.95 in January. That is up $2.52 in January 2024.\nBut consumers across the U.S. are seeing egg prices higher than the $4.95 average. Some stores are running low on less-expensive eggs, leaving shoppers with prices more in the $6 and $7 per dozen range.\nA persistent and impactful bird flu outbreak that started in 2022 has resulted in close to 160 million birds culled, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nThere were more than 308 million egg-laying hens in the U.S. in 2022, according to the Egg Producers Council. In 2023, there were 9.4 billion broiler chickens and 218 million turkeys processed nationally, according to USDA.\nDan Karney, an economics professor with Ohio University, said egg prices could continue to rise this year with the continued impacts of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).\n\"The USDA's prediction is that egg prices will increase by 20.3% during 2025, and egg price increases could get as high as 45.3% within the year,\" Karney said.\nExpensive eggs are part of hotter-than-expected inflation confronting President Donald Trump, who promised to lower prices during the 2024 presidential campaign.\nJanuary inflation figures show high prices are still a challenge, with consumer prices 3% higher and wholesale prices 3.5% higher than a year ago. Both were higher than expected by economists.\nTrump has also acknowledged his push for tariffs, including 25% levies on aluminum and steel, could raise prices.\nOverall, U.S. prices are up 24% from the end of 2019, before the COVID pandemic's resets and ensuing inflation, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThat makes it tough for restaurant owners to raise prices on customers, Rodgers said.\n\"I don't want to put more on the customers than I have to,\" he said.\nKarney said market conditions drive egg prices, and that the Trump administration can look at policies and monitoring of farms to help cut into outbreaks.\nBut Trump's and Elon Musk's austerity and expected GOP deregulation pushes might not lend themselves to more government oversight of farms, critics of the administration contend.\n\"Action on bird flu will require fully staffed, fully funded federal agencies, with a broad and urgent mandate to increase on-farm testing and PPE (personal protective equipment), as well as vaccine development and distribution,\" said Rebecca Wolf, senior food policy analyst for Food & Water Watch.\nThe progressive group worries about job cuts and other rollbacks at the USDA and other agencies, as well as the further proliferation of large factory farms.\n'HUGE NUMBERS'Animal welfare activists are concerned that large-scale poultry farms help proliferate the bird flu outbreaks with their scale and conditions.\nThere have been bird flu outbreaks and mass cullings at large U.S. farms with hundreds of thousands of birds, as well as ones involving 2.6 million, 1.8 million and 1.4 million chickens, according to the USDA.\n\"You are dealing with a huge number of animals,\" said Zach Strong, director and senior attorney for Animal Welfare Institute's farmed animal program.\nStrong said America's larger \"factory farms\" can potentially be breeding grounds and more at risk for the avian flu \"largely because of the higher number of animals in confined settings.\"\nAWI and other animal welfare advocates also want more attention paid to how millions of chickens and turkeys are being culled.\nStrong said one preferred method entails shutting down and sealing ventilation and air systems inside large hen houses until the birds die from overheating.\nThe ventilation shutdown process can sometimes take hours.\nThat has resulted in some farms completely sealing ventilation systems and using heaters to turn up the hen house temperatures to 120 to 130 degrees to cull the poultry.\n\"It's horrific,\" said Amber Canavan, vegan campaign project manager for People for Ethical Treatment of Animals.\nShe worries about large farms fostering the outbreak with their large capacities and conditions.\n\"These are absolute breeding grounds for disease,\" said Canavan, hoping that more Americans look at vegan food options, including for eggs and protein.\nThe U.S. produces more than 90 billion eggs annually, with Americans eating more than 280 eggs (more than 23 dozen) annually per capita, according to the Egg Producers Council and Statista.com.\nStrong said some farms are using nitrogen foam to cull chickens, which works faster and can be less painful.\nHe noted the poultry farmers have been financially reimbursed for chickens and turkey culled.\nAn analysis by Sentient Policy in January found poultry and egg farmers, including some large agri-businesses, have received $1.46 billion in avian flu reimbursements from the U.S. government.\n'A BIG PROBLEM'Austin Spies, who has a farm with 1,000 egg-laying hens in Preston, Maryland, said his family's operation has not had any bird flu outbreaks or cullings.\nSpies said he and his brother shift their chicken flock's pasture around every couple of days (at most) to help their health.\n\"They're not over top of their manure. That can be a big problem,\" he said.\nSpies said the rotational grazing entails temporary fencing and moving the birds.\n\"I think it's becoming more popular,\" he said.\nSome farmers using rotational and more traditional, smaller farming models are using guard dogs to protect against foxes and other predators.\nBack in Montana, Rodgers said he also has some experience with poultry and egg farming. He said the challenge to the rotational model is how to do something like that in large-scale farms.\nMoriarty said farming rules in states such as Colorado are not helping prices or the replenishment of flocks.\n\"In addition to the bird flu issues, Colorado has mandated 100% cage-free eggs, which has decreased egg supply (and is) driving prices up,\" he said.\nSpies said he and other farmers continue to navigate post-pandemic inflation, including for feed.\nHe said the price of chicks has increased, with other farmers looking to replenish flocks and increased interest in backyard farms.\n\"I heard it's doubled,\" the Maryland farmer said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "State should hit brakes on mileage user fees\n\n February 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 851\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Since the Maryland General Assembly convened for a 90-day session last month, the state budget has been the focus of intense attention, an intense focus that generally occurs later in the session.Projected state budget deficits have driven early debates on spending cuts, tax increases, personal income and business tax adjustments, fee increases and \"rainy day\" fund transfers.\nGiven the challenges in reaching consensus on the governor's proposed $67.3 billion budget, and majorities in the House of Delegates and the Senate, these debates have been and will continue to encounter unexpected twists and turns.\nLast week, Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson speaking about a new challenge said lawmakers will likely have to look for \"several hundred million more dollars\" in additional cuts or taxes to cover anticipated decreases in federal funds coming to Maryland.\nDespite these challenges, a balanced budget as mandated by the state constitution will most likely be approved by the General Assembly and sent to the governor for his approval just before or at midnight when the General Assembly adjourns on April 7.\nIf that does not happen, the governor will need to call for a special session for a budget approval for the first time since 2012.\nAnother state budget issue that will be challenging but which has not yet received much attention is long-term funding for the state's $21.2 billion six-year transportation trust fund.\nThis fund provides capital investment funding for the Maryland Aviation Administration, Maryland Port Administration, Maryland Transit Administration, Motor Vehicle Administration, State Highway Administration and The Secretary's Office, as well as Maryland's investment in the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.\nCurrently, almost a third of the transportation trust fund's annual revenue comes from a 46.1-cent per gallon gas tax, a tax that is automatically adjusted based on the rate of inflation.\nThere are increasing concerns that even with future annual automatic gas tax rate increases, it is not a long-term reliable revenue source for the transportation trust fund.\nThere are three driving trends leading to the gas tax reliability concerns: less gas consumption due to improved fuel efficiency of new gas-powered vehicles, increasing use of electric and hybrid vehicles, and less driving by those working from home who seldom or never drive to or from work.\nThe Eastern Transportation Coalition (ETC), a partnership of 19states and the District of Columbia focused on connecting public agencies across modes of travel to increase safety and efficiency. is proposing mileage-based user fee.\nETC has already done a four-month user fee demonstration pilot in Maryland with voluntary participation of more than 170 drivers.\nIn their analysis of the Maryland pilot results, the ETC concludes, \"in general,\" drivers would have paid the same amount with a milage-based user fee as they would have with the gas tax.\nThey do not elaborate on how they define \"in general.\"\nThe response to the ETC proposal from the Maryland Department of Transportation is \"MDOT continues to partner with the Eastern Transportation Coalition on the work that the coalition is doing to learn more about the feasibility of MBUF as a sustainable transportation funding option for the future, but has no next steps planned at this time.\"\nI suggest the transportation department's non-committal for next steps at this time is very appropriate.\nThere are a wide range of unanswered questions on the ETC demonstration pilot results specifically and the MBUF concept in general, that need to be addressed before user fees are given serious consideration as an alternative to a gas tax.\nHow reliable are ETC conclusions that mileage-based user fees and gas tax driving costs are close to equal?\nAre those conclusions applicable statewide in Maryland, especially on the Eastern Shore where long commutes to Annapolis, Washington and Baltimore are common?\nIf the goal is increasing revenue for the transportation trust fund, why replace one revenue source for another with no net gain on revenue?\nWill 170 drivers reporting positive pilot demonstration with a user fee experience from voluntary driver surveys generate enough political support for legislative approval of a statewide user fee when there are over four million licensed drivers in Maryland?\nWhat are the projected long-term trends on sales of gas efficient vehicles?\nWhat are the projected long-term trends on sales of all electric vehicles?\nWhat are the projected long-term trends on sales of hybrid vehicles?\nWhat are the projected long-term trends on work from home workers?\nComplicating matters on this issue is another gas tax related proposal reducing the mass transit operating expense subsidies paid from the state transportation trust fund.\nUnder current law, 50% of the transportation trust fund goes to pay those subsidies since fares cover less than 10% of the total operating costs of mass transit systems.\nThe question is: will the General Assembly and governor approve a new mandate that at least 35% of the operating costs of a mass transit system must be covered by fare revenues, and just as with the gas tax, fares must be adjusted regularly based on the rate of inflation.\nUntil all of the above questions are answered, going slow on any replacement of the current gas tax system with a mileage-based user fee system is necessary, prudent and realistic. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The lowest price in the state yesterday was $2.77 per gallon while the highest was $3.85 per gallon, a difference of $1.08 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 2.2 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.11 per gallon Monday. The national average is unchanged from a month ago and stands 16.5 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nFebruary 17, 2024: $3.38per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.28per gallon)February 17, 2023: $3.29per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.38per gallon)February 17, 2022: $3.55per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.51per gallon)February 17, 2021: $2.60per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.57per gallon)February 17, 2020: $2.37per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.44per gallon)February 17, 2019: $2.28per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.31per gallon)February 17, 2018: $2.53per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.52per gallon)February 17, 2017: $2.28per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.28per gallon)February 17, 2016: $1.74per gallon (U.S. Average: $1.71per gallon)February 17, 2015: $2.27per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.26per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.04 per gallon, down 12.3 cents per gallon from last week's $3.16 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.24 per gallon, up 4.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.20 per gallon.Hagerstown: 3.26 per gallon, up 0.9 cents per gallon from last week's $3.25 per gallon.\n\"The national average has inched higher, driven primarily by sharp gas price increases on the West Coast, where refinery maintenance and outages have created a ripple effect in neighboring states, pushing prices higher in many communities,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"Meanwhile, oil prices remain subdued in the low $70s as President Trump works on a potential peace deal between Russia and Ukraine— an event that, if realized, could have significant implications for oil markets in the months ahead.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Egg prices hit record highs and are expected go higher, straining consumers, restaurants\n\n February 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: News \n \n 1168\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Nick Rodgers knows the pain of record-high egg prices as much as anyone.Rodgers is co-owner of Main Street Overeasy, a popular breakfast and lunch restaurant in Bozeman, Mont.\nRodgers said he buys eggs by the case. And he buys lots of cases.\n\"We get 150 eggs in a case,\" Rodgers said.\nHe said last year a case cost $60.\n\"This year, they are now $127 per case,\" Rodgers said.\nThat doubling of prices added an additional $1,300 in egg costs to the Montana restaurant's narrow weekly bottom line.\n\"We have pretty narrow margins. That is rough,\" Rodgers said.\nIn response, the Bozeman eatery has added a 95-cent extra charge on dishes with eggs.\nOther restaurants have also raised prices because of higher eggs prices. Earlier this month, the Waffle House breakfast chain initiated a 50-cents-per-egg surcharge on its dishes.\nIn Cheyenne, Wyoming, Mike Moriarty owns the Epic Egg restaurant. He's also feeling the pain.\n\"Our egg costs have risen over 200% since February 2024,\" said Moriarty, who also has Epic Egg locations in Colorado.\nThe eatery has put a temporary 8% extra charge on egg dishes.\n\"At this time, we have implemented a temporary surcharge on egg entrees to help offset excessive egg costs instead of updating and reprinting menus,\" he said.\nSTICKER SHOCKEgg prices have almost doubled since January 2024, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.\nThey reported the average price for a dozen eggs as $4.95 in January. That is up $2.52 in January 2024.\nBut consumers across the U.S. are seeing egg prices higher than the $4.95 average. Some stores are running low on less-expensive eggs, leaving shoppers with prices more in the $6 and $7 per dozen range.\nA persistent and impactful bird flu outbreak that started in 2022 has resulted in close to 160 million birds culled, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nThere were more than 308 million egg-laying hens in the U.S. in 2022, according to the Egg Producers Council. In 2023, there were 9.4 billion broiler chickens and 218 million turkeys processed nationally, according to USDA.\nDan Karney, an economics professor with Ohio University, said egg prices could continue to rise this year with the continued impacts of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).\n\"The USDA's prediction is that egg prices will increase by 20.3% during 2025, and egg price increases could get as high as 45.3% within the year,\" Karney said.\nExpensive eggs are part of hotter-than-expected inflation confronting President Donald Trump, who promised to lower prices during the 2024 presidential campaign.\nJanuary inflation figures show high prices are still a challenge, with consumer prices 3% higher and wholesale prices 3.5% higher than a year ago. Both were higher than expected by economists.\nTrump has also acknowledged his push for tariffs, including 25% levies on aluminum and steel, could raise prices.\nOverall, U.S. prices are up 24% from the end of 2019, before the COVID pandemic's resets and ensuing inflation, according to BLS.\nThat makes it tough for restaurant owners to raise prices on customers, Rodgers said. \"I don't want to put more on the customers than I have to,\" he said.\nKarney said market conditions drive egg prices, and that the Trump administration can look at policies and monitoring of farms to help cut into outbreaks.\nBut Trump's and Elon Musk's austerity and expected GOP deregulation pushes might not lend themselves to more government oversight of farms, critics of the administration contend.\n\"Action on bird flu will require fully staffed, fully funded federal agencies, with a broad and urgent mandate to increase on-farm testing and PPE (personal protective equipment), as well as vaccine development and distribution,\" said Rebecca Wolf, senior food policy analyst for Food & Water Watch.\nThe progressive group worries about job cuts and other rollbacks at the USDA and other agencies, as well as the further proliferation of large factory farms.\n'HUGE NUMBERS'Animal welfare activists are concerned that large-scale poultry farms help proliferate the bird flu outbreaks with their scale and conditions.\nThere have been bird flu outbreaks and mass cullings at large U.S. farms with hundreds of thousands of birds, as well as ones involving 2.6 million, 1.8 million and 1.4 million chickens, according to the USDA.\n\"You are dealing with a huge number of animals,\" said Zack Strong, director and senior attorney for Animal Welfare Institute's farmed animal program.\nStrong said America's larger \"factory farms\" can potentially be breeding grounds and more at risk for the avian flu \"largely because of the higher number of animals in confined settings.\"\nAWI and other animal welfare advocates also want more attention paid to how millions of chickens and turkeys are being culled.\nStrong said one preferred method entails shutting down and sealing ventilation and air systems inside large hen houses until the birds die from overheating.\nThe ventilation shutdown (VSD) process can sometimes take hours.\nThat has resulted in some farms completely sealing up ventilation systems and using heaters to turn up the hen house temperatures to 120 to 130 degrees to cull the poultry.\n\"It's horrific,\" said Amber Canavan, vegan campaign project manager for People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).\nShe also worries about large farms fostering the outbreak with their large capacities and conditions.\n\"These are absolute breeding grounds for disease,\" said Canavan, hoping that more Americans look at vegan food options, including for eggs and protein.\nThe U.S. produces more than 90 billion eggs annually, with Americans eating more than 280 eggs (more than 23 dozen) annually per capita, according to the Egg Producers Council and Statista.com.\nStrong said some farms are using nitrogen foam to cull chickens, which works faster and can be less painful.\nHe also noted the poultry farmers have been financially reimbursed for chickens and turkey culled.\nAn analysis by Sentient Policy in January found poultry and egg farmers, including some large agri-businesses, have received $1.46 billion in avian flu reimbursements from the U.S. government.\n'A BIG PROBLEM'Austin Spies, who has a farm with 1,000 egg-laying hens in Preston, Maryland, said his family's operation has not had any bird flu outbreaks or cullings.\nSpies said he and his brother shift their chicken flock's pasture around every couple of days (at most) to help their health.\n\"They're not over top of their manure. That can be a big problem,\" he said.\nSpies said the rotational grazing entails temporary fencing and moving the birds.\n\"I think it's becoming more popular,\" he said.\nSome farmers using rotational and more traditional, smaller farming models are also using guard dogs to protect against foxes and other predators.\nBack in Montana, Rodgers said he also has some experience with poultry and egg farming. He said the challenge to the rotational model is how to do something like that in large-scale farms.\nMoriarty said farming rules in states such as Colorado are not helping prices or the replenishment of flocks.\n\"In addition to the bird flu issues, Colorado has mandated 100% cage-free eggs, which has decreased egg supply (and is) driving prices up,\" he said.\nSpies said he and other farmers continue to navigate post-pandemic inflation, including for feed.\nHe also said the price of chicks has increased, with other farmers looking to replenish flocks and increased interest in backyard farms.\n\"I heard it's doubled,\" the Maryland farmer said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moore's recent State of the State address painted a rosy picture of Maryland's future, but as your state senator, I need to be straight with you about where we really stand.Maryland currently ranks 43rd in economic outlook and faces a staggering $3 billion deficit that could balloon to $7 billion by 2030. This crisis wasn't created by Gov. Hogan or the Trump administration — it's the predictable result of expensive, unfunded policies and overregulation pushed through by the Democratic supermajority in Annapolis.\nThe most glaring omission from the governor's hourlong speech? The crushing cost of living hitting Eastern Shore families right now, especially those sky-high utility bills. His solution is to raise taxes on businesses and high earners, but we all know those costs always find their way down to workers, consumers, and our local businesses.\nLet's break down what's really happening in Annapolis:\nInstead of cutting wasteful programs, the governor wants to raise taxes and increase spending. Maryland already has one of the worst tax burdens in the country. His budget talks about job creation but ignores how businesses keep fleeing to states with lower taxes and fewer regulations.\nThe governor doubled down on the Blueprint for Maryland's Future — a massive unfunded mandate our counties and state can't afford. His proposed $1.6 billion in savings falls woefully short when we're facing a $4 billion annual shortfall to implement it.\nRather than working to control costs, the state has unleashed almost universal increases for licenses and other fees, accompanied by aggressive property tax assessment increases. Aspirational environmental mandates are being reenforced rather than reexamined, while they continue to drive costs. This includes their enormous impact on agriculture in comparison to the meager and in many instances, unmeasurable benefits. Meanwhile, the economy on the Chesapeake Bay has been strangled by poor management strategies that range across the board from the blue crab fishery to migratory waterfowl.\nHere are a couple immediate actions to cut costs: eliminate thousands of funded, vacant positions; repeal costly mandates in the Blueprint that have not been implemented; cut wasteful spending like the Red Line Study and mass transit; and stop the new $2 billion annual payroll tax for paid family leave. Finally, there must be some incentive for agencies to save money rather than exhaust budgets to ensure they are funded in the following year.\nMeanwhile, crime is a very real problem in Maryland and while ending recidivism is essential, the lack of attention and urgency over repeat offenders is alarming. The Eastern Shore way has always been practical and commonsense, there are options that support economic growth, environmental and educational improvement, and promote public safety without breaking the bank. That's what we should be supporting — not costly mandates from Annapolis. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

While some areas are seeing increases, others are experiencing stability or even slight declines, as the bulk of the seasonal transition has yet to significantly impact gasoline prices — certainly good news for motorists,\" said . \"Oil prices have remained steady in the low $70s, but we continue to monitor key developments, including ongoing talks between the U.S., Russia and Ukraine on a potential agreement.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Delmarva Power customers attend event seeking answers for high bills\n\n February 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANDREA GRABENSTEIN agrabenstein@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 576\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n STEVENSVILLE — Filing into the Kent Island Library meeting hall, disgruntled, frustrated and confused power customers sought information on rising bills during a public meeting held by Delmarva Power Tuesday.In light of recent electric bills increases, the open house gave customers the opportunity to discuss with one-on-one consultation forums about accounts, as well as payment plans, budget billing and energy efficiency programs, according to Amber Burruezo, regional communications manager for the power company.\n\"We want to be transparent and communicate with customers,\" Burruezo said.\nDelmarva Power customers across the Eastern Shore are reporting dramatic increases in their utility bills, with some seeing their charges double or triple despite the company's October prediction of an estimated 3% rate hike.\nDelmarva Power, a subsidiary of Illinois-based Exelon Corporation, provides electric service to 208,000 Maryland customers.\nAt the event energy engineer Dave Tancredi, presented resources and assessments on energy usage savings. He sais little things can add up to impact increases in electricity, including a simple hot water leak.\nThe 2024-2025 season has also seen colder temperatures than in prior years, which Tancredi said could impact power bills. The number one issue the engineers see at customer homes is heat pumps, he said.\nTemperature settings can also affect an electric bill, according to Tancredi. He recommended setting the thermostat to 78 degrees in the summer and 68 degrees in the winter.\nDelmarva Power offers programs such as home energy evaluations, and customers can compare their rates with their neighbors at the Delmarva Power website.\nAttending the event as a customer, Jim Hynson, a former Delmarva Power employee of 30 years, noted how the company has changed. Delmarva Power is now an Exelon company, along with Pepco Holdings.\nOverall, Hynson said he was satisfied with the information he received and remembered Delmarva Power fondly as a company to work for.\nOther customers were less satisfied with the event, expecting more overall discussion on the bill rate increases.\n\"What metric is Delmarva using to decide what's affordable?\" asked Amanda D'Onofrio of Centreville, who noted as a military spouse, cost of living allowances couldn't keep up with the rates.\nD'Onofrio considered the event merely a covering of energy savings basics that most people were familiar with. She felt the company neglected larger questions including regulating energy monopoly.\nDelmarva putting forth installment plans and cutting late fees does not address the underlying issue that customers are simply unable to afford their bills, D'Onofrio said. She wanted to see freedom of choice for consumers and an increase in transparency.\nJan Debrew of Stevensville considered her electric bill \"extreme\" and couldn't fathom why it had recently skyrocketed. Debrew stated she had a friend on the western shore with a different provider and a much larger house but a lower electric bill charge. \"It should be at least equal,\" she said.\nDebrew was hopeful to utilize new tactics to reduce the bill, noting she didn't consider herself to have other options for providers in the area.\nLucy Mitchell, of Chester, said the event was \"somewhat helpful\" to get an explanation of her $700 electric bill breakdown. Mitchell learned what pools the most electricity in a home, but she was already performing \"low hanging fruit\" energy savings, and at 80 years old, she was not in the market for high-end items such as new windows and installation.\nAccording to Burruezo, about 30 to 40 customers RSVP'd for individual consultation ahead of time. The event had been rescheduled from Feb. 12 due to inclement weather.\nMore information about Delmarva Power can be found at delmarva.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trump can break laws, but not laws of economics\n\n March 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RICK SCHIMING | Section: Columns \n \n 657\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n \"Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.\"This quote by the famed British economist John Maynard Keynes helps us understand Donald Trump's fascination with tariffs. For all practical purposes, Trump is a mercantilist, following the scribblings of a discredited group of economists from the 18th century.\nMercantilists had a few basic ideas about how a nation could become wealthy. A nation should accumulate as much gold and silver as they could through trade and exploitation. A nation should strive to restrict imports from other nations as much as possible to achieve a positive balance of trade.\nMercantilists viewed the world as a zero-sum game where the only way for your nation to win was for other nations to lose. The goal of the nation was to be as self-sufficient as possible, producing as many goods and services within its own borders as possible. Colonies were especially helpful in providing goods and services, and especially raw materials, to the mother country.\nTrump truly is an unrepentant mercantilist. He has a fascination with gold. He is always talking about a golden age for American. His Trump Tower condo, Mar-a-Lago, and now even the Oval Office look like they were decorated by King Midas. He even sells gold sneakers.\nLike all mercantilists, Trump is deeply disturbed by trade deficits. He sees them as theft perpetrated on the U.S. economy by other nations, requiring punitive tariffs on the offenders.\nHe also is captivated by the idea of colonies. Canada, Panama, Greenland and now even Gaza are viewed by Trump as possible colonial acquisitions.\nThe problem is that days of mercantilism as a rational understanding of how the world works are long over. We now know better. Believing in mercantilist thought today is the economic equivalent of being a member of the Flat Earth Society.\nBasic economic principles tell us that nations should no longer strive to be self-sufficient. The goal now for each nation is to do what they do best and trade for the rest. Trump can break a lot of laws, but he can't break the laws of economics.\nThe sensible and efficient thing for us to do is to produce those goods and services in which we have a cost or technology advantage and then use those goods and services to trade with other nations for the goods and services in which they have a production advantage.\nWhen trade occurs, it is not a zero-sum game but rather an exchange in which both trading nations win. Indeed, expanded global trade since World War II has enriched wealthy and poor nations alike. This trade expansion has proven to be one of the greatest international anti-poverty programs the world has ever seen.\nSo, what would be the economic impact of Trump's continual obsession with mercantilism and tariffs?\nWe will certainly see higher prices in the U.S. for a whole variety of imported goods and services. The Fed will be reluctant to lower interest rates if inflation increases. U.S. tariffs are a tax on U.S. consumers. Even worse, it is a regressive tax with lower income families feeling a greater burden of the higher prices.\nU.S. production will slow as our companies face less demand for our products internationally as other nations will impose tariffs on our exports. Higher unemployment will result. The U.S. economy could face the worst of all possible worlds: higher prices and higher unemployment rates. Clearly, no one wins a trade war.\nThe best-case scenario?\nTariff policy becomes in the second Trump term like infrastructure week was in the first term — lots of talk but ultimately little meaningful or sustained action. Unfortunately, this scenario seems increasingly unlikely now as new tariffs on steel and aluminum have been announced and other reciprocal tariffs are in the works.\nBut whether it is the best case or the worst case or somewhere in between, Trump is the proponent of a discredited academic theory that puts our economy in peril. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "More nuclear power in Maryland? Probably yes",

    "content": "More nuclear power in Maryland? Probably yes\n\n March 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 835\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Forty-five years ago this month, a nuclear reactor at the Three Mile Island electric power generating station in central Pennsylvania experienced a partial nuclear meltdown.It is the worst accident involving nuclear power generation in American history. On the International Nuclear Event Scale it is rated as a Level 5 event — an \"accident with wider consequences\".\nOne of those wider consequences was a dramatic and long-lasting shift on the public perception on the safety and feasibility of nuclear power plants, even with post TMI design and operating improvements for new plants.\nDespite those improvements, some concluded that the TMI accident and how it was mismanaged initially marked the beginning of the end of nuclear power as a source for electric power in America.\nUltimately, the accident did not result in the demise of the U.S. nuclear power industry, but it did halt its historic growth.\nFast forward to today.\nUnexpected and extraordinary increases in electric bills are a huge issue throughout Maryland.\nThey are generating extensive media coverage and widespread expressions of public concern and even outrage.\nThe levels of media coverage, public concern and public outrage on electric bills are greater than that generated by proposals under consideration in the General Assembly to revise state taxes, increase state fees and cut state spending in order to balance the state budget.\nFormer U.S. Sen. Everett Dirksen once said: 'When I feel the heat, I see the light.\"\nPresently, the heat is being felt by elected public officials at all levels of government including members of the General Assembly.\nBased on that heat they are increasingly open to a wide range of electrical generating options that could result in lower electric bills.\nOne option was succinctly captured in a recent headline for a Capital News Service article — \"Craving more energy, Maryland looks to nuclear power.\"\nThat \"craving\" recently has led to a four-bill package of legislation in the General Assembly.\nOne of the bills proposes a procurement framework to support the development of both traditional nuclear power plants and small modular reactors in Maryland.\nIf and when that occurs, any new traditional reactors would join the Calvert Cliffs nuclear power plant in Calvert County.\nOwned and operated by Baltimore based Constellation Energy since it became operational in 1975, Calvert Cliffs is Maryland's only traditional nuclear power plant. It is also the largest nuclear power plant on the East Coast. It generates about 40% of all electric power used in Maryland, an amount equal to that generated and imported from outside of Maryland.\nSupport for increased use of nuclear power in Maryland is not universal.\nJorge Aguilar, a regional director at Food and Water Watch, a national environmental advocacy organization, has said, \"Maryland should be alarmed that state leaders want to build out these astronomically expensive and dangerous nuclear plants in Maryland to meet the state's energy needs. These plants would be expensive to build and produce hazardous nuclear waste. Maryland should be pushing the grid operator to approve renewable energy projects faster. I think Maryland leaders really need to double down on truly clean energy, like wind and solar, as well as batteries. Not nuclear.\"\nThat message is likely to resonate with many of the progressive members in the General Assembly. It is not likely to resonate with the Freedom Caucus in the State House.\nThat caucus is suggesting the following changes in Maryland's energy — reopen closed coal-fired electric generating plants, keep open currently open coal-fired electric generating plants scheduled for closure, stop \"EmPOWER Maryland\" fees on electric bills, repeal or revise the state law that requires higher margins of clean energy to be used statewide and reduce spending $180 million dollars on a state climate department.\nWhile this approach of the Freedom Caucus may be helpful in increasing public awareness of the caucus and their proposed energy agenda, it will not move the needle with the governor or the steadily increasing numbers and power of progressive legislators in Annapolis.\nRegardless of the levels of support or opposition to more nuclear power, there are two realities that will determine its impact on higher electric bills for now and in the future.\nThe first reality is the 90-day General Assembly session ends on April 7, 2025.\nBetween now and then, the Governor and General Assembly leaders will be fully engaged in efforts to secure consensus and a majority of votes on a balanced state budget.\nThe second reality is, even with new policies on approving and encouraging greater use of nuclear power, the schedule for building and opening new nuclear power plants is a long one.\nThe period from proposal, approval, building, and opening can range from six years to 12 years. Construction time alone for the Calvert Cliffs plant was seven years.\nAccordingly, nuclear power will not provide immediate or short-term lower electric bills.\nWhat is urgently needed is the governor and General Assembly leadership to reach agreement on all the underlying causes of higher electric bills and then reach agreement on short-term and long-term solutions.\nOn the question of more nuclear power plants in Maryland, the answers are — probably yes, but not a given, and most certainly, not soon. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If you don't get out on the Bay you don't know it needs protecting, Ewenson said.\nShe is excited that by partnering with local businesses and building connections with the community, the show really connects with the community and emphasizes local involvement.\nWelcoming attendees by land and water, both local and away, the boat show offers a unique opportunity to showcase the culture of the surrounding Kent Narrows, including additional shopping, restaurants, hotels, businesses, and the Cross Island Trail.\n\"It will really benefit the whole area. This is not a convention center, this is people's lives and businesses,\" Ewenson said of this year's show venue.\nIn addition to showcasing the local area, the boat show also seeks to provide accessibility to anyone with maritime interests, with onsite hands-on training available to make any land lubber sea worthy of a new vessel.\nWith new powerboats on the market to behold, an expanded demo dock will offer attendees the opportunity to climb aboard a wide array of powerboats of every style and size. From fishing boats and trawlers to pontoon boats and luxury cruisers, last year's powerboat show saw more than 250 boats, and at least as many are expected this season, she said.\n\"If you're a seasoned boater or a first timer, the show will offer something new for everyone to explore,\" said Annapolis Boat Shows' General Manager Sheila Jones.\nMarine industry career networking opportunities will also be available alongside information about nearby boating clubs and schools.\nAnd a great aspect of spring shows is that you can take your new boat out on the water right away, she said.\n\"Whether you're here for the boats, the education, or the food and entertainment, it's always a ton of fun. And the beautiful new venue means visitors may board even more exciting new powerboats and shop everything from gear and accessories to electronics, communication equipment, education, clubs, and more.\"\nShuttles will run between the lot at the old outlets off Exit 41 and the show.\nAn event certainly not to 'skiff', you can 'ketch' more information about the Bay Bridge Boat Show and other local shows at BayBridgeBoatShow.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton EDC updates Town Council on foot traffic, Fire & Ice\n\n March 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 504\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Easton Economic Development Corporation Executive Director Holly DeKarske provided an update to the Easton Town Council Monday regarding downtown foot traffic.The corporation signed up for Placer.ai, a data tool which provides insight into foot traffic trends. Data was pulled specific to the Chesapeake Fire & Ice Festival in February, as well as year-to-year trends from 2019 to 2024.\nAccording to data provided to the council, North Washington Street saw around 9,200 visits for the two Fire & Ice Festival days this year.\nThat mark is down from around 11,300 in 2024, though this year's foot traffic was hampered by rain during the festival's second day. DeKarske said this year's foot traffic was \"good\" until the weather hiccup.\nShe added that moving forward, her office plans to keep streets open for Fire & Ice to avoid insurance and police costs that are \"really hard to recoup.\"\n\"We're going to see if we can find a way to mitigate the foot traffic and spread things out in such a way so we wouldn't have to close the streets,\" DeKarske said.\nAs for year-to-year numbers, Placer.ai data shows North Washington Street saw around 1 million visitors in 2024. That's down 4.3% compared to 2023, but up 5.6% compared to 2021.\n\"I think that tool is wonderful,\" council President Frank Gunsallus told DeKarske. \" … It was nice to see the positive growth over the last five years, so thank you for your efforts.\"\nWard 3 Councilmember David Montgomery wasn't satisfied with numbers on only foot traffic only.\n\"Foot traffic is interesting, but for economic development purposes, I think we really should be asking what the revenue generation is for our businesses,\" Montgomery said.\nDeKarske said Easton Economic Development Corporation does that by speaking to businesses after events. Montgomery asked that the town aggregate sales numbers from businesses.\n\"That's really the only way we can judge whether this is benefitting our businesses or not,\" Montgomery said. \"If you could find a way to do that, or I'd be happy to entertain a request to have a contractor that (businesses) would trust to collect data and aggregate it for us.\"\n\"Our job is to get foot traffic into town, and hopefully get the right kind of foot traffic that spends money,\" DeKarske responded. \"It is not my job to get them in your store. That is the job of the business owners.\"\nMontgomery said he'd like to bring the topic up during budget season. \"I thought we were getting benefits for our businesses from EEDC,\" he said.\n\"Yes, bringing people to town to spend money,\" said DeKarske.\nWard 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello asked DeKarske what businesses have shared regarding why retail and dining spending is slightly down. DeKarske said the cost of living and the recent presidential election year are two factors.\n\"People are just being cautious still,\" she said.\n\"We still have foot traffic coming into town, but people are dining out less,\" DeKarske added. \"And we also need people who live here to support those businesses as well. And so that has been a little bit of an issue, too.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Recession risk: Could Trump's tariffs sink the stock market and U.S. economy?\n\n March 6, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: Business \n \n 1271\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Is U.S. President Donald Trump risking a recession with his tariffs?Joosep Seitam, co-founder of a New York-based e-commerce firm, is worried about that.\n\"There is a risk of recession. When companies swallow higher costs and consumers pull back in the face of higher prices, economic growth can slow down,\" said Seitam, whose company IceCartel.com sells jewelry online.\nHe worries about the impact on U.S. farmers and small businesses from Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China and additional looming global tariffs slated to go into place April 2. Trump said Friday more specific tariffs against Canada could be enacted before next month.\n\"Small businesses are hurt the most by such policies. They lack the ability to absorb price hikes costs while also not having the influence to negotiate better terms,\" Seitam said. \"When their costs increase due to tariffs, they increase prices or cut costs elsewhere. This means layoffs or reduced expenditure on growth.\"\nSTOCKS PLUNGEWall Street is also worried about the Trump tariffs and their potential for higher prices, disrupted supply chains and trade wars.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down more than 1,000 points for the week on Friday and has lost 2.8% since Trump took office in January.\nThe S&P 500 closed down 2.85% for the week on Friday and is down 4.6% since Trump's return to power, according to Google Finance.\nThe Nasdaq lost more than 506 points for the week, shedding 2.7% of its value. The tech-heavy index is down 7.9% since Trump's return to the White House.\nOverall, U.S. stocks are down 5.5% since Trump return to power.\nTariff fears extend to main street businesses and consumers' inflationary weary pocketbooks. Farmers, publishers, manufacturers, retailers and hosts of other businesses and industries are faced with higher prices for raw materials, parts and products and higher costs to enter international markets via reciprocal levies.\n\"Tariffs are a tax on imported goods and will undoubtedly lead to higher prices. Businesses who use products that have tariffs applied will either need to find another supplier or pay the higher price,\" said Eric Belasco, an economist and head of the agricultural economics and economics department at Montana State University.\nHe said consumers will see higher retail prices and businesses higher costs for raw materials and other inputs.\n\"For example, farmers buy fertilizer from Canadian firms and those prices will go up if tariffs are applied. Many industries have also established their supply chains through NAFTA where components are made and produced interchangeably between these countries,\" he said.\nUNCERTAINTY REIGNSTrump has retreated some with his sweeping 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada after stocks on Wall Street plunged.\nTrump is kicking the can for a month on North American tariffs on automakers and products and materials under the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA). That could help farmers and other businesses.\nBut some other products and materials still face the stiff U.S. levies and the current exemption only lasts 30 days.\nTrump also has 20% tariffs in place on China and promises even more tariffs against other countries in April.\nThe uncertainty and tariffs' upward pressure on prices and potential downward pressure on economic growth has Wall Street investors, farmers, businesses and inflation-weary consumers spooked.\n\"Trump's tariffs will make groceries, electronics, cars, and gas more expensive. Not everything will go up in price right off the bat, but industries that rely on imported tech may see higher costs and be forced to cut jobs,\" said Jeep Stale, managing partner at Raisewell Ventures (a San Francisco-based, tech-focused investment firm).\nThe current tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China were invoked by Trump under an emergency powers law citing the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.\nTrump's one-month extensions don't seem to be helping investor and economic confidence with the market 'animal spirits' selling off stocks and indicating a potential slowdown. Stress and lack of clarity about tariffs is depressing business sentiments and essentially freezing capital spending, mergers and acquisitions and hiring decisions.\n\"Uncertainty is always a cancer for a macroeconomy,\" said Chris Jones, an economist and economics professor at the University of South Florida. \"Expectations drive the capital planning decisions of firms. You have to have some sense for what the future is going to hold.\"\nJones said the tariffs' impacts on the U.S. economy likely depends on their length and reciprocity from other countries.\nBut he does see the possibility of a 'stagflation' scenario with high price and slowed economic growth.\nThe Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank's GDPNow gauge now pegs first quarter economic growth at -2.4%.\nThe new indicator was released Wednesday and improved from -2.8% on Monday.\nThe U.S. has not had a negative quarter of economic growth since 2022 in the midst of 40-year highs with inflation.\n'TRANSITORY'Trump and his economic acolytes such as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have used terms such as \"disturbance\", \"short-term interruption\", \"disruption\" and \"price movements\" while pushing back against fears of tariffs' driving up still persistent post-pandemic inflation.\n\"We could get a one-time price adjustment,\" Bessent told the Economic Club of New York. \"Nothing is more transitory than tariffs if it's a one-time price adjustment,\" he continued.\nThe Biden administration was previously faulted for calling post-pandemic inflation 'transitory.'\nOn Thursday, Trump blamed \"globalist\" companies and countries for trade imbalances still touting tariffs as a way to bolster manufacturing and resource production, railing against Canadian imports, in particular, including lumber key to home building.\nRepublican lawmakers supportive of Trump have said the current tariffs are meant as leverage to push Mexico, Canada and China to curtail fentanyl flows.\n\"And that's President Trump's goal: Use these tariffs as important leverage to get the Canadians and the Mexican governments working with us to stop this scourge of fentanyl,\" U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, R-Montana, told Fox Business Wednesday\nBut Trump and Lutnick have also pressed tariffs as a way for domestic manufacturing and job growth. Lutnick talked about more U.S. factors utilizing robots during a Thursday interview with CNBC.\nDaines and the president's camp have also touted the $1.7 trillion in domestic business investments since Trump returned to power and have promised tax and regulatory cuts and increased oil and gas drilling.\nThat's what Wall Street and businesses expected from a second Trump term as opposed to trade wars and tariffs on the country's three largest trading partners.\nWARNING SIGNSBut there are also other economic warning signs in Trump's first months in office.\nU.S. households currently carry a record $18.04 trillion in debt, according to the New York Federal Reserve Bank.\nThe Conference Board's consumer confidence index also dipped in February with persistent inflation and egg prices at record highs and expected to go even higher due to bird flu outbreaks and mass poultry cullings.\nA new report from PriceWaterhouseCoopers also worries the tariffs will drive up already rising auto and home insurance premiums if prices for auto parts, appliances and home repairs materials are more expensive.\nU.S. employers also reported more than 172,000 job cuts and layoffs in February, the highest since 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\nFebruary layoffs are up 245% from January with some of the cuts stemming from Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) austerity efforts impacting government agencies and contractors, according to the Challenger report.\nJason Brown, an investment and stock market analyst and founder of The Brown Report and Power Trades University, said he's already seeing an economic slowdown, including from the employment and procurement impacts of DOGE.\nBut he doesn't see a sustained economic slump.\n\"I don't think we are going to see a recession,\" said Brown, who is based in Michigan.\nHe understands Trump's long-term play of addressing trade inequities and bolstering domestic manufacturing. \"I think long-term, it's going to be good for the economy,\" Brown said, while also acknowledging the current landscape.\n\"I think short-term, it's going to be pretty painful.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "State's proposed hidden tax would take big bite\n\n March 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARY D. KANE | Section: Columns \n \n 730\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Your favorite local restaurant — where they know your name and usual order — is struggling to make ends meet. The owner works 70-plus-hour weeks, employs 20 of your neighbors and operates on a razor-thin 4% profit margin. Now imagine this small business being hit with a new 2.5% tax on their accounting services, payroll processing, marketing, web and IT support — essential services they can't function without.The owner faces an impossible choice: raise menu prices, cut staff hours or reduce the quality of ingredients. There's no fourth option to simply absorb thousands in new costs.\nThis isn't hypothetical. It will happen if lawmakers pass HB 1554/SB 1045, imposing a 2.5% tax on business-to-business services, including accounting, IT support, consulting and landscaping, among many other services. While framed as a business tax, the reality is these costs flow to consumers.\nThe ripple effect touches every industry. When your auto repair shop pays more for accounting services, your repair bill increases. When your hairstylist pays more for scheduling software, your haircut costs more. When your child's day care center pays more for payroll processing, your child care rates go up. These aren't luxury services — they're everyday necessities for Maryland families already stretched thin by inflation.\nThis couldn't come at a worse time. Maryland already ranks among the least competitive states for business:\n46th in the Tax Foundation's State Business Tax Climate Index.Third highest cost of doing business and 31st for business climate overall (CNBC Top States for Business).41st for percentage job growth and 44th for net migration by state.\nMeanwhile, our neighbors offer a far better climate:\nVirginia: First for business climate; 28th for tax climatePennsylvania: 17th for business climate; 35th for tax climateDelaware: 34th for business climate; 18th for tax climate\nDespite this dismal picture, instead of making Maryland more competitive, lawmakers are rushing through a last-minute tax increase with minimal debate — as a quick fix for the state's growing budget deficit.\nAnd it's happening as Maryland's economy stalls. Growth — not new taxes — is the best way to close budget gaps, create jobs and strengthen communities. Yet this bill does the opposite. It discourages investment, punishes local businesses and makes Maryland even less attractive for growth.\nConsider the real-world impact of these proposals, as shared by local business owners facing higher costs and tougher decisions:\nA small med tech company in Baltimore producing lifesaving technology will pay more than $50,000 a year extra in business-to-business service taxes.A family-owned restaurant group in Frederick would face higher IT, marketing, payroll and accounting costs than one in Wilmington, Delaware — where there's no sales tax at all.\nAn engineering young entrepreneur with a successful brand consulting business will struggle to retain clients as the tax makes marketing services more expensive, while also facing higher costs for the essential services she depends on.\nFor businesses operating on 3% to 5% margins, these extra costs mean the difference between hiring an employee or cutting back.\nVirginia doesn't tax these services. Delaware has no sales tax. Why would Maryland put its businesses at a disadvantage?\nSmall businesses will bear the brunt. Unlike large corporations with in-house accounting and IT, small businesses must outsource these functions. The local auto shop, day care and family-owned restaurant can't absorb this new tax.\nConsumers will feel the pinch too. When a restaurant pays more for accounting, that cost gets passed on to your meal. When an accounting firm pays more for IT support, they raise their rates, increasing costs across the board. This 2.5% tax multiplies into even higher prices for Maryland families.\nWe understand Maryland's budget challenges. But solving today's deficit by creating tomorrow's economic problems is shortsighted. Sustainable revenue comes from fostering a business-friendly environment — where companies want to grow, invest and create jobs.\nEvery dollar a small business spends on new taxes is a dollar not invested in growth. Some will delay hiring. Others will postpone expansion. Some may relocate to business-friendly states nearby. Is that what Maryland needs?\nBefore lawmakers vote, they should consider the real-world impact: the restaurant server whose hours get cut, the recent graduate who doesn't get hired, the family watching prices rise.\nMaryland deserves policies that strengthen communities by supporting small businesses — the backbone of our economy. Instead of creating new burdens, we should be removing barriers to growth.\nSmall business owners across Maryland are watching closely. And so should every consumer who cares about jobs, opportunity and the cost of living in our state. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Striped bass restrictions head to Supreme Court\n\n March 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: HANNAH COMBS hcombs@kibaytimes.com | Section: Local News \n \n 911\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — A coalition of Maryland fishing associations and charter boat operators have escalated their legal battle against new striped bass fishing restrictions, filing an emergency petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking to block the regulations. Captain Robert Newberry, chairman of Delmarva Fisheries Association stated, \"We will take this case to the highest court until this matter is resolved — it is far from over.\"The Delmarva Fisheries Association and the Maryland Charter Boat Association, along with two individual commercial fishermen, argue that the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's (the Commission) recent measures impose \"drastic, unwarranted, and illegal limitations\" on striped bass fishing in the Chesapeake Bay and along the Atlantic coast. The petition, filed March 4, claims the restrictions violate the U.S. Constitution and could jeopardize the livelihoods of many small businesses.\nThe case follows months of legal disputes in lower courts, where the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to halt the Commission's 2024 striped bass management plan, known as Addendum II. The plan, approved in January by a 14-2 vote, reduced commercial quotas, shortened fishing seasons, and limited recreational anglers to catching just one striped bass per day instead of two.\nMaryland and New Jersey voted against the measure, but Maryland ultimately implemented the restrictions under pressure from the Commission and federal agencies. The Maryland Attorney General's Office acknowledged in a letter that failing to comply could trigger a federal moratorium on all striped bass fishing in state waters.\nWhen confronted with having to cut the catch limitation in half, Assistant Director and Fisheries Manager at the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and proxy to the Marine Fisheries Commission Michael Luisi, warned the Commission that limiting Maryland's charter boat clients' catch to one fish a day \"will put people out of business.\"\nDocuments filed with the court by the plaintiffs state Luisi was \"pointedly correct in this assessment but the ASMFC and its federal and other illegally voting partners as well as other member states, including Maryland at that point, decided that its guesstimate on fish-spawning futures five years into the future was more important than the impending demise of these family-run, small businesses.\"\nNewberry said, it is was \"extremely perturbing that Governor Moore and Attorney General Anthony Brown turned their backs on us in the seafood industry in Maryland and also all of us here on the Eastern Shore.\" Moore never weighed in on this constitutional issue affecting those in the seafood industry, but will \"spend millions of taxpayers dollars defending the citizens of Maryland against the so-called constitutional violations of President Trump,\" Newberry said. \"We have not only been left behind, we have tire tracks on our backs from where we have been run over, and left behind.\"\n\"The economic damage is undeniable,\" said Brian Hardman, president of the Maryland Charter Boat Association. \"We've seen a 75-85% decline in business, boats being sold off, and captains leaving the industry. The Commission rushed through regulations without considering the devastating impact on local livelihoods.\"\nHardman continued, \"...the 2025 numbers are continuing to be off by the same ratios or worse; that an unprecedented 53 charter boats have been sold or listed for sale since 2024; and, that 43 \"for hire\" Charter Boat businesses have already been forced to close their doors with another 11 companies losing money at a rate that will soon bring about the same result.\"\nThe legal challenge focuses on alleged constitutional violations, including the 10th Amendment's prohibition on federal overreach, the 5th Amendment's protection against government takings without just compensation, and the 14th Amendment's due process clause. The plaintiffs also argue that the Commission, originally established as an advisory body, has unlawfully assumed regulatory powers without proper state and federal oversight.\nDespite warnings from industry representatives that the new rules would cripple the state's fishing economy, the Commission stood by its decision, citing concerns about overfishing and the need to rebuild the striped bass population by 2029. However, critics claim the commission relied on faulty data, pointing out that the agency's own projections have fluctuated — from a 97% chance of population recovery in 2023 to just 15% in 2024, before rebounding to 50% in 2025.\nIn a statement, the Commission defended its methodology, emphasizing that conservation measures are necessary to prevent further declines in the striped bass stock.\n\"The science may be imperfect, but the consequences of inaction could be severe,\" said a Commission spokesperson. \"We understand the economic hardship this creates, but the long-term health of the fishery must come first.\"\nYet the plaintiffs stated, there are in excess of 240 million striped bass in U.S. waters and the annual number of fishing removals is approximately six million.\nThe Supreme Court previously declined to hear an emergency appeal in May, citing a lack of prior appellate review. The plaintiffs now return to the high court after exhausting their legal options in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which ruled in February that the lawsuit should be dismissed because the plaintiffs had sued the Commission rather than the state of Maryland.\nWith the 2025 fishing season set to begin in May, the petitioners are urging the Supreme Court to issue an injunction that would restore previous fishing limits while the legal battle plays out. Without relief, they warn that more charter businesses will shut down, further damaging Maryland's historic fishing industry.\n\"The Supreme Court is our last hope,\" Hardman said. \"We're not asking for special treatment—just the right to keep our businesses afloat.\"\nA decision on the emergency petition filed March 4, could come within weeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Supreme Court denies fishing case\n\n March 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: HANNAH COMBS hcombs@kibaytimes.com | Section: Local News \n \n 801\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court has denied a hearing for a coalition of Maryland fishing associations and charter boat operators seeking to overturn new striped bass fishing restrictions. But for Captain Robert Newberry, chairman of the Delmarva Fisheries Association, the legal battle is far from over.\"It's not good that we were denied the hearing in front of the Supreme Court, but this is far from over. We are in it to win it! We will be announcing our next move within a week,\" Newberry said, emphasizing that no other group in the state has fought as hard on this issue as the Delmarva Fisheries Association, the Maryland Charter Boat Association, and supporters like Brian Nesspor and Ken Jefferies.\nThe coalition had filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court to block the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's (the Commission) new restrictions, arguing they imposed \"drastic, unwarranted, and illegal limitations\" on striped bass fishing in the Chesapeake Bay and along the Atlantic coast. The March 4 petition claimed the regulations violated the U.S. Constitution and threatened the livelihoods of small fishing businesses.\nNewberry learned of the decision from the Supreme Court just a week after filing. An explanation of the denial is expected to be forthcoming, he said.\nThe case follows months of legal disputes in lower courts, where the plaintiffs sought to halt the Commission's 2024 striped bass management plan, known as Addendum II. The plan, approved in January by a 14-2 vote, reduced commercial quotas, shortened fishing seasons, and limited recreational anglers to catching just one striped bass per day instead of two.\nMaryland and New Jersey voted against the measure, but Maryland ultimately implemented the restrictions under pressure from the Commission and federal agencies. The Maryland Attorney General's Office acknowledged in a letter that failing to comply could trigger a federal moratorium on all striped bass fishing in state waters.\nAssistant Director and Fisheries Manager at the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Michael Luisi, warned the Commission that reducing Maryland's charter boat clients' catch to one fish per day would \"put people out of business.\"\nDocuments filed by the plaintiffs argue that the Commission disregarded these warnings, relying on uncertain projections about fish-spawning trends while neglecting the immediate economic harm to family-run businesses. Newberry expressed frustration with Maryland officials, particularly Governor Wes Moore and Attorney General Anthony Brown, for not standing with the seafood industry.\n\"It is extremely perturbing that Governor Moore and Attorney General Brown turned their backs on us,\" Newberry said. \"They are willing to spend millions of taxpayer dollars defending Maryland against alleged constitutional violations by President Trump, but they ignore the constitutional violations affecting the seafood industry.\"\nIndustry leaders say the damage is already evident.\n\"The economic impact is undeniable,\" said Brian Hardman, president of the Maryland Charter Boat Association. \"We've seen a 75-85% decline in business, boats being sold off, and captains leaving the industry. The Commission rushed through regulations without considering the devastating impact on local livelihoods.\"\nHardman added that \"2025 numbers are continuing to decline at the same rate or worse,\" citing the unprecedented sale or listing of 53 charter boats since 2024. He also noted that 43 charter boat businesses have shut down, with 11 more on the brink of collapse.\nThe legal challenge centers on alleged constitutional violations, including the 10th Amendment's prohibition on federal overreach, the 5th Amendment's protection against government takings without just compensation, and the 14th Amendment's due process clause. The plaintiffs also contend that the Commission, originally established as an advisory body, has unlawfully assumed regulatory powers without proper state and federal oversight.\nThe Commission defended its decision, emphasizing the need for conservation measures to prevent further declines in striped bass populations.\n\"The science may be imperfect, but the consequences of inaction could be severe,\" a Commission spokesperson said. \"We understand the economic hardship this creates, but the long-term health of the fishery must come first.\"\nCritics, however, argue that the Commission's data is inconsistent. Its own projections have fluctuated, estimating a 97% chance of population recovery in 2023, only to drop to 15% in 2024 before rebounding to 50% in 2025. Plaintiffs claim the estimated 240 million striped bass in U.S. waters far outweigh the annual fishing removals of approximately six million.\nThe Supreme Court previously declined to hear an emergency appeal in May, citing a lack of prior appellate review. The plaintiffs returned to the high court after exhausting their options in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which dismissed the case in February on the grounds that the plaintiffs sued the Commission rather than the state of Maryland.\nWith the 2025 fishing season set to begin in May, the petitioners had hoped the Supreme Court would issue an injunction restoring previous fishing limits while the legal battle continues. Without relief, they warn that more charter businesses will shut down, further damaging Maryland's historic fishing industry. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trump's 200% wine, spirits, Champagne tariffs could wipe out imports, raise prices for domestics\n\n March 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: Business \n \n 1093\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n U.S. President Donald Trump's threatened 200% tariffs on French Champagne along with wines and spirits from the European Union will squash imports, hurt smaller U.S. distributors, restaurants and bars, and likely drive up prices with domestic offerings facing less competition.That is according to Karl Strochmann, an economist at New York University, executive director of the American Association of Wine Economists and a leading analyst of the $107 billion U.S. wine market.\nOn Thursday, Trump threatened the 200% tariffs after the EU slapped 50% tariffs on American-made whiskeys and bourbons.\nThe latter came in response to Trump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Europe, Canada and other markets.\nStrochmann said 200% Trump tariffs will dramatically reduce wine selections and likely make what's still available in the U.S. more expensive.\n\"It will almost certainly all but end wine imports from the affected countries (EU countries),\" he said. \"Since France and Italy are our largest wine import partners, the selection of wines will be affected as well.\"\nIn addition to reduced selections at bars and restaurants, the tariffs could adversely affect U.S. distributors who specialize in foreign wines and spirits, he said.\n\"Tariffs of 200% on wine imports from the EU will have a massive impact on U.S. wine importing and distributing companies, particularly small ones that specialize in artisanal wine from Europe,\" Strochmann said.\nThe wine-focused economist said previous 25% U.S. tariffs on European wines from 2019 to 2021 saw higher prices, including for domestic wines (especially reds) because of diminished competition.\n\"Prices might grow because the absence of French, Italian, and Spanish wine might lower competitive pressure,\" Strochmann said.\n'HOSTILE'\nTrump said Thursday he was sticking by his push for tariffs, saying they will help rebalance trade inequities and encourage domestic manufacturing and production. He also promised to punch back when other countries respond to U.S. tariffs.\n'The European Union, one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the world, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States, has just put a nasty 50% tariff on whiskey. If this tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES. This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.,\" Trump said on his Truth Social platform, announcing the levies Thursday morning.\nChampagne is only produced in France, but there is a growing sparkling wine market in the U.S. and other countries.\nThe Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America said Thursday the Trump tariffs will hurt suppliers, wholesalers and retailers and raise prices for U.S. consumers.\n\"The cost of dining out with a bottle of wine or enjoying a cocktail made with an imported spirit will rise significantly. As a result, fewer consumers will frequent bars and restaurants, which will ultimately impact the hospitality sector, reducing job opportunities and wages,\" WSWA President and CEO Francis Creighton said in a statement.\nImported wines and spirits make up 30% of the U.S. marketplace by volume and 35% by revenue, according to the industry group. France and Italy account for as much as two-thirds of U.S. wine imports, according to other industry reports.\n\"A tariff on imported wine and spirits will directly impact American workers,\" Creighton said. \"Rising costs will cause some consumers to stay at home, hurting the bartenders, servers and other bar and restaurant workers who depend on customer traffic for tips and shift hours.\"\nTrump has touted eliminating taxes on tips as part of his economic agenda.\nRETAILER, CONSUMER SHIFTSSmall business owners in the wine and spirits space are waiting to see if the Trump tariffs come to fruition.\nTeresa Soule, who co-owns The Office Lounge and Liquor Store in Livingston, Montana, with her husband, Cory, isn't sure when consumers would feel the impact of Trump's threatened tariffs if they become reality.\nShe said that depends on when distributors run out of existing inventory and start bringing in potentially tariffed imports.\nSoule said in Montana liquors are distributed by the state while wine and beer is distributed by private wholesalers.\n\"It might not affect us for a year,\" she said if current inventories are ample. Other products could see quicker price changes related to tariffs, Soule said.\nShe said heavy tariffs will reduce wholesale purchases from stores like hers.\n\"We might not order it,\" Soule said of potential higher prices.\nThe Soules have been in the wine and spirits business for almost two decades. She expects customers to shift to less expensive brands, including American products, if the prices of European brands skyrocket.\n\"I think that they are going to buy what they can afford,\" Soule said.\nAcross the country, Kevin Leahy owns Coastal Isles Wine Bar with his wife, Shauna, in Punta Gorda, Florida.\nHe sees Trump's tariffs drumbeat as a part of broader U.S. strategies.\n\"I think it is a negotiating tool to get other countries to the table,\" Leahy said.\nTrump imposed 20% tariffs against China and imposed and then delayed 25% sweeping tariffs on Canada and Mexico, citing the need to curtail the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S.\nTrump argues other tariffs — including against Canada and the European Union — are needed to address trade imbalances and respond to levies against U.S. exports.\n\"I think that makes sense,\" Leahy said, of Trump's promises of reciprocal tariffs.\nThe Florida boutique wine bar offers unique selections with approximately 70% of them imported, said Leahy, acknowledging the potential impacts.\nHe said if a 200% tariff goes in place against products from Europe it would likely shift consumer demand.\n\"Who's going to buy wine for 200% more?,\" Leahy said.\nWALL STREET WORRIESTrump's trade wars continue to worry Wall Street with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 1,000 points the trading week ending March 14. The Dow is down more than 3,000 points the past 30 days, according to Google Finance.\nThe Dow was up more than 674 points Friday recouping some recent losses.\nInvestors and businesses worry about tariffs resulting in higher prices and a potential economic slowdown or recession.\nThe Nasdaq was up more than 450 points Friday but is down close to 2,700 points the past 30 days. The S&P 500 is down 7.8% the past month through March 14 even after Friday's 2.13% gain.\nTrump was asked about small business worries about tariffs and trade wars Thursday.\n\"They are going to be so much richer than they are right now,\" said Trump, who went on to list planned U.S. investments by some of the largest corporations such as Meta/Facebook, Apple and General Motors.\nTrump credited tariffs and proposed extensions of tax cuts passed during his first term for those corporate investments. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The authors quote the \"horror\" expressed by business executives at a recent meeting behind closed doors and behind President Trump's back. Their source was a business professor from Yale. Someone from a progressive indoctrination center was their source? While companies are putting their billions on the table this \"school teacher\" source gets onto the front page of the WSJ? I'm assuming the comments from a source from Yale are unbiased, ha ha. Maybe the authors should speak with sources from the companies putting up billions to invest in America.Yale and Professor Sonnenfeld most probably invested nothing. By the way, the stock market has been overvalued for some time so a 5%-10% drop is not the catastrophe being written about. Companies do not make long-term decisions based on what a president says over a two-month span. What long-term decisions were made over the last four years that made these business leaders so comfortable? How much did these business leaders invest with confidence in DEI and with the prospect of higher corporate taxes?\nRICH ADRIAN\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2025-03-18",
    "author": "JAMES ROYAL Bankrate.com",
    "content": "Social financial advice could be bad investment\n\n March 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JAMES ROYAL Bankrate.com | Section: Local News \n \n 858\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Nearly one-third of American adults (30%) who looked for financial advice in 2023 turned to social media, according to Bankrate's Financial Security Survey. Younger Americans are even more likely than the average to seek out financial advice from social media, potentially setting them off in the wrong direction during their crucial early saving years, when they could get a jump-start on building wealth.While social media may be a popular way to access low-cost financial advice, it's a terrible resource for a number of reasons — here's why.\n1. Financial advice often comes from non-experts.Anyone — literally anyone — can claim to be a financial expert on social media and offer advice as they try to attract an audience. Having a presence on social media and declaring yourself a financial expert doesn't make it so, however.\n\"Social media is flooded with misinformation,\" says Jeff Busch, financial adviser at Elysium Financial in South Jordan, Utah. \"So-called experts typically lack education and credentials to give such advice.\"\nIn some worst-case scenarios, so-called advisers may be telling you to do things that are a crime, setting you up for more expense and potentially more significant legal issues.\nThat's why it's vital to check the credentials of any social media personality, and working with a certified financial adviser can help you get good advice.\n2. Financial advice may be self-serving.Financial advice from social media is apt to be self-serving, and \"finfluencers\" may be trying to sell you something that benefits them personally, rather than giving you quality advice.\n\"Most social media 'advice' is designed to hook you on fear or greed,\" says Brad Clark, investment adviser representative and founder of Solomon Financial in Carmel, Indiana. \"If it is one of those two, then it likely has an underlying reason for being shared. You are going to get sold something based on this fear or greed.\"\nSo social media may try to show how rich you could become if you purchased the finfluencer's cryptocurrency or if you bought their wealth-building system, which benefits them personally. Of course, they may also be touting legitimate financial products that give them a huge commission.\n\"If someone truly has a 'get rich quick' scheme that works, they would just do that and get rich and stop wasting their time trying to sell others on it,\" says Clark.\n3. Financial advice may not be tailored to your needs.Even if the financial advice on social media may sometimes be accurate, that doesn't mean it's the right advice for you specifically. Your specific financial circumstances are different from someone else's, and you'll need advice that fits your needs.\n\"When it comes to finances, what might work for a person may not work for someone else,\" says Clark. \"While it could even be good advice for some, it could be terrible advice for others.\"\nBusch agrees: \"Goals, savings, debt, risk tolerance should all be taken into account, and each is different for each person.\"\nSo with social media, you may end up with advice that's suitable for someone, but not you.\nWhere to go for good financial advice\nIf you're looking for good financial advice, it's important to understand who's providing it.\nHIGH-QUALITY WEBSITESHigh-quality websites with credentialed writers or advisers can offer good financial advice. Sites such as Bankrate have experienced and often credentialed writers, including those with the certified financial planner designation, who can offer valuable insight into financial issues. Such credentialed advisers can provide accurate financial advice that may work for you.\nDespite these positives, many individuals have differing financial situations that may require custom advice. So they need to carefully assess whether they need more customized advice.\nFIDUCIARY FINANCIAL ADVISERSA fiduciary financial adviser — one who acts in your interest all the time — is the solution for those looking for the best advice. Your best bet here is to look for a fiduciary adviser who accepts only fee-paying clients. This setup means that you'll need to pay for financial advice, but this pay structure offers the best opportunity to align the interests of your adviser with your own. If you're not paying for financial advice, it may be because they're really salespeople in disguise.\n\"Financial advisers who are fiduciaries bring a lot of value,\" says Clark. \"Their goal is to understand the client's situation and then make recommendations to help them achieve their goals.\"\n\"The key advantage to working with a financial adviser is receiving a customized financial plan,\" says Busch. \"A personalized plan allows an adviser to understand your personal goals and provide support along the way of your life.\"\nA well-aligned fiduciary adviser can help you make the financial decisions that make the most sense for your situation, and the best financial advisers can help you build wealth for the long term. Here are four of the most important tips to find a financial adviser who is aligned with you.\nBOTTOM LINEThose looking for the best financial advice tailored to their specific situation can turn to a top financial adviser aligned with their needs and steer clear of dubious advice on social media.\n\"You should exercise caution and take any information you find and consult with your own financial adviser,\" says Busch. \"It's the safest way you can build a solid financial plan and avoid costly mistakes.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The national average is down 10.6 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 42.4 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nMarch 17, 2024: $3.50 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.44 per gallon)March 17, 2023: $3.29 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.43 per gallon)March 17, 2022: $4.18 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.28 per gallon)March 17, 2021: $2.84 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.88 per gallon)March 17, 2020: $2.22 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.19 per gallon)March 17, 2019: $2.56 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.54 per gallon)March 17, 2018: $2.54 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.54 per gallon)March 17, 2017: $2.30 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.29 per gallon)March 17, 2016: $1.97 per gallon (U.S. Average: $1.96 per gallon)March 17, 2015: $2.43 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.41 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $2.97 per gallon, up 13.8 cents per gallon from last week's $2.83 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.14 per gallon, down 3.2 cents per gallon from last week's $3.17 per gallon.Hagerstown: $2.82 per gallon, down 9.5 cents per gallon from last week's $2.91 per gallon.\n\"As concerns over tariffs and policy uncertainties grow, gas prices have continued to decline across much of the country, raising the possibility that the national average could slip below $3 per gallon and approach some of the lowest prices seen in years,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"However, this decline shouldn't necessarily be celebrated, as it comes with strong warning signs. When the economy slows, gasoline demand drops— along with demand for other refined products like diesel and jet fuel. We've already seen some signals that the months ahead could be challenging. All of this suggests that gas prices are likely to remain low for now. However, if economic conditions improve, gas prices could eventually follow suit and start rising again.\"\nGasBuddy is the authoritative voice for gas prices and the only source for station-level data. GasBuddy's survey updates 288 times every day from the most diverse list of sources covering nearly 150,000 stations nationwide, the most comprehensive and up-to-date in the country.

    "content": "Small businesses bracing for Trump tariffs, potential trade wars and 'flexibility'\n\n March 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: Business \n \n 1098\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Candace Kiersky is waiting and trying to figure out the path forward.She's also trying not to worry.\nKiersky owns Skagit Valley Larder — a wine bar and cheese shop in downtown Mount Vernon, Washington.\nThe town, which is known for its tulips and annual tulip festival, is about 50 miles from the Canadian border.\nLike other small businesses across the country, Kiersky is waiting to see what happens with U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and what they might do to her costs, pricing, inventories and supply chains.\nTrump has threatened 200% tariffs against wines, champagnes and liquors from France, Italy and other European Union countries.\nThat came after the EU imposed a 50% tariff on American bourbons and whiskeys. That was in response to Trump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The EU announced Thursday it was pushing off the start of its tariffs on bourbon and whiskey and other U.S. goods until mid-April. They were slated to go into the place at the start of the month.\nIt is just one battle front in Trump's promised trade wars with more fights expected April 2 with the U.S. administration promising reciprocal tariffs for duties levied on American products.\nKiersky's business — which also includes a wine club and classes — would feel the brunt of Trump's threatened 200% tariffs on European wines and French Champagnes.\nShe said 70% of her stock is from Europe and 30% are domestic wines. Like others in the wine space, Kiersky said many of her customers prefer imported wines. \"French wines are quite a bit more evolved,\" she said.\nKiersky is not sure what Trump tariffs will be put into place, and for how long and which ones the president might threaten but never impose or impose and then pull back.\n\"I'm actually waiting to see what actually comes to fruition,\" she said.\nShe's not alone with other businesses and suppliers throughout the wine and spirits space trying to figure out the impacts of Trump's trade wars.\nImported wines and spirits make up 38% of the U.S. marketplace, according to the Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America.\nThe industry group opposes Trump's 200% tariffs. There are also worries the tariffs will eliminate European wines from the U.S. market, allowing domestic producers to raise prices because of less competition.\nLike other wine shops, bars and restaurants and liquor stores, Kiersky is trying to figure out paths forward if the tariffs happen.\nHer current inventories include wines from France, Italy, Spain and Austria.\nShe will be seeing what distributors have in stock before the tariffs start hitting prices and what she can order.\n\"Buyers like me are going to be looking to distributors and asking 'what do you have already here,'\" Kiersky said.\nKiersky expects to see some distributors and retailers order French and other European wines to try to get them in the U.S. before the new duties are levied.\nShe's also looking at creating a new European wine club featuring imported bottles that get into the U.S. before the tariffs are potentially enacted.\n\"I might do something that could get boxes out to people with the European wine we might have on hand,\" Kiersky said. \"Some hidden gems.\"\nCanadians upset with Trump's tariffs and his jabs that their country should become the 51st U.S. state have also been vowing to curtail travel to the U.S. and rescue their purchases of American products. That could impact tourism, including areas just across the border.\nTrump's promised tariffs and trade wars are prompting other businesses to look for innovative and creative hacks. Trump contends the tariffs will help spur domestic industries including winemakers.\nBut they are also rattling investors, consumers and business confidence.\nThe National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Small Optimism Index fell in February, and small business uncertainty levels are their highest since 1974, according to the national group.\nAnd that was before Trump's latest trade and tariffs volleys toward Canada and the European Union earlier this month. He's already imposed 20% blanket tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\"Uncertainty is high and rising on Main Street, and for many reasons,\" said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg in a statement March 11, citing small business concerns about inflation and labor conditions.\nConsumer confidence has also slipped significantly, according to the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers.\nUM Economist Joanne Hsu said consumer sentiment is worsening across income, political affiliations and geographic regions.\n\"Many consumers cited the high level of uncertainty around policy and other economic factors; frequent gyrations in economic policies make it very difficult for consumers to plan for the future, regardless of one's policy preferences,\" Hsu said in a statement on the preliminary March sentiment figures.\nStocks are down the past 30 days, as Wall Street and investors also worry about Trump's trade path and a potential economic slowdown.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is down more than 1,440 points and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are off 5.75% and 8.9%, respectively, the past 30 days as of the end of trading Friday, according to Google Finance.\nTrump vowed to stick with his tariffs, touting their use by former President William McKinley. He argued the tariffs will help address trade imbalances and inequities.\n\"April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!! For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!,\" Trump said in a social media post Friday morning.\nBut then during comments from the Oval Office, Trump also said there could be some \"flexibility\" with his promised reciprocal tariffs.\n\"..The word flexibility is an important word,\" Trump said. \"Sometimes it's flexibility. So there'll be flexibility, but basically it's reciprocal.\"\nHe's also pushed back on worries that tariffs will raise prices, disrupt supply chains (including for automakers, publishers and home builders) and hurt U.S. exports.\nTrump and other White House officials contend tariffs skeptics are globalists opposed to their populist agenda.\n\"The United States of America is going to take back a lot of what was stolen from it by other countries and, frankly, by incompetent U.S. leadership. We're going to take back our wealth and (we'll) take back a lot of the companies that left,\" said Trump in another post.\nBut Kiersky said the 200% tariffs on wine and French Champagne imports from the EU will hit a host of businesses and jobs — ranging from European vineyards and American distributors to wine shops, bars and restaurants. The U.S. is the largest wine market in the world totaling $107 billion, according to a 2024 report from BMO.\n\"Imported wines create more jobs on this side of the ocean than it does in Europe,\" she said. \"It affects so many people.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The national average is down 1.6 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 42.5 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\n\"For the first time in over a month, the national average price of gasoline has risen, driven by the final step in the transition to summer gasoline across wide portions of the country,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nMarch 24, 2024: $3.56 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.51 per gallon)March 24, 2023: $3.27 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.41 per gallon)March 24, 2022: $3.80 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.24 per gallon)March 24, 2021: $2.83 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.86 per gallon)March 24, 2020: $2.12 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.05 per gallon)March 24, 2019: $2.64 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.62 per gallon)March 24, 2018: $2.63 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.60 per gallon)March 24, 2017: $2.29 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.29 per gallon)March 24, 2016: $2.02 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.01 per gallon)March 24, 2015: $2.39 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.42 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $2.99 per gallon, up 1.7 cents per gallon from last week's $2.97 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.12 per gallon, down 1.9 cents per gallon from last week's $3.14 per gallon.Hagerstown: $2.89 per gallon, up 7.0 cents per gallon from last week's $2.82 per gallon.\nDe Haan said the increase this past week has nothing to do with politics or tariffs.\n\"(The increase) is instead the result of seasonality, and is something that happens almost every year,\" he said. \"Concerns over refinery maintenance have been muted so far this year, largely due to broader concerns about the U.S. economy, and demand remains soft. However, for those in the northeastern U.S. who have enjoyed relatively low gas prices compared to the national average, the final step in the transition to summer gasoline is still a few weeks away. Once it occurs, they too will likely see prices rise. For areas that have already completed the switch, ongoing economic uncertainty will likely prevent further major increases — for now.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Nothing better': Land surveyors shed light on profession's unique draw\n\n March 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 684\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS — Five years ago, Grant Foster didn't know much about the field of surveying.After graduating from college and completing an internship in an office, he was looking for a change in pace. That's when he took a job as a surveyor at Lane Engineering in 2022.\n\"I fell into it, and I loved it,\" Foster said.\nFoster, 24, has been a crew chief for two years. Instead of a 9-to-5 office job, he's in the field working on construction sites and properties across the Mid-Shore.\nLand surveying includes a wide variety of field work, often at construction sites and homes, such as denoting property boundaries, measuring land or locating utilities.\nLocal leaders in the industry say the demand for surveyors is high, particularly for young surveyors. Jeff Hubbard, Lane Engineering's chief of surveys, said there's a limited number of surveyors overall, making their time especially valuable.\nAs development on the Mid-Shore increases, that demand only rises. Surveying on the Shore comes with its unique challenges, Hubbard notes, from property lines meeting with the Chesapeake Bay to ensuring environmental regulations are followed.\nHubbard, who represents Eastern Shore counties on the board of the Maryland Society of Surveyors, said surveying \"has always had a marketing issue.\"\n\"When kids go to school, they don't think about becoming surveyors,\" Hubbard said. \"They think about becoming engineers. They think about becoming doctors, lawyers.\"\nBut for those who do find the field, it's sometimes a perfect fit. Heinlein enjoys that his job has him working in nature and with animals.\n\"Any kid who likes the outdoors, it's almost the perfect job for it,\" Heinlein said. \"You are outside all the time, seeing gorgeous views.\"\nTECHNOLOGY\nHubbard has been in the field since 1974 and has been a licensed land surveyor since 1986. He's seen surveying change drastically due to technology — compasses, rulers and protractors have been replaced by geographic information systems that can store and analyze points on a map.\n\"The ability to digitize all that has been a game-changer for the survey industry,\" Hubbard said. \"Today, those same people are out there locating the same things, but we don't have to pull a tape to find out how far away we are.\"\nOnce field surveyors gather the data, licensed surveyors work their magic inside, creating maps, designs and drawings often necessary for construction approvals from local agencies or commissions.\nBut two-dimensional, paper drawings haven't gone away yet, Hubbard says.\n\"At the end of the day, we still work in a world where the counties (and) approving agencies still are using paper,\" he said.\nHe hopes that Lane Engineering can continue to prioritize technological advancements, though some of that is limited based on what agencies require.\nFoster said technology initially captivated him when he began the job years ago.\n\"It will never be boots on the ground,\" Foster said. \"So, yes, technology helps us do our jobs better, but I don't think it'll ever take the surveyor out of the field.\"\n\"This isn't going anywhere,\" crew chief Michael Mitchell said. \"It's one of the oldest professions, and it's going to be necessary going forward. Whenever there's civil engineering going on, you're going to need surveyors to implement it.\"\nUNIQUE FIELD\nAt Lane Engineering, field crews often work at multiple sites in a day. The crew chief and a survey technician work together in what they say is an independent job.\nMitchell, who's been in the field for more than five years, enjoys that aspect.\n\"There's a lot of autonomy that goes with the job,\" Mitchell said. \"I'm given a task. I come out here, and I figure out what I think is the most effective way to get it done and it's up to me. I kind of get to call the shots out here within reason.\"\nEarlier this month, Mitchell was at Gannon Range in Easton, a construction site for a housing development coming to Matthewstown Road. He was marking the buffer area for where utility lines could be run.\nPlaying a role in important construction work is a neat part of the job to Mitchell.\n\"You see a lot of development and you're like, 'I remember when that was a field,' and now we're driving down the road,\" Mitchell said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Sophisticated yet approachable is concept behind new Betterton beachside restaurant\n\n March 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 589\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BETTERTON — Situated where the Bay meets the Sassafras River, the restaurant of the same name will be opening late spring.Over the years the property at 12 Ericsson Avenue had its share of owners with unique visions, from an Irish-themed bar, to a beachside restaurant with quick-service menu items and karaoke night, but this one could be the boldest yet.\nBeginning in June, Chef Paul Edward and his wife, Caroline Benkert, will offer dinner nightly, a prix fixe menu to \"20 souls\" Wednesday through Saturday at 6:30 p.m. at Sassafras.\nEdward explained, \"Whatever is caught that day we're going to prepare. This early spring, we are looking forward to Chesapeake blue crab, spawning rockfish, foraged morels, forest herbs and greens and rhubarb and asparagus.\"\nHe mentioned he has local watermen, hunters and farmers helping him prepare this food and complete his vision for the establishment.\n\"Our focus will be wild caught seafood from the Bay, water fowl during hunting season, foraged fruits and vegetables and hyper-seasonal produce from local farmers,\" Edward said.\nHe has ambitious plans for his cuisine. Having just put down the gravel in the parking lot, already downstairs there is fresh fish hanging, a humongous yellow-fin tuna and jumbo fluke dangling from rope, cooling.\nA quick glance around the chef's work area, tells you everything will be freshly made and prepared using homemade spices and herbs. He even makes his own kombucha, a fermented drink containing probiotics that may support gut health and improve digestion. Even the flour and corn flour is not store-bought.\nEdward reflects on a time in the distant past, how people prepared food before modern conveniences and heavy processing methods.\n\"I think back to the time when fish was roasted over fire and corn was made into batter and baked over coals and the smoke of oak perpetually perfumed,\" he said.\nHe and Benkert will deliver these types of meals in elegant fashion to no more than 20 diners in a supper club setting, an old idea, revitalized after COVID-19 lockdowns when people looked to connect again through food and cozy atmosphere.\nDiners step into a rustic yet tasteful setting that feels familiar with old, well-kept homes on the Eastern Shore. The floors are wood from this area, but burned in a Japanese style. There is a fireplace now, then the long chef's table, (where the bar used to be) with fine, vintage china purchased from a Crumpton auction which creates the familiar feel of a waterfront home.\nEdward describes it as \"modern Chesapeake cookery.\"\nWith 20 years experience owning the BlueBird-Baltimore, winner of the \"Best of Baltimore\" Readers' Poll for cocktails in 2018, 2020, 2021 and 2022, they are excited for this next project, a restaurant based on their understanding of food, nutrition and optimal health. Edward said he has ideas similar to Modern Stone Age Kitchen, to which owner Bill Schindler, is a friend and will be one of his first dining guests.\nThe property overlooks the beach, and as people are drawn to the Bay when the weather gets nicer, Edward and Benkert are hoping to build a consistent clientele.\n\"Our guests will experience the Chesapeake Bay, this ancient and beautiful body of water, through an intimate feast unlike any they've had before.\"\nApril dates are now available, with May reservations open soon for a first peek at the intimate Chef's Counter. Six seats will be open for a prix fixe, multi-course seafood forward menu. At an additional charge, are abbreviated alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage pairings or a quaint menu of potations by the glass.\nTo learn more or make a reservation visit https://www.restaurantsassafras.com/. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Gigantic costs': Trump auto tariffs to drive up car prices, repairs expenses, insurance premiums\n\n March 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: Business \n \n 1103\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on foreign-made automobiles and auto parts are expected to significantly raise prices for cars and auto repairs.Some estimates from industry analysts expect car and truck price hikes of between $5,000 and $12,000 per vehicle under Trump's tariff regime.\nBrian Moody, senior editor for Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book, said automakers could raise prices across the board to lessen sticker shocks for certain models.\n\"We estimate prices can go up anywhere between three and 25%. Most likely auto makers will try to spread that out across some of their vehicles that are made both inside and outside the U.S. so to reduce shock to the consumer if this goes through,\" Moody said.\nCarmakers and parts suppliers are already dealing with Trump's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum and 20% tariffs on all Chinese goods.\n\"It's reasonable to expect that vehicle prices will rise, which presents an added challenge to an industry that is already grappling with ongoing affordability concerns,\" said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights for Edmunds.com Inc. (an automotive research firm).\nMichigan-based Anderson Economic Group LLC estimates Trump's 25% tariffs will increase new car prices $4,000 to $10,000 for gasoline-power cars and trucks and as much as $12,000 for electric vehicles manufactured or outfitted parts outside the U.S.\nAn analysis of the tariffs by Anderson said the Trump regime \"will impose a gigantic set of costs on consumers.\"\nAnother analysis by TD Economics pegs a $5,000 price increase for cars impacted by Trump's tariffs.\nA number of industry analysts see Tesla as a winner from Trump's tariffs. Elon Musk's electric automaker produces its U.S. stock at plants in Texas and California.\n\"Tesla wins, Detroit bleeds,\" wrote wealth management firm Bernstein senior auto analyst Daniel Roeska in a Thursday note to clients, according to CNBC. The Bernstein analyst projects Trump's auto tariffs to total $100 billion and add $6,250 to car prices.\nMusk, a top Trump backer and who runs Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) austerity measures, said in a social media statement.\n\"Important to note that Tesla is not unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk said in social media statement on his X platform.\nCar prices are already high.\nAccording to Edmunds, the average sale price for a new vehicle was $47,373 in February. The average sale prices for used cars and trucks was $25,005.\nAccording to the White House, approximately 16 million vehicles were sold in the U.S. in 2024 with roughly half of those imports.\nThe White House said among domestic vehicles between 50% of 60% of their parts and components were foreign sourced.\nIndustry analysts expect new car sales to dip when potential tariff price jumps are felt and there could be upward pressures on used cars with higher demand and higher prices across the marketplace.\nThe potential for higher prices for cars comes as U.S. consumer sentiment slides and Wall Street investors worry about the tariffs bringing higher prices, disrupted supply chains and slower economic growth.\n\"The increased demand for used cars that tariffs might bring could impact used car prices down the road. Used car prices almost always follow new car prices,\" Moody said.\nHIGHER REPAIR COSTS\nTrump's tariffs will also increase the prices of auto repairs and car insurance premiums, according to industry analysts.\n\"Many vehicle parts are sourced globally, which would increase repair costs for car owners, and reconditioning costs for dealers. Insurance premiums will also likely increase as any accidents involving new parts will see increased costs as well,\" Caldwell said.\nCar insurance costs are already up across the country since the pandemic. They could increase more with higher prices for imported aftermarket auto parts and components due to the tariffs, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC).\nJonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, an Atlanta-based research group, says the Trump tariffs could increase car prices by 10% and if they are extended more broadly to globally-sourced parts that \"inflation would surge in maintenance and repair and insurance, which vehicle owners are already struggling to handle.\"\nMoody said \"anyone who thinks they might have a major repair in the near future should probably make an appointment to get their car looked at soon.\"\nTrump announced the tariffs March 26.\n\"The 25% tariff will be applied to imported passenger vehicles (sedans, SUVs, crossovers, minivans, cargo vans) and light trucks, as well as key automobile parts (engines, transmissions, powertrain parts, and electrical components), with processes to expand tariffs on additional parts if necessary., White House said in a statement.\nVehicles and parts from Canada and Mexico under a 2018 trade deal negotiated with Trump \"will be given the opportunity to certify their U.S. content and systems will be implemented such that the 25% tariff will only apply to the value of their non-U.S. content,\" according to the White House.\nTrump wants to bring back auto and other manufacturing to the U.S. and has been promising more tariffs on other countries and industries on April 2.\n\"If they are made in the United States, there is absolutely no tariff,' Trump said. He said the tariffs are encouraging investments in the U.S. \"Business is coming back to the United States so they don't have to pay tariffs.\"\nTrump also said he favors tax and interest deductions for purchases of American-made cars. He has also warned U.S. automakers not to raise their prices, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nThe United Auto Workers (UAW) backs Trump's tariffs, criticizing decades of free trade policies that created global supply chains.\n\"We applaud the Trump administration for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working class communities for decades. Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today's actions,\" said UAW President Shawn Fain.\nThe UAW said there are under-utilized car and truck plants in Ohio, Michigan and North Carolina that could accommodate increased domestic production.\nIndustry analysts said Trump's tariffs will lead car dealers and automakers to get rid of customer incentives, which could add to affordability challenges and potentially fewer moderately priced models and trims.\n\"This is difficult news for an industry already staring down an affordability problem,\" said Erin Keating, an executive analyst with Cox.\n\"Affordable new vehicles are already few and far between — there are only 27 vehicles available with prices starting below $30,000, four of which have already been discontinued: the Chevy Malibu and Nissan Versa ending production this year and the Nissan Altima on the chopping block. Many are sourced from Mexico, Japan and South Korea. Tariffs of 25% or more at the border change the dynamics drastically — pushing prices higher on average by $5,300. Last year, these models made up 13% of all vehicles sold in the U.S.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

But by December, that changed.\nDiscovering internet deserts across the Eastern Shore and being able to fill those voids has been one of the more positive results of the COVID pandemic.\nChoptank Electric Cooperative and its subsidiary Choptank Fiber provided Kids Landing Playcare with broadband access. Now, Kuebel says everything from internet speed to system security has improved.\n\"Knowing that all of that has been taken care of is just peace of mind,\" Kuebel said.\nSince the pandemic's onset, broadband expansion has been a hot button topic. Maryland has an Office of Statewide Broadband that aims to connect all residents, while local providers have worked furiously since the pandemic to extend services. Need still exists, though, predominantly in rural areas.\nTimothy McGaha, Choptank Electric's vice president of technical services, said the pandemic \"turned up the temperature on the desire\" for broadband infrastructure as parents worked remotely and children attended school online.\n\"We heard all those stories of people saying, 'I have to take my kid to the McDonald's and sit in the parking lot so they can do their work because schools are closed,'\" said Valerie Connelly, Choptank Electric's vice president of government affairs and public relations.\n\"The whole team really tried to find a way to do it as quickly as we possibly could,\" Connelly said.\nPEOPLE HELPED\nMarty Bollinger, an Easton Utilities customer, has been back and forth between Washington, D.C. and Claiborne for a number of years. He said internet access was a \"real problem\" during the pandemic when both of his children were in school.\nBut recently, Easton Utilities and its Easton Velocity service connected Bollinger's Claiborne residence, which he says has made a huge difference.\nEaston Velocity's Connect Talbot initiative has reached 1,900 subscribers since 2021, according to Easton Utilities communications director Kelly Simonsen.\n\"I have had exceptional support from Easton Utilities on this,\" Bollinger said. \"I am really impressed with their people. They're very professional, very responsive.\"\nColin Campbell's parents, Neil and Barbara, live in rural Wicomico County and had an access gap the size of the Grand Canyon, their son said. It impacted their ability to be on conference calls or attend public meetings on Zoom.\nChoptank Electric extended broadband fiber to their house around six months ago.\n\"They did everything they possibly could to serve our area as quickly as the red tape would allow,\" Colin Campbell said of Choptank Electric.\nAt Kuebel's Stevensville Playcare, broadband has made a difference not just in internet speed, but also business. With reliable internet, Kuebel can now accommodate multiple parents for co-working sessions, where parents work in-house as their children are cared for in the room next door.\nThe internet improvements have led the business to staff more employees since more parents and children are showing up, Kuebel said.\nCHALLENGES\nAs residents nationwide clamored for high-speed access during the pandemic, Easton Utilities and Choptank Electric both began their respective broadband efforts in 2021. Providers have faced unique challenges.\nSimonsen says Easton Utilities, a nonprofit, is bound to follow the criteria laid out in the grants it receives.\n\"We cannot jeopardize the grant funding, and likely any future grant opportunities, by serving a property that has not been specifically dedicated for service,\" Simonsen wrote.\nFunding from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 has supported many state and county initiatives, such as the Maryland Emergency Broadband Benefit, which provided $15 subsidies to households for internet costs. That program shut down in 2024 due to a lack in funding.\nColin Campbell, a West Ocean City resident, says broadband access is a \"systemic issue\" on the Eastern Shore that predates the pandemic.\n\"Even if we're talking about 2005, 20 years ago, in my opinion it's still as critical as electricity,\" he said. \"Because how are you supposed to be a student?\"\n\"The fact that this continues to be this struggle where private industry has to continue to fight to get grant money ... is fascinating to me,\" he added. \"In 2025, we're still having this conversation.\"\nThe underserved and rural areas that remain unconnected are the \"toughest and most expensive\" projects, McGaha says.\n\"While the temperature has been turned down from a big portion of our membership and the people on the Shore,\" McGaha said, \"there's still those people that are left (that) are the most expensive and most difficult to get to.\"\nThis April will be Choptank Fiber's four-year anniversary of its first customer. The 5,000-customer mark has since been reached. Choptank Electric leaders say they're excited to embark on the next four years of providing crucial broadband coverage to more Eastern Shore residents.\n\"We're still early in this,\" McGaha said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moore is recommending an increase in Maryland's capital gains tax and an increase in the personal income tax. In each instance, the increase will only be for higher levels of income. Of course, such a tax will primarily affect those with the largest stake in the state's economy.In contrast, Canada's new prime minister recently announced he will not propose or support an increase in Canada's capital gains tax. While this may not seem especially perspicacious since the Canadian capital gains rate is already at 50%, it certainly does recognize a limit to what is economically sensible. It's wishful thinking but would be nice, therefore, if Canada's experience helped educate Gov. Moore and Maryland about the pitfalls of pushing the private sector too far.\nART CECIL\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 18.7 cents per gallon higher than a month ago and stand 39.3 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has increased 0.9 cents in the last week and stands at $3.558 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.39 per gallon yesterday while the most expensive was $3.89 per gallon, a difference of $1.50 per gallon. The lowest price in the state Sunday was $2.39 per gallon while the highest was $3.89 per gallon, a difference of $1.50 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 2.7 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.11 per gallon Monday. The national average is up 2.2 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 39.7 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nMarch 31, 2024: $3.56 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.51 per gallon)March 31, 2023: $3.39 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.48 per gallon)March 31, 2022: $3.79 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.22 per gallon)March 31, 2021: $2.79 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.87 per gallon)March 31, 2020: $2.03 per gallon (U.S. Average: $1.95 per gallon)March 31, 2019: $2.65 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.69 per gallon)March 31, 2018: $2.67 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.66 per gallon)March 31, 2017: $2.32 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.32 per gallon)March 31, 2016: $2.08 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.06 per gallon)March 31, 2015: $2.37 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.41 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.17 per gallon, up 17.7 cents per gallon from last week's $2.99 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.21 per gallon, up 9.0 cents per gallon from last week's $3.12 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.07 per gallon, up 18.4 cents per gallon from last week's $2.89 per gallon.\n\"We've seen the national average inch up for the second straight week, but with renewed refinery issues on the West Coast, gas prices there are likely to jump 10 to 35 cents per gallon over the next couple weeks. Meanwhile, motorists in the Northeast should consider filling up soon, as the final step in the transition to summer gasoline is just a couple of weeks away— and with it, a likely increase in prices,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"As we head into April, Americans should expect gas prices to rise, with a peak that could occur in mid-to-late April. While average prices remain well below last year's levels, we'll likely begin to catch up, with prices expected to increase in most— if not all—states over the next few weeks. Continued uncertainty around whether tariffs will be implemented on April 2 could also impact pump prices, setting the stage for a volatile period for American drivers.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It features indoor and outdoor seating as well as parking for customers. The cafe is relocating from its Aurora Street building.\nBut that location will remain, the Grolls said. The main production area at Aurora Street, previously attached to the cafe, will expand, allowing the bakery some extra flexibility.\nEat Sprout offers local and organic food and drinks, including scratch-made bread and bowls. In addition to Easton, it has shops in St. Michaels and Annapolis, including one in the Statehouse.\nEat Sprout's Easton location opened in 2018. Seven years in, the move to be closer to Easton's downtown core is already paying dividends, Ryan Groll says.\n\"It exceeded our expectations for sure,\" he said. \"From the volume of people, the exposure and what kind of feedback that we're getting from the guests.\"\nGroll said the new space is more purposeful and thought out in terms of spacing, storage and products. The ambiance and indoor seating will make a huge difference in the customer experience, he said.\nThe business has already noticed customers encouraging family, friends and co-workers to come see the new space and try it out.\n\"They're not just coming in to shop for themselves,\" Groll said, \"but now they're meeting a friend there to enjoy a coffee and a snack or a meal and then grabbing what they need to take to go.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland lawmakers push for new power plants\n\n April 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RACHEL McCREA Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1385\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As energy issues take center stage in Annapolis, lawmakers are pushing to build new energy generation projects in Maryland.Regional supply-demand issues and a coming leap in energy prices have lawmakers concerned about consumer energy costs and reliability. They're considering measures to build new energy as they try to lower costs for Marylanders, work around regional grid issues and make the state more self-sufficient.\n\"All of us are concerned about the prices,\" said Del. Lorig Charkoudian, a Democrat from Montgomery County. \"All of us are working really hard to figure out how to alleviate the impact on ratepayers.\"\nBills introduced this session would promote building more in-state energy projects, including natural gas, nuclear, renewables and battery storage. These bills come even as some experts doubt that Maryland really needs to build more energy production right now.\nWhat's driving this push for new in-state energy?\nIncoming data centers and manufacturing have boosted demand across the multi-state regional grid. Electrification is also a factor.\nThe regional grid operator has warned of the possibility of a capacity shortage by the middle of next year.\nReliability issues might be a growing concern, but the more urgent issue with this supply-demand mismatch is affordability.\n\"Currently, there is sufficient generation and supply to keep the grid reliable, but the cost has skyrocketed,\" said Abe Silverman, an assistant research scholar at Johns Hopkins University's Ralph O'Connor Sustainable Energy Institute.\nDelays in getting new energy projects up and running are contributing to this strain. A huge backlog of projects have been waiting for approval to plug into the grid, but that process has \"imploded,\" Silverman said.\nCalled the \"queue,\" the approval process was designed to handle hundreds of large projects like natural gas, nuclear, and oil. Thousands of smaller renewable energy projects have overwhelmed the queue recently, Silverman said, causing wait times to jump from two years up to five.\nProjects have to deal with other roadblocks like siting and permitting, local opposition, and supply chain issues once they are approved. The regional grid operator is implementing reforms to deal with the queue.\nOn top of that, energy prices for 2025 and 2026 shot up last summer. Ratepayers wouldn't begin to feel the impact until June.\nPJM holds a \"capacity auction\" each year, where they pay generators in exchange for the promise that power plants will be around to produce energy when needed. In the summer of 2024, capacity prices at the auction for the entire grid went from $2.2 billion to $14.7 billion, a 800% increase.\nA report from the Office of People's Counsel, which represents Maryland's residential ratepayers, estimates that the average residential BGE customer would see an extra $16 on their monthly electric bills because of the auction. Allegheny Power System customers (including Potomac Edison customers) will see an $18 increase, Delmarva customers will have a $4 increase, and Pepco customers will pay an extra $14 per month. The increases will hit after June 1 of this year.\n\"They're making decisions that are harming our constituents, harming our ratepayers, harming our communities,\" Charkoudian said. \"And so again, we're here kind of going 'Okay, so, like, what's within our control? What are the things we can affect even though we can't affect, directly, these markets that are driving up prices for our consumers?'\"\nA spokesperson from PJM wrote that almost all of its meetings and voting are public. PJM doesn't make a profit, he said, and its directors cannot have financial stakes in members of the organization. It has over one thousand members belonging to different sectors like generation, transmission and distribution, as well as customers and consumer advocates.\n\"PJM favors no fuel or technology,\" he wrote. \"We do not plan generation; we study projects requesting to interconnect to the grid for their impact on reliability and to make sure they can deliver electricity throughout the region. Nearly all the projects we are studying — and the 50,000 (megawatts) we have cleared to build — are renewable.\"\nHe wrote that auction prices were high this year because of increased peak load predictions, power plant retirements, and market reforms.\nWhat solutions to these issues are legislators considering?\nAt a very basic level, there are three basic ways to address these energy issues, Silverman said: generate more, import more or use less. The state could build more energy generation, build more transmission lines or work to cut back on usage.\nIt's up to policymakers to decide which solutions to use and how, and a number of bills are backing option one: building new power in Maryland.\nDemocratic leadership is sponsoring a legislative package that would promote building new natural gas, nuclear, and other types of \"dispatchable energy.\" Gov. Wes Moore's energy bill also supports new nuclear, which would be funded by ratepayers. Charkoudian is the lead sponsor on legislation that would support building more energy storage, provide clean energy credits for nuclear, and incentivize solar. It also supports relicensing the state's only nuclear power plant.\nMeanwhile, a bill enjoying bipartisan support in the Senate would take a hard look at Maryland's current energy policies. If it's passed, a team of experts would have to find a way for the state to cut back on imports and increase in-state energy generation.\nMaryland needs to \"reverse course\" on its energy policies and prioritize energy reliability and affordability, said bill sponsor Chris West, a Republican from Baltimore and Carroll counties.\n\"If I can get that (bill) through, I will be a happy camper,\" he said.\nMaryland currently imports 40% of its electricity from out of state.\n\"I don't want to say that there aren't legitimate concerns about relying on power imported from other places, but the reality is … that Maryland has long imported portions of its generation,\" People's Counsel Lapp said. \"Generally, it's ranged around 40%, but sometimes goes up and sometimes goes down.\"\nBut it can be more cost-effective if energy doesn't have to travel as far between where it's produced and where it's consumed, said Adam Dubitsky, the consulting state director for the Maryland Land & Liberty Coalition.\nExisting plants in Maryland could have cut imports in half in 2023 by producing more in-state energy, Lapp said, but that would have been more expensive for them than imports.\nHow much more in-state energy does Maryland need?\nNone, at least not immediately, according to the Office of People's Counsel.\n\"What we're finding is that there is not an immediate reliability crisis to address,\" Lapp said.\nHe said there could be reasons to build more energy in Maryland, like meeting clean energy goals, but the state isn't seeing the same demand growth from data centers as other areas. The only similar concern in Maryland would be the coming retirement of a power plant, but PJM is building a new transmission project to make up for the loss of energy. A study from the Office of People's Counsel found that the transmission will be enough to make up for the loss and even provide more capacity without needing to build more power in Maryland.\n\"Based on current forecasts, assuming there is overall enough supply to meet PJM's demand, Maryland should be in good shape,\" Lapp said. \"If PJM as a region falls short, you know, Maryland could fall short. But that's not a Maryland-specific problem.\" It would be expensive and unrealistic for Maryland to build all the energy the grid is demanding, he said.\nWest, the sponsor of the task force bill, is worried about potential brownouts, blackouts, and expensive imports if the grid doesn't have enough energy supply.\nWhen asked to choose between paying for new generation in Maryland or facing blackouts and pricey imports, \"I think you'd find the people of Maryland say, 'we think we'd rather bite the bullet and generate it locally,'\" West said.\nCharkoudian said the idea of blackouts was \"absolutely inaccurate.\" Higher prices are on the horizon because of the capacity market, but not blackouts, she said.\nThe reality, Silverman said, is that PJM has less surplus power than it used to. There's still enough to keep the lights on, but the safety buffer has shrunk.\n\"I would say we're in the yellow zone, not the red zone,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, he said, consumers are in a financial crisis.\n\"Energy poverty is a real thing in the United States, and as we sort of balance the need to talk about climate change and … other localized environmental issues, we also need to talk about customer affordability, because that also has really profound impacts on people's quality of life,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So, I pinch myself every day, it's awesome.\"\nThe Oxford Bellevue Ferry is America's oldest privately owned ferry. Its original ownership was established in 1683. As its name implies, the ferry provides transportation services for vehicles, bicycles, motorcycles and passengers between the incorporated town of Oxford and the historic working community of Bellevue.\nPrevious owners Tom and Judy Bixler sold the fleet to Andrews this past February and will be enjoying retirement, but they still will be helping out with the ferry when they can.\n\"I won't lie to you, It's bitter sweet,\" previous owner Tom Bixler said. \"It's a wonderful day knowing that we've got the perfect successor. A gentleman who's highly professionally trained and has great business sense. It's exciting, but it's an end of an era. I got the privilege and the honor to own the ferry, I'm only one of three owners in 90 some-odd years.\"\nIn their 24 years of ownership, the Bixlers are proud of how they brought the ferry forward.\n\"The fact that I think we brought the ferry forward so that she can go another 100 years,\" Tom Bixler said. \"There was a time there it was getting harder and harder. We got some great cooperation from the state, the county, but the key here is the fact that community supports it so well and the people of Maryland, I mean it's an icon, so we're very fortunate.\"\nResidents brought food items and beverages to the docks to toast the new captain and celebrate the history of the ferry.\nThe Rev. Kevin Cross conducted the Blessing of the Fleet and wrote a song to help introduce Andrews.\nPapers with the lyrics were printed out and residents sung along while Cross flung holy water around the vessel.\nAfter Andrews was introduced, he presented the previous owners with an oar, which symbolized retirement.\n\"Our relationship, it transcends past past the commercial buyer seller, and we're just partners in maintaining and supporting the ferry,\" Andrews said. \"So we couldn't be more pleased with our friendship and relationship with the Bixlers.\"\nWhen asked if he had a message for Talbot County residents, Andrews said, \"be so thankful that you live close to Heaven here in Talbot County and come ride the ferry.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 31.2 cents per gallon higher than a month ago and stand 35.2 cents per gallon lower than a year ago.The national average price of diesel has increased 3.6 cents in the last week and stands at $3.594 per gallon.\nAccording to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.89 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $3.79 per gallon, a difference of 90.0 cents per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 10.6 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.21 per gallon Monday. The national average is up 13.2 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 35.6 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nApril 7, 2024: $3.60 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.57 per gallon)April 7, 2023: $3.50 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.58 per gallon)April 7, 2022: $3.74 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.14 per gallon)April 7, 2021: $2.78 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.87 per gallon)April 7, 2020: $1.99 per gallon (U.S. Average: $1.89 per gallon)April 7, 2019: $2.68 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.74 per gallon)April 7, 2018: $2.67 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.66 per gallon)April 7, 2017: $2.35 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.39 per gallon)April 7, 2016: $2.06 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.04 per gallon)April 7, 2015: $2.35 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.38 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.25 per gallon, up 8.5 cents per gallon from last week's $3.17 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.20 per gallon, down 0.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.21 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.24 per gallon, up 17.0 cents per gallon from last week's $3.07 per gallon.\n\"While the national average price of gasoline saw its largest weekly gain of the year, it likely won't last long, as oil prices have plummeted amid growing concerns about the global economy following the U.S. announcement of some of the most significant tariffs in over a century, along with OPEC+ restoring oil production faster than anticipated,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"In addition to falling oil prices, the stock market has dropped sharply, and the risk of a recession has increased — raising the likelihood of reduced global energy and oil demand, which is sending prices lower. As a result, motorists can expect gas prices to begin falling nearly coast-to-coast, with oil now at its lowest level since the early days of the pandemic in 2021. If tariffs aren't scaled back soon, the national average could fall below $3 per gallon in the weeks ahead, with no clear indication of how long it might stay there as market volatility persists.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But according to the U.S. Trade Representatives office, Russia imported $3 billion worth of goods and raw materials into the U.S. last year.\nThe U.S. has a $2.5 billion trade deficit with Russia, according to USTR. Under the formula used by the Trump administration to levy import duties, Russia could have seen a 42% tariff.\nRussia ranks among the top 65 countries importing goods and materials into the U.S, according to Trading Economics.\nRussia has more U.S. imports than Sri Lanka, which was facing a 44% U.S. tariff, as well as Serbia (37% tariff), Laos (48%) and Myanmar (44%) before Trump announced his pause and retreat to a 10% rate.\nWhile some Russia products have been restricted by war sanctions (which Trump has hinted at easing as part of his efforts to forge a ceasefire in Ukraine), there have continued to be precious metals and rare earths imports into the U.S.\nRussia's exclusion has salience in one U.S. state, in Montana, where GOP lawmakers supportive of Trump want to see prohibitions on Russian metals and rare earths imports until the end of the war in Ukraine contending they are hurting the state's mining industry.\nMontana is the only U.S. state where platinum and palladium (which is used to make catalytic converters) are mined.\nRussia is a top exporter of the metals as well as other rare earths.\nSibanye-Stillwater Ltd. (a South Africa-based mining conglomerate) operates two platinum and palladium mines in Montana and laid off 640 of its statewide workforce (40% of its footprint) late last year.\nThe mining company blamed Russia dumping for a contemporary drop in palladium prices.\nSibanye-Stillwater is backing a bill put forward by Montana's four Republican members of Congress to ban Russian imports of palladium, platinum and other metals and rare earths including zinc, copper, nickel, braggite and ruthenium until the war ends.\nU.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy and U.S. Reps. Troy Downing and Ryan Zinke, all Republicans, introduced the Russian import restrictions bill Feb. 28.\nThat was the same day as Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance argued with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House calling him ungrateful for U.S. war aid after he told them not to trust Putin, citing Russia's 2022 and 2014 invasions.\nTrump, who has also imposed 25% tariffs on automotive, auto parts, steel and aluminum imports (including from Canada and Mexico, could have impacted Russian trade flows with his \"Liberation Day\" import taxes.\nDowning said in a statement that existing Ukraine war sanctions serve as tariffs against Russia. but that he wants to see Congress and Trump approve the legislation.\n\"America's existing sanctions regime already serves as a tariff against Russia. Targeted import bans like the Stop Russian Market Manipulation Act would put meaningful pressure on the Kremlin and improve outcomes for Montana miners. I'll be pursuing every available legislative avenue to see this bill enacted into law as soon as possible for my constituents,\" said Downing, a freshman Republican whose district includes the Montana mines.\nDaines also said he supports Trump's goals of more balanced trade flows and increasing U.S. manufacturing.\n\"I've been in close contact with the White House to share Montanans' concerns, and I share President Trump's goal of ending unfair trade practices and increasing Made-In-America manufacturing and production. In the Senate, I'm fighting for ways to expand market access for Montana producers and businesses overseas and will always always support Montana farmers, ranchers and businesses,\" Daines said.\nThe Trump tariffs have stirred worries about higher prices, slower growth, trade wars and a potential recession. The president and his economic team argue the import taxes will \"re-industrialize\" the U.S. via increased domestic manufacturing while settling inequitable trade scores.\nThe U.S. administration is indicating Trump is willing to deal with Japan, South Korea and other countries. But China and the EU are tougher situations to resolve.\nTrump has struck friendly tones toward Putin and Russia since taking office. The U.S. president has said he trusts Putin and has joined Russia in opposing Ukraine joining NATO.\nTrump has said his goal is to the end the war in Ukraine, but the U.S. also voted with Russia on United Nations resolutions and against Kyiv and Europe regarding the third anniversary of the 2022 invasion.\nTrump previously said tariffs and more sanctions could be issued against Russia as part of efforts to stop the Ukraine war.\nBut Russia and two of its war allies, North Korea and Belarus (which also face sanctions), were not on the sandwich board displaying Trump's tariffs.\n\"They've actually put tariffs on penguins but not on Putin,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, on the Trump import taxes on Antarctic islands and not Moscow. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Two participants explained how the program has made an impact on their businesses.\nJen Wagner, an Easton mosaic artist, said the courses offered her an opportunity to take a step up — even in her 21st year as a small business owner.\n\"I'm at a pivotal point in my career,\" Wagner said. \"I've experienced a lot of success, but I'm ready to take it to the next level.\"\n\"It completely changed my life,\" she said of the program. \"I needed people that I could trust to look at things with a fresh pair of eyes. The mentorships were the most important things to me, to be able to talk to experts from legal, from accounting.\"\nNolan Laguna of Laguna Floor Care, in his fourth year as an entrepreneur, said the academy gave his four children the opportunity to watch him develop as a business leader.\nThe training program was created by Will Holmes Consulting, a Baltimore-based business management firm, and its founder Will Holmes. The Talbot County Economic Development and Tourism office and its director Cassandra Vanhooser spearheaded the effort.\nDuring the academy's courses, participants learned about organizational infrastructure, growth planning, human resources and legal practices, and financial documentation.\nVanhooser thanked the County Council for funding cohorts of the business academy through American Rescue Plan Act dollars. The Rural Maryland Council funded the third cohort, she said.\n\"Your investment sends a strong message: that Talbot County believes in its entrepreneurs and is willing to back that belief with action,\" Vanhooser said.\nOf the third group's 14 members, Vanhooser recognized a common theme of courage.\n\"It takes guts to step out on your own, to embrace risk and to believe in your vision enough to pursue that in the face of uncertainty,\" she said. \"These individuals rose to the challenge.\"\nLast year, the Talbot Works Business Academy graduated its first two cohorts. Vanhooser said of all businesses who have taken the academy to date, there have been 11 new employees added, three businesses expanded and two participants launching second businesses.\n\"Here in Talbot County, we know that small businesses are the heartbeat of our local economy,\" Vanhooser said. \"They create jobs, bring innovation and build the character of our towns and communities.\"\nThe 14 graduates honored Tuesday were: Olamide Adejumo, Motivar Consulting; Maria Bowser, In Vein Phlebotomy; Ann Casamento, Easton Advanced Aesthetics; Amanda Cook, Tilghman Island Baking Company; Jair Devereaux, JusJai2; Johanna Duke, Southern Jo's Kitchen and Bar; Nolan Laguna, Laguna Floor Care; Pamela Limberry, Care Partner Perfection; Kristen Lycett, Phillips Wharf Environmental Center; Jeffrey Mathias, Mathias Marine Services; Monika Mraz, Doehrn Tea Company; Demar Mundy, DM Trucking; Lamont Powell, The Powell's Trash Removal Service; and Jen Wagner, Jen Wagner Mosaics. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Jake Day visits Caroline County to discuss economic development and housing\n\n April 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 465\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Jake Day, the state's secretary of housing and community development, visited Caroline County as part of his tour through the state Wednesday.While in Denton, Day spoke with businesses owners, development officials and county officials and conducted a walking tour of downtown to identify places where state money could be leveraged.\nWhile talking with business owners and development officials, constituents voiced concerns about connecting with the right state department or program to receive the help they need with funding and repairs. Day believes that Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development could help bridge that gap of communication.\n\"I'm not here today to tell you the Maryland Department of Housing Community Development is going to solve every economic challenge you have on the county hand,\" Day said to constituents. \"We can be a piece of the puzzle. We're a part of the equation. We can say, we'll bring our colleagues in from MDOT, we'll bring our colleagues in from the MBE, let's get them in the room.\"\nWhile the department is not the main provider for all state grants, it has helped provide Choptank Electric Cooperative with a great amount of funding.\n\"Choptank Fiber has acquired about $18 million dollars in grant funding through DHCD. We completed those grants in a very timely fashion. We continue to do deployment throughout the county,\" said Matthew Teffeau, manager of government affairs and economic development for Choptank Electric Cooperative.\nIn addition to $18 million in funding for broadband, the department has provided 37 rental units and about $10 million in financing for avoidable housing from 2020 through 2024.\nAfter the conversation, Day participated in the walking tour through downtown Denton, visiting multiple business.\nThe purpose of Day's tour around the state is to engage county leaders and municipal representatives to show how the state can collaborate with counties in the areas of housing, community and economic development, and small business support through grants and other programs.\n\"I love doing this,\" Day said. \"Today is an opportunity to meet directly with entrepreneurs, banks, chamber of commerce, business owners, mayors, Main Street managers, and county commissioners and have a conversation with them about their aspirations and their needs.\"\n\"Our agency is best suited to help these communities with their visions,\" he continues. \"We don't tell them what their visions are, we don't tell them what to aspire to, we serve their visions.\"\nDay spent about 20 minutes at each business, looking around and learning more about downtown Denton. Town of Denton Mayor Abigail McNinch thanked Day for all the help the DHCD has provided to Caroline County.\n\"We are so excited because for him to see the projects that DHCD has worked on and has helped us accomplish and also look forward to projects that he and his department can help with, it's invaluable, we're really excited,\" McNinch said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some of those stopped by the law offices of Campbell and Furneisen to celebrate the company's one-year anniversary.Partners Bridget Campbell and Ivette Furneisen were both nominated for Eastern Shore's 2024 Women to Watch. And according to their website, Furneisen is \"one of very few Spanish-speaking lawyers on the shore, and possibly the only native Spanish-speaking. It continues, \"Furneisen has quickly gained a reputation as a friend to Hispanics and other immigrants in the area, helping with traffic and family court, visas and applications for citizenship.\"\nFurneisen said this anniversary is a significant celebration due to that distinction.\nOver sparkling beverages and catering courtesy of Happy Chicken, and while balancing conversation with friends and well-wishers, Furneisen shared why she feels like her work is more vital than ever.\nIt started, she said, 15 years ago. In her native country of Spain, she was working for a nonprofit doing immigration work. She extended that realm of her expertise by studying law at George Mason University. Ultimately, she and her husband, who worked for American Airlines, discovered Kent County.\nNow a year in to running her own practice advocating for Spanish speakers, she expressed concern for her clients, some of whom had been detained by immigration police being caught in offenses such as traffic violations.\nThese incidences, she said, are why she decided to pursue law further.\n\"Everyone deserves representation. It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor,\" Furneisen stated.\nShe takes a lot of cases from the public defender's office for those who normally could not afford a lawyer.\n\"Now, I can be an advocate for them. And not just in the courts. I really care,\" she said.\nThe other half of the firm is Bridget Campbell. She handles family law, real estate, business formation and other practices.\nLike her legal partner, Campbell is grateful to be representing Kent County. With both of them working jointly, they cast a wide net of services.\nSome of the most rewarding work is representing children as a best interest attorney, Campbell said. It is her job to advocate for children, give them a voice, and from those assessments, persuade the judge to act in the children's best interest.\nThis involves talking to the parents, the therapists and the children, being present for them in their time of need, Campbell said. As a mother of three boys, this is very near to her heart as she reflects on her time studying law at Villanova, before attending Washington College.\nOriginally born in Pennsylvania, she has established roots here after studying law at Villanova and attending Washington College. She is president of the Kent County Humane Society, dedicated to promoting animal welfare, \"preventing unnecessary pain and suffering for domestic companions in the community.\"\nBoth attorneys see themselves reaching beyond their law profession to help those in need.\n\"Ivette and I find a way to give back to the community every way we can,\" Campbell said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They can also find worm castings if so obliged.Samantha Arcand, owner of Arcand Wrigglers Worm Castings based out of Centreville, is selling her castings to Chestertown customers for the first time .\nShe defined worm castings as just worm manure, which is highly beneficial for the garden, and one of the few types of manure that can be spread over plants safely without going through a cold composting, also called freezing, process.\nThe castings resembles black soil, which she sells in a bag for $10.\nThe process of using worm manure as compost, known as vermicomposting, involves feeding worms food scraps, which the worms then turn into nutrient-rich organic fertilizer.\nArcand started this business last spring, going full time, leaving her job at Target in Kent Island to pursue her passion for vermiculture.\nAs a hobby farmer over 20 years, she unlocked the magic of castings when feeding the worms to her pet turtles. Over time, by using the worm castings in her garden, her plants grew healthy and numerous.\n\"My garden just exploded,\" Arcand said. \"Right now, I have two freezers full of cucumbers.\"\nShe uses two breeds of worm for the castings: red wrigglers, a very common worm, and European nightcrawlers.\nThe worms are happy too — not an easy task to accomplish. They live in an enclosed garage, with an air conditioner and heater to maintain the temperature at a comfy 65 degrees. Any subtle change to that and the worms look to bail out.\nWithin the garage, she keeps the worms inside big wooden flow bins about 2 feet deep. The worms are fed a combination of worm chow, a mix of horse, chicken and livestock feed, and most excess waste from Arcand's garden.\n\"They get all the fruits and veggies, and everything we don't eat,\" Arcand said, who stressed the importance of keeping in mind to balance the acidity.\nWith this very natural diet, she guarantees the nutrient analysis of her product.\nWorm castings will not burn up plants like other fertilizers, Arcand says. She tells customers worm castings are rich in micronutrients: sulfur, iron, zinc, calcium and copper; and provide macronutrients: potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus. Research, she added, has shown worm castings enhance seed germination, plant growth, flowering and fruit production.\nArcand offers this information in instructional videos on Tik Tok. Last week for instance, Arcand demonstrated online what the best kind of bedding to use when raising worms is.\nIn addition to Chestertown, you can find her at markets in Centreville, Kent Island, and soon in Makers Market in Georgetown, Delaware. You can also get her products on Amazon, Ebay or at arcandwigglers.com.\nWhat is next for Arcand's business? Much like worms do, Arcand would like to see her business multiply.\nShe wants to sell the worms as well as their \"dirt,\" but she pointed out she needs to get up to 1 million worms to start selling them. She is well on her way, daily spotting the multiple little golden orb eggs worms leave behind.\nIn the meantime, gardeners will enjoy using this product, Arcand said, and the plants will enjoy feeding from it. As her mottos states, \"Let us feed your plants so that they can feed you.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

But he said Talbot County is one market that seems to be thriving.\"It's one of the markets that does seem to be thriving in an area of great uncertainty,\" he said in an interview before the 2025 Talbot County Business Appreciation Summit.\nHosted by the Talbot County Department of Economic Development and Tourism and the Talbot County Economic Development Commission, the Business Appreciation Summit included a keynote speech from Barkin and the presentation of Community Impact Awards to a variety of businesses and individuals.\nThe awards are presented to businesses, nonprofits, community projects and individuals that have made a significant impact in the county, according to the Department of Economic Development and Tourism.\nBefore awards were presented, Talbot County Council Member Keasha Haythe said companies can be judged based on their products and services. \"But one can also judge a company on the impact their people have on their community,\" she said.\nRecipients of the Community Impact Awards included Bluepoint Hospitality, Building African American Minds, Walter Chase, The Oaks, Port Street Commons and University of Maryland Shore Regional Health.\nThe county, Town of Easton and Easton Utilities were all recognized alongside Shore Regional Health for the project to build a new hospital in Easton, which is expected to open in spring 2028.\n\"It's important to point out that this award is the result of a massive group effort of years of hard work and dedication,\" Easton Mayor Megan Cook said.\nShore Regional Health President and CEO Ken Kozel acknowledged the journey to building a new hospital on the Mid-Shore hasn't been easy. The project has been more than two decades in the making.\n\"But we've persevered, we've been persistent and we've tried to work our hardest to achieve this goal,\" he said. \"And it's because of each one of you in this room that has helped us get this far. So we're humbled, we're grateful and we're also excited about what the future holds for health care in this community.\"\nKEYNOTE SPEECH\nDuring the event's keynote address, Barkin spoke from his point of view about economic uncertainty. He said even though the numbers that have come in so far this year \"have barely moved\" since the end of 2024, federal government policy has \"taken center stage\" and led to falls in business optimism and consumer sentiment.\n\"The scale and the pace of change seems to have created a sense of instability,\" he said.\nDuring his speech, Barkin made a point to discuss what is known when it comes to the economy and where things are headed. He said the country is headed toward:\nMore tariffs.Lower net migration.An extension of the 2017 tax cuts.Deregulation.Lower growth in government spending.Efforts to promote traditional energy sources.\nWhat is yet to be determined, Barkin said, is how far these efforts will go and what the final outcome of the efforts will be.\n\"Or as I've been saying, we're on the road. It's foggy. We know the direction. We're just not sure about the destination,\" he said.\nBarkin said the Federal Reserve is driving through the same fog as businesses and consumers. He said the labor market is still in a good place and inflation is above target.\n\"If conditions start to shift, we're well-positioned to adjust,\" he said. \"But until that — like businesses and consumers — we're just waiting for the fog to clear.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Shore legislators worry about tax hikes, energy, education in the wake of General Assembly\n\n April 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 802\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Maryland General Assembly session officially ended Monday night. Lawmakers fought through a very tough fiscal year budget, which had some significant impacts for Eastern Shore communities, legislators said.Members of the Eastern Shore delegation stressed budget difficulties loom over state lawmakers, who spent much of this year's session tackling an over $3 billion deficit.\n\"I think the session was not a good session,\" Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said. \"We've just made Maryland a very expensive, more expensive than it was, and it's going to make us less competitive in the region.\n\"If you believe that economic competitiveness is in fact a priority, I think that it is, and I think that by raising taxes and fees, both at the state level and then forcing the locals to also increase their fees and taxes is a double whammy.\"\nMaryland lawmakers passed a balanced budget Monday, concluding their spring session after months of grappling with the deficit. The final budget included about $2 billion in cuts and about $1.6 billion in tax hikes.\n\"I think we left frustrated that we had to raise taxes $1.66 billion and there was no regard to wanting to really seriously cut expenses from the state budget,\" said Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico).\nEastern Shore Delegation members believe after this year's session, the Shore will see lasting effects both fiscally and in several key industries.\nSolar\nOne of the biggest concerns for the Mid-Shore this budget session has been solar energy.\nA renewable energy bill aimed at increasing generation of energy within the state by promoting solar energy production was passed by both chambers of the state legislature.\nSome Eastern Shore Delegation members feel provisions added to these bills during legislators' deliberations supersede counties' authority regarding solar permitting and regulation.\n\"It undermines all the work that the counties have already done to try to facilitate where and how to put solar,\" Mautz said. \"It includes a new assessment for planting solar, which is going to raise energy costs.\"\nHutchinson echoed this sentiment, saying, \"It falls on deaf ears that the Democrats from Montgomery and Prince George's county all think that they know how the quality of life is here on the Eastern Shore.\"\nUtility bills\nHouse Bill 1035 and Senate Bill 937, known collectively as the \"Next Generation Energy Act,\" include plans to reduce energy bills and address shortfalls by modernizing the state's energy infrastructure and incentivizing in-state energy production.\nEastern Shore Delegation members believe this effort to get the cost down lacked the immediacy rate payers need to address bill hikes.\n\"We have not addressed the number one complaint I received when I arrived in January,\" Hutchinson said, \"rate payers calling to say that their electric bills are astronomical. We put legislation forward to try to lower utility bills, and again, it falls on deaf ears.\"\nEducation funding\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Futue, the state's education improvement and funding initiative through 2032, originally outlined an increase in teacher collaborative time, during which teachers are not in classes and can plan, grade or meet with students individually. But with adjustments made in the state's budget to combat the deficit, funding to implement the change has been postponed.\nThe Blueprint also sustained several other cuts and freezes that impact county finances. Multiple Mid-Shore county school boards have had to make budget cut decisions and potential layoffs in response.\n\"So let me take Dorchester County, for example,\" Hutchinson said. \"They pushed down the teachers' pensions. They pushed down the Blueprint. They pushed down other mandates that the state usually paid for, but now it's all the county, they have to pay for (it).\"\n\"The school board is short about $5 million. They just eliminated summer school,\" he said. \"They're looking at having to lay off student support personnel. They say we want to create a world-class education. Yet you look at the results of what's happening in Maryland and say that doesn't make sense.\"\nPotential special sessions\nWhile the 2025 session has ended, Mautz doesn't believe discussion is officially over.\nAs the federal government continues to shift funding priorities, state legislators may need to reconvene to address any impacts this has on the balanced budget, he said.\n\"Counties are probably going to have to raise revenue through taxes and different things,\" Mautz said. \"The federal government is probably going to continue to reduce spending. Then there's a high likelihood that we're going to have a special session.\"\n\"So we would have to go back to Annapolis again to address any changes that that come from federal spending reductions. Just as the federal government is reducing its spending, the state is doing the same thing to the counties, and so where all this ends, it seems to be, taxpayer, taxpayer, taxpayer.\n\"Everybody should know it's very hard to predict how this is all going to play out, but I don't think the discussion about the budget is is officially over.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland faces runaway spending, weak economic growth\n\n April 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JOHNNY MAUTZ | Section: Columns \n \n 565\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The 2025 session of the General Assembly wrapped up at midnight on April 7, and I need to be straight with you — they just approved one of the largest tax increases in Maryland history.When Gov. Wes Moore was elected, he inherited a $5 billion surplus. Now, just three years later, we have accrued a $3 billion deficit.\nI stood my ground and voted no on this budget.\nLet me be clear: Our fiscal problems aren't because you aren't paying enough taxes. The problem is runaway spending and weak economic growth. The so-called \"Blueprint for Education\" simply costs more than we can afford, and the state keeps adding more employees, agencies and departments. These new taxes and fees will only drive businesses and jobs away from Maryland.\nI know many on the Shore are struggling with inflation and skyrocketing energy costs. It's even tougher for folks who rely on government assistance for energy, food and housing — many of these programs have been cut or face reductions.\nMaking matters worse, the state pushed many costs down to our county governments while authorizing increases in local income taxes (the \"piggy-back tax\"). This creates pressure for counties to either raise these taxes or hike property taxes to meet state mandates.\nMost of these mandates come from the Blueprint for Education. Despite our efforts to provide relief to local jurisdictions, all we got was a three-year freeze on \"collaborative time\" for teachers. Not nearly enough.\nOur Eastern Shore has become a target for out-of-state solar developers. They see our flat, affordable farmland and Maryland's generous renewable energy standards as an opportunity. Despite united opposition from all Eastern Shore legislators, outside interests pushed through legislation to fast-track solar projects here as their \"solution\" to energy costs.\nTwo harmful solar bills passed this year: SB931, the \"Renewable Energy Certainty Act,\" gives the Public Service Commission new power to approve massive projects and override our local zoning decisions. SB909, the \"Energy Resource & Adequacy Planning Act,\" creates yet another government office within the PSC (funded by your utility bills) to make energy policy recommendations. I fought against both bills because they trample local control and ignore the true value of our agricultural land.\nThere were a few bright spots on public safety.\nThe General Assembly finally made possession of stolen firearms a felony. Legislation also passed allowing parole consideration for seniors and those convicted between ages 18-24 after serving 20 years — but the Parole Board must still approve any release.\nOur top local priority — funding for the new Eastern Shore Regional Medical Center — received $20 million in the governor's budget to continue construction of this critical facility that will replace the aging Easton Memorial Hospital.\nAfter years of trying, we finally amended the permanent revocation law for commercial watermen. Violations of oyster laws will still result in revocations, but watermen will now have a path to petition for reinstatement so they can apply again to work on the water.\nWe also approved an important pilot program for Dorchester County that allows private sector resources to review well and septic permits — a critical function often delayed in our local health departments.\nAnd small towns with less than $100,000 annual revenue will now be exempt from costly legislative audits — a win for many Eastern Shore communities.\nBut make no mistake — our budget troubles aren't over. With federal spending cuts on the horizon, we may face a special session before 2026. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Devastating': Small businesses sue Trump over tariffs\n\n April 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: National \n \n 1059\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A group of small businesses — including a wine and sake importer, industrial manufacturer and fishing gear and tackle e-commerce firm — are suing President Donald Trump over his tariffs, challenging his use of an emergency law to impose taxes on imports.Texas-based Liberty Justice Center filed a federal lawsuit in the U.S. Court of International Trade on April 14 on behalf of five small businesses impacted by Trump's \"Liberation Day\" and other tariffs.\nThe lawsuit challenges Trump's authority to invoke tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\nTrump is the first U.S. president to invoke tariffs under the 1977 emergency powers law.\nThe lawsuit argues Trump lacks the authority to issue his across-the-board, worldwide tariffs without approval by Congress.\nTrump has cited flows of fentanyl (an illegal synthetic opioid) into the U.S. for imposing 20% tariffs against China and threatening Canada and Mexico with 25% levies.\nTrump cited trade deficits for his \"Liberation Day\" country-by-country tariffs. The tariffs were originally as high as 49% but have been reduced to 10% during a 90-day pause instituted by Trump after worries about financial markets.\n'NO ONE PERSON'The Liberty Justice Center argues longstanding trade deficits don't constitute an emergency and some of the countries in Trump's tariffs don't even have trade surpluses with the U.S.\n\"IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose across-the-board tariffs—it does not even authorize tariffs at all; and even if the IEEPA did extend such power to the President, that would be an unconstitutional delegation of Congress's power to impose tariffs,\" the Texas group said in a statement.\n\"No one person should have the power to impose taxes that have such vast global economic consequences,\" said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel at the Liberty Justice Center. \"The Constitution gives the power to set tax rates—including tariffs—to Congress, not the President.\"\nTrump is imposing a 145% tariff on China (with current exemptions for smartphones, computers and other electronics and technology components). There are also 25% U.S. tariffs on imported cars, auto parts, aluminum and steel imposed under separate trade protocols.\n\"If starting the biggest trade war since the Great Depression based on a law that doesn't even mention tariffs is not an unconstitutional usurpation of legislative power, I don't know what is,\" said Ilya Somin, co-counsel a law professor, at George Mason University.\nChina has imposed 125% tariffs on U.S. goods in response to the Trump import taxes.\nThe White House pushed back against the lawsuit.\n\"Never Trumpers will always oppose him, but President Trump is standing up for Main Street by putting an end to our trading partners—especially China—exploiting the U.S. His plan levels the playing field for businesses and workers to address our country's national emergency of chronic trade deficits,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields.\n'TARIFF CHAOS'The small business owners who are part of the suit say the tariffs are raising costs and hurting their operations.\n\"This is devastating to our ability to operate and support the farmers and producers we work with around the world,\" Victor Owen Schwartz, owner of VOS Selections, which imports wines, spirits and sakes.\nTrump previously threatened 200% tariffs on European wine and liquor imports but has not followed through on that.\nConventionally, U.S. administrations have gone through more lengthy trade regimens, that require additional approvals, to institute tariffs.\nDan Pastore, president and co-founder of FishUSA Inc., a Pennsylvania-based e-commerce firm specializing in fishing tackle and gear, said his company sources its products from markets such as South Korea, Kenya, China and Canada and has had to hold up production flows because of the tariffs and their uncertainty.\n\"Instead of focusing on growing our business, creating more jobs in our region, and developing new products that our customers want, we are spending countless hours trying to navigate the tariff chaos that the President is causing for us and all our vendors,\" said Dan Pastore, President and co-founder of FishUSA. \"It takes years working with factories to design and build our products, and we cannot just shift that business to the U.S. without starting the whole process over again.\"\nOther plaintiffs include Utah-based Genova Pipe which makes piping and relies on Asian resin imports.\n\"With limited domestic sources, we rely on imports to meet our production needs. The newly imposed tariffs are increasing our raw material costs and hindering our ability to compete in the export market,\" said Andrew Reese, president of Genova Pipe, which also has manufacturing plants in Washington, Michigan and other U.S. states.\nEarlier this month, the New Civil Liberties Alliance also sued the Trump administration over the tariffs on behalf of a Florida business owner also challenging the use of presidential emergency powers.\n'MAIN STREET, NOT WALL STREET'Trump and his economic advisors argue the tariffs will settle longstanding trade inequities and bring manufacturing to the U.S.\nThe White House said in a tariffs announcement that current trade inequities have \"undermined critical supply chains; and rendered our defense-industrial base dependent on foreign adversaries.\"\nThe tariffs fight is also pitting Trump's push for continued American hegemony over the international economy versus a more globalist system with multinational supply chains and the ever-increasing economic importance of China.\n\"I'm proud to be the President for the workers, not the outsourcers; the President who stands up for main street, not Wall Street; who protects the middle class, not the political class; and who defends America, not trade cheaters all over the globe,\" Trump said earlier this month defending his tariffs regime.\nThe United Auto Workers union backs Trump's auto manufacturing tariffs hoping they will boost domestic productions.\nThe pro-Trump America First Policy Institute also backs the tariffs.\n\"President Trump made a clear and strong statement on 'Liberation Day': countries will no longer take advantage of the American market with unfair trade practices that have hollowed out our manufacturing base, depressed wages, and threatened our national security,\" said Robert Lighthizer, chair of AFP's Center for American Trade.\n'DIFFICULT TO CHALLENGE'The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power over tariffs and taxes. But the legislative branch has increasingly deferred to the executive branch over trade policies.\nThere are efforts by Trump critics in Congress to take tariffs back. Trump has promised to veto a bill if it passes.\nSome legal analysts agree with the challenges. Others see the court deferring to executive power related to the emergency powers law.\n\"It would appear that the power the president utilized to impose tariffs under IEEPA is very nearly absolute and difficult to challenge,\" said Achyuth Anil, an international trade policy researcher with the University of Sussex in Britain. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 21.5 cents per gallon higher than a month ago and stand 48.7 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has decreased 4.8 cents in the last week and stands at $3.546 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.81 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $3.79 per gallon, a difference of 98.0 cents per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has fallen 8.2 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.13 per gallon Monday. The national average is up 7.8 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 46.9 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\n\"For now, the good news is that gas prices typically reach their yearly peak around April 10, so we may have already witnessed 'peak pain' at the pump for 2025,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"As refiners near the end of seasonal maintenance and supply begins to rise — and with the changeover to summer gasoline nearly complete — it's increasingly likely that gas prices have already hit their high for the year.\"\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back ten years:\nApril 14, 2024: $3.68 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.60 per gallon)April 14, 2023: $3.59 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.65 per gallon)April 14, 2022: $3.67 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.06 per gallon)April 14, 2021: $2.76 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.86 per gallon)April 14, 2020: $1.95 per gallon (U.S. Average: $1.82 per gallon)April 14, 2019: $2.73 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.83 per gallon)April 14, 2018: $2.69 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.71 per gallon)April 14, 2017: $2.41 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.41 per gallon)April 14, 2016: $2.09 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.10 per gallon)April 14, 2015: $2.38 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.38 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.17 per gallon, down 8.0 cents per gallon from last week's $3.25 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.16 per gallon, down 4.8 cents per gallon from last week's $3.20 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.22 per gallon, down 2.8 cents per gallon from last week's $3.24 per gallon.\n\"After oil's sharp drop over the last couple of weeks — driven by concerns over the impact of U.S. tariffs and OPEC+ restoring production faster than expected — gasoline prices have posted a notable weekly decline, with nearly every state seeing prices fall,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"While I do expect gas prices to continue trending lower, any abrupt change in the current tariff situation could eventually bring the decline to a halt.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "New business tax not fully thought through\n\n April 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 772\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On the last day of the 2025 Maryland General Assembly session, a majority of General Assembly members and Gov. Moore finally agreed on a $68 billion state budget package.The agreement includes approximately $2 billion in budget cuts, and a wide range of new taxes, tax increases, new fees and fee increases.\nTaken together, the tax and fee changes are projected to generate approximately $1.8 billion in new state revenue.\nOne new tax that is the largest single source of projected new state revenue is a 3% business-to-business sales tax for services provided by information technology providers.\nCurrent projections are this new tax will generate approximately $482 million in new revenue.\nThe key words here are current and projections.\nAchieving a balanced state budget for an entire fiscal year may be wishful thinking.\nThere is no guarantee if and when all the revenue from the new IT services sales tax will come in as projected.\nDel. Ben Barnes, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, was asked if he was confident about the projected revenue from this new sales tax.\nHe did not answer the question directly. Instead, he said, \"We are super confident that the final budget compromise turns a massive structural deficit into a positive structural balance.\"\nIt remains to be seen if that super confidence will hold until the end of the upcoming fiscal year.\nComplicating matters is that between now and July 1 of this year, the Maryland comptroller's office will have to issue regulations to implement the new IT service sales tax.\nSenate Budget and Taxation Committee Chair Guy Guzzone has already acknowledged, \"It's very complicated [the new IT service sales tax] and the comptroller will be figuring out how exactly that implementation occurs.\"\nMaryland Senate President Bill Ferguson has said that he expects there will be a bit of a delay in the implementation of the regulations.\nThe budget bill compromise includes a trigger for a special session to address the impact of any future Trump administration decisions that further reduce the historic and substantial flow of federal dollars into Maryland.\nLargely missing during all the debate and deliberations on Annapolis leading up to the approval of this new IT service sales tax was greater consideration of what-if questions.\nWhat if greater consideration would have been given to estimates from the Cybersecurity Association of Maryland, that this new tax could result in IT service companies leaving Maryland?\nWhat if this scenario is already being confirmed?\nMaryland State Del. Brian Crosby is the owner of an IT services firm formerly based in Maryland. During a recent speech on the House floor, he told his House colleagues in anticipation of this new IT service sales tax being approved, he had already decided to move his IT service business from Maryland to Virginia.\nWhen asked later about how the new sales tax could impact his business, Crosby said, \"All I can say is that within a year, we'd be bankrupt.\"\nJacob Stokes, president of a 50-employee IT and software development company based in Columbia echoed that sentiment. He has said, \"We're going to have to leave the state. That's our only option.\"\nWhat if greater consideration had been given to concerns raised by the Maryland Chamber of Commerce? The Chamber has suggested, \"Once Maryland starts taxing services, whether it's tech, legal, marketing or accounting, it becomes easier to expand these taxes to other sectors down the line.\"\nThey further suggest, \"Today, it's tech services. Tomorrow it could be any other service upon which Maryland businesses and consumers depend.\"\nWhat if greater consideration had been given to reports on all the businesses that have already have or are considering transferring their incorporation from Delaware due to what they perceive to be a hostile business climate there?\nThe current list includes Facebook, Walmart, AMC, Madison Square Entertainment, Pershing Square Capital Management, Simon Property Group, Dropbox, Meta, Trip Advisor and Roblox.\nWhat if final action on any tax legislation would be contingent upon the Maryland comptroller providing legislators a report with details on the regulations and compliance standards for any new taxes, tax increases, new fees and fee increases?\nThat would help avoid the consequences of accepting the thinking of former U. S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi: \"We have to pass the bill so you can find out what's in it.\"\nWhat if this new IT service sales tax, coupled with legislative leaders rejecting Gov. Moore's proposal to reduce the corporate net income tax, derails Moore's goal to reverse Maryland's sluggish economic growth by reducing tax and regulatory burdens on businesses?\nGoing forward, Maryland is best served when every policy decision maker in Annapolis has a commitment and an opportunity to consider what-if questions which in turn helps ensure no final decisions are made using a deeply flawed \"ready-aim-fire\" approach. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Devastating': Small businesses sue Trump over tariffs\n\n April 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: News \n \n 1058\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A group of small businesses — including a wine and sake importer, industrial manufacturer and fishing gear and tackle e-commerce firm — are suing President Donald Trump over his tariffs, challenging his use of an emergency law to impose taxes on imports.Texas-based Liberty Justice Center filed a federal lawsuit in the U.S. Court of International Trade on Monday on behalf of five small businesses impacted by Trump's \"Liberation Day\" and other tariffs.\nThe lawsuit challenges Trump's authority to invoke tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\nTrump is the first U.S. president to invoke tariffs under the 1977 emergency powers law.\nThe lawsuit argues Trump lacks the authority to issue his across-the-board, worldwide tariffs without approval by Congress.\nTrump has cited flows of fentanyl (an illegal synthetic opioid) into the U.S. for imposing 20% tariffs against China and threatening Canada and Mexico with 25% levies.\nTrump cited trade deficits for his \"Liberation Day\" country-by-country tariffs. The tariffs were originally as high as 49% but have been reduced to 10% during a 90-day pause instituted by Trump after worries about financial markets.\n'NO ONE PERSON'\nThe Liberty Justice Center argues longstanding trade deficits don't constitute an emergency and some of the countries in Trump's tariffs don't even have trade surpluses with the U.S.\n\"IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose across-the-board tariffs—it does not even authorize tariffs at all; and even if the IEEPA did extend such power to the President, that would be an unconstitutional delegation of Congress's power to impose tariffs,\" the Texas group said in a statement.\n\"No one person should have the power to impose taxes that have such vast global economic consequences,\" said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel at the Liberty Justice Center. \"The Constitution gives the power to set tax rates—including tariffs—to Congress, not the President.\"\nTrump is imposing a 145% tariff on China (with current exemptions for smartphones, computers and other electronics and technology components). There are also 25% U.S. tariffs on imported cars, auto parts, aluminum and steel imposed under separate trade protocols.\n\"If starting the biggest trade war since the Great Depression based on a law that doesn't even mention tariffs is not an unconstitutional usurpation of legislative power, I don't know what is,\" said Ilya Somin, co-counsel a law professor, at George Mason University.\nChina has imposed 125% tariffs on U.S. goods in response to the Trump import taxes.\nThe White House pushed back against the lawsuit.\n\"Never Trumpers will always oppose him, but President Trump is standing up for Main Street by putting an end to our trading partners—especially China—exploiting the U.S. His plan levels the playing field for businesses and workers to address our country's national emergency of chronic trade deficits,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields.\n'TARIFF CHAOS'\nThe small business owners who are part of the suit say the tariffs are raising costs and hurting their operations.\n\"This is devastating to our ability to operate and support the farmers and producers we work with around the world,\" Victor Owen Schwartz, owner of VOS Selections, which imports wines, spirits and sakes.\nTrump previously threatened 200% tariffs on European wine and liquor imports but has not followed through on that.\nConventionally, U.S. administrations have gone through more lengthy trade regimens, that require additional approvals, to institute tariffs.\nDan Pastore, president and co-founder of FishUSA Inc., a Pennsylvania-based e-commerce firm specializing in fishing tackle and gear, said his company sources its products from markets such as South Korea, Kenya, China and Canada and has had to hold up production flows because of the tariffs and their uncertainty.\n\"Instead of focusing on growing our business, creating more jobs in our region, and developing new products that our customers want, we are spending countless hours trying to navigate the tariff chaos that the President is causing for us and all our vendors,\" said Dan Pastore, President and co-founder of FishUSA. \"It takes years working with factories to design and build our products, and we cannot just shift that business to the U.S. without starting the whole process over again.\"\nOther plaintiffs include Utah-based Genova Pipe which makes piping and relies on Asian resin imports.\n\"With limited domestic sources, we rely on imports to meet our production needs. The newly imposed tariffs are increasing our raw material costs and hindering our ability to compete in the export market,\" said Andrew Reese, president of Genova Pipe, which also has manufacturing plants in Washington, Michigan and other U.S. states.\nEarlier this month, the New Civil Liberties Alliance also sued the Trump administration over the tariffs on behalf of a Florida business owner also challenging the use of presidential emergency powers.\n'MAIN STREET, NOT WALL STREET'\nTrump and his economic advisors argue the tariffs will settle longstanding trade inequities and bring manufacturing to the U.S.\nThe White House said in a tariffs announcement that current trade inequities have \"undermined critical supply chains; and rendered our defense-industrial base dependent on foreign adversaries.\"\nThe tariffs fight is also pitting Trump's push for continued American hegemony over the international economy versus a more globalist system with multinational supply chains and the ever-increasing economic importance of China.\n\"I'm proud to be the President for the workers, not the outsourcers; the President who stands up for main street, not Wall Street; who protects the middle class, not the political class; and who defends America, not trade cheaters all over the globe,\" Trump said earlier this month defending his tariffs regime.\nThe United Auto Workers union backs Trump's auto manufacturing tariffs hoping they will boost domestic productions.\nThe pro-Trump America First Policy Institute also backs the tariffs.\n\"President Trump made a clear and strong statement on 'Liberation Day': countries will no longer take advantage of the American market with unfair trade practices that have hollowed out our manufacturing base, depressed wages, and threatened our national security,\" said Robert Lighthizer, chair of AFP's Center for American Trade.\n'DIFFICULT TO CHALLENGE'\nThe U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power over tariffs and taxes. But the legislative branch has increasingly deferred to the executive branch over trade policies.\nThere are efforts by Trump critics in Congress to take tariffs back. Trump has promised to veto a bill if it passes.\nSome legal analysts agree with the challenges. Others see the court deferring to executive power related to the emergency powers law.\n\"It would appear that the power the president utilized to impose tariffs under IEEPA is very nearly absolute and difficult to challenge,\" said Achyuth Anil, an international trade policy researcher with the University of Sussex in Britain. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Participants could walk or run at their own pace, and medals were awarded to the top finishers in four categories: adult male, adult female, youth male, and youth female. Each category winner received a free entry to the Savage Race obstacle course in Kennedyville.\nThe medalists included:\nYouth female first place: Phoebe Fritz of Chestertown (fifth overall).Female adult first place: Margaret Randolph of Millington (fourth overall).Youth male first place: Jonathan Smith of Berlin (first overall).Adult male first place: Chris Blanchard of Rock Hall (second overall).\nRescue President Cora Dickson, who also participated, thanked the community for its support and shared in welcoming remarks from Rock Hall Mayor James Cook.\nThe Bun Run raised awareness about the large number of rabbits abandoned after being purchased on impulse during the Easter holiday. The event is part of the organization's ongoing efforts to highlight the importance of long-term commitment and specialized care for rabbits.\nThe Eastern Shore Rabbit Rescue and Education Center, established in 2014, has placed nearly 500 rabbits in new homes, and the Bun Run is an essential fundraising effort for the organization, which spends most of its funds on veterinary expenses, including spaying, neutering, and vaccinations.\nThis year's event also featured fundraising competitions. The top fundraising team in the business category was Brampton 1860 of Chestertown, which raised $500, and the top individual fundraisers, each with $300, were Cora Dickson and William Fielder.\nThe Bun Run, initially organized as a virtual event in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, has continued to grow, with in-person events in Salisbury and now Rock Hall.\nMore information about the Bun Run and how to support the rescue's efforts is available at esrrec.org/bun-run. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Denton becomes first American Discovery Trail Town, hopes to draw tourists\n\n April 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 627\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The American Discovery Trail has made a landmark of Denton.The town has been designated as the first town in the American Discovery Trail, a coast-to-coast path across the USA connecting people with rural and urban areas, wilderness, desert, mountains and forests.\n\"I think the American Discovery Trail is unique. It's amazing,\" Peter Schoettle, American Discovery Trail secretary, said. \"The United States, we're blessed with a number of phenomenal outdoor trails. The American Discovery Trail is unique in that it's from coast to coast ,from the Atlantic to the Pacific. No other trail does that.\"\nIn the beginning of April, Denton held a ceremony to announce the trail town designation at the town's welcome center.\nThe American Trail Society came up with the idea for the program to allow towns to become American Trail Discovery towns.\n\"We started this program of saying, 'let's give more recognition to some neat little towns along the way,'\" Schoettle said. \"This would benefit the towns, and it would benefit the trail, and so we announced this program of becoming a trail town.\"\nWhile the process of being claimed as a trail town was not easy, Denton worked hard to get it done.\nThe first step Denton completed was forming a committee dedicated to the trail.\n\"Originally, we produced a proclamation a couple years ago, and I think as a staff and as a council, I think we thought that's all we had to do,\" said Scott Getchell, town administrator. \"But they came back a couple years ago and said they that we needed to adopt a resolution stating that we are a trail town.\"\nAfter adopting a resolution, the town also needed to complete a memorandum of understanding and an application to be approved as an official trail town.\n\"When they complete those steps, we give them the award, or the title of American Discovery Trail Town,\" Schoettle said. \"And Denton is the very first in the whole country, and so that's amazing. I mean that's unique. Being first, it's like winning a gold medal in the Olympics.\"\nOne of the main reasons the program was started is to highlight smaller towns and bring tourism to those areas.\n\"I think it's fabulous,\" Schoettle said. It's a win-win situation. I really hope it helps put Denton on the map. They're a great town, and when hikers plan on doing the Discovery Trail, they will say, 'Well, wait a minute, I should plan to stay overnight in Denton.'\n\"They will use their restaurants, use their hotels or motels, and give them a little economic boost and more publicity. So, I hope they get a lot more visitors.\"\nDenton believes the exposure from the American Discovery Trail will help local businesses.\n\"Long term, I think it's great,\" Getchell said. \"It's going to take a little while to take off I'm sure, but I think long term, were going to be known around the country as being a trail town. People that do a lot of hiking and things like that, they're going to be mapping our town as a place, as a resource on their journey... We spoke to different businesses and they're put up stickers on the doors so somebody walking through here knows that that's a trail town business.\"\nWhile the American Trail Society created the program for towns, Schoettle believes Denton deserves all the credit for its initiative to get everything in the application process done.\n\"I think the town deserves a lot of credit,\" Schoettle said. \"You always need volunteers to do these things. Scott Getchell, the town administrator was a key player. Abby McNinch, the mayor, and the town council, they passed that resolution more than a year ago. That was a big step forward that showed this town really wants to get known and supports the trail, they deserve all the credit.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2025-04-26",
    "author": "JIM BRUCE",
    "content": "False bravado on tariffs threatens Talbot County\n\n April 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JIM BRUCE | Section: Columns \n \n 422\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n President Trump's abrupt announcement of tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports provoked them to impose retaliatory tariffs of 125% on U.S. goods exported to China.This jeopardizes our $300 million in exports to China from Maryland's 1st Congressional District, including from all of Talbot County and the rest of the Eastern Shore.\nChina is hardly blameless on tariffs, but the tragedy for our farmers and businessmen is that our president and our congressman brought on themselves this latest threat to the future exports of Talbot County and the Eastern Shore. Worse, Trump's foolish bravado on tariffs is turning to desperation.\nRecall that just after President Trump levied a massive 104% import tariff on Chinese goods, he bragged on April 9, at a mega-fundraiser, \"These countries are calling us up, kissing my ass to negotiate deals on tariffs. They are dying to make a deal… [saying], Please, Sir, make a deal. I'll do anything, Sir.\"\nTrump thus portrayed initiating a call to the U.S. to negotiate tariffs as a demeaning, obscene act by our trading partner. This mocking and senseless incivility to all our trading partners, including China, explains why China's commerce ministry said on the next day that China is open to dialogue with the U.S. on tariffs, but it must be based on \"mutual respect.\" Doubling down on the insult, Trump then insisted that the Chinese president must call first for negotiations to begin.\nYou need not be an expert in tariffs to know that the importance of respect — saving face — is deeply embedded in Chinese culture. Any real U.S. negotiator on any subject would know this. It further confirms that Trump hatched his chaotic and amateurish tariff plan on the fly without careful planning.\nChina has called, not to urge the U.S. to negotiate the tariffs, but for the U.S to capitulate and \"completely cancel\" Trump's reciprocal tariffs. While Trump says that President Xi has called him and trade negotiations with the Chinese are underway, China denies it, calling it \"fake news.\"\nTrump is learning just how dependent our economy is on trade with China for, to name a few, sales of Boeing jets and rare earth metals for our high-tech industries.\nWhat's at stake for Talbot County is no small matter. In 2022, our farmers and businesses in Maryland's 1st Congressional District exported over $300 million in goods and services to China. China's retaliatory tariffs of 125% now imperil our exports. Yet our Congressman Andy Harris simply endorses Trump's turbulent tariffs, despite the threat to agriculture, e.g., soybeans, and other businesses in his district. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Things to remember if buying or selling this spring\n\n May 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MID-SHORE BOARD OF REALTORS | Section: Real Estate \n \n 524\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n If someone is buying or selling this Spring, they may have noticed a few new ways of doing things since the last time they went through this process, noted Michelle Abplanalp, president of Mid-Shore Board of Realtors.There are several real estate changes that went into effect in August related to showing homes and compensation.\nFor buyers, a written buyer agreement is now required. Buyers and their Realtors will need to reach an agreement regarding how the agent will be paid for their services and put it in writing before seeing a home. \"However, don't get hung up on signing this agreement,\" Abplanalp said. \"This agreement can be specific. It can be to see one specific home, it can be for one day or one week, whatever you negotiate.\"\nBefore signing this agreement, buyers should ensure it reflects the terms they have negotiated with their Realtor and that they understand exactly what services will be provided and how much these services will cost, the Board of Realtors said.\nThe buyer agreement must include four items:\nA specific and clear disclosure of the amount or rate of compensation the agent will receive or how this amount will be determined must be stated.\nThe compensation rate must be objective and stated as an amount, a flat fee, a percentage, or an hourly rate. The compensation cannot be open-ended.\nThe agreement prohibits the Realtor from receiving compensation for services from any source that exceeds the amount or rate agreed to by the buyer.\nThe agreement must note that the Realtor fees and commissions are fully negotiable and not set by law.\nThese written agreements apply to both in-person and live virtual home tours but do not apply to open houses or inquiries about services. The home seller may agree to offer compensation to their Realtor, or the seller can offer to assist with closing costs or home inspections.\nFor home sellers, the offers of compensation (when a seller or a seller's agent shares compensation with a buyer's agent) cannot be shared on Multiple Listing Services. MLSs are local marketplaces used by both buyer and seller agents to share information about homes for sale. Offers of compensation are still an option but are now communicated off the MLS should a home seller choose to pay the buyer's agent fee.\nSellers may consider doing this as a way of marketing their home or making their listing more attractive to buyers.\nPer Abplanalp, whether buying or selling, the Realtors compensation or fees remain fully negotiable and are not set by law. Realtors have agreed to abide by the Realtor Code of Ethics and to provide clear and transparent discussions with their clients about compensation.\n\"What's important to know is these practice changes provide consumers on both sides of a residential transaction with additional choice and transparency,\" Abplanalp said. \"It helps to have this discussion upfront so there are no misunderstandings. I have found that my clients appreciate knowing what I will do for them, what services I provide, and at what cost.\"\nThe Mid-Shore Board of Realtors mission is to advocate for its members and the public to preserve the right to own, transfer and utilize real property.

Together, we can foster growth and nurture the next generation of Main Street leaders, paving the way for vibrant downtowns and thriving communities.\"\nDeKarske said at a town meeting in March that the town sent a request for proposal to the state in hopes of being chosen as the conference's host.\n\"You need to make sure you have enough hotel rooms and places for them to eat because they have you go back out to town over those two days,\" DeKarske said in March. \" ... It's a really good opportunity for us.\"\nIn 2024, Frederick hosted the inaugural Maryland Main Street Conference, which was a one-day event attended by more than 400 people.\nDay said in a press release the conference is an opportunity for economic developers to learn how best to invest in Maryland's historic centers.\n\"The Town of Easton is a prime example of the payoff of that investment, and I'm so excited to recognize them as the host of this year's conference,\" Day stated. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Canaries in coal mine' are chirping loudly\n\n May 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 833\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For almost a century, between the late 1890s until 1986, coal miners relied on canary birds rather than fellow miners to detect increasing levels of colorless, odorless carbon monoxide and other toxic gases in the mines that could sicken or even kill humans.While mechanical sensors have long since replaced canaries in mines, the term \"canaries in the coal mine\" is still a metaphor for an early warning system to alert people of impending negative, even catastrophic outcomes, if they do not make necessary and timely changes.\nRecent news reports on three \"canaries in the coal mine\" scenarios that merit serious consideration by Gov. Moore and the leadership of the General Assembly.\nThe first are reports published in Maryland Matters that recent decisions on the state budget made by a majority in the General Assembly and by Gov. Moore have not gone unnoticed by three major public finance credit rating agencies — Fitch, Moody's and S&P Global Rating.\nIn the world of government finance, the ratings from these firms are of paramount importance.\nThey determine the interest rates on bonds issued by states to fund budgets in addition to revenue received from taxes and related revenue sources. The higher the states bond rating, the lower the interest rate on bond repayments.\nWhile these bond agencies reaffirmed the currently in place highest credit rating for Maryland, AAA, two did so with concerns.\nMoody's downgraded the state's fiscal outlook from stable to \"negative,\" citing looming structural deficits driven by state funding for the Blueprint for Maryland's Future also known as the Kirwan Plan.\nIn its report, Moody's wrote, \"The negative outlook incorporates difficulties Maryland will face to achieve balanced financial operations in coming years without sacrificing service delivery goals or adding to the weight of the state government's burden on individual and corporate taxpayers.\"\nThis is the first time since 2011 that Moody's has issued a negative outlook for Maryland.\nTheir report notes, \"The outlook revision was driven by expected structural imbalances and planned depletion of General Fund surplus and budgetary reserves by about 60% from fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2025, which threatens to undermine performance relative to peers.\"\nIn their report, S&P Global Ratings, expressed concerns about deficits and costly programs. Those concerns led them to grade Maryland nearly in the middle of its rating system — a grade that would typically equate to a credit rating just below AAA. But the agency gave the state the benefit of the doubt citing its history of fiscal management.\nThe second \"canary in the coal mine\" are reports from the General Assembly's nonpartisan legislative budget analysts. They are projecting that by next year, the state's projected structural budget deficit — the gap between projected expenses and expected revenues — will grow to $1 billion. In fiscal 2027, the last year of Moore's term, it grows to $1.3 billion. A year later, it more than doubles to $3 billion.\nThe third \"canary in the coal mine\" are recurring reports from Delaware about businesses moving or planning to move their business incorporation domicile from Delaware.\nThe latest to do so is Affirm Holdings Inc., a publicly held American technology firm that handles financial services for merchants and shoppers. Affirm is one of at least 20 major companies citing a hostile Delaware business environment as the reason for their decisions.\nAffirm joins Facebook parent company Meta, Walmart, Tripadvisor, The Trade Desk and Roblox.\nIn the face of all this news, one has to question the impact of a recent compromise reached by the leadership of the Maryland General Assembly and Gov. Moore on a final state budget and state tax package.\nThat compromise did not include a proposed reduction in the corporate net income tax but did include a new 3.5 % sales tax on information technology service providers.\nA spokesperson for Gov. Moore has said the governor is still optimistic going forward, saying the governor \"remains confident\" in the state's fiscal position following the news on the three credit ratings. He also said the governor will work with lawmakers on \"long-term structural solutions\" that balance revenues with priorities.\nState Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone is also optimistic. He was quoted in a Maryland Matters article, \"I know we can figure it out, and we will figure it out. Whatever the circumstances, whatever the economy gives us, in a broad sense, we'll use our tools, and we'll be thoughtful, and we'll come up with, I believe, good solutions.\"\nTime will tell if the current news from Delaware projected deficits and credit rating concerns will be included in future dialogue and deliberations on state spending and state revenues which in turn will help ensure fully informed decisions will be made on future state budget decisions in Annapolis.\nWe are likely to know very soon.\nThe final approved state budget bill requires a special legislative session later this year to address unexpected impacts in Maryland on more reductions in federal government spending.\nIf and when that occurs, I suggest Marylanders deserve thoughtful consideration of the current canaries in the coal mine as well as unexpected others yet to be made known. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In a small community, business owners aren't just business owners, they're our neighbors,\" she said.\nTalbot County has 1,478 established businesses and 4,537 Non-employer establishments, according to Census data. Non-employer establishments would be considered contractors, freelancers, consultants and entrepreneurs.\nAccording to the U.S. Small Business Administration, a small business determined based on both numbers of employees and the average revenue. Many local businesses fall in this category, local economic authorities said.\n\"They're community leaders, they're our friends,\" Krenier said. \"You can get things so easily nowadays, shipped right to your door. But, what you can't get is, that feeling you get when you walk into a store and they know your name and they know your order or you see people around you know, the person's your kids soccer coach or lacrosse coach.\"\nCassandra Vanhooser, the county's director of economic development and tourism, credits county residents for their \"great entrepreneurial spirit.\"\n\"We have so many great things going on,\" Vanhooser said. \"Small Business Week gives a chance to really celebrate that entrepreneurial spirit and the can-do-it attitude that our businesses have. It's just incredible.\n\"I think what our small businesses bring to our community, they really formed the foundation of our business community. So it's it's hugely important.\"\nKreiner and Vanhooser both want residents to remember to support small business not just one week, but every week.\n\"Supporting small businesses is supporting our community, it's supporting our way of life,\" Krenier said. \"It's what keeps our whole community strong, connected, vibrant and you're strengthening your relationships.Everybody's sad when one of our businesses goes out, well that's because it meant something to people. Even if it wasn't where you shopped, It meant something to us.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Shop ‘till you drop: Could Trump upend, reset the age of the insatiable American consumer?\n\n May 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: Business \n \n 1083\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n No one spends like Americans.Could U.S. President Donald Trump change that with his tariffs regime?\nBy leaps and bounds, the U.S. is by far the world's largest consumer market totaling $19 trillion annually, according to federal data.\nAmerica has 4% of the world's population but more than 31% of consumer spending, according to the World Bank. Consumers account for two-thirds of the behemoth U.S. economy.\nTrump is an unlikely messenger for a pullback on Americans' vociferous consumer appetites.\nTrump has long been a standard bearer for American capitalism; marketing and hawking everything from Bibles, watches and vodka to sneakers, ball caps and golf gear to his MAGA aficionados. The Trump Organization's hotels and golf courses depend on tourism and spending by the affluent.\nBut his tariffs aimed at bringing back manufacturing to post World War II levels in the U.S. and to 'Buy American' could also raise prices and reduce supplies of globally sourced consumer goods such as toys, clothing, footwear and jewelry.\nTrump has quipped that Americans might not miss some imported items, especially from China which currently sees a 145% tariff from Trump on most goods.\n\"You know, somebody said, 'Oh, the shelves are going to be open,'\" Trump said, from the White House last month. \"Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.\"\nTrump followed that up during an NBC interview alluding to American consumerism.\n\"I'm just saying they don't need to have 30 dolls. They can have three. They don't need to have 250 pencils. They can have five,\" Trump said.\nA pullback of U.S. consumer spending would be a sea change for hosts of industries and supply chains.\nThe U.S. accounts for 3% of the world's kids.\nBut America buys 40% of the world's toys (most of which are manufactured in China).\nThat's just the tip of America's ravenous consumer appetite.\nPick a consumer category — cars, boats, cosmetics, wine, fragrances — and the U.S. is likely the largest market globally.\nThe next closest overall consumer market is China at $7 trillion despite having more than four times the population as the U.S.\nAmerican consumer spending has been insatiable and almost limitless compared to the rest of the world.\nTrump's tariffs regime — and current trade war with China — has already dampened consumer confidence.\nThe Conference Board and University of Michigan have both reported significant dips on consumer sentiment since Trump took office and announced his tariffs aimed at bolstering U.S. manufacturing and settling past inequitable trade scores.\nThe former's consumer gauge shows expectations at a 13-year low.\n\"Consumer confidence has deteriorated in the early months of 2025,\" said Piyush Puri, founding partner of Mercurius Media Capital (MMC), a California-based consulting firm.\nPuri said there is \"pervasive pessimism\" about jobs, income and financial situation in sentiment surveys. \"At the same time household debt is at record highs,\" Puri said.\nThe New York Federal Reserve Bank reports American household debt sits at a record $18 trillion. That is up from $14 trillion at the end of 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic and its ensuing inflation wave.\nPuri said he can see consumers putting off bigger purchases — such as cars which face 25% levies for imported vehicles and auto parts — and turn to bargain brands for everyday items.\nDeidre Popovich, a business professor at Texas Tech University, also sees consumers bargain hunting and comparing prices.\nBut she doesn't foresee a marked, societal pullback from American consumerism.\n\"It's tempting to think that tariffs will 'reset' American overconsumption but behaviorally, that's unlikely. U.S. consumer culture is built on habit loops, emotional spending, and identity-driven purchases,\" Popovich said. \"Tariffs may change what people buy, or where they shop, but the general desire to consume isn't going anywhere.\"\nShe said consumers at large are displaying \"financial dissonance.\"\n\"This behavior reflects deeply ingrained consumption habits along with a psychological response to stress,\" she said, noting continued U.S. consumer spending despite record debt loads and economic skepticism before and after Trump's election. \"More specifically, when people feel anxious or uncertain, spending can become a way to assert control or maintain a sense of normalcy.\"\nBut others see potential for \"new normals\" with shopping, especially from more cash-strapped households, as Trump persists with his tariffs and other countries respond with their own levies.\nSome Americans could also potentially awaken to spending habits and how many material things they actually need.\nGeorge Carrillo, CEO of the Hispanic Construction Council advocacy group, said if tariffs result in higher prices, slower growth or both (i.e. stagflations) that could \"influence more conscious consumption habits, as shoppers weigh the necessity of every purchase.\"\n\"While America's role as a global consumer powerhouse isn't disappearing overnight, tariffs and mounting financial strain are undoubtedly nudging long-standing behaviors in a new direction,\" he said.\nConsumers, especially working class and middle income households are already stretched with prices up 24% overall since February 2020 and before the COVID-19 pandemic and its ensuing inflation wave.\nConsumer watchdog Michael Podolsky said American shoppers have already been frustrated by price hikes following Trump's tariffs announcement and the \"lack of transparency\" regarding pricing in general.\n\"Skepticism toward brands is growing among shoppers, with some believing companies are using price hikes as an opportunity rather than a necessity,\" said Podolsky, CEO and co-founder of PissedConsumer.com.\nTrump personally called Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos last month to complain about a report the e-commerce giant could list tariff costs next to some prices. Amazon said the disclosure idea was just being considered and would not come to fruition.\n\"The instances with price increases due to tariffs may soon lead to heightened public frustration as well as continue reshaping purchasing habits, with more consumers refusing the products affected by tariffs,\" Podolsky said. \"Some shoppers report that they have already delayed purchases or canceled services altogether.\"\nTrump was elected, in part, due to voters' frustrations with high, post-pandemic prices during the Biden administration.\nTrump contends inflation has cooled, including with gas prices averaging $3.15 per gallon (down 13% from a year ago), according to AAA.\nBut Puri said if product categories and store shelves have fewer options, that will allow the remaining product makers, including from the U.S., to potentially raise prices with less competition.\nCarrillo said Trump's trade pushes have thrown consumers and small businesses for a loop.\n\"The president initially promised relief from rising costs, but tariffs have taken us on a roller-coaster ride, forcing Americans to adjust to the reality of higher prices while being asked to 'stay patient,'\" Carrillo said. \"Adding to the frustration, the administration has shown resistance to companies like Amazon making the impacts of tariffs more transparent to consumers.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He claims the commission and state agencies are shortening the fishing season, reducing the size of removable fish, lowering commercial quotas and limiting recreational fishers on charter boats to one fish per day.\nThe new federal lawsuit expands beyond state agencies to include the U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and several environmental groups and natural resource agencies along the coast.\nThe suit targets agencies including the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, which coordinates conservation and management of coastal fish species in 15 states along the Atlantic.\nIn a press release, Newberry expressed frustrations shared by many in the fishing industry. \"For too long, our industry has allowed this obscure Interstate Compact (ASMFC) founded in 1942 to help furnish the food supply behind the war effort, to transform itself into a power-hungry partnership with massive support from federal government agencies which apparently think that fish are more important than people,\" he said.\nThe coalition of plaintiffs includes the Delmarva Fisheries Association.\nExecutive Order\nOn April 17, Trump signed an executive order titled \"Restoring American Seafood Competitiveness,\" vowing to end the monopoly of foreign seafood exports and make the U.S. the world's dominant seafood producer. The order also calls for investigation of the same policy makers that Newberry's coalition is suing.\nRegulatory agencies maintain that restrictions are not intended to harm commercial fisheries but to preserve them.\nAt numerous conferences, including the most recent, these agencies cited insufficient Atlantic striped bass populations based on Marine Recreational Information Program data from computer models. Their restrictions, they say, aim to address this shortage.\nMany in the fishing industry dispute these claims. Newberry said striped bass stock across the entire Mid-Atlantic region \"has never been more plentiful.\"\nCaptain Willy Hatch, president of the Cape Cod Charter Boat Association, questioned the scientific methods used to determine stock shortages.\n\"One major flaw in the claimed science behind this regulation is the NOAA's Marine Recreational Information program being used to estimate recreational and for-hire catch data, which has been found to be grossly overestimating recreational catch,\" Hatch said.\nEconomic impactMarc Berger, head of the East Coast Fishing Coalition, warned about broader economic impacts of fishing regulations.\n\"These actions threaten not only the present viability of our businesses but also the long-term sustainability of the for-hire sector of the fishing industry,\" Berger said. \"The ramifications extend beyond our industry, impacting hotels, restaurants, tackle shops and other merchants relying on our operations to sustain their livelihoods.\"\nNorth Carolina Watermen United expressed similar sentiments: \"We stand in solidarity with our fellow watermen in our opposition to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.\"\nThe group noted fishermen are struggling within the bounds of regulations on several species, including southern flounder, red drum, striped mullet and spotted trout.\n\"The socio-economic hardships put on not only our captains, crew, and families but our entire coastal communities when agencies continue to handcuff these watermen is immeasurable,\" the organization stated. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Department of Commerce unveils new Montana brand in Miles City\n\n May 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Hunter Herbaugh Miles City Star | Section: News \n \n 700\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n While the World Famous Bucking Horse Sale hit full stride in Miles City on Friday, it wasn't the only thing taking off, as the Montana Department of Commerce unveiled a new brand for the state on the first full day of the event. Coming as the first new brand for the state in over a decade, the new look is aimed at embodying the spirit of the state and its people, encapsulating the entirety of Big Sky Country from east to west.The event was held with all the fanfare it could muster, with Miles City and Custer County representatives standing alongside Department of Commerce leadership and Gov. Greg Gianforte, who is swinging through Miles City for his annual trip to the Bucking Horse Sale and his yearly 56 County Tour.\nUnveiling the new brand, DOC Chief Marketing Officer Mitch Staley said the launch of this new look is aimed at honoring Montana's character and history, and letting the rest of the world know it as well.\n\"It's a realignment with what has made Montana what it is with the brand that our state uses to promote the great things, the people and our stories — not only here in Montana, but all across the country and the world,\" Staley said. \"This brand helps to represent us to visitors who come here, it will help us attract new businesses by promoting our economy, and also, it helps promote and uplift the businesses that are here already.\"\nWhile promoting business is a major aspect of this new look for Montana, a large part of it is also aimed at the people, be those the people currently living in the state or those looking to come in and call it home. Gianforte emphasized this during his comments, saying his hope is that the new brand will get even those who have lived here all their lives to go out and rediscover what makes Montana special.\n\"For the first time in 16 years, we're re-introducing Montana to the world, and we're doing it by shining a spotlight on the people who make this place so great. Our new brand centers on the stories of real Montanans; of family ranches and veterans, small business owners, families and community leaders. Their voices, their experiences, their Montana.\"\nAnd of course, there's no other appropriate way to introduce a new Montana brand to the world than with a classic truck. Unveiled during Friday's launch, the new brand was emblazoned on the side of 1968 Chevy C-10 pick-up. The design is inspired by Montana's classic license plate, with a horizontal line in the colors of the setting sun breaking into the silhouette of rugged mountains to one side, representing the western side of the state, transitioning into a flat line that then rises into the visage of hills and cap rocks at the other end, representing the eastern side of the state, all set to a sky blue background.\nAs Staley describes it, the truck is a billboard on wheels advertising the state.\n\"This truck will be at all of our booths across the state Through the summer, we'll have several events... It's really a way to get this in front as many Montanans as we can rather than have one billboard, one static ad somewhere,\" he said.\nThe new brand also includes a new website aimed at improving the travel experience through Montana for visitors and residents alike, including updated road maps.\nMeanwhile, Gianforte described the brand as not only a testament to the state and its people, but also, in his personal opinion, a testament to the dream that Montana represents.\n\"Montana is recognized globally as America. It really is the heart of America. We have incredible outdoor adventure opportunities, but even more important are the people of Montana; the grit, the independence, the work ethic,\" he said. \"This brand is about telling the story of the people of Montana in a way that not only brings people here to visit, but, maybe, they come here to pursue the American dream.\"\nThe new brand, along with the truck, will be hitting the road this summer with a schedule of appearances set to be posted to the Department of Commerce website in the near future, according to Staley. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Markets vote daily on Trump's trade policy\n\n May 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RICK SCHIMING | Section: Columns \n \n 738\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In a sense, each business day is election day for the U.S. economy. Holders of U.S. stocks, U.S. Treasury bonds and U.S. dollars around the world make their trades and cast their dollar votes based on how they feel about the strength and sanity of US economic policy and the health and stability of American democracy.While widely publicized and widely followed, the U.S. stock market is the narrowest view of the health of the economy, essentially a vote on the future health of about 5,000 corporations that are listed on the major stock exchanges (NYSE and NASDAQ). The average daily dollar trading volume is around $300 billion. A falling stock market indicates that investors believe that profits will decline in the future for these corporations due to falling demand for their products and/or rising costs of production.\nLess reported and less well-known, the US Treasury bond market and the foreign exchange currency market provide a more important and meaningful vote on the state of the economy. The dollar votes cast in these markets are huge compared to the stock market. The Treasury securities market has a daily trading volume of nearly $1 trillion while in foreign exchange market, the average trading volume in dollars is over $6 trillion.\nLet's first look at the market for U.S. Treasury securities. The 10-year bond has long been the most widely held and safest financial asset worldwide because it has been backed by the absolute guarantee of the U.S. government never to default on this obligation. Typically, in times of economic distress around the world, investors increase their demand for these bonds, which raises their price and lowers their interest rate.\nThe foreign exchange market is where foreign currencies are traded daily. Investors around the world buy and sell U.S. dollars for their own respective currencies. A rising U.S. dollar internationally means that foreign investors want to hold dollars because of the strength and stability of the economy. A strong dollar reflects the role of the dollar as the central reserve asset and means of payment in the world economy.\nIn short, when the U.S. is seen as strong economically, U.S. Treasury interest rates fall and the value of the dollar rises. When the U.S. is seen as weak, Treasury interest rates rise and the value of the dollar falls.\nWhat has happened in these markets recently? Investors worldwide are fleeing all U.S. assets (stocks, Treasuries, and the U.S. dollar). This reflects an increasing distrust of our future economic health in the face of chaotic policy choices. Faith and confidence in the U.S. economy is disappearing as tariffs and other poor policy choices by the Trump administration slowly but surely erode international confidence in the United States.\nFor someone who wants to be seen as a winner, Trump is losing almost every day in the stock, US bond and foreign exchange markets. Trillions of dollar votes by investors around the world are being cast against Trump's stewardship of the economy and his economic policies.\nUnfortunately, he isn't the only one who loses. We all do.\nHigher interest rates for Treasuries means both costlier interest payments on the national debt leading to fewer federal funds available for other priorities and to bigger federal budget deficits in the future. Higher interest rates on Treasury bonds dictate higher interest rates across the US economy. Anyone paying interest on any debt is hurt by weakness in the US Treasury market.\nA weaker US dollar internationally also costs US consumers. A weaker dollar means that it costs us more dollars for us to buy goods and services from overseas. This puts even more inflationary pressure on our economy especially when combined with the inflationary pressure of increased tariffs.\nThe worst-case scenario of higher and wider tariffs? Falling stock prices, higher bond rates and a weak U.S. dollar could slow economic growth, increase unemployment and raise inflation. In other words, stagflation. The latest GDP figures already show a shrinking economy since Trump took office in January.\nThese big three financial markets are casting their dollar votes against Trump and his reckless and incoherent stewardship of the economy. When Trump moves to increase tariffs, these markets tank. When he backtracks on his tariff policies, the stock market soars. Doesn't this say volumes about the stupidity of his trade policies?\nIt is a humiliating defeat for him and a loss for all of us. Unless or until his policies change for the better, the resulting pain to US consumers will continue. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Waterfowl Festival concerned about losing funding\n\n May 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Business \n \n 583\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — After President Donald Trump proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts, organizations like the Waterfowl Festival began to worry about their future.According to the festival's Executive Director Deena Kilmon, more than just the future of the festival is at stake. Without expected funding, the maintaining the historic armory building, continuing the William A. Perry Scholarship Program, and fundraising for wildlife and habitat conservation are uncertain, Kilmon said.\nThe festival, one of Talbot County's largest economic drivers, has been in operation since 1971.\n\"We had independent auditors tell us that about 30,000 people were downtown during the festival last year,\" Kilmon said. \"You have the thousands of community residents that just enjoy all the free stuff, you know, the music and the parties, and then we have about a thousand volunteers that come over, which includes about 200 student volunteers every year.\"\nAccording to Kilmon, last year's festival filled all the hotels in Talbot County and three surrounding counties. \"Every restaurant was full Thursday, Friday, Saturday night. No one had any room anywhere, so we don't know the ultimate economic impact, but we know it's large,\" she said.\nThe Waterfowl Festival applied for several grants this year in fear federal and state art funding gets cut.\nThose grants include the Maryland Historic Trust Grant to target crucial repairs on the Armory building, fix ADA accessibility issues, and simply maintain the historic building that hosts nonprofit organizations for a small fee and is open to the public at no cost.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook said it's important for the Waterfowl Festival to remain in the town and she would like to keep the organization as the steward to the building.\n\"It would be great to keep them in the Armory because that building anchors our downtown, and since it is such a community space, it's important to keep it open to the community,\" Cook said.\n\"Waterfowl have been the stewards of that building for a number of years, they take great care of it. You know, it would be a tragedy, a true loss for the town if that building went dark,\" Cook later said.\nThe Maryland Heritage Areas Authority grant would allow the Waterfowl Festival to re-open the stage and host even more artists and speakers.\n\"Those are all the things we would love to do if we could bring the building up to modern safety standards,\" said Kilmon. \"But again, that's outside of our mission of supporting conservation and wildlife habitats across the nation. That's what we do for real, but this is just something that we feel like as stewards of the building, it's the right thing to do.\"\nThe festival will learn about its state and federally funded grants by the end of the fiscal year in June. In the meantime, Waterfowl Festival staff are preparing to make changes.\nCurrently, children do not have to pay to attend the festival or participate in many activities like soap carving and the fishing derby. That may change if the grants are not awarded.\nThe festival has raised over $6 million for conservation and wildlife preservation over the years and supported secondary education for student volunteers known as \"duck sitters.\" Last year, the festival raised $24,000 for scholarships, awarding each student $2,000.\nKilmon said a one-year deficit would not kill the festival, but if it continued, they'd have to take extra measures.\n\"You know, we'd have to start, I hate the word downsizing, but what I'll say is, making the footprint of the festival smaller, right? And offering less free opportunities for education,\" Kilmon said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Maryland's largest coal mine changes hands\n\n May 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: PAUL KIEFER Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 931\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Maryland's largest active underground coal mine changed hands last month after the mine's previous operator, Canadian firm Corsa Coal, filed for bankruptcy and auctioned assets to pay creditors.The new operator, Pennsylvania-based Rosebud Mining Company, will not inherit the dozens of delinquent fines levied by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) for safety violations at the Casselman mine in Garrett County, Maryland.\nA Western District of Pennsylvania Bankruptcy Court judge approved a $15 million bid from Rosebud to acquire two underground mines in March, though Corsa's creditors delayed finalizing the sale in hopes of attracting a higher bid.\nIn a declaration filed with the court in January, Corsa President Kevin Harrigan attributed his company's financial troubles in part to an unpredictable market. \"Economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures and corresponding monetary policy controls\" pushed coal prices below Corsa's mining costs in 2024, Harrigan wrote, straining the company's ability to cover looming debt payments.\nCorsa did not respond to a Capital News Service request for comment by press time.\nThe company issued layoff notices to 93 employees at the Casselman mine on March 13 — a majority of the more than 100 people working at the mine as of 2024, according to MSHA records.\nRosebud hired 50 former Corsa employees after the acquisition, most of whom remain at the Casselman mine.\nThe mine produced roughly 660,000 tons of coal in 2023 — a relatively small output compared to the largest mines in neighboring Pennsylvania and West Virginia, but more than twice the output of the next-largest mine in Maryland in the same year.\nThe Casselman mine yields metallurgical coal, used to heat blast furnaces for steel production.\nWhile the market for thermal coal, used to generate electricity, has dwindled in the face of competition from cheap natural gas and renewable energy sources, the metallurgical coal market is relatively insulated from those pressures.\n\"There is still a very strong need for metallurgical coal,\" said Allegany Coal & Land Co. President Steve Jenkins, whose western Maryland company leases property to small coal operators.\nAnd although coal is not a renewable resource, Jenkins noted that Maryland's coal seams are far from expended. \"It's just a matter of how much is accessible in the regulatory environment,\" he said.\nBut like any commodity, the metallurgical coal market experiences price fluctuations, including an ongoing supply imbalance that pushed prices below Corsa's mining costs.\nHarrigan's declaration makes no mention of delinquent MSHA fines, and the total amount left unpaid to the agency — just under $25,000 — is relatively minor compared to other obligations, including $21.3 million in debts acquired by purchasing or leasing mining equipment, parts and fuel.\nThose unpaid fines stem from a range of safety violations, including several flagged by MSHA as \"reasonably likely to result in a serious injury or illness.\"\nIn October 2024, for instance, MSHA inspectors issued a $5,000 fine to the Corsa subsidiary operating the Casselman mine for allowing coal dust to accumulate, creating a fire or explosion hazard — one of more than 80 fines issued to the operator for the same violation since 2019, records show.\nOn the same day, inspectors also fined the company $2,400 for failing to provide adequate firefighting infrastructure for Casselman miners. Both fines remain delinquent, although Corsa paid other fines issued later the same year.\nA bankruptcy attorney representing Corsa did not respond to a CNS inquiry about why those delinquent fines were not listed as liabilities in the company's initial bankruptcy filing.\nBut Wes Addington, executive director of the Appalachian Citizens' Law Center, said MSHA doesn't pursue unpaid fines as aggressively as other federal regulatory agencies. The center is a nonprofit law firm based in Whitesburg, Kentucky, that represents coal miners and their families on black lung and safety cases and advocates on environmental issues related to coal extraction in the region.\n\"I'm skeptical (about) how much energy the government is going to put into trying to collect those fines,\" he said, given MSHA's track record of allowing mines to continue operating with thousands of dollars in delinquent safety violation fines.\nThe change in ownership at the Casselman mine comes as some mine safety advocates like Addington raise alarms about the risks created by an increasingly feeble MSHA.\nAn analysis of public data published by the Appalachian Citizens' Law Center in March indicates that MSHA has lost roughly half of its coal mine inspection staff in the past decade.\nFederal law requires the agency to inspect surface mines at least twice and underground mines at least four times annually.\nTony Oppegard, a former mine inspector who previously served as an adviser to the MSHA administrator under President Bill Clinton, told Capital News Service that he doubts the agency will be held to those standards in the current political climate.\n\"In years past, if MSHA was having a hard time making their twos and fours, there would generally be an oversight committee in the House and or the Senate who would call them in and want an explanation,\" he said. \"With the current Congress, I don't know if they'd even care.\"\nThe Trump administration's decision in March to close dozens of MSHA field offices, including several in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, compounded those concerns.\n\"Consolidating offices will reduce emergency response efficiency by placing inspectors farther from mining sites, making it more difficult for them to respond quickly in the event of a mine disaster,\" said Erin Bates, the communications director for the United Mine Workers of America. \"With an already limited workforce, stretching inspectors even thinner will reduce oversight effectiveness and compromise miner safety.\"\nWorkers at the Casselman mine are not unionized, and Maryland mines are served by an MSHA office in Morgantown, West Virginia that is not slated for closure. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tariff effects not seen in Port of Baltimore yet\n\n May 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DARANEE BALACHANDAR Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 648\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BALTIMORE — It is still too early to gauge the impacts of President Donald Trump's widespread tariffs on imported goods on the Port of Baltimore, despite other ports experiencing changes.\"We expect to see impacts with our container business, especially from China,\" said Richard Scher, director of communications for the Port Baltimore, in a statement to Capital News Service. \"But those impacts will likely not show until June.\"\nTing Long Ding, operations management and business analytics professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, told CNS that larger ports, like the Port of Los Angeles and the neighboring Port of Long Beach, would experience a much more significant drop in imports compared to the Port of Baltimore because the general volume of imports at the southern California ports is much greater.\nLos Angeles and Long Beach also are geographically closer to China, the second-largest source of U.S. imports, and other Asian and South Pacific nations.\nOn May 12, the United States and China reached an agreement to lower tariffs. Under the new deal, the United States will reduce tariffs on goods imported from China from 145 percent to 30 percent, while China will lower its tariffs on American imports from 125 percent to 10 percent.\n\"It is important to note that even with this China agreement, tariffs are much higher overall than they were at the beginning of the year,\" said John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in a statement issued after the U.S.-China trade talks. Businesses, including small enterprises, are trying to manage with the disruptions and growing costs, Murphy added.\n\"We continue to urge the Trump Administration to prioritize tariff relief for businesses and families, and to address foreign trade barriers as it negotiates with other countries,\" Murphy said.\n\"Ultimately, the impact of tariffs on the Port of Baltimore and all ports will depend on the length of time that the tariffs are implemented in addition to the decisions of shippers to send their products to the U.S.,\" Scher said.\nLast year, the Port of Baltimore was the second-biggest importer of automobiles in the United States. It lost its first place due to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse, which paused operations at the port from March to July last year.\nBaltimore's port is one of the only ports in the country to have equipment and facilities to handle and store roll-on/roll-off cargo like fully assembled cars, motorcycles and trucks.\nThe Port of Baltimore also receives other imports like nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery, aluminum, iron and steel, according to U.S. Census data.\nSome auto manufacturing customers that ship into U.S. ports, including Baltimore, are holding their vehicles at the port of entry, while others are adding import fees or absorbing the tariffs, Scher said.\nRep. Johnny Olszewski (D-Maryland) told CNS the tariffs are another setback for the Port of Baltimore, which still is recovering from the bridge collapse.\n\"It's challenge after challenge after challenge, except this one is completely avoidable. There's no reason for the president to need to propose these tariffs,\" Olszewki said. \"There's been no good reason expressed to members of Congress or the American people about what the real purpose of a tariff is.\"\nThe congressman said he has not received any complaints or concerns related to the tariffs from individual port workers.\nThe International Longshoremen's Association, which represents Baltimore's port workers, endorsed Trump in last year's election. ILA President Harold Daggett in January credited Trump with helping the union obtain a new contract with stronger provisions against automation. He called the president \"one of the best friends of working men and women in the United States.\"\nThe ILA said it had no comment on the tariffs for now.\nDing said the tariffs would impact port workers and truck drivers in the long run.\nThe Port of Baltimore is an economic engine that would have a direct and indirect impact on all the sectors and workers supporting it, Ding said.\n\"It's an entire ecosystem,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 4.0 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stand 45.5 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has increased 2.9 cents in the last week and stands at $3.502 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.69 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $3.79 per gallon, a difference of $1.10per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 6.1 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.14 per gallon Monday. The national average is up 1.9 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 41.0 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nMay 19, 2024: $3.53 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.55 per gallon)May 19, 2023: $3.44 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.52 per gallon)May 19, 2022: $4.59 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.60 per gallon)May 19, 2021: $3.05 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.04 per gallon)May 19, 2020: $1.95 per gallon (U.S. Average: $1.90 per gallon)May 19, 2019: $2.76 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.84 per gallon)May 19, 2018: $2.91 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.92 per gallon)May 19, 2017: $2.32 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.35 per gallon)May 19, 2016: $2.26 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.27 per gallon)May 19, 2015: $2.66 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.71 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.02 per gallon, down 7.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.09 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.15 per gallon, up 5.1 cents per gallon from last week's $3.10 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.24 per gallon, unchanged from last week's $3.23 per gallon.\n\"Gasoline prices jumped in over three-quarters of U.S. states over the last week, as oil prices surged following former President Trump's decision to reduce tariffs and strike new trade deals — moves that inspired optimism that a major tariff-induced economic slowdown might be avoided,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"In addition to gains in price-cycling markets, rising oil prices — fueled by economic optimism and tightening gasoline inventories — contributed to broader upward pressure on prices. While Americans are still seeing significant savings compared to a year ago, that gap has narrowed as oil prices have rebounded. As we approach Memorial Day, GasBuddy is preparing to release its summer travel survey results and issue a gas price forecast for the season. For now, motorists can expect one of the most affordable summers for hitting the road since the pandemic, with gas prices tracking at some of the lowest inflation-adjusted levels in years.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Moore signs two energy bills, including debated solar legislation\n\n May 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 515\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed two prominent energy bills into law on Tuesday, bills largely opposed by Eastern Shore Republicans during this year's Maryland General Assembly.Senate Bills 931 and 937 were part of an expansive energy package lawmakers wrestled with this session. While Moore vetoed the package's third bill, due in part to budgetary reasons, he put pen to paper for the others.\nThe Renewable Energy Certainty Act, or SB931, aims to increase the state's solar generation by streamlining the regulatory process for solar projects. Specifically, it provides the Maryland Public Service Commission with approving authority for projects under the 2-megawatt threshold.\nTuesday, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said the legislation creates \"a clear path forward for solar and battery storage projects to eliminate local barriers and allow local government to join in community solar programs.\"\n\"It is essential that we have more affordable and cleaner, Maryland-made energy,\" Ferguson said.\nBut Eastern Shore legislators, as well as county representatives, don't see it the same way.\nRepublican legislators unsuccessfully pushed for Moore to veto the bill amid concerns it strips away local control over solar project approvals and places too much authority at the hands of the Public Service Commission.\nCaroline County Commission President Travis Breeding said it will override the county-instituted 2,000-acre solar cap.\nPer the legislation, the Public Service Commission can grant solar project approvals on up to 5% of land designated for agriculture and forests. County leaders say the amount of land prone to solar development could quadruple.\n\"It's going to change the landscape, it's going to change the look of the county,\" Breeding said in an interview, citing concerns on food production and agricultural jobs. \"It's going to change our economy.\"\nBreeding noted the commissioners are \"pursuing solutions at the federal level\" in the form of reaching out to Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.). Breeding hopes there can be federal restrictions on solar project subsidies so developers \"cannot offer these lucrative deals to entice landowners.\"\nSENATE BILL 937\nThe Next Generation Energy Act, or SB937, focuses on ratepayer relief after a winter of skyrocketing energy bills — a trend Ferguson said was a \"wake-up call\" and not just a \"temporary spike.\"\nFerguson noted $200 million will go toward ratepayer refunds — an average of $80 per household, Ferguson said, split between winter and summer payments.\nThe bill looks to increase in-state generation by trimming permitting processes as coal and oil plants reach their ends.\n\"We know that older coal plants and oil plants are being retired based on private action, and we have not built up enough alternative energy to fill it fast enough, and so the General Assembly had to act,\" Ferguson said.\nDel. Chris Adams (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said the bill's framework doesn't do enough to incentivize nuclear energy or in-state generation. Adams and other Republicans have also disagreed with Democrats on the premise that the bill provides necessary relief to ratepayers.\n\"Maryland is still ... dependent on other states to bring us energy,\" Adams said in an interview last week. \"It's expensive, and that sole political decision is what's creating the ratepayer difficulties that we're experiencing and will experience moving forward.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It was founded in 1961.\nIn Easton, a number of affordable housing projects had been pursued under The Arc Central Chesapeake Region name, some of which are still in the works. Last year, the organization opened the Port Street Commons, a mixed-use building with nine apartment units and office headquarters.\nThe Arc Central Chesapeake Region previously had two subsidiaries for housing management and community development: Chesapeake Neighbors and Chesapeake Community Development. Under Fello, those subsidiaries will remain. For brand purposes, they'll be jointly presented as Fello Communities.\nRondeau said Fello's history as a longtime chapter of The Arc isn't taken for granted.\nThe Arc's national organization dates back to the 1950s when it was first organized by parent groups in Minneapolis. It has chapters across the country, including Maryland's chapter and many local chapters within the state.\n\"Being part of The Arc and a national movement is a really important part of our history, and we would've never gotten here without that,\" Rondeau said. \"But at some point, we all grow up.\"\nIn a press release, Fello stated it serves over 4,000 Marylanders in Anne Arundel County and the Eastern Shore. There are over 650 employees, nearly 100 housing units and 43 properties, the release stated.\nThose services won't go away due to the name change, Rondeau said.\nThe Fello president noted the nonprofit's Board of Directors and top executives had been discussing the name change for a couple years. Once they began transitioning in recent months, the excitement has been \"contagious,\" Rondeau said.\n\"I think there's also excitement of really being able to have our own brand that feels like us, it feels connected to our values, it feels connected to our vision and mission,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But proposed short-term rental (STR) regulations, introduced by Council members Lynn Mielke and Pete Lesher, threaten my livelihood and the community I love.These regulations add red tape, longer minimum stays, stricter licensing, inspections and hearings that make running a responsible STR feel impossible. They don't just impact me; they jeopardize the local cleaners, landscapers and businesses like restaurants and boutiques that thrive on tourism. My guests, often families or bridal parties, pour money into our economy, supporting the $260 million tourism industry that employs one in nine residents, per tourtalbot.org.\nWe already follow strict rules: We're licensed, pay taxes, meet safety codes and pass inspections. I support fair regulations, but these changes feel like a solution in search of a problem.\nAt the May 2025 Planning Commission meeting, over 40 property and business owners, including STR Review Board members Keith Watts and Cindy Reichart, raised concerns about their necessity. This should be a wake-up call.\nTourism is Talbot County's backbone, with 750,000 visitors in 2024. My business houses them, keeping dollars flowing to local shops and services year-round. These regulations could choke this economic engine, driving away guests and hurting small businesses.\nI'm not asking for a free pass — just fairness. STR owners like me support local events and keep tourism vibrant. I've built my dream here, and it's heartbreaking to feel that effort penalized. The current rules work: they protect residents, ensure safety, and generate revenue. Why fix what isn't broken?\nI'm speaking out for myself, my family and every worker and shopkeeper who relies on tourism. Talbot County Council, please don't shut out the people who serve this community.\nLet's keep our doors open for visitors who love this place as much as we do.\nMICHELLE HOYLE\nSt. Michaels \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Economic reality needs to drive budget decisions\n\n May 31, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 706\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In a recent column, I wrote about the following three thought-provoking news reports on Maryland's bond ratings and fiscal policies that merit immediate attention of Gov. Moore and the leadership of the General Assembly:Decisions by Moody's to downgrade Maryland's fiscal outlook from stable to negative for the first time since 2011.Unanswered questions on how to address structural state budget deficits driven in large part by state funding obligations for the Blueprint for Maryland's Future.The potential for Maryland to experience similar outcomes to those recurring in Delaware where businesses have relocated or are planning to relocate their Delaware incorporation after concluding that state has a hostile to business environment.\nNow comes the unwelcome news that Standard & Poor's Global Ratings has issued a negative outlook for outstanding revenue bonds issued by the Maryland Transportation Authority.\nSince 1971, the transportation authority has been responsible for building, operating, improving Maryland's toll facilities, and financing new transportation projects.\nCurrently MDTA operates, maintains and collects tolls on the Fort McHenry Tunnel, Harbor Tunnel, Chesapeake Bay Bridge, Hatem Memorial Bridge, Gov. Harry W. Nice/Sen. Thomas \"Mac\" Middleton Bridge, Millard Tydings Bridge and Maryland Route 200, aka the Intercounty Connector highway in Montgomery County and Prince George's County.\nMDTA is also in charge of the massive job of rebuilding, reopening and operating the Francis Scott Key Bridge that will, at some point, once again connect Anne Arundel and Baltimore counties.\nWhile Standard & Poor's recently reaffirmed MDTA's current AA bond rating, they also downgraded its outlook on MDTA's bond rating from stable to negative. They warned of the potential for future changes, in part due to S&P's uncertainty over the costs of building the Key Bridge replacement.\nThese costs have been estimated to be at least $1.8 billion.\nFunding sources for those replacement costs are uncertain especially if the Trump administration continues to aggressively pursue further reductions in federal government spending.\nWhat if only some or none of the $1.8 billion promised by former President Biden for bridge replacement is delivered by the federal government?\nSuch an outcome is possible given a Republican president and a Republican Congress.\nIn any event, S&P does not foresee raising the recently reaffirmed AA bond rating upward \"given MDTA's relatively high debt burden and additional borrowing plans.\"\nConversely, S&P has warned there is \"at least a one-in-three chance they could lower the rating within the two-year outlook based on final costs to replace the Key Bridge along with MDTA's s $5.1 billion capital improvement program.\"\nCurrently MDTA has $2.1 billion in outstanding debt. In fiscal 2026, which begins July 1, 2025, that debt amount is expected to \"increase significantly\" to $2.6 billion, according to an analysis of the General Assembly's nonpartisan Department Legislative Services.\nThat analysis projects outstanding MDTA debt will increase to $3.3 billion in fiscal 2027, before peaking at $3.8 billion in fiscal years 2029 and 2030.\nThose amounts are slightly less than that provided for in MDTA's statutory authority on a borrowing cap.\nTo date, MDTA seems unconcerned by these negative news reports.\nAn MDTA spokesperson has said, \"The agency will continue to meet its debt payment obligations despite the loss of the Key Bridge and temporary loss of associated revenues, the MDTA expects to remain in compliance with all board directed financial policies and trust agreement covenants.\"\nOne has to ask: Is that based on rigorous analysis or wishful thinking?\nI predict all the above news will result in Gov. Moore calling a special session of the Maryland General Assembly well before the next regular session convenes in January 2026.\nIf and when a special session is held this year, Gov. Moore and the leadership in the General Assembly have a responsibility to every Maryland taxpayer.\nThat responsibility is simple and achievable.\nCollectively and individually, they need to acknowledge, understand and respect the observations in all of these bond rating reports.\nThey need to give special attention to Moody's report which includes the following: \"The negative outlook incorporates difficulties Maryland will face to achieve balanced financial operations in coming years without sacrificing service delivery goals or adding to the weight of the state government's burden on individual and corporate taxpayers.\"\nIt is imperative that in any special session and in future regular sessions, decisions on state spending levels, spending cuts, new taxes, tax increases, new fees and fee increases be based solely on economic realities. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In fact, he even requested to see the bottle complete with the label.But wines from Maryland in general, and Southern Maryland in particular, have come a long way since then.\n\"I think our reputation has definitely improved,\" Zimmerman said during a lecture titled \"Port of Leonardtown Winery, and the History of Wine in Maryland\" held May 21 at Historic Sotterley. \"I think people and their wineries experience has improved. There's also a lot of experienced winemakers coming into the area, which has improved the quality of Maryland wines immensely.\"\nThe Leonardtown winery is celebrating its 15th season this year and has won numerous wine industry awards.\n\"We're very well known for producing wines in general, dry and sweet,\" Zimmerman said.\nThe lecture also featured wine tastings of a limited edition sparkling red the winery will release in June.\n\"It is a dry red sparkling and it's loaded with red berry flavors,\" Zimmerman said of the wine, the label of which was designed by local artist Bernard Matus. \"It has lots of notes of blueberry, raspberry. I think it's going to fly off the shelves.\"\nThe lecture also included Southern Maryland Grape Grower's Cooperative President David Wood, who is also owner of Forest Hall Farm Market in Mechanicsville.\n\"We needed a viable alternative. Nobody's going to create a market just for grape juice,\" Wood said of the winery's beginnings in 2007. \"Just like anything else that is new, you learn as you grow. The money's not in the grapes, the money is in the profit of the wine.\"\nBut Wood added it wasn't easy for former tobacco farmers to start growing grapes.\n\"You weren't prepared to do the marketing, to go out and shop your crop to find a buyer who was willing to buy it,\" he said. \"That's not a farmer's strength; they're used to staying at home and dealing with their crops. The selling of the crop was the big issue and the co-op stepped up and provided a solution to that challenge.\"\nWith the start of the wine co-op in 2007 — the first in the state — farmers still faced hurdles before seeing the literal fruits of their labors.\n\"The [profit] net was pretty good because tobacco was labor-intensive; it didn't require a lot of investment,\" Wood said. \"Grapes on the other hand are costly and it takes about three years of growing the grapes before you get your first harvest.\"\nWood said wineries require an investment of about $10,000 an acre \"before you get your first crop, and you probably won't break even until your fifth or sixth harvest.\"\nBut he added growers will \"probably get 20, 25 years of harvests, so once you get over the hump, you can really get ahead.\"\nThe Port of Leonardtown Winery had its first crush of grapes in 2009 and opened a year later.\nWood added that a single winery can usually offer the basic red and white varieties, but having a co-op means a selection of 20 labels or more.\n\"It gives us not only more grapes, but a wider variety,\" he said. \"It turns into a product mix of more unique wines.\"\nZimmerman said Port of Leonardtown produces about 5,000 cases annually, and that red and white grapes are treated differently; reds get a mix of seeds and skin where it gets its flavor and color, while whites are made with whole cluster pressing.\nAll reds are aged in an oak barrel, while all white grapes are aged in a stainless steel drum.\n\"Chardonnay made in stainless steel barrels have crisp, clean like green apple flavor,\" she said, \"versus chardonnays in made in oak barrels have a baked apple, vanilla cinnamon-spiced, clove flavor. They're different styles, but just both beautiful wines.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Prices in Maryland are 12.1 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stand 58.4 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has decreased 2.4 cents in the last week and stands at $3.465 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.65 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $3.79 per gallon, a difference of $1.14 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has fallen 3.8 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.09 per gallon Monday. The national average is down 6.9 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 41.0 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nJune 2, 2024: $3.60 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.50 per gallon)June 2, 2023: $3.44 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.54 per gallon)June 2, 2022: $4.67 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.76 per gallon)June 2, 2021: $3.03 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.04 per gallon)June 2, 2020: $2.02 per gallon (U.S. Average: $1.99 per gallon)June 2, 2019: $2.72 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.81 per gallon)June 2, 2018: $2.94 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.95 per gallon)June 2, 2017: $2.37 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.38 per gallon)June 2, 2016: $2.33 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.33 per gallon)June 2, 2015: $2.72 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.76 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $2.97 per gallon, down 1.9 cents per gallon from last week's $2.99 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.12 per gallon, unchanged from last week's $3.12 per gallon.Hagerstown: $2.98 per gallon, down 10.8 cents per gallon from last week's $3.09 per gallon.\n\"The national average price of gasoline has continued its gentle descent over the last week, with the most notable declines seen in the Great Lakes region, where a minor refinery issue was resolved, sending wholesale gas prices lower,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"We're also beginning to see prices retreat in California, a trend that should soon extend across much of the West Coast as additional gasoline shipments from Asia help offset recent refinery disruptions. While gasoline inventories remain somewhat tight heading into the summer, I'm optimistic that increased refinery output could pave the way for further price declines.

The store then held a grand opening Saturday with company leaders and town officials.\nThe 35,000-square-foot store is located on Marlboro Avenue, nestled within the Tred Avon Square business center. The business offers household goods, clothing, food and more at discount prices.\nTown Council President Don Abbatiello expressed excitement for Ocean State Job Lot during Monday's council meeting. He said replacing the former Big Lots was important.\n\"It's always good for us to be reusing facilities as opposed to trying to break ground on something new,\" Abbatiello said.\nIn March, Ocean State Job Lot announced it acquired 15 Big Lots locations across many states following Big Lots' bankruptcy claim last year. Three of those locations are in Maryland: Easton, Elkton and Chester.\nEaston's opening makes it the second Ocean State Job Lot in to welcome Maryland shoppers. The company's Hagerstown location cut the ribbon in April.\n\"We're thrilled to introduce Maryland to our unique brand of shopping,\" said Easton store team leader Bob Thomas in a press release. \"We've worked hard to create a bright, friendly, and convenient shopping experience for residents and visitors alike, and we're grateful to be part of the Easton community.\"\nThe Easton Ocean State Job Lot is open Mondays through Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The cruises have been a major driving force of Cambridge's tourism and economy, Christopher said.\nThe Dorchester Chamber of Commerce has not done data collection on the economic impact of the cruise line visits, but Christopher said they certainly helps local shops and restaurants.\nAccording to Elusive Tours owner Jerry Hayes, the cruise line has shifted its focus from Cambridge to St. Michaels this year. Elusive Tours partners with the American Cruise Lines in both cities, and Hayes said the business is currently operating two tours with cruise guests in Cambridge: one at RAR Brewing and the other at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.\nHayes said even though Cambridge is no longer a primary port this summer, it won't be neglected.\nElusive Tours helps to bus cruise ship guests from St. Michaels to Cambridge to visit Harriet Tubman's historic sites and museums, the market at Church Creek, and RAR's brewery.\nFor one excursion, Elusive Tours takes guests with author and Dorchester County historian Jim Duffy on a boat ride through Cambridge Harbor as he narrates the tales of the Eastern Shore.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Cruise sets sail from Baltimore, stopping in Annapolis, Yorktown, Williamsburg, St. Michaels and sometimes Cambridge. The cruise is advertised on the website as an eight-day riverboat cruise that takes guests to the \"crab capital of the world.\"\nHayes said the cruise is a great opportunity to explore the Chesapeake. \"Even if you're a local, it's a unique way to see where you live, and if you've never been here before, you'll fall in love,\" he said.\nChristopher and Hayes said the less frequent stops in Cambridge is likely a temporary change in the American Cruise Line's Chesapeake Bay Cruises itinerary, but that is not certain. American Cruise Line's did not respond to a request to comment.\nThis has been updated to correct a name spelling. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gut punch to seniors, families\n\n June 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 319\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I want to publicly thank Congressman Andy Harris for casting a \"present\" vote on the so-called \"Big Beautiful Bill\" (H.R. 1). While this vote may seem inconsequential at first glance, in today's hyper-partisan climate, even a moment of hesitation is a sign worth recognizing.But the job isn't finished. When this reckless piece of legislation returns from the Senate, I urge Congressman Harris to take a stronger stand — and vote no.\nThis bill is fiscal malpractice. It will send the national debt into the stratosphere, piling trillions in unfunded giveaways onto future generations. It slashes the foundation of health care for millions by stripping access to Medicaid and chipping away at Medicare — a gut punch to seniors and working families alike.\nEven worse, it's a shell game. Clever accounting gimmicks are buried in the text to disguise the real cost and delay the fiscal fallout just long enough to clear a few election cycles. But voters and markets alike will not be fooled forever.\nLet's call this bill what it is: the largest single transfer of wealth from the working poor to the ultra-wealthy in U.S. legislative history. While corporate tax cuts and loopholes proliferate, everyday Americans are left to carry the burden.\nTo put things in perspective, in the 1950s when the American economy was firing on all cylinders, the typical CEO made about 20 times the salary of the average worker, and the highest income tax bracket was 90%.\nToday's CEOs make roughly 200 times their average worker's salary and pay a maximum tax rate of 37%. Do the drafters of this bill really think that another big tax break for rich people is a higher priority than reducing the deficit? Or food assistance for pregnant women and hungry children?\nCongressman Harris, you had the wisdom to pause the first time. Now have the courage to oppose it. Eastern Shore families — and the nation — are counting on it.\nROBERT MURPHY\nStevensville \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 7.7 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stand 55.8 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has increased 4.0 cents in the last week and stands at $3.488 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.55 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $3.99 per gallon, a difference of $1.44 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 1.1 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.08 per gallon today. The national average is down 9.5 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 32.7 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nJune 16, 2024: $3.59 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.41 per gallon)June 16, 2023: $3.41 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.55 per gallon)June 16, 2022: $4.99 per gallon (U.S. Average: $5.01 per gallon)June 16, 2021: $3.00 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.08 per gallon)June 16, 2020: $2.11 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.10 per gallon)June 16, 2019: $2.59 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.67 per gallon)June 16, 2018: $2.85 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.89 per gallon)June 16, 2017: $2.28 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.29 per gallon)June 16, 2016: $2.33 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.36 per gallon)June 16, 2015: $2.76 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.81 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.00 per gallon, up 9.8 cents per gallon from last week's $2.91 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.09 per gallon, up 2.3 cents per gallon from last week's $3.07 per gallon.Hagerstown: $2.98 per gallon, up 10.5 cents per gallon from last week's $2.88 per gallon.\n\"With Israel and Iran trading attacks, oil prices have surged to multi-month highs — setting the stage for additional price hikes at gas pumps across the country,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"As long as tensions in the Middle East continue to escalate, the risk of further impacts on oil prices remains high. For now, I expect gas prices could rise by 10 to 20 cents, while diesel could climb 15 to 25 cents in the coming days.

    "content": "Data centers could cause significant electricity challenges\n\n June 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Michael Reid mreid@somdnews.com | Section: News \n \n 536\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Data from phones, computers and many other devices has to go somewhere, and that somewhere is data centers.The Patuxent Partnership addressed that issue June 16 with a discussion titled \"Data Centers: The pros and cons and what it means for you, the residential customers,\" at the USMSM Building in California.\nData centers are giant warehouses filled with microprocessors that manage all data on the Cloud. There are currently 44 data centers in Maryland, and almost 300 in Northern Virginia.\nWith more data centers comes the need for more electricity to supply them.\n\"People should not so much be concerned about them, but aware of them,\" said Scott White, who is on the The Patuxent Partnership board of directors and is CEO/President of HTii. \"I think it's important to understand the economic forces that are driving this integration of data centers, but also the potential impact for their power supply and whether the cost goes up if there's more demand.\"\nPanelist Sonja Cox, president/CEO of SMECO, said the co-op can put out a maximum of 1,036 megawatts — or peak load — and data center developers are talking about the need to add another 4,000 megawatts.\n\"The data center developers want the data centers built yesterday,\" Cox said, \"so they want the power, they need the power to run them.\"\nShe added SMECO is working on some feasibility studies, but was unable to go into details because of non-disclosure agreements.\n\"I will say that the main thing we want to make sure is that our customers are not subsidizing this bigger load,\" she said.\nLarger data centers can use as much electricity as a medium-sized town.\n\"It's a brave new world right now with AI and data centers,\" panelist and Constellation Vice President of Government and Regulatory Affairs Lael Campbell Campbell said, adding that the matter is one of national security, which \"we have to take seriously. We see ourselves as the key part in how America is going to win that race and how America is going to support this new growing economy.\"\nCampbell added that a new data center \"is not going to just plop down 1,000 megawatts of demand overnight. They're phasing in that demand over time, so it's not like all of a sudden the entire output of a nuclear power plant is going to be sucked off the grid. Frankly, that's a bit of fear mongering.\"\nData centers can also have an effect on power grids, telecommunications and power lines.\n\"We're talking about 100 acres of forest or farms in Southern Maryland. We're talking about a fundamental shift in our economy, our way of life, our natural resources,\" independent advocate and panelist Rosa Hance said, adding that data centers \"could be shifting the way we use our land and other natural resources.\"\nCalvert County is in favor of data centers.\n\"There are legislators who want to keep data centers out of Maryland,\" Commissioner President Earl F. \"Buddy\" Hance (R) said in an April Southern Maryland News story.\nHe added he was \"tired of hearing Annapolis say, 'We can't allow these data centers because we don't have power.' We all draw power from the same grid. We are going to lose revenue and jobs. If the state of Maryland creates obstacles, they [data centers] aren't coming here.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Co-owners Nick and Chikki Shajwani credit the Waterfowl Festival as one of the main reasons they're coming to Easton.\n\"The biggest thing that drew us to Easton was the Waterfowl Festival. We've been coming there for over a decade, plus now, and being part of that festival. It's been an amazing run,\" Chikki said.\nThe journey for the brothers started long before they owned a store. It goes all the way back to visiting the United States as tourists in the summer of 1998.\nIn 2002, the brothers moved to the United States, setting up in Galena, Maryland. The began to work for a man named Scott Mason, the original owner of Molly's Place.\n\"Molly was a black lab, and that happened to be Scott Mason's dog,\" Chikki said. \"We used to be in a hardware business. We had a hardware store in Galena, and it used to be slow in the winter time. Nick had this crazy idea because since it was so slow in the winter.\"\nAccording to Nick, all summer long Mason would be there every day, and then during the winter he would disappear. Nick asked Mason where he went during the winter, and Mason told him he went to his hunting property.\nAfter Nick found out about the Eastern Shore's wintertime hunting culture, he thought of the idea of opening a sporting goods store.\n\"That's how the sporting good store came to be. We opened a little sporting good store in a 900-square-foot space that used to be our lawn mower repair shop. That's how we got into this sporting goods business. We did great the first year,\" Nick said.\nMason bought out a building that housed a store named Vonnies in 2009, and in 2010 the brothers open Molly's Place's Kennedyville location.\nThe brothers now open their second location, which will feature partnerships no other store on the east coast offers, they said.\n\"This store is going to be more of our experiential store,\" Nick said. \"We are going to really go into and specialize in the product that we feel the community would really support. We have a great partnership coming through, which is the first of its kind. A strategic partnership with a brand called KUIU which is high-end hunting gear, which they have never done that with any other independent retailer in the country.\"\nAccording to Nick, the California-based company coming to the Easton is a \"huge feat for every outdoorsman and outdoor women that's out there.\"\nThe brothers are excited to bring Molly's Place to Talbot County and surrounding areas, with the store expected to open in late July or August.\n\"Molly's, at the end of the day, is a core-values driven company,\" Nick said. \"We are going to carry the same values that we have worked towards, perfected and delivered here and been part of us, and we are excited about carrying and bringing that to Talbot County and those surrounding areas.\"\nThis report was updated to clarify misspelling from \"Bonnies\" to \"Vonnies.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — The beloved Blue Crab Coffee Shop in St. Michaels has reopened under new ownership, but they're not new to many on the Eastern Shore. Bagery owner Matt Andrews has expanded his reach from Easton to St. Michaels with the Blue Crab.Andrews took ownership of the establishment in May, and he says he's excited to honor the history of the space.\nThe Blue Crab building was a formerly Odd Fellows Lodge, built in 1867. It was originally named the Shealtiel Lodge No. 1024. Four years after the Civil War ended, the building was renamed to the Freedom's Friend Lodge No. 1024, and is the oldest Odd Fellows Lodge remaining in Maryland.\n\"All the plates that we use are from former Odd Fellows Lodges around the country,\" Andrews said.\nHe wants to pay homage to the building's former use by learning and preserving its history through social media videos, interviews with members of the historical society, and by getting footage of some of the artifacts.\n\"We're anxious to learn more and tell people about it,\" he said.\nAlong with the interesting history that comes with the establishment, Andrews is excited to expand service beyond breakfast and lunch. He said they plan on testing out dinner service soon but want to get their footing at the new location first.\nAndrews says the community response has been overwhelmingly positive with strong feedback on the organic bread products made from scratch in Easton.\n\"All the feedback has been good about the food and the coffee and service,\" Andrews said.\nFormer Blue Crab owners Helen and Brian Herman stepped away from the restaurant in mid-April so Helen could focus on her architecture practice, Brian on his recording studio and so the two could spend more time with their three children, according to a Facebook post made by the Blue Crab in early April.\nAndrews said the Herman's still own the building and he has a good working relationship with them. \"We've had a good relationship with them over the years,\" he said. \"They have been buying bagels wholesale from the Bagery since we opened in 2018.\"\nAccording to Andrews, a majority of the menu uses the products they make in house at the Bagery and has an array of vegan options.\nBlue Crab baristas Anna Szwaja and Alyssa Skinner said the transition in ownership has been smooth. Szwaja worked for the Blue Crab's previous owners last summer, and Skinner started at the Bagery a year and a half ago.\n\"We all get along really well,\" Szwaja said. Skinner agreed, saying she really enjoys her co-workers.\n\"I like getting to know customers and people that come in regularly,\" Szwaja said as she gestured to the knitting club in the back of the restaurant. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Guidebook aims to 'get people out there'\n\n June 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BROOKE ENSMINGER | Section: Business \n \n 560\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A second edition of an Eastern Shore guidebook connects locals and visitors to places and activities they might not have known were just a short drive away.Writer Susan Moynihan, who grew up in Annapolis, decided to create an updated version of her guidebook titled \"100 Things to Do in Annapolis and the Eastern Shore Before You Die\" to accommodate changes after COVID-19. The book highlights beloved Eastern Shore destinations.\n\"The fact that we have this beautifully preserved and cared for expanse of land and culture that still stays so close to its roots, I find fascinating,\" Moynihan said. \"I find it to be a really unique part of the world.\"\nIn compiling her list, Moynihan began with the things she loved to do in Annapolis and the surrounding areas. She then asked friends and other locals for recommendations, considering whether each item was worth recommending in the book. She said she wanted to put a focus on activities and locations that \"wouldn't exist anywhere else.\"\n\"Going out on the Skipjack or going to a seafood festival and trying all the food. There's so much,\" Moynihan said.\nAmy Kreiner, the president of the Talbot County Chamber of Commerce, said guidebooks can help visitors find more affordable activities when they have to be financially careful in what they're choosing to do.\n\"They give an idea of what can be experienced in the different areas,\" Kreiner said. \"There's just so many more things to do that can be explained in a guidebook than a lot of other places.\"\nThe list kicks off with food and drink, and includes Rise Up Coffee Roasters and Bas Rouge in Easton and Booze in St. Michaels. Moynihan describes Rise Up as having a distinctive style with its black-and-white graphics and an \"indie-inclusive sensibility.\"\n\"We have really amazing restaurants and places to stay with really, really outstanding chefs and dining experiences,\" Kreiner said.\nOysterfest is an annual seafood festival in St. Michaels hosted by the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum. The festival kicks off oyster season in October with a day full of oyster-themed events.\nWhile the diverse dining options can be an attraction of their own, Kreiner said the biggest draws to the area are the history and the waterfront.\nMoynihan's book highlights waterfront gems like the Skipjack Nathan in Cambridge, where guests can take private sails, and the Oxford-Bellevue Ferry in Oxford, the oldest private ferry in the United States.\nBuilding on the history of the Eastern Shore, the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St. Michaels showcases the largest collection of Chesapeake boats. Other featured museums include the Water's Edge Museum in Oxford, the Museum of Rural Life in Denton and the Tilghman Watermen's Museum on Tilghman Island.\nEntertainment is another unique experience on the Eastern Shore. Many locals have attended a show at the Avalon Theatre, a must-visit entertainment venue on Moynihan's list. Lesser-known, however, is Chesapeake Ghost Tours, where guests can take a haunted walking tour in towns around the Eastern Shore and beyond. Each location offers its own unique tale, but Moynihan recommends the Cambridge tour.\nWhile guidebooks are often seen as tools for tourists to effectively navigate an unfamiliar area, Moynihan wants her book to be a guide for Eastern Shore residents and visitors alike.\nShe said her goal is \"just to get people out there.\" Locals don't have to travel far to find unique places and activities that are rich in history, culture and entertainment. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Sharp contrasts': Tourism sees international 'headwinds', domestic travel resilience\n\n July 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Adams MultiMedia | Section: National \n \n 1452\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Is the glass half-full or half-empty for travel and tourism this year?International travel to the U.S. faces some \"sentimental headwinds\" with Canadians, Europeans and other travelers having negative views of President Donald Trump and his \"America First\" rhetoric and agenda.\nThe World Travel & Tourism Council said in May the U.S. could lose as much as $12.5 billion in international tourist spending this year (a 7% decline from $181 billion in 2024 to below $169 billion projected this year).\nOxford Economics also has a \"negative outlook for inbound travel to the U.S.\" citing \"sentiment headwinds\" with international views toward Trump including his tariffs, geopolitical posturing, hardline immigration moves and cuts to U.S. foreign aid .\nTrump has also talked about the U.S. making Canada the 51st U.S. state, taking over Greenland and stepping back from European alliances. His hardline immigration efforts include the arrests, detentions and deportation of undocumented migrants, including many from Latin America.\nTrump issued an executive order July 3 raising entrance fees for foreign tourists and groups visiting national parks.\nThe economics group expects an 8.7% drop in international trips to the U.S. with significant pullbacks on visits to the states by Canadians and Europeans.\n\"We forecast international visitor spending to fall by $8.5 billion (-4.7%), relative to last year,\" the Oxford group said in its negative outlook report.\n'WE'VE SEEN A SHIFT'But Americans continue to travel in force domestically and internationally this year, according to tourism executives and business owners on the frontlines of travel trends.\nThe industry paints a less dire, more watchful picture of the economy and travel trends.\n\"We've seen a shift,\" said Stacy Ritter, president and CEO of Visit Lauderdale (which promotes tourism to the Fort Lauderdale area of South Florida).\n\"International travel is relatively stable overall, but we have seen a noticeable dip in visitation from Canada. That said, the increase in domestic travel has more than made up for it,\" Ritter said.\nThat has made for \"strong and steady\" tourism flows so far this year, she said.\n\"What's especially notable is that off-peak travel is out-performing expectations. That's a strong indicator that people are prioritizing travel, even in uncertain economic times,\" Ritter said.\nBut she is also seeing \"shorter booking windows\" for travel plans.\nRitter said shorter stays can translate into less spending and succeeding tax revenue.]\nShe said local tourism tax revenue is trending slightly down. That suggests visitors are coming, but they may be choosing shorter stays or being more mindful with their spending.\nJorge Salas-Guevara Succar, founder and president of New Paths Expeditions (which leads tours and operates small cruises across the globe), is also seeing a shift among international bookings. 'Over-tourism' has become a soar point in Europe wit large.crowds stressing popular destinations such as Paris and Barcelona.\nSome of our most seasoned travelers are now actively pivoting toward destinations that offer smoother logistics and fewer crowds, especially Latin America,\" Succar said. \"We've had a noticeable number of travelers switch their European reservations to Latin America trips mid-year, citing overcrowding, uncertainty, and a desire for deeper, more authentic experiences.\"\nWars in the Middle East since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks inside Israel have also discouraged travel to that region.\n'A RAPID RISE'Domestic travel has been carrying the tourism load with AAA reporting a record 72.2 million Americans traveling for the July 4th holiday and more than 45 million for Memorial Day weekend.\nLower gas prices are encouraging for inflation-weary households. The average price of gasoline stood at $3.14 per gallon as of Monday, July 7. That is down from more than $3.50 per gallon a year ago and down from the record $5-plus gas prices during the summer of 2022 and 40-year highs with inflation.\nMountain West states such as Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Idaho are seeing increased interest from tourists.\n\"We have seen a rapid rise in clients traveling to the Western U.S. especially near or abutting National Parks. Yellowstone, in particular. Incredible vistas, cultural experiences, and easy access especially for those from the Northeast. Alaska has also seen a huge uptick,\" said Carolyn Addison, head of product of Black Tomato, a New York-based luxury tour operator.\nYellowstone National Park had its busiest May on record — 566,363 visitors this year. That is up 8% from a year ago and 20% from 2021, according to the National Park Service.\nIn May, passenger counts at Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport in Belgrade, Montana, were up 12% in May compared to two years ago.\nRichie Khandelwal, president and co-founder of PriceLabs, a Chicago-based firm specializing in software for vacation rentals, sees \"sharp contrasts in short-term rental booking favoring smaller and rural areas with cheaper rates than pricey bigger cities.\nHe points to markets such as Ocean City, Maryland, Bend, Oregon and Saratoga Springs, New York, as performing well.\n\"One key trend we're seeing is guests booking later, perhaps waiting to see how things play out before deciding where to travel — or if they can afford to travel at all,\" he said.\nAddison said more travelers are seeking peace and tranquility on their vacations for personal resets \"away from urban rhythms.\"\n\"This isn't about isolation, but intentional connection. Month-long stays are becoming increasingly common, as travelers trade rushed itineraries for unhurried exploration,\" Addison said.\nSuccar agrees seeing more travel motivations stemming from \"a desire for less screen time.\"\nRitter said her Fort Lauderdale tourism group has stepped up its promotions of the local food scene.\nCulinary tourism is a top travel trend this year, according to Eleanor Moody, a travel expert at HomeToGo, which operates an online vacation rentals marketplace and platform.\nShe said experiences such as sporting events, concerts and natural events (such as eclipses and animal migrations) are also on tourists' contemporary vacation wish lists.\nThere are also travelers eyeing off-the-beaten path experiences. That could help draw visitors to Mississippi's Gulf coast as well as the Pacific Northwest, according to HomeToGo.com,\nMany travelers are still cost conscious — still feeling the financial impacts of post-pandemic inflation and higher prices.\nMoody said there are instances where travel to Europe can be cheaper than some popular U.S. destinations.\n\"With extended, cost-conscious vacations on the rise, more U.S. travelers may consider international vacations to stretch their dollars,\" she said.\nMESSAGES TO MOMOther tourism groups are promoting trips closer to home.\n\"We're seeing a lot more staycations and shorter vacations this year. Less people are flying internationally and are choosing to vacation here in the U.S. instead,\" said Steve Schwab, CEO of Casago.com, a Scottsdale, Arizona-based vacation rentals and property management company.\nSchwab said he is seeing more road trips and vacations closer to home.\n\"All of these things seem to be pretty consistent among age groups but perhaps more dominant for Gen-Zers and Millennials, and that's likely just due to less funds at their disposal for traveling.\nThe Wisconsin Dells Visitor & Convention Bureau has its tourism marketing efforts focused on Midwestern drive markets such as Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Louis and Des Moines.\nThe area is known for its water parks, amusement parks. and summer fun.\n\"We are typically trying to reach the family household vacation planning decision-maker (usually 'mom'),\" said Andy Larsen, spokesperson for the Wisconsin group.\nDodie Stephens, vice of marketing for Explore Asheville, said the North Carolina tourism group also focused its marketing to regional drive markets with an emphasis that the area is open for visitors after all the damage caused by Hurricane Helene last year.\n\"We're shouting it from our beautiful Blue Ridge mountaintops—the Asheville area is open for business and eagerly welcoming visitors after Hurricane Helene impacted our region in fall of 2024,\" Stephens said.\nShe said the western Carolina region is still getting that word out to the travel marketplace.\n\"We're seeing a mixed picture of business as we continue to invite leisure travelers back. In May, hotel occupancy averaged 67%, down five points from 2024 and ten points from 2019,\" she said.\nCarl Cronje, co-founder and CEO of TourAxis, an international tourism firm specializing in coach tours, said he's not seeing Americans \"step back from international travel.\"\n\"Our South African tours are performing exceptionally well, and European tours continue to be favorites,\" he said.\n\"Our primary focus continues to be the U.S. market, and we particularly target female travelers in their mid-50s who represent our core demographic for coach travel,\" Cronje said.\nThose can include group and solo vacations (a growing trend among women), he said.\nHe also sees travelers focus on experiences and the \"memory economy.\"\nJakob Wahl, CEO of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA), said domestic tourism is performing well in the U.S., China and Brazil and that vacationers are cost conscious.\n\"Affordability continues to be a key consideration, particularly for families and multi-generational travel,\" he said.\nWahl said if tourists are uncertain about the economy or world affairs, they may be more prone for shorter trips.\n\"We've also seen an increase in spontaneous, last-minute visits\" he said, pointing to attractions offering localized and specialized promotions and digital services focused on those visitors. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Washington St., the restaurant has undergone significant renovations from what was a building in rough shape with structural issues, says Holly DeKarske, executive director of the Easton Economic Development Corporation.\n\"It is really, really satisfying to now see the Pub back open and to be here and bring some vibrancy back to Washington Street,\" DeKarske said.\nPrager and Washington Street Pub Executive Chef Daniel Pochron emphasize that the Pub will be affordable, something many residents have been asking for since plans to reopen it were announced. Almost the entire menu will be under $30, Pochron said.\nThe two-level dining area seats around 160 people, complete with a sizable bar on the first floor and large TVs visible from both levels.\nEmployees worked on finishing touches Tuesday. Sitting on the second level, Pochron, a 26-year resident of the Eastern Shore, beamed with excitement when thinking back to how he and his wife often dined at the former Pub.\n\"We'd come here on a Friday and a Saturday night, and this place was packed,\" he said. \"That's the excitement that I want to bring back. I love it more than anything.\"\nThere'll be a raw bar with five types of oysters, Pochron said. Other seafood options include lobster, shrimp (peel-and-eat, cocktail and tacos), fish and chips, crab cakes and cream of crab soup.\nPochron noted additional entrees such as the meatloaf, chicken pot pie and burger are reasonably priced. There are salads under $20 and sandwiches around $15.\nDesserts include apple pie, carrot cake, a root beer float, bread pudding and a chocolate chip cookie skillet.\n\"To make the food comfort food that's good and fair priced. That's what brought me back to the pub,\" said Pochron, a longtime chef in the area with stops at the Tidewater Inn and the Inn at Perry Cabin in St. Michaels.\nPrager said in an interview last month that it was important for the establishment to remain as the Washington Street Pub, a place where he hopes \"everybody would feel comfortable in.\"\nAnd yes, the highly requested pub chips are back. In fact, Pochron said it was a lengthy process to try to source former Pub employees to find where to get the chips.\n\"Anywhere I go, the first question I have to answer is, 'I got the pub chips back,'\" the chef said.\n\"You wouldn't believe how many people asked about pub chips,\" Prager said. \"So it was like, 'OK, we got to figure that out.'\"\nThe Washington Street Pub will be open Wednesday to Monday from 11 a.m. to midnight and closed on Tuesdays.\nDeKarske shared excitement for the boost she believes the restaurant will bring to Easton's downtown, especially during the summer months and the Waterfowl Festival in November.\n\"To have another dining establishment is huge,\" DeKarske said. \"That's what brings people downtown. That's what gets locals and visitors out and about, and then also helps boost all of our retail.\n\"It was definitely felt when it closed,\" she said. \"But I think that we are going to feel it when it reopens as well.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He talked to county officials at a roundtable discussion at the Dorchester Innovation Center before touring the facility.\n\"It's important to be here because we want to focus on all of Maryland and all Marylanders,\" Coker said. \"There's always a lot of focus on the major metropolitan parts of Maryland, and we need every Marylander to know that we care about all of them, where they live and what economic development opportunities are there to include rural areas like Dorchester County.\"\nCoker's walk through Cambridge served as a time to learn about historic sights and scenery. Coker said he enjoyed the Harriet Tubman monument.\n\"Just seeing that monument, that's the first time I've seen that particular one,\" Coker said. \"It's a lot of history there, a lot of symbolism, and that symbolism actually serves to tie history to the present and the future. That's what I really appreciate.\"\nCoker said his focus is providing growth opportunities throughout the state, including counties that don't get much attention. According to Coker, making sure attention is shown to those counties will require continued visits and help with economic diversity.\n\"This is the second time I've been in Cambridge in my almost six months in the job,\" Coker said, \"so I've been here twice already. I'll be back because I want to come back in a non-work capacity to see the communities and frankly to contribute to the economic growth of the communities.\"\nThe commerce secretary said he wants his department to be \"an advocate for the tourism industry that's here.\"\nCoker talked about diversity in the state, saying he wants to consider diversity when his department allocates funding.\n\"We have to continue again to advocate for all of Maryland, and we'll do that,\" Coker said.\n\"That diversity certainly includes racial, and ethnic and gender, but it also includes social and economic diversity, and it includes geographic diversity and industry sector diversity as well,\" Coker added.\nWhile the Star Democrat talked to Coker before his conversation with Dorchester County officials, Coker hoped the conversation would bring light to what the state can do better.\n\"I'm not out here to have anybody pat us on the back and tell us how wonderful a job we're doing. We want to know what we need to do better,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Caroline’s in Denton making strides in new owners tenure\n\n July 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: Caroline \n \n 512\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DENTON — Caroline's in Denton has been open for just about nine months under new owners and in that time has seen increased following on social media and increase revenues.Owner and Executive Chef Ken Zellers and his wife, Robin Zellers, have ideas to take Caroline's in Denton to the next level. They will be putting a permanent food truck at a new brewery in Denton called Eden Town Brewing Company.\n\"We purchased the food trailer out back, so we're going to be doing the food at the brewery, putting the trailer over there, next step of expansion,\" Zellers said.\nThis next step in expansion brings hopes for Caroline's in Denton to keep growing.\n\"That's a scary part of getting in the restaurant industry,\" Zellers said. \"You never know how the community is going to take to you, how they're going to like your food, your drinks and what you're doing, but it seems to be working out pretty well.\"\nZeller took over ownership from previous owner Nancy Minahan, Zeller interviewed multiple times for the chef position at Caroline's in Denton but was never granted the opportunity, until Minahan called him about buying the restaurant.\nZeller started working at a restaurant at just 14 years old and began cooking at 16 years old and running a kitchen at 18 years old. He is an award-winning chef in Anna Arundel County including best chef of the year just last year.\nOne thing Zellers has done since taking ownership of Caroline's in Denton is tweaking the menu away from fine dinning to more affordable menu with high quality ingredients.\nZellers keeps the high quality ingredients by serving fresh farm to table items on the menu, fresh farm items that come from Caroline County and other counties across the Mid-Shore.\n\"Ingredients is always the No. 1 thing,\" Zellers said.\nStarting with a good ingredient is important, he said, plus it supports the local economy and the community, not to mention local farms.\n\"I think that's the biggest thing like just the quality of the ingredient. You just put that on the plate and let it shine, and you don't have to do much to it,\" Zellers said. \"I think it's a big part of why people have taken to our food so so much because we really can't mess it up because the flavor's there.\"\nThe Zellers have added an enclosure onto the porch for extra seating for the winter and summer days. Next to the restaurant is Caroline's side bar which features outside and inside seating with a different menu than Caroline's in Denton. Zellers called the outdoor seating \"beautiful.\"\nWith plans of more expansion, Zellers says the love and growth Caroline's in Denton has seen still hasn't hit home for him yet.\n\"This is always going to be the baby, we're always going to make sure this is taken care of, but it's just like I said, I don't think it's hit me,\" Zellers said. \"I could have never imagined especially a restaurant that's this beautiful that I would be the owner of it, but I fell in love with when I first interviewed with Nancy.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Denton dress boutique expands operations with small business assistance\n\n July 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT | Section: News \n \n 515\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Over two decades, Lizzie Hernandez and her mother, Elizabeth Escobar, have transformed a dream that began in their home into a flourishing cornerstone of their local community.Escobar created Betty's Boutique in 2012 and began sewing and tailoring wedding gowns, prom dresses, quinceañera dresses, suits and tuxedos — all out of her living room. By 2019, she was able to open the first brick and mortar iteration of Betty's Boutique, a small shop in Denton.\nBut, as was the case for many small businesses, the pandemic came as a big challenge.\n\"We were shut down, and a little bit lost as to where we were going to go from here, y'know, to not have to close down,\" Hernandez said. \"And then my mom had an idea from my aunt, to start making masks for the family. Sooner or later, we made an entire operation out of it. We sold over 30,000 masks.\"\nAs word spread, the Denton community rallied behind Betty's Boutique, purchasing so many masks that by the time lockdowns were lifted, demand for the boutique had soared. Escobar and Hernandez were thrilled, but as a team of two, they struggled to keep up with community interest.\n\"This business is run by just me and my mom, which puts a lot of pressure on both of us — I'm at the front of the house and she is basically at the back of the house, so it's her brand, but I'm the one who is taking the appointments, organizing everything, doing the social media,\" Hernandez said.\nThe Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development's Neighborhood BusinessWorks Program was able to alleviate some of this pressure. With $26,355 in funding from the Business Boost Microgrant program, Betty's Boutique has been able to hire additional staff, delegate tasks and take in more clientele.\nBusiness Boost awards are offered through the department's Neighborhood BusinessWorks program and provide applicants with microgrants ranging from $20,000 to $50,000 to support growth or expansion opportunities. In fiscal year 2025, Neighborhood BusinessWorks provided $21.2 million in investments to 108 small businesses across Maryland — including Betty's Boutique.\nThis extra support has given Betty's Boutique the ability to give back to the community of Denton.\n\"We may be a very small, quiet, out-of-the-way town, but I will say the town has been nothing short of incredible. With all sorts of diversity, we have been able to connect with many communities,\" Hernandez said. \"And we have now actually been able to offer free sewing classes with our local church every Saturday.\"\nHernandez and Escobar look toward the future, with plans to one day expand into casual wear and create their own designs.\n\"My mom has been building this business since 2012, and although we've had many, many hiccups, as many times as she wanted to throw in the towel after having to start over again, she never did,\" Hernandez said. \"She kept going, she kept showing up, to not only prove to herself but to be an example to others, that no matter what, as long as you put the work in, the results will come — with time, patience and discipline, for sure.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Now, construction has started on Legion Road to expand the road connected to the Taco Bell and Dunkin Donuts, creating a lane for the new Wendy's.\n\"At this point in time, what they're doing is they're actually taking and extending the road that goes behind Taco Bell. It actually comes in and goes into the property where Dunkin Donuts is,\" Bill Clemens, building code official and property maintenance inspector for Denton Planning and Codes, said to the Star Democrat on Wednesday.\n\"So that road will go back and wrap around Dunkin Donuts, and then they'll develop the site for Wendy's. So that's the starting point.\"\nAccording to Denton Planning and Codes department, without any delays, the Wendy's should be up and running no later than the end of the year. Clemens expects the Wendy's to be a good economic addition to Caroline County.\n\"It's going to do the same thing all the others have done. They offers options, brings jobs/ It'll bring revenues to both the town and the county,\" Clemens said. \"It's a good name brand.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I really want Italian. We're not battling to see where we're going to go today,\" explained Kris Gobeil, regional director for Wonder food hall. \"We can all go to one place, we can get our food together and we can truly enjoy the food together, which is the whole point of hospitality.\"\nWonder brings together 21 brands with separate menus all under one roof and prepared in one kitchen. Options include pizza, pasta, Mexican, Chinese, Middle Eastern, Thai, Mediterranean, poke, burgers, wings, cheesesteaks, salads, barbecue and more.\nThere is also a variety of price points, from a $6.70 burger and $10.45 burrito to a $26 sea bass entree and a $37 steak.\n\"We really want to get rid of the concern of choices,\" Gobeil said. \"We want people to have one area that they can go to, so that way everybody can get what they're looking for out of one location.\"\nWhile there are a handful of tables for dine-in customers, the business focuses mostly on delivery and pick-up orders.\nThe 3,500-square-foot building along the center road through The Grove is almost entirely dedicated to the large kitchen necessary to cook the wide variety of menu items. The small front-of-house area consists of four tables, two kiosks for ordering, a small counter and racks where pickup orders will be placed.\nWhile Wonder has developed many of its own brand concepts, it also licenses brands and menus from established chefs and restaurants, including celebrity chef Bobby Flay and Texas barbecue restaurant Tejas.\nWonder started in New York City and has rapidly expanded. The Newark location is the company's 53rd location and its first in Delaware.\nThe Newark location is open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily, though Gobeil noted the company could consider late-night or breakfast hours later.\nGobeil said Wonder is excited to join the growing roster of businesses at The Grove, formerly known as College Square Shopping Center.\n\"What better location? I mean, look around here,\" he said. \"Not only do we have residential, but we also have some great shops around us. It's really just about being a part of a community.\"\nSeveral other businesses are slated to open in The Grove soon, including Nifty Fifty's, a 1950s-themed diner; The Picklr, an indoor pickleball club; Lefty's Alleys and Eats, an entertainment center featuring bowling, axe throwing, Top Golf simulators, Krazy Darts, a 6,000-square-foot arcade and a restaurant; and Med Spa.\nCold Stone Creamery and Turkiye Kebob House opened earlier this year. Other additions in the past few years include Smoothie King, Crunch Fitness, Del Pez Mexican Gastropub, First Watch, Raising Cain's, NovaCare Rehabilitation, Jersey Mike's Subs, Bonchon Korean Fried Chicken, Leslie's Pool Supplies and Compass at The Grove, a 306-unit luxury apartment complex. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Public media defunded, but isn't going anywhere on the Shore\n\n July 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Local News \n \n 447\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On Friday morning, the House of Representatives passed the Rescissions Act, pulling back previously approved funding for the Corporation of Public Broadcasting for fiscal year 2026 and 2027.This marks the first time in American history that public broadcasting has been federally defunded leaving public radio and television stations vulnerable.\nPublic radio stations on the Eastern Shore were prepared for this scenario.\n\"Oh, we're disappointed, but not surprised,\" General Manager of Delmarva Public Radio Judy Diaz said. \"We've been planning for this scenario for a while in anticipation that this could happen.\"\nDiaz said federal funding accounts for 15% of the annual budget and has been a reliable source of funding since the station launched in 1987.\nOther stations on the Shore were not as reliant on federal funding to begin with.\nWHCP Cambridge Community Radio has been in operation for 10 years. Because of its youth, the station never qualified for or received federal CPB funding, relying solely on community donations, foundation support, state agency grants and a strong volunteer base, according to founder Mike Starling.\n\"Those funds we've never had to depend on and rely on to beef up our services, which would have been great,\" Starling said.\nOver those 10 years, the station has evolved from a low power FM station to a full-service community radio station with a broader transmitter and increased coverage.\nWith the support of the community, WHCP is expanding and will launch a new music station on Sept. 18, marking the 176th anniversary of Harriet Tubman reaching freedom in Pennsylvania.\nHowever, stations like Delmarva Public Radio are feeling a bit more pressure. Diaz said management has taken preemptive measures such as restructuring and combining staff roles, and freezing positions through retirement.\nDelmarva Public Radio has three unique stations that range from in-depth news reporting with jazz, blues and funk sprinkled in, alternative music and news, and \"all classical all the time.\"\n\"One of the arguments for the rescissions is that we are redundant, that it's the kind of programming that you can already get in your market,\" Diaz said. \"But we're among the only local, non-commercial stations in this area, especially in rural markets.\"\nStarling emphasized Diaz's point, saying local, community-based journalism is vital despite being incredibly labor-intensive. \"That's why you don't find many commercial entities that will hang in there and do it because they can make money different ways,\" he said.\nStarling wants to encourage residents to come to Radio Advisory Board meetings, donate and contribute local stories.\n\"It's not attractive to other broadcasters. We're too small, we're not profitable enough, but we're here covering what's important because this is our home,\" Diaz said. \"These stations were built over decades. And if we lose them, we don't get them back.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Artificial intelligence threatens free internet\n\n July 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MICHAEL DAVIS | Section: News \n \n 431\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Artificial intelligence will eliminate the free internet. Unless something changes, we can kiss all the free, online stuff goodbye. This identifies the problem. Unfortunately, solutions are currently unknown. This poses a threat to the information age as we know it and even to an informed democracy.The free internet is an illusion. It may appear free, but almost everything is funded by advertising. This is true of free podcasts, travel sites, weather sites, music sites, videos, medical information sites and shopping sites. To quote Claude.AI, \"… free websites require … enormous resources for servers, bandwidth and staff. Without advertising revenue … it's nearly impossible to sustain these services.\"\nAI will reduce the number of views generated on advertising-funded websites. Let's say you are taking a trip to Atlanta. An easy AI program can go into all the airline flight data and find you the cheapest one-way flight with added leg room leaving from BWI after 10 a.m. It can also book you a car. It will tell you about the weather in Atlanta.\nFinding a hotel and calling the hotel to make a reservation? Done. It will download to your phone your favorite podcasts, videos and music playlists for inflight entertainment. It will send you a summary of that day's national and local news. In a few minutes after you ask AI to do this, you'll get all the information in One Big Beautiful Email. You need not look at a single website nor their ads.\nHowever, advertisers need actual people, not computers, bots nor web browsers, to \"see\" the ads. Unpopular websites cannot attract advertisers or get paid subscribers. Popular websites rely on ads to pay for podcasts, travel sites, weather sites, music sites, etc. Many people pay for sites to receive perks, but most of us tolerate ads to gain online information for free.\nUsage data varies from site to site, but some trends are showing up. The Wall Street Journal reported that Google AI is causing a dramatic drop in ad views on news publishers' websites. The New York Times reported a drop in viewers to their websites due people using AI programs. Loss of live viewers means loss of ad revenue. Sites will have to charge for what used to be free access, creating another gap between the rich and the poor.\nMeanwhile, our government is closing more websites, for example those that provided free medical advice. Information we need to live is being commercialized. Whether due to AI, or government cuts, our access to vital online information that sustains an informed democracy suffers when there is no \"free\" online information market. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Made with love': Chris' pizza pop-ups taking off\n\n July 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: News \n \n 399\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — Chris Mckelvy tossed his freshly made dough up in the air and caught it with ease, stretching it with each toss and catch, eventually letting it settle on the flour-covered steel table top in the back of the historic Oxford Market.The Oxford Pizza Company, founded by Mckelvy in 2023, holds pizza pop-ups on Mondays from 5 to 7 p.m. and Fridays from 5 to 8 p.m. out of the market.\nThe Oxford Market has been owned by John and Kate Mckelvy since 1995, the year their son, Chris, was born. For 30 years, the Mckelvys have been providing the town with homemade food that is freshly prepared and \"made with love.\"\nChris Mckelvy is following in his parents footsteps, preparing his pizza's with high quality ingredients and a homemade dough fermented for at least four days.\nHe first got into the pizza business by selling his homemade frozen pizzas at the market. He was inspired to make the frozen pizzas because he wanted to find a use for freezer space that sat empty.\nBut after seeing some success from the frozen pizzas, he began honing his craft, investing in his business and started the pizza pop-ups.\nMckelvy said when he first started, he would sell around 10 pies on a Friday night. Now, the daily sales volume equals what was previously sold over an entire weekend.\n\"Basically every ounce of money I make goes right back into buying better equipment and progressing the pizza business,\" he said.\nThis includes the purchase of a new portable pizza oven, which will enable Mckelvy to hold his pop ups at local events and partner with other restaurants and stores.\nRecently, he partnered with the Tilghman Island Country Store to host pop ups and sell his frozen pizzas. The pizza pop-ups at the Country Store will begin in August, and the frozen pizzas will be available Sunday.\nBut Mckelvy is not abandoning the market he grew up in. He has plans to expand there as well, hoping to create a seating area with bistro lights. He said there's a possibility of serving small plates, beer, wine and, of course, pizza.\nMckelvy wants customers to know they are a one-stop shop and are there to serve the people.\n\"If someone wants something from us either the market or pizza, we are willing to go out of our way to get people what they want,\" Mckelvy said.\n\"We're here for the people,\" Mckelvy said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton Beer Fest canceled after slow ticket sales\n\n July 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 403\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Slow ticket sales and a lack of vendors led the Easton Volunteer Fire Department to cancel next month's 10th annual Easton Beer Fest.The event, slated for Aug. 16, is known for a wide craft beer selection, bringing together hundreds of people each year since 2016. But forging ahead with this year's festival would've put the fire department at an operating loss for the effort, according to treasurer Chris Hash.\nBeer Fest is usually an October event, but a slew of other festivals led organizers to move it up to August in an attempt to attract vendors and festivalgoers. Ticket sales this year, as of Tuesday's cancelation announcement, were 45% of what they normally would be around a month before the event, Hash said.\n\"Ticket sales were drastically below those benchmarks,\" he said. \"That combined with an overall shift in the craft beer industry with a number of brewers that have closed or other ones that have cut back in their staffing. We were faced with breweries that were not able to attend, which left us below our benchmark to have or produce a successful event.\"\nTypically, around 35 breweries would attend, and sometimes as many as 45, Hash said. Less than 25 were scheduled for this year.\nHash says he's seen a dip in Maryland's craft beer industry recently. Nationwide, the nonprofit Brewers Association tracked nearly 400 closings of breweries in 2024, which outpaced the number of openings.\nOne less fundraiser\nCanceling the fundraiser is a financial strain on the Easton's fire department. Hash said the festival has brought in $250,000 over the last nine years.\nLeaders at the Easton Volunteer Fire Department are encouraging residents to give financial support through other upcoming events. The department is hosting a golf tournament in September. Spots are sold out, but sponsorships are still available, Hash said.\nAnd on Feb. 21, the fire department will host Stews & Brews at the fire hall, a fundraising event that coincides with the annual Chesapeake Fire & Ice Festival.\nFor future events, Hash said he hopes attendees buy tickets early if they're able, as ticket projections play a role in cancelation decisions.\nHe said the fire department hopes to bring back Easton Beer Fest in the future.\n\"It's something that, personally, I enjoy doing,\" Hash said. \"I enjoy bringing people in, bringing good beer to them. You feel like you're letting people down when you're not able to provide an event or what they've become accustomed to.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Apparently Pennsylvania efforts have been successful.\nMeanwhile, without similar media reports it's woefully unclear what Maryland leaders have done or are doing to make our state attractive to private capital. In fact, with Maryland's threatening budget deficit and Wes Moore's focus on presidential ambitions it's difficult to see how we can compete with Pennsylvania or any other state for future capital commitments.\nIt's good the Ravens are competitive with the Steelers, but it's more important that Baltimore does not appear to be holding a candle to Pittsburgh in a competition for private enterprise.\nART CECIL\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some of those stopped by the law offices of Campbell and Furneisen to celebrate the company's one-year anniversary.Partners Bridget Campbell and Ivette Furneisen were both nominated for Eastern Shore's 2024 Women to Watch. And according to their website, Furneisen is \"one of very few Spanish-speaking lawyers on the shore, and possibly the only native Spanish-speaking. It contines, \"Furneisen has quickly gained a reputation as a friend to Hispanics and other immigrants in the area, helping with traffic and family court, visas, and applications for citizenship.\"\nFurneisen said this anniversary is a significant celebration due to that distinction.\nOver sparkling beverages and catering courtesy of Happy Chicken, and while balancing conversation with friends and well-wishers, Furneisen shared why she feels like her work is more vital than ever.\nIt started, she said, 15 years ago. In her home country of Spain, she was working for a nonprofit doing immigration work. She extended that realm of her expertise by studying law at George Mason University. Ultimately, she and her husband, who worked for American Airlines, discovered Kent County.\nNow a year in to running her own practice advocating for Spanish speakers, she expressed concern for her clients, some of whom had been detained by immigration police being caught in offenses such as traffic violations.\nThese incidences, she said, are why she decided to pursue law further.\n\"Everyone deserves representation. It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor,\" Furneisen stated.\nShe takes a lot of cases from the public defender's office for those who normally could not afford a lawyer.\n\"Now, I can be an advocate for them. And not just in the courts. I really care,\" she said.\nThe other half of the firm is Bridget Campbell. She handles family law, real estate, business formation and other practices.\nLike her legal partner, Campbell is grateful to be representing Kent County. With both of them working jointly, they cast a wide net of services.\nSome of the most rewarding work is representing children as a best interest attorney, Campbell said. It is her job to advocate for children, give them a voice, and from those assessments, persuade the judge to act in the children's best interest.\nThis involves talking to the parents, the therapists and the children, being present for them in their time of need, Campbell said. As a mother of three boys, this is very near to her heart., as she reflects on her time studying law at Villanova, before attending Washington College.\nOriginally born in Pennsylvania, she has established roots here after studying law at Villanova and attending Washington College. She is president of the Kent County Humane Society, dedicated to promoting animal welfare, \"preventing unnecessary pain and suffering for domestic companions in the community.\"\nBoth attorneys sees themselves reaching beyond their law profession to help those in need.\n\"Ivette and I find a way to give back to the community every way we can,\" Campbell said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the business website, Matt and Sarah dreamed of building a family business in Denton for many years.\n\"My wife was born and raised here in Denton. We lived in North Carolina for a while, which is where I'm from, and down there, there's lots of breweries,\" Matt Dahl said. \"We saw how much people loved breweries as a place to just come and get a beer or just hang out with friends and family.\n\"So, we moved back up here, we knew that Denton didn't have a brewery. The more research we did, we realized really that there's not that many breweries in the entire region. We saw what breweries did for the towns that did have them. It's becomes an attraction. So that's really what we're hoping this brewery is going to bring people into Denton.\"\nThe brewery plans to serve multiple different types of beer, including India pale ales, pale ales, pilsners, lagers and much more. They will also provide cocktails and wine.\n\"We want to have something for for everyone,\" Dahl said. \"Not everyone likes every type of beer, so you got to have a variety.\"\nEden Town will also partner with Caroline's in Denton to provide a full service food truck. Dahl loved the idea of partnering with a local business to provide food.\n\"We love it because that's why we're doing it,\" Dahl said. \"We' haven't even opened yet, and we have all already created a partnership with another business here in town that I think is going to help both of us.\"\nIn addition to an in-house brewery that guests will be able to see from the tap room, Eden Town Brewing will also have an event room.\n\"This is an area that people will be able to rent. If they have a private party, we have to close it off,\" Dahl said. \"If they've got a kind of larger party, we can open this door up, and they can have part of the yard.\"\nEden Town Brewing Company has land that can be utilized for bigger events and for making the brewery a family friendly place were people can bring their kids to play. Owners also plan to sell Eden Town Brewing Company merch. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

I think Newark really needed a place like that.\"\nThe business also caters to people with a variety of dietary restrictions, including gluten-free, dairy-free and vegan.\n\"This is very much an extension of our home, and how it would feel to literally come over to our house for breakfast one day,\" Maureen said. \"That's what we really wanted in the space, was for it to be warm, welcoming and genuine.\"\nThe name, The Cut Bakes, comes from two different phrases, she said. The culinary term \"cut in\" means to add cold butter into dry ingredients, and \"in the cut\" means off the beaten path.\nBoth Matthew and Maureen have been cooking for most of their lives. He studied culinary arts at Howard Vo-Tech and Walnut Hill College in Philadelphia, and then worked as a chef in several restaurants. After inheriting her grandmother's love of baking, she went to school to be an art teacher but instead starting working in cafes and bakeries.\nThey met in 2011 while working at Cantwell's Tavern in Odessa. Later, they worked together at Drip Cafe, Matthew serving as executive chef and Maureen serving as pastry chef.\nSeveral years ago, they decided to branch off on their own. They organized supper club events in Wilmington, took catering orders, made custom cakes and sold baked goods at craft fairs and farmers markets, including Newark Natural Foods' weekly farmers market at Newark Shopping Center.\n\"Once we had the kids, we were like, if we're going to be grinding and working all these hours, then we need to be doing it for ourselves,\" Maureen said.\nIn the beginning, they worked out of rented space in a commercial kitchen. Late last year, they took over the storefront at 60 N. College Ave. The previous tenant was Roja & Verde Taqueria, run by Drip Cafe owner Greg Vogeley. When that restaurant closed, Vogeley offered to sublet the space to the Andersons.\n\"Having this actual physical location has been the biggest weight lifted off our shoulders,\" Matthew said. \"Now it's all about growing the brand and making sure we're doing what we need to do to stay in the game.\"\nDuring the week, they use the kitchen for catering and bakery orders. They also host occasional pop-up dinners featuring other local chefs.\n\"We're making a little creative space for people who are in the same boat that we were three or four years ago that are just looking for a space to try out a concept before they take that leap into leasing a space,\" Maureen said.\nThe couple is still deciding whether to keep growing the business at the current location or aim to eventually move to a different location and pivot toward a more breakfast-focused menu at some point in the future.\n\"We love Newark,\" Maureen said. \"This is where our kids go to school, this is where we work, this is where we live. We're very much invested in the community.\"\nFor now, they enjoy the flexibility of being able to set their own hours in order to balance raising their young kids with growing the business.\n\"In a society that tells us that we need to just grind, grind, grind, and make money and make money, and that's all that is of value, I feel like it's important not only for people in the community to see us thriving in this way, but our kids to see us really going out on a limb and going 10 toes down into something that's been a dream of ours for a long time,\" Maureen said.\nCurrently, The Cut Bakes is open Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Starting in mid September, the hours will change to Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. The business is also at the Newark Natural Foods farmers market from 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. every Sunday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Come to Tilghman\n\n August 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Business \n \n 506\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TILGHMAN ISLAND — When walking into Gina's at the Bridge, it is immediately clear who Gina Lee Werner is.Simply looking at the decor and tasting the unique blend of flavors on the menu tells the tale of the fun and eclectic restaurant owner who makes her staff feel like family, signing each check with a heart or \"love, Gina.\"\nHer husband, Michael Joseph Werner, calls it \"Ginafying.\"\nGina Lee Werner been a restaurant owner for over two decades, and the Werners opened Gina's at the Bridge in November. Now eight months in, the Werners have learned that getting out to Tilghman Island — miles past St. Michaels, where tourists usually stop — is worth the drive.\n\"I hear people all the time. They're like, 'oh, my God, it's so far. I just can't do that drive.' It's the extra 10 minutes passing St. Michaels, and it's just something about that drive,\" Michael said.\nIn an effort to encourage people to come to Tilghman and connect more local businesses, the Werners are purchasing a shuttle van, which can hold around 14 people. They plan to provide shuttle services from St. Michaels and beyond.\nThe current proposed name of the shuttle is \"The Tizzy.\" It will begin operation in next week.\nIn addition, the Werners are planning to purchase a center console boat to provide shuttle service on the water.\nGinafying Tilghman\nGina opened Gina's in St. Michaels in 2011, which she still runs. But she always wanted to buy the property she could operate out of.\nThe new restaurant is situated on Knapps Narrows right next to the historic Tilghman Island Drawbridge.\nIt is the busiest drawbridge in the nation, and on a nice summer day, the bridge could be raised up to 50 times, according to PropTalk Chesapeake Bay Boating.\nThe restaurant sources crabs, oysters and fish directly from local watermen, emphasizing extreme freshness while fostering strong community relationships on the island. Along with local seafood, the Werners make a point of collaborating with local artists and businesses like the Tilghman Island County Store and the Little Big Market.\nGina firmly believes in a \"rising tide raises all ships\" mentality.\nShe was inspired to open her first restaurant, Gina's Cantina, after a bad experience at a restaurant she formerly worked in where she didn't feel supported after returning from maternity leave.\n\"I was working all the way up until eight months pregnant, but I went back and everything changed,\" Gina said. \"It just fueled me.\"\n20 years later, that fuel remains ignited, but not out of spite. Her motivation is fostered through an environment where staff are happy yet hardworking and the customers love the food but also feel at home.\nTo Gina, it is more important to prioritize a relaxed customer experience, where guests can enjoy the view.\n\"I definitely believe that the restaurants have been such a way for me to put my heart out there so I can still do my art and I can also make a living because I'm not selling my art,\" Gina said. \"The art is when people come in and they're like, ah, yeah.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

At 58 years old, Waugh's one-man operation has taken him to cemeteries in White Plains, Brandywine, La Plata and beyond.\n\"It was difficult getting access to them [cemeteries] or finding out who to properly talk to [for permission],\" he said, but that hasn't stopped him from doing the work.\nMost of Waugh's projects are deeply personal for the families he helps.\nDonna Briscoe, 63, of Waldorf turned to him when two of her relatives' stones became very worn down.\n\"The stone had gotten so weathered that you can't even read the information on it,\" Waugh said.\nWaugh cleaned and repaired Briscoe's great-great-grandfather's headstone, along with the headstones of his children, all dating back to the 19th century — no charge, at the time.\n\"That's the type of work he does,\" Briscoe said, adding that Waugh provides great service.\nFor Waugh, this was about more than just restoration. It's about honor and connection.\n\"I never met my grandmother, my great-grandmother or my great-grandfather, but I was able to clean and reset both of their stones,\" he said. \"For me, it helps me stay in contact with the people.\"\nOften, he said, people don't know where their ancestors are buried until they reach out to him for help — to locate and restore long-forgotten headstones.\n\"It's like bringing a piece of their family's story back to them,\" Waugh said.\nHe added that memorial headstones shouldn't be somber, but personalized, bringing back happy memories of a loved one's personality.\nWith that, Waugh has engraved small details — such as bingo cards, custom cars, travel imagery and even sewing thimbles — for several headstones.\nSometimes, his role goes beyond restoration and engraving.\nGrief can be heavy, Waugh said, and when clients come to him, they may just need someone to talk to, so he listens.\n\"This is something that God planned ahead for me,\" Waugh said. \"This was never something that I saw myself doing,\" but he did anyway.\nThings like brass spinning, stones discoloration from various elements and moss is what lures Waugh into cleaning and restoring these headstones, with the bonus of honoring the dead and God.\n\"My dream for this business is to be able to help as many people and restore as many stones as I can,\" he said. \"To show my grandchildren that nothing in this world is impossible.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A subcommittee was assigned to develop the plan, which serves as a roadmap for the next three years.\nThe plan is designed to guide the EDC in setting priorities and staying focused on key objectives.\n\"I do want to say that the plan is really a roadmap for us. It's not locked in stone, but it's going to get us from where we are now, to where we want to be over the next three years,\" Klein said.\nThe strategic plan is linked to the town's comprehensive plan, ensuring that the objectives, priorities and goals of both documents are in sync, particularly in the chapter on economics.\nThe process in putting together the plan included collecting input from stakeholders and customers through various means, including surveys.\nKlein said they are looking for further funding opportunities.\n\"So we are working with our fundraising committee, continuing to do sponsorship recruitment as we have done. We do a lot of annual sponsorships and event sponsorships, but also looking at other ways to develop other funding options,\" Klein said.\nThe new strategic plan can be found on the town's website. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The prize was a free customized fire pit from Blue Line Metal Works.\nZellers said his restaurant gave out more than 50 cards during the course of the week.\n\"We started with only 18 cards, and after the first night, we had to get some more,\" he said.\nNo restaurants The Star Democrat was able to contact had any cards left when the week was over.\nThe restaurants in downtown Denton that participated were Pizza Empire, Caroline's in Denton, El Chupacabra, Craft Bakery & Cafe, Market Street Pub and Shore Gourmet.\nShore Gourmet Manager Jennifer Sipala said that from Monday to Thursday, they received a big boost in customers.\nWhile restaurant week was success, some restaurants in Denton said sales did slow down the week after.

    "content": "Delaware company aims to tap into the ‘aquifer in the air’\n\n August 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 513\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A Delaware company is preparing to start shipping new equipment that, quite literally, creates drinkable water out of thin air.\"We have developed an energy-efficient separation of water from air,\" said Bryan Barton, president of Newark-based AirJoule. \"This platform will not only transform and revolutionize HVAC and dehumidification, but will finally unlock the aquifer in the air – an abundant resource of water.\"\nAirJoule, which was founded in 2018, opened a 42,000 square-foot facility on Shea Way in the Delaware Industrial Park off South Chapel Street last year.\nThe AirJoule system contains an advanced sorbent that pulls water vapor out of the air and then uses a dual-vacuum chamber to collect the water.\nThe system is powered by waste heat from a data center or other industrial facility.\nOne AirJoule unit the size of a shipping container can produce approximately 350 gallons of water a day while using only a quarter of the energy of traditional dehumidification technology.\nBarton said AirJoule is ideal for areas of the Middle East and other places where water is scarce. Data centers and other industrial facilities that need water can use AirJoule units to harvest that water, allowing them to open in places that they wouldn't have been able to before.\n\"I can see this as enabling whole industries in parts of the world that previously could not develop because there was water scarcity,\" Barton said. \"We're a planet of 8 billion people now, and we're just going to continue to grow. And so how do you grow into a desert when there's no water? That's the reality the world faces right now.\"\nAirJoule has a partnership with GE and is working on integrating its technology into HVAC systems. In humid climates, up to 80 percent of the energy used in air conditioning is related to dehumidification, and AirJoule could reduce that, Barton said.\nThe company is also working with the military on using AirJoule products to produce water for troops on deployment.\nThe Newark facility, which employs 35 people, is AirJoule's engineering headquarters and will handle the initial manufacturing. The company hopes to open additional manufacturing facilities around the globe as it grows.\nLast year, the company received more than $1 million in state incentives to locate in Delaware.\n\"This facility brings with it cutting-edge technology, but also brings, most importantly, jobs, investment and longterm potential for growth,\" County Executive Marcus Henry said. \"These are skilled jobs in research, manufacturing and assembly, exactly the kind of opportunities we want to grow in this New Castle County region. But the ripple effect of investment like this, I believe, extends beyond the walls of this building. It supports our local supply chain. It draws in talent and entrenches our position as a destination for forward-looking companies that are shaping our future here in New Castle County.\"\nBarton said Delaware was attractive because of the engineering talent available here.\n\"New Castle County in particular, is one of the largest per capita concentrations of engineers in the country,\" he said. \"And from that, we can have the pleasure of recruiting and retaining the top talent that's needed to be successful as a company.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This cycle has led to an ongoing and worsening insurance crisis for churches and other houses of worship, but also homeowners, businesses, and everyone in between,\" said Van Carlson, CEO of SRA 831(b) Admin, an Idaho-based risk management firm.\n\"The market is being squeezed between a multi-front problem of rising premiums, insurance companies leaving markets and new exclusions being added. At the same time, churches often have fewer financial resources to respond to this changing environment,\" Carlson said.\nHe is seeing instances of some churches going without insurance and others shutting down operations because they cannot afford premiums.\nCLIMATE CHANGEThe challenges facing religious institutions are part of a wider problem of higher insurance premiums.\nHomeowners insurance premiums are up more than 67% nationally since 2019, according to Ohio-based Matic Insurance Service Inc.\nCar insurance rates have jumped more than 45% across the U.S. in that same time, according to Florida-based FinanceBuzz.\nThe increases have been even more in certain parts of the country such as those impacted by hurricanes, tornados and wildfires where more intense and more destructive storms and extreme weather are causing more damage, driving up premiums.\nPost-pandemic inflation (with overall U.S. prices up 26% since 2019) and now President Donald Trump's tariffs on auto parts, raw materials and country-specific imports put upward pressure on repair and replacement costs.\nScott Figgins, senior vice president for Indiana-based Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Co., a leading insurer of Christian churches and ministries nationally, said wind, hail and other storms as well as wildfires \"are continuing to generate above average numbers of claims\", driving up property insurance premiums, including for churches and other nonprofits.\n\"Elevated storm losses and wildfires are still driving rate increases in areas exposed to severe weather,\" he said.\nFiggins said from 2012 to 2021 the annual average for catastrophic losses was $44.1 billion.\n\"Since 2020, the average is $83.5 billion,\" he said.\nCarlson said churches have unique challenges that can be problematic on the property insurance front.\n\"For religious groups in particular, they often have extremely high risks that are hard to insure,\" he said.\n\"Churches can be large and expensive to repair, most religious buildings and organizations are open to the public with little or no due diligence,\" he said. \"All of these factors are risks that insurers often either need to charge more to cover, or may even be unwilling to cover entirely.\"\nNUCLEAR VERDICTSFiggins and Carlson said churches see unique insurance challenges related to other polices.\nFiggins said that is in \"large part to the growing concern in the world reinsurance market for nuclear verdicts coming out of sexual misconduct exposure.\"\nChurches and other faith organizations can carry insurance policies related to misconduct by clergy and others.\n\"Churches are increasingly looking for liability insurance, especially related to misconduct,\" Carlson said, pointing to a group that specializes in covering Roman Catholic parishes and archdioceses.\nHe also said there are alternative tax and financing paths to insurance policies for churches and other groups that can look at to help cover repair costs. Those include self-insurance funds.\nFiggins said umbrella, commercial auto and general liability insurance polices have been \"rapidly rising\" due to large jury verdicts in abuse and misconduct cases.\n\"In 2020 the average jury verdict reached an all-time high of $2.5 million, a 37% increase over 2019 and a 274% increase over 2010,\" he said.\nBetween 2004 and 2023, the Catholic Church paid out more than $5 billion in damages related to sexual abuse cases, according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University.\nThat makes for a tough insurance landscape for churches and other houses of worship.\n\"There is significant reduction in capacity for higher limits of coverage and what is available is seeing large price increases,\" Figgins said.\nA number of churches, denominations and religious groups either declined or did not respond to requests for comment about their insurance landscape.\n'DELAY, DENY, DEFEND'Ted Patestos, founder and CEO of Houston-based Tiger Adjusters (which provides insurance services to policyholders working on claims with providers), said some in the insurance industry have moved toward a business model of denying more claims while inflation and more intense weather from climate changes are driving up costs and premiums.\n\"Delay, deny, defend,\" Patestos said of the mantra of some insurance providers.\nHe said state insurance regulators are in \"a bind\" because if they try to come down too hard on the industry or try to dictate operating and financial terms larger, more stable insurance companies will just pick up stakes and leave states and regions.\nPatestos said more extreme weather events strain the bandwidth of insurance claims processing.\nHe said that churches, nonprofits, small businesses and households who pay higher deductibles run the risk of \"paying a premium without real insurance.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Whether I'm in a rural area in West Virginia or an urban area in Delaware, one thing remains the same – taxes are one of the top issues for small businesses.The One Big Beautiful Bill extends the 199A passthrough deduction, which will generate $750 billion in economic growth and create over one million new Main Street jobs. There are an estimated 86,000 firms in Maryland which could be eligible for the deduction, or about 41 percent of all firms.\nIn addition, the bill boosts take-home pay for the typical hardworking family. It is estimated to increase wages in Maryland from $4,700 to $8,400 and protect 116,000 full-time equivalent jobs over the next four years if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act had been allowed to expire.\nThe bill delivers tax cuts to working families and job creators. The SBA stands ready to empower entrepreneurs to start and grow their small businesses.

Prices in Maryland are 3.6 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stand 26.7 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has decreased 1.9 cents compared to a week ago and stands at $3.671 per gallon.\"The national average is nearly unchanged from a week ago, with gasoline prices continuing to hover in the same territory where they've spent much of 2025 so far — in the low-$3-per-gallon range — as oil prices remain anchored in the $60s,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.\nAccording to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.69 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $4.79 per gallon, a difference of $2.10 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline is unchanged in the last week, averaging $3.09 per gallon today. The national average is down 4.6 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 27.9 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nAugust 18, 2024: $3.35 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.37 per gallon)August 18, 2023: $3.79 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.84 per gallon)August 18, 2022: $3.89 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.90 per gallon)August 18, 2021: $3.05 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.17 per gallon)August 18, 2020: $2.24 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.17 per gallon)August 18, 2019: $2.54 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.60 per gallon)August 18, 2018: $2.80 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.83 per gallon)August 18, 2017: $2.30 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.33 per gallon)August 18, 2016: $2.07 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.14 per gallon)August 18, 2015: $2.53 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.67 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.06 per gallon, down 7.8 cents per gallon from last week's $3.14 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.25 per gallon, down 5.3 cents per gallon from last week's $3.30 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.03 per gallon, down 1.8 cents per gallon from last week's $3.05 per gallon.\n\"Price cycling markets once again led the biggest weekly price changes, with Ohio and Florida seeing a cycle and higher prices last week, while Michigan posted the largest drop and could be due for another jump in the cycle sometime this week,\" Haan said. \"For the majority of motorists in non-cycling states, gas prices will likely remain near current levels as we head toward Labor Day. However, it's worth watching developments around a potential peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. If such an agreement materializes, it could send oil prices lower on expectations that sanctions against Russia might be eased, effectively boosting global oil supply.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Court rules digital ad tax violates First Amendment\n\n August 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BRYAN P. SEARS Maryland Matters | Section: State News \n \n 461\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A provision in Maryland's digital ad tax is an unconstitutional restriction on free speech, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.The 2021 law — the first of its kind in the nation — imposes taxes on large tech companies for the digital ads they sell within the state. But it prohibits those companies from passing the tax on to consumers as a surcharge, fee or line item on their bills — what a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals saw as a ban on telling customers about the new added tax.\nIn a ruling that invoked American protests against the Colonial-era Stamp Act, Circuit Judge Julius Richardson wrote that, as then, \"complaining about taxes remains a grand American political tradition.\" And the court said Maryland lawmakers went too far by adding language to the tax bill that was intended to shield them from public criticism.\n\"Perhaps fearing such complaints, Maryland paired its tax with another rule,\" Richardson wrote for the court. \"Companies that make money advertising on the internet must not only pay the tax, but avoid telling their customers how it affects pricing: No line items, no surcharges, no fees.\n\"If companies pass on the cost of the tax, they must do so in silence — keeping customers in the dark about why prices have gone up and thereby insulating Maryland from political responsibility,\" he wrote.\nThe ruling reverses a 2024 decision by U.S. District Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby, who agreed with the plaintiffs — a group of tech firms and business associations — that the law created some First Amendment issues. But she let the law stand because the offending provision had \"many constitutional applications.\"\nFriday's circuit court ruling sent the case back to Griggsby with instructions to determine an appropriate remedy for the plaintiffs.\nThe ruling is a blow to officials who looked to the unique tax to help pay for expensive K-12 education reforms contained in the Blueprint for Maryland's Future. Expenses associated with that law continue to rise and are potentially budget busting — even if the digital ad tax survives the onslaught of legal challenges.\nThe 2021 law — sponsored by Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) — targets big tech firms including Apple, Meta and Google.\nUnder the law, companies reporting $100 million of gross global annual revenue are subject to a 2.5% levy. The tax increases in increments of 2.5% to a maximum rate of 10% levied against companies reporting more than $15 billion in gross global revenue.\nThe state could collect as much as $250 million annually from the digital ad tax, according to a legislative analysis. The funds are earmarked for the education reform program.\nNeither Ferguson nor Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D), the defendant in the lawsuit, immediately responded to requests for comment on the ruling Friday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Golden light sweeps across farm fields as animals graze peacefully. People unwind, grateful for another day well spent. Perched on a hill above the Choptank River, Denton embodies the best of rural living. Cornfields and chickens are living tributes to the farmers who shaped our community.

In the top righthand side of the building, there are still boarded windows from the fire damage.\nThe Eastpoint Mo's Seafood was one of three others in a local franchise, previously operating alongside other Mo's in Little Italy, White Marsh and Towson.\nAny mention of the Eastpoint location on Mo's Seafood's website was quietly removed after the fire, although it is unclear when the changes were made.\nFollowing the fire, neither the company nor owner made a public statement about the state of the restaurant.\nThe Mo's Seafood Facebook page, which represents all four of its locations, has not been updated since April 2021.

But the 'grill' brings in an idea of dinner.\"\nBenjamin and Barlow have been operating Miss Oxford Diner for 22 years. Benjamin, a Cecil County native who grew up near Cecil County Dragway in Rising Sun, said although the diner is packed with so much nostalgia the 1950s era layout is limiting.\n\"We can't seat parties of 10 to 12,\" she said of the diner at 233 South Third St.\nWord got to the couple that Hatcher's closed in May along with Bog Turtle Brewery. Hatcher's only operated for a little more than a year, while Bog Turtle had celebrated its fifth anniversary in March. Both were under the same ownership.\n\"We should think about moving,\" Benjamin said of the discussion the couple had. \"We talked to the landlord in July and things moved very fast.\"\nBenjamin said that Rising Sun town officials have been very helpful.\n\"The town and the area has been very, very accommodating and welcoming,\" Benjamin said. \"The town's been very easy to work with.\"\nRising Sun Mayor Travis Marion said this fast transition is proof that the town has come into its own after years of a building moratorium and efforts since to revitalize Main Street.\n\"The opening of Sunrise Grill is another proud milestone in that journey, showing just how quickly new businesses want to be part of Rising Sun's success story,\" Marion said.\nSince the building had been renovated extensively to change from Sue's Restaurant to Hatcher's, Benjamin said there wasn't much to do except change the name and add a little paint and a few other appliances in the kitchen.\nShe said the menu at Sunrise Grill will be very similar to what customers — many who are from Rising Sun — have been choosing at Miss Oxford Diner.\n\"We want to bring good, home cooked food to the area,\" she said. That means breakfast favorites such as biscuits and gravy, eggs Benedict and even avocado toast. \"Our pancakes are phenomenal and we have French toast that is like none other.\"\nBarlow said they have connected with Stafford Farms in Elkton to provide locally grown meats and will add new items to the menu.

I worked in a hospital setting with a 30-minute lunch break. The walk to the main hospital was five minutes with an in-line wait of at least 10 minutes — all to purchase cheap, unwholesome and boring food.Do the math — there is now 10 minutes left to eat. So I am a food truck fan.\nThe takeaway from the StarDem article was the statement \"we need to be mindful of our brick- and-mortar stores, we don't want to do anything to compete with them.\"\nSo this is about favoritism toward brick-and-mortar stores? I thought competition was a basic tenet of capitalism and healthy competition was to the benefit of the consumer.\nSo the only thing brick-and-mortar stores should fear is food itself.\nSHARON HARRINGTON\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hot or not?: Trump touts U.S. economy but businesses are leery of what lies ahead\n\n August 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS Adams MultiMedia | Section: Business \n \n 1108\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Is the U.S. economy hot, cooling or somewhere in between?President Donald Trump and his acolytes say the U.S. economy is humming, citing rising stock markets, big promised corporate and foreign direct investments and lower gasoline prices.\n\"We have the hottest country on Earth. We have the hottest economy on Earth,\" Trump said earlier this month.\n\"We have hundreds of billions of dollars falling in from tariffs …One year ago we were dead as a door nail. Now, we have the hottest country,\" Trump continued.\nThe White House touts $8.7 trillion in announced or promised U.S. investments since Trump took office in January from corporate titans such as Apple, NVDIA and IBM as well as countries such as United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Japan and Qatar.\nTrump's always-vociferous critics counter that the cost of housing, child care and groceries are still high compared to before the resets of the coronavirus pandemic, and they worry about the president's very-malleable tariffs regime driving up prices and straining supply chains.\nSome economists and analysts see the potential for slower growth and hiring combined with higher prices from tariffs and post-pandemic inflation. Some employers are also looking to artificial intelligence and robotics to take over some workers' duties.\nA new forecast from Capital Economics released Aug. 25 foresees 690,000 new jobs created in the U.S. over the next 12 months, 64% less than the jobs created in 2024, according to reports by the Telegraph and Business Matters. That comes after major revisions trimmed recent government jobs growth numbers.\n'HOLDING PATTERN'In the middle and on the frontlines of the economy, some businesses loaded up on inventory and materials from China and other importers to help stave off some of the impacts of Trump's tariffs.\nOther business owners are in a wait-and-see mode for the impacts of the tariffs and other Trump economic policies with job growth slowing and wholesale prices coming in higher than expected in July.\n\"A lot of people are really in a holding pattern with spending,\" said Nathan Green, CEO of Next Level Radio. The Maryland-based company provides radio and music content to hotels, casinos and other venues in 29 U.S. states.\nGreen sees some more careful spending among both businesses and consumers.\n\"People are just not sure if the other shoe is going to drop,\" Green said.\nMelissa Katrincic, co-founder and CEO of Conniption Gin in Durham, North Carolina, has also been navigating the Trump landscape.\nThe downtown distillery sources its juniper berries for its gins from Albania and Bulgaria. Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on Albania while Bulgaria is part of the European Union, which is currently subject to a 15% U.S. tariff rate under the most recent deal with Trump.\nKatrincic said her distillery gets its bottles and glassware from China.\n\"We source from China for a custom bottle design,\" she said. \"We over-purchased at the end of 2024 knowing there could be a lot of uncertainty.\"\nTrump kicked the can until November with trade negotiations with China. The current U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports is 30%. Trump's use of emergency powers to invoke some of his tariffs faces legal challenges.\nKatrincic is keeping tabs on tariffs as well as broader trends such as consumer spending, travel, inflation and social connections.\nShe is hoping to see a rebound in \"ritualistic pauses\" such as having a drink after work or before a special event, noting how those activities were lost during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTRAVEL TRENDSThe summer tourism season has seen a similarly mixed picture.\nDiane Medler, executive director of Discover Kalispell in Montana, saw a drop in tourism activity in the spring and early summer but was more optimistic about the rest of summer and into the fall. The Kalispell area is home to Glacier National Park and has other outdoor attractions.\n\"We do anticipate more road trippers throughout the summer and into fall,\" she said.\nMedler has seen a \"steep decline\" in Canadian tourists. Trump's tariffs and previous jabs of making Canada the 51st state have made him unpopular north of the border impacting tourism to the U.S.\nLike other tourism groups, the Montana organization has been putting an emphasis on attracting visitors from nearby markets.\nConsumers and businesses are still impacted by post-pandemic inflation.\nU.S. prices are up 26% from the end of 2019 and before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nU.S. households are carrying a record $18.39 trillion in debt, according to the New York Federal Reserve Bank.\n\"We are placing a heavy emphasis on drive market traffic, specifically Montanans who are looking to explore closer to home, as well as Spokane and Seattle,\" Medler said.\nAnnette Brown, chief marketing officer at Visit Temecula Valley in California, said her group has seen continued healthy visitations from Canadians.\n\"For the remainder of this year, we've paused all international PR and marketing efforts, except for Canada, where we're still seeing demand that justifies continued investment,\" she said.\nBrown also sees more road trips.\n\"This year, driving vacations, or road trips, are a prominent trend. Many travelers are opting for road trips to have greater flexibility for exploration and to avoid the costs and potential hassles of air travel,\" she said.\n'PROCEED CAREFULLY'As of close of Thursday trading, U.S. stocks markets are up for the year with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 7%, the S&P 500 is up more than 10% and the Nasdaq is up more than 12%, according to Google Finance.\nStocks jumped Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated the central bank was getting ready to cut interest rates.\nTrump has been pressuring Powell and the central bank to cut rates.\nPowell has been reticent to cut rates citing uncertainty about tariffs. On Friday, Powell indicated that sentiment is changing during remarks in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, at the annual meeting of U.S. and global elites.\n\"The stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,\" Powell said.\nThe U.S. jobless rate is currently 4.2%. Gas prices stand at $3.16 per gallon on average nationally (as of Monday, Aug. 25), according to AAA Fuel Gauge Report. That is down from $3.35 per gallon a year ago and the record-high $5.02 per gallon set in 2022.\nWall Street reactively negatively to Trump's higher tariffs pushes but then rallied when the president eased the U.S. stance, retreated or \"taco-ed\" (Trump always chickens out) as part of negotiations, according to University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers, a Trump critic.\n\"The stock market is not the economy, but if you listen carefully, the stock market can be informative, \" Wolfers said in a social media analysis. \"Every time Trump leans into his economic instincts — threatening tariffs, undermining the Fed, or destroying institutions, stocks tank. Every time he tacos, they bounce back.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

MICHAELS — The summer tourism season comes to an end after Labor Day. For multiple businesses in St. Michaels, it could mean a slow down in business.Businesses in St. Michaels are preparing for the fall and winter months by cutting back on some costs.\n\"It's something that we know is coming every year,\" Craig Schury, owner of Pemberton Pharmacy & Gift St. Michaels, said. \"This year has been a little more difficult than most, so we're prepared. We pair down our staff a little bit and we try to keep our merchandise pretty tight. If we control those cost, we know we can be alright.\"\nAccording to some business owners in St. Michaels, this year's tourism season has not been as good as previous years. While data specific to this year's tourism in St. Michaels is not yet available, domestic tourism nationally has seen a slow down.\nAccording to Bank of America, their aggregated card data showed softer lodging, tourism and airline spending in 2025.\nSome St. Michales businesses plan shift merchandise to fit with upcoming seasons in hopes of keeping revenues up.\n\"We have less families in the fall, more couples, more anniversaries, more getaways, baby moons once the kids are back in school,\" said Courtney James, manager for The Preppy Redneck store.\n\"So, it's a different vibe in that a lot of people stop on their way to the beach in the summer and they have more families. Boating season also goes into October. So, a lot more people when it's cooler come out on their boats, um, which is a different vibe too. Each one brings kind of a different vibe.\"\nWhile the shift in merchandise and savings is key for business, the one major factor business owners hope to continue to see during the fall and winter months is support from the local community.\n\"It's paramount,\" said Jay Hudson, owner for Blue Heron Coffee. \"We're here for the community, so having the community support throughout the winter means the world. I look at the community as more of the sustainable business model, they're here every day, so their support means all the world. Tourism kind of comes and gos, but to have the community support, not just through the winter, just in general, means the world to a business.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A developer's dream: deep-water port and opportunity zone in Cambridge\n\n September 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 534\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — The City of Cambridge is the only city in Maryland that has a deep-water port and a designated opportunity zone.Having an opportunity zone is unusual for a waterfront community, which is why the city's recently proposed new comprehensive plan emphasizes this unique dichotomy. Opportunity zones are economically distressed areas designated by the state and federally funded to create economic growth and job opportunities.\nThe deep-water port and established maritime industry are significant assets for economic development, and the tax incentives that come along with the opportunity zone designation are attractive, said growth strategy advisor Shean Bourgeois, who is working with the city on its comprehensive plan update.\nWhen city staff created the previous comprehensive plan in 2011, Cambridge did not have an opportunity zone designation. Now, the combination of the designation and the city's deep-water port are seen as significant assets to its economic growth.\nIn August, the city hosted a weeklong charette where residents could voice their opinions on the future of Cambridge's development. On the final day, representatives from Able City, the development company assisting the city with its comprehensive plan, presented the visions that came out of the charette.\n\"Right now, what we hear is that there's room for improvement when it comes to the mooring fields and the harbor facilities,\" Able City partner Jason King said. \"What we hear is that there's room for improvement in terms of waterfront dining, the ability to pull your boat up to a restaurant, and there's not any sort of coherent waterfront walk.\"\nBourgeois said during the planning process, they looked at the things that set Cambridge apart from other cities on the Eastern Shore.\n\"The one that jumps out is the opportunity zone designation because it's federal. The state has to recommend which areas that fit the criteria. And then when you combine that with the fact that there's port access, really the only one on the Eastern Shore, it stands out,\" Bourgeois said.\nCambridge's 470-foot wharf is home to the only port on the Eastern Shore that has the depth, space and infrastructure to accommodate the largest and heaviest ships used in global trade. The deep-water port took shape in 1963 and was once the port of call for the Presidential Yacht, U.S.S. Potomac.\nFor King, the project is about more than just the port or the opportunity zones. It is about reconnecting the city to the waterfront. \"Generally, when we talk about economic development for Cambridge, we talk about maximizing waterfront potential,\" he said.\nKing said it is important that the development project is equitable, ensuring that the economic development benefits all residents and does not displace existing businesses.\nThe charette presentation was a first step in the comprehensive plan, and the process of understanding the implications of the opportunity zone and deep-water port are ongoing, King said.\nCurrently, the plan is being drafted, which King said will take about 1,000 hours of work.\n\"Having worked previously with King and Bourgeois in both Florida and Georgia I can assure you that this will be a transformative document... a type of Comprehensive Plan that I suspect has not been seen before in Cambridge (or on Maryland's Eastern Shore),\" Cambridge City Planner Brian Herrmann wrote in an email to the Star Democrat. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We are the best versions of ourselves when reading becomes part of a daily routine,\" Nyczaj said.\nMany of the curated books come from Gilbert's own collection as an avid reader seeking to share her passion with others and inspire a love of reading.\n\"We believe that humans will always learn more from books, not bots. We are a community focused on knowledge and growth from all genres of literature,\" she said.\nInviting everyone to pick up their next read, Brackish Books is interested in providing suggestions as well as listening to what the community is reading and catering to local tastes, according to Gilbert.\n\"We love to talk about books, recommend books and shout out our amazing local authors,\" Gilbert said, \"Let's talk about books, and see if my TBR list matches yours.\"\nGilbert is immensely proud of her local authors section, highlighting the local talent of the area.\nThe trailers pop up locations are based on strong connections Gilbert and Nyczaj have made through their time living on Kent Island and the Eastern Shore.\n\"We improve our lives in more ways than one through reading,\" she said.\nThe ultimate goal is to open a Brackish brick and mortar bookstore, but for now the bookworm duo are happy to meet the community where they are.\nBecause, as the official Brackish Books' t-shirt merchandise proclaims, \"Life is short, buy the books.\"\nBeginning this month, Brackish Books is now a regular vendor at the weekly outdoor Kent Island Farmers Market from 3:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. outside Cult Classic Brewery.\nMore information including upcoming times and pop up locations can be found on the Brackish Books social media pages. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A few weeks ago, I was alerted that a decommissioned Old Trinity Church sign was sold at this auction and returned the rector the following Sunday.Another story came out of this auction. Bernie Dryden perused every item of the large auction until he found an old Bible he described as \"tattered\" and had fountain ink stains from water damage over the years.\nThe Bible sat on the final table of the auction hall and he decided to purchase it for $12.50 to give to his grandson, who is studying theology. Upon getting home, he began flipping through the pages of the old text and realized it was a family bible.\nDryden read through the names listed in the birth, marriage and death records held within the religious text and found a familiar name. His grandson decided returning the Bible to the original family was the Christian thing to do.\nOnce again, a religious relic has gone home. Read this story and more from the day in today's edition. As always, thanks for reading.\nDo you love puzzles? The Star Democrat is considering adding a daily puzzles page to stardem.com.

None of this would be possible without our dedicated teammates, who have made Iron Hill a place where great beer, great food, and genuine hospitality come together.\"\nSixteen other Iron Hill locations in Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Georgia and South Carolina remain open. The closest to Newark are at the Wilmington Riverfront and in West Chester, Pa.\n\"While we are closing a few locations, this is truly part of a larger growth story — we are evolving, strengthening our brand, and positioning Iron Hill for long-term success,\" said Kirke, who took over as CEO in January.\nIron Hill was founded in Newark in 1996 by Kevin Finn, Mark Edelson and Kevin Davies. Finn and Edelson were making beer out of home brew kits, and they teamed up with Davies to open the Main Street restaurant.\n\"At the time, Main Street was catering to undergrads with mostly pub-type food, so we were unique because we were offering something that was more upscale,\" Finn recalled in 2016 as Iron Hill was celebrating its 20th anniversary. \"Main Street needed that and people really loved it. Iron Hill became a place where families could come to instead of a bar.\"\nSince then, Iron Hill expanded into a multi-state chain and earned the coveted \"World Champion Brewpub\" title at the World Beer Cup several times. In 2016, the company announced it was partnering with a Connecticut-based private equity firm to accelerate its expansion along the East Coast.\nOn Wednesday, a company spokesperson would not provide details about why the company chose to close its Newark location, nor would she make the company's leaders available for an interview.\n\"Newark holds a very special place in Iron Hill's history as the community that helped the Iron Hill family grow from its very beginning,\" Danielle Guzzetta said in an emailed response. \"The decision to close was not made lightly; it reflects the company's ongoing efforts to adapt to a changing business landscape while positioning Iron Hill for long-term strength and success. We are deeply grateful to the Newark community for its support over the years.\"\nThough the company provided only vague answers Wednesday, during remarks Edelson made to Newark City Council last November, he hinted at financial difficulties for the Newark restaurant and said the number of customers patronizing Main Street businesses had decreased in recent years.\n\"We have less customer traffic than we ever have,\" Edelson said at the time. \"It really started with COVID. COVID was terrible for the hospitality industry, and the hospitality industry continues to suffer from that. Load on top of that, we have the worst consumer downturn in the last 30 years right now.\"\nIn Newark, he said, one of the biggest issues is parking. He said parking in Newark was the second-worse in any town the company operated in. Phoenixville, Pa., where Iron Hill had just closed its restaurant, was the worst, he added.\nThough Iron Hill is one of the few downtown Newark businesses with a private parking lot behind it, the restaurant's owners have long complained to the city about parking issues, including that non-customers were parking in their private lot.\nIn 2016, Edelson floated the idea of moving the restaurant out of Newark if the city didn't build a parking garage or pursue other solutions.\n\"Iron Hill is at a crossroads here in Newark,\" Edelson said in 2016 \"As we come up on our latest lease renewal, we're left with weighing the decision to continue to do business in Newark or look for other options outside of the Newark property in New Castle County. Continuing to kick the can down the road gives us a signal that we can't look forward to the city supporting improving parking in the business district.\"\nIn 2019, Iron Hill's landlord, Tsionas Management, converted the parking lot behind the restaurant from a free lot reserved for Iron Hill customers to a privately-run pay-by-the-hour lot open to anyone willing to pay the fee. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2025-09-13",
    "author": "BARBARA KNEPP",
    "content": "Waterfront project promises to transform Cambridge\n\n September 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BARBARA KNEPP | Section: Columns \n \n 736\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the heart of Maryland's Eastern Shore, along the scenic banks of the Choptank River, lies an ambitious vision for renewal: the Cambridge Harbor project. Spanning 30 acres of prime waterfront property, this initiative — led by Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc. (CWDI) — promises to transform a neglected industrial site into a vibrant hub of economic opportunity.Imagine a boutique hotel anchoring the development, surrounded by retail spaces, residential units, public parks and a promenade that invites residents and visitors alike to stroll, shop and savor the river's beauty. Modeled in spirit after Baltimore's Inner Harbor, it's a project designed to boost tourism, create jobs and revitalize our community after years of planning and progress, including recent concrete pours on the promenade and ongoing talks with developers.\nYet, scroll through the Facebook comment sections under any local news post about Cambridge Harbor, and you'll encounter a digital deluge of negativity. A chorus of self-proclaimed experts — let's call them the \"citizen know-it-alls\" — chimes in with dire predictions, unfounded accusations and outright misinformation. These are folks with zero credentials in urban planning, economic development or environmental science, yet they post as if they've got Ph.D.s in all three.\n\"This will destroy the ecosystem!\" one declares, without a shred of data. \"It's a waste of taxpayer money!\" another rants, ignoring the project's reliance on private investment and grants.\n\"Gentrification alert — say goodbye to affordable housing!\" pipes up a third, overlooking the inclusionary plans for mixed-income residences.\nDon't get me wrong: Healthy debate is the lifeblood of democracy, especially in a small town like Cambridge where everyone has a stake in our future. Questions about timelines, environmental impacts or funding are fair game and have been addressed through public meetings, environmental assessments and transparent updates from CWDI.\nBut what we're seeing isn't informed discourse — it's a toxic brew of speculation, conspiracy theories and knee-jerk negativity that clogs up comment threads and drowns out constructive voices.\nThe real danger here isn't just the annoyance of scrolling past these rants; it's the tangible harm they inflict on the project itself. Misinformation spreads like wildfire on social media, shaping public perception and eroding support among residents who might otherwise champion this revitalization. When baseless claims about \"environmental disasters\" or \"corrupt deals\" gain traction, they can sway local policymakers, leading to unnecessary delays in approvals or funding.\nWe've already seen tensions, like the 2024 lawsuit between the City Council and CWDI over land use, which was exacerbated by public outcry fueled by online hysteria.\nWorse, this social media blitz has real-world consequences for the project's viability. Investors and developers, who are essential to bringing the boutique hotel and retail spaces to life, are increasingly wary of committing to projects mired in perceived controversy.\nWe've seen it happen: negative online campaigns have scared away potential partners who see the vitriol and question the community's support. This isn't speculation — it's a pattern seen in other developments where social media storms have chilled investment. Beyond that, the project's reputation, tarnished by relentless online attacks, can even impact its ability to secure insurance. In the eyes of insurers, reputation equals risk. A project painted as contentious or unstable becomes a liability, driving up costs or making coverage harder to obtain, which further strains the budget and timeline.\nThis echo chamber of uninformed outrage wastes precious resources. CWDI and city officials end up spending time debunking myths instead of building. In a community still recovering from economic challenges, every stalled month means lost jobs, untapped revenue from tourism, and a fading chance to make Cambridge a destination rather than a drive-through. The promenade's progress this year is a win, but imagine if unchecked negativity derails the next phases—residential builds, retail influx, or the waterfront park that's already breaking ground to enhance public access to the Choptank.\nTo these Facebook warriors: If you're passionate about Cambridge, channel that energy productively. Attend a CWDI meeting, review the official plans on their website, or volunteer with local groups focused on sustainable development. Expertise isn't born from a smartphone screen; it comes from facts, research and engagement.\nAnd to the rest of us: Let's not let the loudest voices dictate our future. Support Cambridge Harbor not blindly, but with eyes wide open to its potential. Our town deserves progress, not paralysis from the peanut gallery. If we tune out the noise and focus on the facts, we can build a waterfront that benefits us all — for generations to come. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He writes about \"American frustration at the system's failure to adapt to meet the essential needs of sovereign nations,\" which really means the U.S. alone.\nThe alternative? Not a new global system based on multilateral cooperation, since that would limit U.S. actions. Instead, the Trump people prefer \"a mix of tariffs and deals for foreign market access and investment\" — in other words, the approach taken with the European Union and Japan.\nAnd as between tariffs and \"deals,\" tariffs have priority because they can punish countries that have protected their markets and used various measures, such as subsidies and \"lax labor and environmental standards,\" to enhance their trade position. China comes first to mind. The administration is determined to stop the consequent flight of US capital and production abroad.\nThis America First argument is a recipe for trade protectionism, the weaponization of tariffs and shakedown of U.S. corporations. We can see the early results: not a win for American workers and consumers, nor even for many multinational corporations, but another opportunity for the concentration of political power in the Oval Office.\nTariffs can be wielded to benefit those who are willing to play Trump's game: invest in the U.S. or suffer the consequences. In an unprecedented display of state capitalism, the administration has taken a slice of investment deals abroad — such as Nvidia's AI chip sales in China—and a government share in U.S. corporations, as in the Nippon Steel-US Steel deal and the 10% government share Trump demanded of Intel.\nNEW TRADING ORDER\nTrump's new trading order doesn't distinguish between friend and adversary. Tariffs are being imposed based mainly on political rather than commercial considerations. With few exceptions — Russia, so far, is one — high tariffs have hit India, Canada, Japan, South Korea and the European Union just as hard as they have hit China.\nThe U.S. trade deficit is rarely cited as the main reason for the high tariffs. India's purchases of Russian oil, Canada's constant criticism of Trump, South Korea's low level of military spending, Brazil's trial of right-wing former president Jair Bolsonaro and China's challenge to the U.S. as global leader — these are among the actual reasons for Trump's tariffs. He's a spiteful and vengeful man.\nCareful reflection on the possible reactions of countries hit with the tariffs doesn't seem to have occurred in the Trump camp. Trump and his inner circle have always been oblivious to the power of nationalism abroad even as they nurture American nationalism.\nThe Canadians have turned to other markets and to \"buy Canadian.\" No Kentucky bourbon on their shelves!\nIndia is boycotting U.S. goods, and its leader is cozying up to Beijing and Moscow.\nThe Chinese have embraced self-reliance in computer chips, to the point where car manufacturers are being told to stop using foreign chips. A boycott of U.S. soybeans, sales of which Trump had insisted China should double, is underway.\nBrazil's leader has firmly rejected Trump's interference in its judicial processes.\nSouth Korea, Japan and the EU have all pledged major new investments in the U.S., knowing full well that they can string along the actual investment process — and might never have to make them at all if there's a change in administration.\nWriting in Foreign Affairs, Michael Froman warns:\n\"If Washington continues on its current course — defined by unilateralism, transactionalism and mercantilism — the consequences will be grim, especially as Beijing continues on its own damaging course of subsidized excess capacity, predatory export policies and economic coercion. The risk of the United States and China playing by their own rules, with power the only real constraint, is contagion: if the two largest economies in the world operate outside the rules-based system, other countries will increasingly do the same, leading to rising uncertainty, drags on productivity and lower overall growth.\"\nTHE REAL WORLD\nBlame should, however, fall mainly on the U.S., for while Trump is rejecting globalization, the Chinese are embracing it. If the entry of their goods into U.S. markets is proving too expensive, they are moving exports and production elsewhere.\nThe Chinese have become Global South leaders through their Belt and Road Initiative, which provides development loans, and through the export of goods, services and production lines, particularly to Africa and Southeast Asia but increasingly to Latin America. The more trade pressure Trump exerts, the better the Chinese look to many developing countries.\nThe U.S. economy is supposed to be the chief beneficiary of these trade policy shifts. But it's not happening. At a macroeconomic level, there is modest growth in GDP. And corporate profits are up. But most key indicators of economic health speak to serious problems already in sight or soon to be. Job figures are far below expectations.\nFortune magazine reports that a third of American CEOs plan to reduce their work force and increase prices. Farmers who rely on migrant labor are suffering. Consumer confidence and spending are down, inflation is moving upwards, home purchases are down and foreign tourism is way down. Some economists are predicting a recession, others stagflation.\nTrump's tariffs are widely understood to be a national sales tax which, as Forbes reports, \"will yank back from consumers' wallets about half the projected tax savings from the One Big Beautiful Bill's extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts.\"\nYet Trump and his yes-men will continue to claim to the bitter end that all the bad news is fake and that tariffs are working as intended. But have you noticed that they now say the good news won't come until next year? \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

And sprinkles. Lots and lots of sprinkles. Through trial and error the family has perfected their tried and true recipes, he said.\nThe current seasonal fall flavor is maple bacon, a perfect combination of salty and sweet with homemade maple glaze and generous chunks of bacon.\nGonuts Donuts also sells snacks of fruit, chips and drinks.\nCommunity reception for the donuts on-wheels has been overwhelmingly positive, Roskosky said, with eager crowds sugar-surging for dozens of donuts all throughout the opening day.\nTaking in the scenic view of Chesapeake Manor Vineyard while the rest of the family played nearby was mother and daughter Beverly Coursey and Jessica Beckmann of Kent Island.\nTheir first time visiting the winery, it was when the two heard about the donut truck's pop up grand opening on Saturday that they knew they had to check it out.\nHappy to support local businesses and enjoy a glass of wine with their donut, \"They are delicious and have so many flavors,\" Beckmann said.\n\"Mimosas and donuts pair well, you can't go wrong,\" Coursey said.\nThe vineyard itself lent a wonderful atmosphere for the whole family, with plenty of activities and space for children, and a relaxing environment for adults to sit back, Beckmann said.\nProviding surprise deliveries of fresh donuts to community members who go above and beyond, Gonuts is initiating a Donut Drop Poll, inviting the community to decide each week which Hometown Heroes to deliver to, including first responders, teachers, and doctor's offices.\nStill looking into potential permanent locations, more information about Gonuts Donuts, including pre-ordering, and upcoming next stops can be found on Gonuts Donuts social media of Facebook and Instagram. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This number may have increased since the study.\nThis is the 11th annual Maryland Ironman, an extreme triathlon race that requires approximately 1,200 volunteers to pull off. The Ironman Foundation has grant funding available for local nonprofits that volunteer for the race, per this year's Race Director Brian Snow.\n\"We have over $40,000 in nonprofit money, and it goes to volunteers and groups to help stimulate the economy with people participating as volunteers,\" Snow said.\nBoth Hengst and Snow said Friday that they were still looking for volunteers for Saturday's big race.\nThe race will include a 2.4-mile swim in the Choptank River in between Gerry Boyle Park at Great Marsh and the Yacht Club, finishing at the boat ramp at Gerry Boyle Park. Next, there will be a 112-mile bike ride through Dorchester County and the scenic Blackwater Wildlife Refuge. The race will finish with a 26.2-mile run through historic downtown Cambridge and beyond.\nSnow said athletes from all 50 states and over 30 countries will be participating on Saturday. He said every athlete generally comes with one other person considering the intensity of the race.\nBoth Snow and Hengst expressed their gratitude to the volunteers and residents of Cambridge and Dorchester County for being gracious hosts.\n\"I do want to put a huge thank you out to the community, you know, Cambridge, Dorchester County, everyone, for being so welcoming and supportive of the athletes,\" Hengst said.\n\"We're one of the smaller towns that hosts an event of this size, and we couldn't do it without the community's support. The athletes always comment about how nice everyone is and how welcoming it is here,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton business leaders reflect on summer, look ahead to fall\n\n September 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 806\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — After an up-and-down summer with mixed results for local shops and restaurants, Easton business owners and leaders are keen for the fall season to start.Holly DeKarske, executive director of the Easton Economic Development Corporation, said when she's checked in with business owners across the town, they've been pleased with foot traffic as summer has come to a close.\n\"They admit it started out kind of rough, and there have been some slow days,\" DeKarske said in a recent interview. \"But it's all been a, knock-on-wood, things seem to be up.\"\n\"We're hoping for a solid fall, Christmas season,\" she added. \"It's gonna be fascinating to see how Christmas season goes. I don't have any idea.\"\nNanny Trippe, owner of the Trippe Gallery on North Harrison Street, said she's excited to see how foot traffic fares in the fall, especially with more weekend events. The Waterfowl Festival, slated for Nov. 14-16, is the main headliner.\nThe artist acknowledged the beginning of 2025 started off \"wonky\" and unpredictable due, in part, to national economic trends.\nAccording to U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data, consumer spending took a dip in May, a 0.2% drop from April. But that monthly change rebounded in June and July. In the latter, consumers spending on goods rose 0.9% from the month prior, according to the data.\nFor the restaurant scene, DeKarske said while new additions like the Washington Street Pub have provided a bump, national spending concerns are reflected locally.\n\"You can go in any of these restaurants right now and you'll see it's a little bit down,\" she said. \"It costs a lot more to go out.\"\n'UNCERTAINTY'\nTrippe said she thinks unpredictability in foot traffic is common for years following a presidential election. But this year stood out to her.\n\"I've been in business here for 13 years and I've not heard this much uncertainty about the economy before,\" Trippe said.\nLinda Laramy, owner of the Crackerjacks toy store on South Washington Street, said her business picked up as the summer went along. She said the slow start could have been from customers' concerns about tariffs, among other things.\n\"We had a fairly slow spring and May,\" Laramy said of the 46-year-old store. \"But then starting in June, and July and August, we had a good normal amount of business and customers.\"\nTim Boyle, owner of Vintage Books, had an opposite trend, with a \"phenomenal\" spring that led into a more normal July and August.\n\"July and August typically are slower months for me, not too far off of January and February, because the visitors are generally heading to the beach,\" Boyle said. He expects business to pick up this fall.\nDeKarske said the business landscape isn't usually as volatile as it has been this year.\n\"Usually you can kind of cruise into the season knowing what's going on,\" she said. \"But right now with tariffs, you don't know what's gonna impact. People were trying to place orders, and then some of them are holding off on orders.\"\nDeKarske said the fall and Christmas seasons will be especially interesting to watch through the lens of the economy.\nMARKETING EASTON\nWith summer officially ending next week, event season is in full swing for Easton's downtown. The Easton Economic Development Corporation, or EEDC, spearheads many events, such as Fall Kickoff on Oct. 3 and 4.\nBut for non-event weekends, DeKarske said the nonprofit corporation homes in on digital marketing toward people that can make a one-day drive to Easton. That effort has yielded good results, she said.\nAnd the focus isn't just on the downtown — businesses on U.S. Route 50, Easton Parkway and other areas of town are just as important, DeKarske said. One example is the Mistletoe Hall business park. This week, animal nutrition manufacturer Vetagro broke ground on a facility in the commerce park.\n\"We're hoping by now, having broken ground out there, that that'll bring a little more visibility, too,\" Klein said of the Mistletoe Hall area.\nDeKarske and EEDC Board Chair Tom Klein noted multiple challenges with driving that EEDC tackles. Signage to direct travelers to downtown Easton is often limited on state roads or highways. But once visitors do explore the downtown, DeKarske and Klein said they're often looking to return.\nWhile EEDC staff have consistent communication with Easton officials, it isn't an official entity under the town government. DeKarske said while that's been an obstacle in the past, there have been \"huge strides\" to better communication so that EEDC can advise businesses on construction and other town activities.\nEEDC does have a memorandum of understanding with the Town of Easton to manage its arts and entertainment designation, visitor's center and economic development responsibilities.\nTrippe, the art gallery owner, said the EEDC's staff have been helpful.\n\"They do a fantastic job of promoting all of the businesses,\" Trippe said. \"They walk the streets, checking in to see what you've got going on, and maybe even inspiring you to do something special.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The national average is unchanged from a month ago and stands 1.8 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\n\"The national average saw a slight increase last week, primarily driven by states that experienced price cycling just ahead of the switch back to winter gasoline,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"Florida, Ohio, Michigan and Maryland— all states known for routine price cycling— saw double-digit jumps to average gas prices.\"\nHe predicted the transition to cheaper winter gasoline and with driving demand seasonally tapering off as temperatures dip, gas prices face additional downward pressure.\n\"We're still on track to potentially see the national average fall below $3 per gallon for the first time in years this autumn,\" De Haan said.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nSept. 22, 2024: $3.05 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.16 per gallon)Sept. 22, 2023: $3.62 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.84 per gallon)Sept. 22, 2022: $3.41 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.65 per gallon)Sept. 22, 2021: $3.09 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.18 per gallon)Sept. 22, 2020: $2.23 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.20 per gallon)Sept. 22, 2019: $2.59 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.66 per gallon)Sept. 22, 2018: $2.81 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.85 per gallon)Sept. 22, 2017: $2.57 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.56 per gallon)Sept. 22, 2016: $2.26 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.21 per gallon)Sept. 22, 2015: $2.25 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.28 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.15 per gallon, up 14.5 cents per gallon from last week's $3.01 per gallon.\nWashington, D.C.: $3.21 per gallon, down 1.8 cents per gallon from last week's $3.23 per gallon.\nHagerstown: $3.10 per gallon, down 5.3 cents per gallon from last week's $3.16 per gallon. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They opened the doors on a new leasing office at 407 Brookletts Ave. adjacent to the Easton Crossing site.\nRoss Benincasa, Fello's senior vice president of community development, said demolition at the Easton Crossing site was finished earlier this summer.\n\"Early next year, we'll start to see vertical construction underway,\" Benincasa said.\nApproved by the town earlier this year, the project is one of the larger housing endeavors in town, replacing the former Perdue AgriBusiness operation that used to occupy the space.\nElsewhere in Easton, Fello opened nine units and offices on Port Street in 2024 and received town approval for 28 townhomes at Silo Court, the second Perdue site bought by the developer to turn into housing.\nEaston Crossing will include market-rate and affordable units. The units will not majorly differ based on the rates, Fello President and CEO Jonathon Rondeau said.\n\"Our philosophy for Easton Crossing is all about creating a neighborhood where everyone of all backgrounds, abilities and incomes can live together successfully,\" Rondeau said.\nBuilderGuru Contracting and Gardiner & Gardiner Contracting will serve as the general contractors for the project.\nIn an interview, Rondeau said he was excited to get the leasing building opened as a preliminary step for the project.\n\"For us it was important that, while we're not yet leasing, that we show the community what's possible and what will be happening at this site,\" Rondeau said.\n\"I think people are still sort of cautiously optimistic,\" he added when asked about the project as a whole. \"We're also respectful that people already live here, so there's a balance of making sure that we're not being intrusive to people's livelihood as we are going through construction.\"\nThis story has been updated. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Watermen oppose striped bass cuts, urge status quo at Chesapeake College forum\n\n September 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1084\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WYE MILLS — Eastern Shore watermen packed Chesapeake College on Monday and overwhelmingly opposed draft striped bass rules that would trim total removals by 12 percent in 2026 and could add more closures.The public hearing — organized by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources — drew more than 100 people, including county commissioners, council members and state delegates. By a show of hands, virtually every attendee opposed any change to current rules.\nAt issue is Draft Addendum III, the Fisheries Commission's proposal to support rebuilding the East Coast striped bass stock by 2029. The action seeks to reduce fishery removals by 12 percent beginning in 2026. For the commercial sector, the draft proposes a quota cut; for the recreational sector, it considers season closures and/or size-limit changes.\nIt also contemplates requirements for commercial tagging programs, a coastwide definition of total length for size-limit compliance, and changes to Maryland's recreational baseline season to simplify rules, improve enforcement and better align fishing access with release mortality and stakeholder input.\nThe Commission intends to take final action no later than October, with most measures implemented in 2026.\n\"Tonight is a way for the members on the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to hear your concerns,\" said Mike Luisi, an associate director with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources' Fishing and Boating Services and a member of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. He later added: \"The plan is to get the striped bass healthier so we can [return] to additional quotas in light of having a healthier population. That's the truth. It is to provide for a better stock so we can provide more quota back to the commercial industry and [lighten] restrictions on the recreational industry. For those who say we do not take the watermen's advice, we do a spring spawning stock assessment where watermen take us out on their routine.\"\nEmilie Franke, a fishery management plan coordinator for the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, walked the audience through the options, including a potential allowance for catch-and-release during part of the spring — a period that has been closed in recent years to protect spawning fish. That drew a sharp reaction.\n\"Catch-and-release will be on spawning grounds,\" said Brian Hardman, president of the Maryland Charter Boat Association. \"How could you push this through knowing this information?\"\nFranke said striped bass–specific research about catch-and-release effects on spawning — such as impacts on egg production or pre-spawn behavior — is limited. \"The research is inconclusive,\" she said, noting the technical committee is working to incorporate environmental factors into models where appropriate.\nSpeakers repeatedly pressed the agencies on data and modeling. Hardman questioned the federal Marine Recreational Information Program estimates. \"The MRIP data that they use is off by about 40 percent,\" he said. \"Maybe the numbers you are trying to hit are so artificially high we will never get there.\"\nDelmarva Fisheries Association President Rob Newberry cited a Maryland study from the late 1990s to argue release mortality is higher than assumed. \"There's 200 years of data you people have flagrantly not paid attention to,\" he said, urging the state and the Fisheries Commission to complete socioeconomic and pollution analyses before tightening rules. \"Start using good science — it's there.\"\nRobert T. Brown, president of the Maryland Watermen's Association, said the draft's rebuilding target is unrealistic. \"You all are wrong that they put the target so high,\" Brown said. \"You can only go so far until it is out of reach. You can't maintain it. When it comes to it, we've got so many rockfish out there now. The big fish are there, the small fish [are] coming back.\"\nElected officials echoed the industry's frustration. \"Send this back, rework it,\" said State Sen. Johnny Mautz. \"The reality of how this plays out is it is overburdening our local economy. Last year's impact from two fish to one fish was catastrophic.\"\nDorchester County Council member Mike Detmer said the draft has eroded trust. \"I am deeply concerned about the 12 percent cut,\" he said. \"What I hear is a lack of confidence in the board. The watermen are the most concerned to have a robust fishery. We have to protect this magical resource.\"\nWicomico County Council member James Winn urged the agencies to look beyond fishermen for causes. \"Are we the issue?\" he asked. \"Could it be a menhaden fleet up in Virginia catching more than just menhaden? Have you done studies on other industries affecting the fish? Maybe we should be restricting what they're doing — not what we're doing.\"\nTalbot Watermen's Association President Jeff Harrison said stricter rules have hollowed out traditional working communities. \"When I ran charter there were about 40 [charter boats] on Tilghman,\" he said. \"Right now there are three. It's hard to call it a fishing village anymore.\"\nDel. Jay Jacobs called spring catch-and-release \"the wrong direction,\" arguing it contradicts prior steps to protect broodstock. \"It's an unscientific position to take without knowing the damage it's caused,\" he said. \"We're here to maintain a historic livelihood.\"\nSeveral speakers described the proposal as a choice between the status quo and more closures, with some options allowing spring catch-and-release. Many said they prefer no change. \"Why haven't you considered giving us 12 percent back instead of taking?\" asked waterman Dan Dierker. \"Start talking to people who pay the most to fish, who have the most to lose. Stop listening to the wrong people like the CCA (Coastal Conservation Association).\nVeteran Kent County waterman Don Pierce said cumulative quota cuts are pushing families out of the business. \"I've been doing this for 60-plus years,\" he said. \"You come in for one day, trying to run this industry. … Had a 12,000-pound quota when this all started. When you're done with this one, I'll have seven. Take a 50 percent cut in your salary, see how long you sit there.\"\nLuisi said the Maryland baseline season concept grew out of feedback from many quarters — including watermen — and that nothing has been finalized for 2026. \"We heard that it would be in Maryland's best interest to try to drive the economy,\" he said. \"These changes weren't meant to harm anyone. They were meant to try to offset different times of the year.\"\nWhat's next: The Fisheries Commission is scheduled to consider Draft Addendum III later this fall in Annapolis, with final action expected no later than October 2025 and implementation in 2026. Commercial tagging requirements, if adopted, could take longer to roll out. Maryland's DNR said it would carry comments from Monday's forum to the board. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It will begin to welcome new residents this weekend.\nThe project, which sits right off of Matthewstown Road, was led by Mallard Construction Group.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook, Ward 2 Councilmember Robert Rankin and other town officials toured the apartments on Wednesday, getting a look at the first of four buildings at the site.\nJim DiDonato, president of Mallard Construction Group, thanked town officials and his team for making the project possible.\n\"We're glad that we can deliver a product that I think the town can be really happy with,\" DiDonato said.\nUnits include one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments. Amenities offered are a bike storage room, pickleball court, dog wash station, patio and more. The one-bedroom units start at just under $1,800 a month, while larger apartments range from $2,000 to $2,300, according to the complex's website.\nStephen Margerum, principal with Cove Property Management, said five people will move in this weekend, which will kick off a \"consistent flow of move-ins\" through November.\n\"We have a lot of demand, a lot of people wanting to move in as quickly as possible,\" Margerum said. \"The response from the prospective residents have been really great.\"\nHe said the two 38-unit buildings will be filled out by the end of the year. The other two buildings, both 30 units and still under construction, will be delivered next spring, Margerum said.\nProperty management has been busy with tours and applications, he said. Before the leasing office was set up, more than 400 people signed up or went into the The Promenade's applicant database, Margerum said.\nThe Elliott Road project is one of Easton's larger housing developments, by units, currently in the pipeline. More than 1,000 units have recently opened, are under construction or have received town approval.\nEarlier this month, developers for a downtown apartment complex on Brookletts Avenue cut the ribbon on a new leasing office. Construction on that 116-unit project begins later this fall. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It has been our pleasure to serve you, and we are deeply grateful for your support, friendship, and loyalty over the years,\" the company said in a message to customers Thursday. \"We sincerely hope to return in the future, and when we do, we promise to welcome you with open arms.\"\nIn an email to employees, the company said it plans to file for bankruptcy \"due to ongoing financial challenges.\" It said the company did not warn employees of the pending closure because it was \"working diligently behind the scenes\" to find new funding sources.\nIron Hill was founded in Newark in 1996 by Kevin Finn, Mark Edelson and Kevin Davies. Finn and Edelson were making beer out of home brew kits, and they teamed up with Davies to open the Main Street restaurant.\n\"At the time, Main Street was catering to undergrads with mostly pub-type food, so we were unique because we were offering something that was more upscale,\" Finn recalled in 2016 as Iron Hill was celebrating its 20th anniversary. \"Main Street needed that and people really loved it. Iron Hill became a place where families could come to instead of a bar.\"\nIn the decades that followed, Iron Hill expanded into a multi-state chain and earned the coveted \"World Champion Brewpub\" title at the World Beer Cup several times. In 2016, the company announced it was partnering with a Connecticut-based private equity firm to accelerate its expansion along the East Coast. It had locations in Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Georgia and South Carolina.\nDuring remarks Edelson made to Newark City Council last November, he hinted at financial difficulties for the Newark restaurant and said the number of customers patronizing Main Street businesses had decreased in recent years.\n\"We have less customer traffic than we ever have,\" Edelson said at the time. \"It really started with COVID. COVID was terrible for the hospitality industry, and the hospitality industry continues to suffer from that. Load on top of that, we have the worst consumer downturn in the last 30 years right now.\"\nStill, Iron Hill took many customers and employees by surprise Sept. 10 when it announced it was closing its flagship Newark restaurant, along with locations in Voorhees, N.J., and in the Chestnut Hill neighborhood of Philadelphia. At the time, CEO Mark Kirke said the closures would help stabilize the rest of the company.\n\"While we are closing a few locations, this is truly part of a larger growth story — we are evolving, strengthening our brand, and positioning Iron Hill for long-term success,\" Kirke said, just two weeks before changing course and closing all the remaining restaurants. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland’s housing order aims to boost affordable housing, cut barriers\n\n September 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SANDRA SMITH Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 638\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Gov. Wes Moore signed an executive order on Sept. 3 aimed at tackling Maryland's escalating housing affordability crisis. The Housing Starts Here initiative seeks to expedite housing development, reduce production delays and make home ownership more accessible across the state.According to the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), the state faces a deficit of around 96,000 housing units — a gap that has been widening over recent years.\nThe 2025 Maryland Housing Needs Assessment, an analysis of Maryland's housing gap conducted by DHCD and The National Center for Smart Growth, reveals significant disparities in housing availability across the state. Counties like Montgomery and Howard have median home prices exceeding $600,000, making homeownership unattainable for low and middle income residents.\nConversely, areas such as Allegany and Wicomico counties report median home prices below $200,000, which indicates regional inconsistencies in the Maryland housing market.\nThe executive order will broadly target each county in Maryland in order to create more housing development throughout the state.\n\"[The executive order] says that everybody has a piece of the housing crisis, and everybody deserves for their local and state governments to be working in concert to solve that crisis,\" DHCD Secretary Jake Day said.\nIn more than half of Maryland counties, renters are spending more than one-third of their annual income on housing costs, which is considered unaffordable by federal standards.\nWhile Maryland's median income is 28% higher than the national median, the state's median home price is 35% higher, highlighting the disproportionate cost of housing.\n\"How we got here is really the post-2008 financial crisis. It was real-estate driven… that had to do with risks that the financial industry took at the time,\" Secretary Day said. \"It led to a collapse in the economy, in residential home values and more. The over-correction of the market meant we stopped building houses at a pace that matched population growth.\"\nThe Housing Starts Here Executive Order directs state agencies to identify underutilized state-owned properties suitable for transit-oriented development, aiming to increase housing density in areas with existing infrastructure.\nTransit-oriented development is a strategy that promotes dense, mixed-use communities around transit to help increase ridership and the use of public transportation.\n\"There are a lot of benefits to it… we want to develop state-owned land for transit-oriented development, since state-owned land is not currently taxable. There's no revenue generation for the states or local jurisdictions. It also provides an opportunity for Marylanders to live closer to transit and use it more,\" Maryland Department of Transportation's Chief of Real Estate and Transit-Oriented Development, David Zaidain, said.\nAccording to Zaidain, transportation is the second biggest household budget item behind housing. It costs roughly $600 a month for Marylanders to own a car, which is pushing the state towards more transit usage.\nZaidain also noted the climate change benefits that come with transit-oriented development.\nThe executive order directs the state to speed up timelines for housing permits and establish a state housing ombudsman, or overseer, to help projects move forward.\nThe legislation comes on the heels of a 2024 legislative package that made housing more affordable and accessible for Marylanders struggling with construction barriers, along with creating the Office of Tenant and Landlord Affairs.\nThe Housing Starts Here order also directs agencies to track housing production progress annually, coordinate with local governments to address regional shortages and ensure accountability across jurisdictions.\nBy centralizing oversight and removing barriers, the administration aims to close the housing deficit and expand affordable options for Marylanders in the years ahead.\n\"When regulatory processes add cost, that cost has to be recouped — either with higher rents or a higher sales price. So, the more regulatory burden we place, the more likely it is that we're just producing expensive [places] for people to live,\" Secretary Day said. \"By cutting time and money out of the process, by streamlining it, we can make it easier to get to the finish line.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

For decades, he helped families on the Eastern Shore with everything from heating oil to pool water needs.After over 50 years in the trucking industry, Murphy is set to retire.\n\"It's something I didn't want to do, but it was time. My health wasn't get any better,\" Murphy said. \"I'm going to do what I want to do, like travel and so on and so forth… try to take care of the grandkids.\"\nMurphy was born in Baltimore in 1953 and moved to Caroline County in his youth. In 1974, at 21, Murphy started his career as a truck driver.\nHe worked at Lady Bug Lines in Harrington, Delaware for five years from 1987 to 1992.\nIn 1992, Murphy started his own business, Murphy Transport. In 1994, Murphy added a pool water company to Murphy Transport, and in 1998 he created America's Best Oil, hauling petroleum products and heating oil to multiple states around the county.\nAmerica's Best Oil helped with the fueling process for multiple Chesapeake island restoration projects.\n\"When they did Poplar Island, we loaded seven trailers in one truck on to the barges,\" Murphy said.\nAt both businesses' peak, Murphy operated 24 trucks and employed more than 30 people.\nMurphy was involved in multiple aspects of his businesses including mechanics and dispatch. His wife of 53 years, Mary Lou Murphy, also played a significant role, handling home affairs and supporting him in his work.\nMurphy's daughter, Kristy Murphy-Taylor, recalled her mother getting up at 4 a.m. to make her husband breakfast before a long day of work.\nDespite financial challenges, Murphy's daughter said he prioritized helping customers, often providing services like emergency heating oil deliveries without extra fees, even if it meant personal sacrifice.\n\"If somebody ran out in the middle of the night, he would get up and take them heating oil, he'd restart their furnace for no fee. Any other company charges and people really appreciated that,\" Murphy-Taylor said.\nMurphy recalled one customer during the winter afraid of running out of heating oil at her house. While this customer paid, some customers didn't, but Murphy looked at the potential for doing good.\n\"If that woman had not paid me, the way I looked at is five to 10 other customers called that did pay, that would that would justify for that one lady not paying. That's the way I always looked at business,\" Murphy said.\nMurphy believed in helping the community and that positive word-of-mouth would ultimately benefit the business.\nDue to a diagnosis of lung cancer in 2022 and amyloidosis, a rare blood disease, Murphy sold his business on Feb. 28. Throughout his long years in business, Murphy touched many hearts.\nMansour Ali worked for Murphy Transport for over 25 years. Ali enjoyed every year working under Murphy.\n\"Back in the day, Murphy was just getting started, and he was a hard worker and he wanted hard working employees. I stayed with Murphy for as long as I did because it was the best job I ever had and the best employer that I ever worked for,\" Ali said.\nAli recalled Murphy coming out to help him with a flat tire in the middle of the night.\n\"You would call him and he would get out of his bed for flat tires, he would bring his trailer over and he would actually change the tires himself,\" Ali said.\n\"One time I had been running all day and I happen to see him pass me going in the opposite direction. I called him and asked 'what you doing over here?' He said 'I got all this work in here and I don't got nobody to do it.' So he would come out and do it himself. I said, 'Man send me half of whatever you got.' If he had six loads, send me half of them, and we stayed out there until that work was done,\" Ali said.\n\"That's how really he got his name, because he wouldn't turn any work down and companies knew when you call Murphy Transport, they're going to get the load to you,\" Ali said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "New life for historic general store\n\n October 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: Business \n \n 854\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Nelson and Jeania Stewart have transformed a historic general store into Harper's Coffee Tavern and Shelter & Co., a combination coffee shop and antique emporium that the couple hopes will become a community gathering place in the small Kent County town of Still Pond.As Halloween approaches, Harper's Coffee Tavern and Shelter & Co. has opened in the historic W.M. Medders & Co. building, offering coffee, antiques and a Gothic atmosphere unlike any chain store.\nAt the intersection of Main Street and Still Pond Road the Stewarts prepare for their favorite holiday, emblematic of the looming pumpkin figure on the roof glowing in the night sky.\nOpen now from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays and Sundays from noon to 4 p.m., they invite visitors to stop for a brew and to browse their collection.\nWilliam Medders purchased the store from George Harper operating it from 1894-1959. During that time, he expanded the business by selling housewares and grocery items.\nCarrying on the Medders' shopping tradition, the Stewarts offer more than coffee to the community.\nThis is not a Starbucks.\nAnd not Dunkin'.\nThose designer coffees will eventually be offered, but it is the enriching experience that sets Harper's apart. Entering Harper's is like journeying into a world of classical novels and Edgar Allen Poe stanzas.\nIn the serving area, patrons are treated to a spacious Victorian/Gothic atmosphere. Busts of historical figures, candelabras, vintage furniture, beautiful designs, musical instruments, paintings and art sculptures are featured.\nBeyond a donated piano and latticed windows are classic books inviting customers to stay for a while, read and enjoy the atmosphere.\nIn time for Halloween, there are skulls, werewolves and horror/suspense type imagery everywhere, like in the bird cage displayed there is a sculpture of novelist Stephen King's \"It\" clown facing off with the demon from \"Legend.\"\nThere are werewolves, hanging bat skeletons, a giant skull with glowing eyes, a face in a jar and coffin-shaped cabinets.\nAbove the comfortable seating area hangs a message, \"Needful Things\" a King story about neighbors taking the Faustian bargain (deal with the devil).\n\"If you appreciate art, history and especially mystery, this is the place for you,\" Nelson said.\nAn area inspiring creativity is ideal as Nelson and Jeania are founding members of The Devil's Brigade, an international Celtic band known for its epic, multi-instrumental sound including jigs, reels, hornpipes, ballads, originals, covers, soundtracks, patriotic and military music and Irish foot-stompers.\nSitting down with them and their dogs, especially little Kaiser, (don't mistake his cuteness for weakness) they have intriguing stories behind their items.\nThey talk about touring cities, his love of teaching, the interesting people they meet day by day and their plans to make Still Pond a place to host community events.\nFor both, having an establishment like this has been a dream. They are looking on ways to improve upon it in increments with Jeania lending her talents of art, sculpting, and textile conservation as well as plumbing, roofing, flooring and carpentry.\n\"She does it all,\" Stewart said with a smile. \"And I do as she says.\"\nThe Stewarts are now closer to their goal of keeping Harper's open more often. Finding someone like-minded, matching the duo's energy furthered that mission along. Jeania said she sensed that regular customers Marion Green from Rock Hall, with his girlfriend Nicole Sheffer were the right people to oversee the shop while out of town. \"I knew right away I could trust them. Now we can go away and keep the store open. It really helped open things up,\" Jeania said.\nExiting Harper's, the antique portion of the location is called Shelter & Co. Inside, the Stewarts and Green offer their world of antiques and many other items. Everything is for sale, Jeania pointed out.\nThe downstairs portion holds Green's collections through the years, antiques and art deco items like animal sculptures, shot glasses, vintage bottles, models and more. Upstairs are Jeania's items. There are quilts, bedspreads, fine china, paintings, mirrors and even old documents left from George Harper in the late 1800's.Tourists, yard sale enthusiasts and lovers of antiques can spend hours browsing through all the items.\nThe amount of goods on both sides of the building might have made Medders proud.\nUpstairs, encased in glass there is an old Baltimore Sun article about his life and vision for the store. Reporter, Walter V. Brooks wrote about it: \"During these days of drastically curtailed retail stocks and critical goods, a trip to the store is like a visit to Aladdin's cave.\"\nThat certainly could sum up an experience at Harper's and at Shelter & Co.\nNelson envisions the place as a meeting and gathering hub and for hosting events such as birthdays and weddings. \"I like to see it as a destination for learning and big dreams. There's something magical about Still Pond.\"\nStop in and visit Nelson and Jeania or see them perform at the Fairfax Fall Festival Oct. 11. Nov. 7-8, they will be at the the National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum in Florida supporting veterans, a cause they are passionate about, and then back performing at the annual Dickens of a Christmas, Dec. 5-6 in Downtown Chestertown.\nTheir albums can be found online and for information about renting the space contact them at info@thedevilsbrigade.net. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore last week blamed President Donald Trump for a federal shutdown that he says is landing especially hard on the Maryland workforce.\"Since Donald Trump has come on board, he has fired over 15,000 Marylanders that are federal workers,\" Moore said in a press conference. \"Donald Trump doesn't have an interest in governing. He doesn't have an interest in a fully functioning relationship between the federal government and the states.\"\nBut state Republicans say Democrats bear responsibility for the fact that many Marylanders will be missing their paychecks until Congress can approve a continuing resolution that would keep the government running.\nState Sen. Justin Ready, the minority whip, blamed Democrats in Washington and elsewhere for the shutdown.\n\"Maryland Democrats must abandon the political theater and focus on governing. They need to prioritize Maryland families first by putting D.C. grandstanding aside by supporting a clean CR to reopen the federal government,\" he said in a statement.\nTrump has threatened mass government layoffs if congressional Democrats refuse to get on board for a Republican spending bill. And that means something in Maryland, where a huge chunk of the workforce is employed directly by the federal government, or is a contractor for one of its agencies.\nIn 2024, prior to job cuts under the Trump administration, an estimated 269,000 Maryland residents were employed by the federal government, state officials told reporters on Wednesday. They said about 210,000 were federal contractors.\nMoore said that 15,000 jobs have already been cut in the past year. Now, those who are still on the payroll will go without paychecks, and those who are nonessential will be furloughed.\nState officials can't do much to help those employees absorb the impact, but Moore vowed to do all he could to provide some support.\nHis administration plans to keep paying out for safety net programs, assuming they'll get their federal reimbursement as usual. They haven't heard otherwise, state officials told reporters last week.\nThe governor is asking the courts and utility companies to protect furloughed federal workers from eviction, foreclosure or utility shutoffs while they are involuntarily suspended from work. He's also expanding emergency assistance programs for federal employees.\nBut the state will not be able to support these programs indefinitely, Moore said. If the shutdown continues, the state and its residents face worsening consequences.\n\"We can see big infrastructure projects delayed,\" he said. \"We can see military families, people who already sacrificed for this country, go without pay for weeks. We can see small businesses dip into the red.\"\nMoore said that his administration will monitor and respond to growing uncertainty caused by the shutdown.\n\"We are going to do everything in our power,\" Moore said, \"to make sure that, despite the federal government deciding to leave all of us on our own, that people in the state of Maryland will know that the state, at least, and this administration will continue to fight for them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Prices in Maryland are 17.3 cents per gallon lower than a month ago and stand 22.6 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has increased 1.1 cents compared to a week ago and stands at $3.663 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.69 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $4.79 per gallon, a difference of $2.10 per gallon. The lowest price in the state yesterday was $2.69 per gallon while the highest was $4.79 per gallon, a difference of $2.10 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has fallen 0.3 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.08 per gallon today. The national average is down 10.8 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 4.7 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nOctober 6, 2024: $3.22 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.13 per gallon)October 6, 2023: $3.44 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.71 per gallon)October 6, 2022: $3.56 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.90 per gallon)October 6, 2021: $3.13 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.22 per gallon)October 6, 2020: $2.26 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.17 per gallon)October 6, 2019: $2.50 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.65 per gallon)October 6, 2018: $2.84 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.91 per gallon)October 6, 2017: $2.45 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.49 per gallon)October 6, 2016: $2.24 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.26 per gallon)October 6, 2015: $2.23 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.29 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $2.96 per gallon, down 9.3 cents per gallon from last week's $3.05 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.14 per gallon, down 5.0 cents per gallon from last week's $3.19 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.13 per gallon, up 5.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.07 per gallon.\n\"While the national average slipped slightly over the last week, it's once again been a mixed bag depending on where you fill up,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"Gas prices cycled upward in Ohio and Michigan, declined in Indiana and Delaware, and pain is about to return to California and neighboring states following last week's refinery fire outside Los Angeles. While OPEC again agreed over the weekend to boost oil production for November, the real story for motorists has been regional variation — especially in areas served by California's supply system. Though the damage from the fire appears limited, the West Coast is likely to see prices climb, while most other areas can expect relative stability or slight declines.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton hosts Main Street conference; visitors weigh in on downtown atmosphere\n\n October 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 738\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Many new faces walked the downtown streets of Easton this week for the second ever Main Street Maryland Conference.Hosted jointly by the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development and the Easton Economic Development Corporation, among other partners, the conference brought Main Street managers and economic development officials together in one space to exchange ideas and advice.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook encouraged those visiting the town to take it all in.\n\"Look around and notice the historic buildings that anchor our downtown,\" Cook said during her opening remarks on Tuesday morning. \"The parks and open space tucked throughout, and the small shops and restaurants that give our Main Street its unique energy.\"\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, conference attendees walked the downtown streets, dined in restaurants and joined tours with local officials and leaders to learn more about Easton.\nLisa Challenger, executive director of the Beach to Bay Heritage Area encompassing Somerset, Wicomico and Worcester counties, said Easton's gardening and plants caught her eye.\n\"Somebody has really been paying attention and giving all of that lots of love,\" Challenger said. \"No trash. Your first impression is just, 'Wow, it is so pretty.'\"\nKara Norman, executive director of the Downtown Frederick Partnership, felt similarly. She said Easton's streetscapes are \"lovely\" and the \"subtle\" things next to sidewalks and buildings really make a difference.\nCarol Gilbert, an assistant secretary at the Department of Housing and Community Development, touched on the historic aspect of downtown Easton.\n\"The level of authenticity of the core downtown,\" Gilbert said. \"There's really beautiful architecture.\"\nOn Tuesday, local officials and leaders led tours to shed light on what makes Easton unique, including The Hill district, the Talbot Historical Society and an overview of housing revitalization by Ross Benincasa, senior vice president of community development for the nonprofit developer Fello.\nTown Planning and Zoning Director Miguel Salinas, meanwhile, led attendees on a tour of Easton's East End area, explaining land use opportunities and challenges the town faces.\nThose who toured Easton largely had positive words. Challenger did note small area of dissatisfaction: \"I wished I didn't have to park so far away.\" She said she parked near the library and walked to the Avalon Theatre. But it's not necessarily a negative, she added.\n\"I think when there's a lack of parking or not enough, it's probably a good sign,\" Challenger said. \"It's so busy.\"\nState officials stop by\nDuring the two days, multiple high-level officials in Gov. Wes Moore's administration spoke to attendees, including Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D) and Department of Housing and Community Development Secretary Jake Day, the latter of whom has expressed interest in running as a Democrat for the 1st Congressional District seat currently held by Rep. Andy Harris (R).\nMiller recalled her first trip to Easton in 2022, a visit she was nervous for given the governor had to cancel last minute. Many more people showed up than she expected.\n\"The thing that I learned about Easton that day is never underestimate how much this town shows up for others,\" Miller said in front of more than 100 people inside the Waterfowl Festival building on Tuesday evening.\nDay arrived later Tuesday, joining town and state officials on an evening out at restaurants including Tiger Lily. He hosted a roundtable with his department's top officials on Wednesday to close out the conference.\nAfterward, Day said in an interview that the state made the right choice in selecting Easton for the second annual conference. Last year's was held in Frederick and next year's will be in Hagerstown.\nDay, the former mayor of Salisbury, said Main Street managers take on difficult jobs in rebuilding and maintaining Main Street designations and downtown areas.\n\"When I was mayor, we tore up our Main Street,\" Day said of Salisbury. \"We went under the knife for three-and-a-half years. This can be disruptive work to do transformative placemaking. And even the small stuff, policy-changing, trying to bring events, it's hard.\"\nJulia Glanz, deputy secretary of DHCD, said in an interview that the two-day conference was the longest she'd spent in Easton. The restaurants stood out to her, and she said she's made a mental note to come back after missing out on an \"incredible\" mushroom soup at Legal Assets.\n\"It's been so exciting to see all of the shop owners come together and buy into this event,\" Glanz said. \"I know that's how they buy into all their events. … They all understand how to work in unison to create an environment that's really engaging for residents and visitors alike.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Major sponsors included Benelli USA, Hevi-Shot, Banded and Vortex Optics.\nSales representatives answered questions while food vendors, live music and children's activities kept crowds entertained.\n\"We're out here in God's country, the Eastern Shore, surrounded by like-minded people. It doesn't get better than that,\" said world champion duck caller Sean Mann, who offered a calling clinic Sunday, teaching mallard calls.\n\"Most ducks respond to mallard calls. That's always the first thing we teach on the Shore,\" he said.\nNearby, Jimmy Wren, owner of United Call Works, led Saturday clinics and gave away merchandise. A Maryland native, Wren said he was glad to be home and reported selling more than 40 calls during the festival.\nDecoy artists Jeff Coates and Nick Castiglione demonstrated their painting techniques, with Coates applying a natural-looking feathered texture to cork wood.\nFirearm retailers and representatives such as Retay from Easton, shotgun manufacturers and LWRCI discussed trends in gun ownership. A hot topic this year was silencers and short barrels, with attendees asking questions following the decision to reduce the National Firearms Act tax on suppressors from $200 to $0 beginning Jan. 1.\n\"Using silencers is all about hearing protection,\" said sales representative Liam Parker, who praised lawmakers' move to eliminate the fee.\n\"This will open up a section of new buyers,\" said Scott Tull, account manager for LWRCI.\nOther vendors also had strong sales. Under Armour sold out of many items, while Banded Hunting Gear reported hip waders, panel blinds and Phantom Tech soft shell hoodies as top sellers.\nOutside the tent, Chestertown Lions Club members directed parking while families enjoyed children's activities. Shore Party Rentals provided a bounce house, Kent 4-H Triple Shots offered a BB gun and archery range, and Beth Hill, principal agent associate for 4-H Youth Development in Kent County, demonstrated leaf-pattern tracing. Face painter Ashley Burl kept a steady line of children waiting for designs.\nFood vendors drew crowds as well. The Robinson family's Madhouse Oysters sold 300 oysters by Saturday afternoon. The Farmers Daughter BBQ served pulled pork, Jimmy's Fat Rolls offered lobster rolls, and Get the Scoop dished out hand-dipped ice cream, milkshakes and sundaes.\nMusic filled the festival grounds with Friday performances by Gunner's Rest, Nicholas Ray — playing one of his last local shows before moving to Nashville — and Ashley Vagnoni Chapa. Saturday featured singer-songwriter Joe Bryan, playing alt-country, classic rock and indie covers, followed by the Old School Duo from Galena. Easton country artist Justin Ryan closed out the weekend Sunday.\nChestertown Lions Club member Michael Moore estimated 300 vehicles were parked on-site around noon Saturday.\nMarketing coordinator Justin Ly said more than 3,300 people attended the three-day event.\n\"Another one in the books! Thank you to everyone who came out, to our vendors, brand partners, sponsors, nonprofits and every member of the Molly's family. It was a great weekend,\" Ly said.\nMolly's Place operates in Kennedyville and recently opened a second location, Molly's Easton.

Like, I like to talk to people, and just like a lot of aspects nowadays, like, people are all on the internet and not really face-to-face,\" Marron said.\nMarron and her husband, Dan, own a farm just outside of Greensboro. They would do vending shows at the farm to showcase art, food and clothes made by Eastern Shore residents.\nThe shop in Ridgley allows a permanent location for vendors to showcase.\n\"I would do vending shows, and it's really hard for the vendors,\" Sophia Marron said. \"You have to set up, you have to load, you have to unload, you're in the hot hot weather, you're paying a fee... I wanted them to be able to have a space to provide that to the community at a low cost.\"\nNow, the Marrons are seeking to evolve the vendor shop concept further.\nThey plan to move the shop to their farm, Constellation Farmstead, and reopen on their own land, where they can offer the space to vendors for free.\n\"I won't have to charge them a rent fee, and we can just do it on a lower overhead budget, and that will be better for the vendors,\" Sophia Marron said. \"So if their stuff sells, it sells. If it doesn't, it doesn't, and it doesn't hurt the vendor.\"\nThe decision came after Sophia realized she spends a lot of time at the shop that could be spent at the farm.\n\"We farm as well, so farming, and being here and running the shop,\" Sophia Marron said. \"I can be at the farm and do the vegetables, the produce and the meat and also offer vendors.\"\nCrafted Roots has featured 27 vendors at one time. The vendors sold different items from homemade goods and candles to 3D-printed items farm to table healthy food items and much more.\nAccording to Sophia Marron, when people come into the store and they see all of the hand-crafted items, they are fascinated.\nThe art and handcrafted items are the highlight, but for Marron, the importance of eating healthy farm to kitchen food is also key. A variety of healthy food options are available at the shop.\nMarron suffers from stomach issues, and per doctors orders she has to eat fresh and non processed foods. The importance of selling fresh farmed food is a key to help others.\n\"So, I think it with my stomach issues and stuff I found eating fresh and local, not sprayed, no pesticides, it's really beneficial to your health. So that's another reason why I wanted to open this as well to offer that to the community,\" Marron said.\nThe new location for Crafted Roots is expected to open next fall. The Ridgley location will close its doors on Oct. 25. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

A drizzly mist filled the air, obscuring vision in downtown.Inside the inn, two nationally renowned economic strategists gave an equally cloudy view of the economy for the last quarter of 2025 and 2026.\nThere are many mixed messages on the economy, said Meghan Shue, the chief investment strategist for Wilmington Trust, a division of M&T Bank, a sponsor of the event.\nThe 2 percent target for inflation in the United States has become \"increasingly elusive,\" said Anirban Basu, a leading economist based in Maryland.\nThe two offered their insights at the economic symposium breakfast sponsored by the Talbot County Chamber of Commerce, described by one financial executive as a \"must attend event\" for business owners and managers.\nShue and Basu ran through dozens of economic indicators and market trends, using them as evidence for their predictions. Their hazy outlook is based on mixed markets and uncertain and shifting regulations by the federal government.\nSince President Trump announced tariffs on April 8, markets have posted strong returns, especially in international stocks and gold, but the volatility could be seen when there was a significant drop in the markets Friday after Trump announced a 100% tariff on goods from China.\nAt the same time, the country's gross domestic product is strong and inflation does not seem to be a concern, Shue said, adding that if there is a recession the economy will \"bounce back quickly.\"\n\"Being diversified is really important,\" Shue said.\nShe said that domestic spending is weak. Half of the growth in domestic spending has come from artificial intelligence capital spending such as data center growth. Job growth has ground to a halt and there are 900,000 fewer jobs than there were last year. While there are not many layoffs in the economy, there is not much hiring either.\n\"The tariff headwinds have really done a number on business confidence,\" she said.\nStill corporate earnings so far this year have been good, and Shue predicts continued growth in the coming year.\n\"Companies have a remarkable ability to adapt to any situation,\" she said.\nShue sees the Fed continuing to cut interest rates — by as much as 75 basis points in 2026.\nBasu echoed Shue's concerns for mixed messages and shifting federal regulations, noting that markets are down this week as the trade war between the U.S. and China heats up.\n\"You are poorer now than when you woke up,\" he said.\nHis talk was salted with references to Denzel Washington movies that had the audience laughing.\nFederal regulations are adding to the clouded outlook. The Big Beautiful Bill passed in July will add an estimated $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade and deportations will result in higher prices.\nUnemployment rates are not astronomical, he said, but they are higher than they were last year.\nHe noted that grocery bills, which are rising, really capture Americans' attention. As a result of continued rising prices for consumer goods, Americans are drawing down on their personal savings, which is a big concern for economists.\nShue summed up her outlook, describing the current economic look as a Rorschach test. Different economists see different pictures in the economic inkblots. There are a lot of mixed messages, she said, which makes the economy subject to \"headline drift.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We could even see a handful of stations in places like Oklahoma, Texas, or even Wisconsin drop below $2 per gallon in the weeks ahead — something not seen since the pandemic. In addition, with wages up and gas prices down, Americans are spending the smallest share of their paycheck on gasoline in many years.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Economic strategists offer cloudy view ahead\n\n October 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JIM JOHNSON jjohnson@chespub.com | Section: Business \n \n 543\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The weather outside the Tidewater Inn Tuesday morning was gloomy. A drizzly mist filled the air, obscuring vision in downtown.Inside the inn, two nationally renowned economic strategists gave an equally cloudy view of the economy for the last quarter of 2025 and 2026.\nThere are many mixed messages on the economy, said Meghan Shue, the chief investment strategist for Wilmington Trust, a division of M&T Bank, a sponsor of the event.\nThe 2 percent target for inflation in the United States has become \"increasingly elusive,\" said Anirban Basu, a leading economist based in Maryland.\nThe two offered their insights at the economic symposium breakfast sponsored by the Talbot County Chamber of Commerce, described by one financial executive as a \"must attend event\" for business owners and managers.\nShue and Basu ran through dozens of economic indicators and market trends, using them as evidence for their predictions for future trends. That hazy outlook is based on mixed markets and uncertain and shifting regulations by the federal government.\nSince President Trump announced tariffs on April 8, markets have posted strong returns, especially in international stocks and gold, but the volatility could be seen when there was a significant drop in the markets Friday after Trump announced a 100% tariff on goods from China.\nAt the same time, the country's gross domestic product is strong and inflation does not seem to be a concern, Shue said, adding that if there is a recession the economy will \"bounce back quickly.\"\n\"Being diversified is really important,\" Shue said.\nShe said that domestic spending is weak. Half of the growth in domestic spending has come from artificial intelligence capital spending such as data center growth. Job growth has ground to a halt and there are 900,000 fewer jobs than there were last year. While there are not many layoffs in the economy, there is not much hiring either.\n\"The tariff headwinds have really done a number on business confidence,\" she said.\nStill corporate earnings so far this year have been good, and Shue predicts continued growth in the coming year.\n\"Companies have a remarkable ability to adapt to any situation,\" she said.\nShue sees the Fed continuing to cut interest rates — by as much as 75 basis points in 2026.\nBasu echoed Shue's concerns for mixed messages and shifting federal regulations, noting that markets are down this week as the trade war between the U.S. and China heats up.\n\"You are poorer now than when you woke up,\" he said.\nHis talk was salted with references to Denzel Washington movies that had the audience laughing.\nFederal regulations are adding to the clouded outlook. The Big Beautiful Bill passed in July will add an estimated $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade and deportations will result in higher prices.\nUnemployment rates are not astronomical, he said, but they are higher than they were last year.\nHe noted that grocery bills, which are rising, really capture Americans' attention. As a result of continued rising prices for consumer goods, Americans are drawing down on their personal savings, which is a big concern for economists.\nShue summed up her outlook, describing the current economic look as a Rorschach test. Different economists see different pictures in the economic inkblots. There are a lot of mixed messages, she said, which makes the economy subject to \"headline drift.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When we heard about this property, we said, 'How awesome would it be to have it all in one shop?' Before we knew it, we were signing the papers — and now here we are.\"\nInside, uplifting music plays and the air is filled with holiday scents. Shelves are lined with homemade purses, jewelry, wildlife art, paintings and seasonal items.\n\"It's all of our creativity that we put into the center week in and week out,\" Upp said.\nAmong the featured works are Foehrkolb's Baltimore screens, a traditional art form that began in 1913 and became a popular Maryland trend. The painted screens are part of her childhood, and she said she cherishes sharing them with the Eastern Shore community.\nElburn's carvings, hand-painted sculptures and woodwork reflect life on the Shore. His craftsmanship is also visible across the street, where his restoration work on \"Old Salt\" preserves the cherished Rock Hall landmark originally carved by local sculptor Jac Smolens.\n\"Elburn's exposure to the everyday activities of Rock Hall watermen influences his art,\" Upp noted.\nMeeks keeps the shop festive with wreaths, door swags and floral arrangements. \"She does just about everything,\" Upp said with a smile.\nHiggs offers homesteading items, herbs, oils, honey, soaps, sea salts, teas and other all-natural products.\nFor four-legged customers, Holland bakes all-natural dog treats called Smoochie Poochies.\nUpp, like Meeks, creates a bit of everything — from jewelry and handbags to charm bracelets, just in time for the holidays.\nHer jewelry draws inspiration from a Hawaiian luau party the center hosted Aug. 21, where guests picked a pearl from a shell to take home. Now, that same pearl jewelry, along with other pieces featuring quality gems and stones, is available at the shop.\nUpp also sells her own beeswax chapstick made with essential oils and offers something for kids — a chance to \"adopt\" their own dragon.\nCreated by a local 3D-print artist, the unhatched baby dragons come with an egg, wristband, miniature house and adoption certificate — \"because dragons need homes too,\" Upp said.\nThe Yellow Dragonfly showcases what Upp calls a \"fun, eclectic bunch\" of handmade goods.\n\"We offer unique, handmade items at affordable prices you won't find anywhere else,\" she said.\nDuring the ribbon cutting, Upp's granddaughter Addy had the honor of cutting the ribbon, followed by applause from the crowd.\n\"We're so excited to see the village popping back into life with a lot of activity,\" Walters said. \"It's a great addition to the community.\"\n\"Welcome, Yellow Dragonfly. We're so happy to have a good business here in this space,\" Resele added.\n\"On behalf of everyone, we are tickled to be here,\" Upp said, pleased with the turnout and strong sales throughout the evening.\nThe Yellow Dragonfly is located in the little yellow building at Rock Hall Village on Main Street. Fall hours are Friday, noon to 6 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Currently, 35 states have average gas prices below $2.99 per gallon, and GasBuddy even recorded the first $1.99 cash price at a station in Evans, Colorado, with stations in Oklahoma and Texas not far behind. Barring any major disruptions, gas prices are likely to remain slightly below year-ago levels and could stay under $3 for much of the next few months.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
