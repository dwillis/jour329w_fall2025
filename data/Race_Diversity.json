MICHAELS\n\n August 4, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 5 | Section: News \n \n 810\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS - Regina Hartfield found a community to share her passion for being on the water through the Universal Sailing Club, the Baltimore-based organization that has sought to create connections, encourage fellowship and spread knowledge among Black sailors within the Chesapeake Bay region for more than two decades.To Hartfield, it was a natural fit for a club doing so much to nurture the present and future of Black sailing to take time to honor the past. The Eastern Shore resident organized the first Souls at Sea on-water remembrance and libation ceremony in 2013 to acknowledge the millions of captive Africans who perished during the transatlantic crossing known as the Middle Passage.\"I conceived of Souls at Sea because of the freedom that we have to make choices about being on the water and being in boats and owning boats and sailing around the world wherever we want to go,\" Hartfield said. \"Our ancestors did not have that choice, did not have that freedom when they were enslaved and traveled here in ships along the Middle Passage.\"There are so many souls who were lost along the way, and this just acknowledges them and lets them know that, 'On this day at this time with these people that are present, we acknowledge and remember you,'\" Hartfield said.For its 10th anniversary, Universal Sailing Club is bringing Souls at Sea to the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum for the first time.At 1 p.m. on Saturday, Aug. 19, CBMM general admission guests are invited to join the landbased portion of the ceremony, which will be held on campus along Fogg's Cove adjacent to the Van Lennep Auditorium.This piece of the annual remembrance ritual features a blessing of the captains and boats and a performance from African drum, dance and song troupe Xaala Mainama.Representatives from the National African American Quilt Guild will present a special quilt commemorating Souls at Sea's 10th anniversary. Guests will then send off the vessels as they depart for the ceremony on the water in the Miles River.This event is funded through CBMM's Regional Folklife Center under the Maryland Traditions program of the Maryland State Arts Council.\"I think it is incredible that we are able to partner with CBMM on our 10th anniversary,\" Hartfield said. \"We're always excited to share this ceremony beyond our club. Any time we're in a public setting, we embrace anyone who is interested in finding out more and learning exactly what we're doing. Through this collaboration, we hope for the word to go out even farther than ever before.\" The Universal Sailing Club was founded by Black sailors Marcus Asante and Michael Campbell in 2001, and a few years later, Hartfield joined the group.With the support of her fellow members, Hartfield planned the first Souls at Sea in 2013, and since that inaugural event in Baltimore, it's become an annual tradition for the club as a remembrance and libation ceremony modeled on African traditions with a unique Chesapeake flair.\"There are many wonderful commemorations that include libation ceremonies that take place on the land,\" Hartfield said.\"Ours, I like to think, picks up from there.\" Following the on-land portion of the Souls at Sea ceremony, the club members sail to a pre-determined spot and raft up before the ceremony resumes. There, they come together in prayer to acknowledge both their ancestors and the deities of the water and engage in a traditional libation ceremony, which is a ritual pouring of water as an offering to the lost souls.According to a CBMM announcement, the powerful scene is all about acknowledging the estimated two million-plus enslaved Africans who died making the voyage to the Americas over the roughly 350 years of the transatlantic human trade.\"What's special is whether it's on-land or on-water, we all are experiencing aspects of the ceremony together,\" Hartfield said. \"The conversation, the drumming, the dancing, the acknowledgement of ancestors, the blessings - we're all experiencing that as a group, but each one of us is experiencing it individually and connecting with it in our own special way.\" Over the past decade, Souls at Sea has made stops across the Chesapeake Bay watershed, including visits to Annapolis and Cambridge.This year, the ceremony comes to CBMM and the Miles River for the first time, bringing with it a rare opportunity to connect with the past.\"I can't believe that it's been 10 years,\" Hartfield said. \"I remember getting to the three-year milestone and thinking that was amazing. Now getting to the 10-year mark is incredible. I am humbled that we are this point, and people are still excited to come out and do this year after year.\" \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nIn partnership with the Universal Sailing Club, Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum is hosting the 10th annual Souls at Sea ceremony on Aug. 19, starting at 1 p.m. Drawing on African traditions, this is an on-water remembrance and libation ceremony honoring ancestors lost during the Middle Passage. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Salary gender gap needs to be counted, tracked\n\n August 15, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 585\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Everyone knows that men make more money than women do. The wage gap, it's called. What to do about it is the issue.In New Zealand, they're trying something new.Counting. And reporting.According to Minister for Women Jan Tinetti, new legislation will require businesses with more than 250 employees to report their gender pay gaps in order to encourage greater equity in the workplace.Some 900 companies will be subject to the new reporting requirement, which will eventually be extended to as many as 2,700 firms employing more than 100 workers.\"Change is needed,\" she said. \"Requiring companies to publish their gender pay gap will encourage them to address the drivers of those gaps and increase transparency for workers.\" New Zealand, far from perfect, has done better in this regard than we have.According to Bloomberg, New Zealand has reduced the gender pay gap in the public sector to a record-low 7.7%; in that sector, half the senior management jobs are held by women.In the private sector, where some 200 companies voluntarily report, the gap was 9.2% in 2022. Tinetti explained that other nations such as Australia, Canada and the U.K. have gender pay gap reporting in place and that the move to require such reporting in New Zealand \"is part of the government's ongoing commitment to make New Zealand an equitable and desirable place for people to live, work and do business.\" Here in the United States, by contrast, stagnation is the rule. Women earned 20.3% less than men in 2019. By 2022, the gap widened to 22.2%. The regression-adjusted wage gap, which has been stagnant for two decades, actually widened a little bit, from 22.6% to 22.9%, driven by men's higher wages, especially at the top of the wage distribution.Among workers, women are more likely to graduate college than men and are more likely to receive a graduate degree than men - but they are paid less than men at every educational level. And the wage gap increases with educational achievement.Black and Hispanic women are paid the least; for them, the wage gap is biggest, by far.The swift progress of the '80s and '90s in closing the wage gap has slowed to a crawl. Minimum wage sets a floor so the gap is smallest at the bottom, but as wages increase, so does the gap.Economists point to a number of factors including job segregation, the devaluation of \"women's work,\" societal norms and discrimination. Is it really such a mystery?In mid-career, women balance children and family. Help them with that balance and women will soar. Penalize them for it and they will not soar. Treat all women as mothers and you will find that even the women who are not mothers will not soar.This is not rocket science.Women reaching for the top need support and encouragement. As you get to the top, discrimination becomes far more subtle and subjective. It is no longer a matter of an objective test.It turns on the subtleties of who is comfortable with whom, of the inherent biases that lead people to duplicate themselves in choosing the most qualified.That's where keeping track comes in. It's the least we can do. Counting. It forces us to take a second look. Ask a second time.Is this really the best we can do? What's wrong with this pictureft Because, as they have recognized in New Zealand, where the picture is better, there is still something very wrong with the picture of a gender wage gap in place.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "African American museum celebrates March on Washington anniversary\n\n August 24, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 722\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture invites visitors to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington by experiencing Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream Speech\" on view for a limited time through Sept.18 in the \"Defending Freedom, Defining Freedom\" gallery.The museum also offers three compelling exhibitions: \"Defending Freedom, Defining Freedom: The Era of Segregation 1876-1968,\" \"Making a Way Out of No Way\" and \"A Changing America\" that shares the story about the March on Washington. More information about the March on Washington is available on the museum's website at https://nmaahc. si.edu/explore/stories/historical-legacy-march-washington.\"At the National Museum of African American History and Culture, sited at the foot of the Washington Monument, the meaning and purpose of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom persist today,\" said Kevin Young, the Andrew W. Mellon director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture. \"The words of all its speakers resonate six decades later, and we serve as witnesses to the bravery and dedication of its organizers.To be able to show visitors the copy of the 'I Have a Dream' speech King read and improvised from while at the podium is an honor and privilege.\" On Aug. 28, 1963, a crowd of a quarter-million people came together on the National Mall with a shared purpose of striving for social justice, the end of segregation, fair wages, economic opportunities and the rights of full citizenship. Many historians credit the march for pressuring the Kennedy administration to act on civil rights, eventually leading to the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.The momentous day concluded with King delivering his iconic \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial.The March on Washington took place exactly 100 years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which proclaimed the freedom of enslaved people in rebellious states. But full freedom had not been achieved a century later.The murder of 14-yearold Emmett Till while visiting relatives in Mississippi Aug. 28, 1955, and his killers' acquittal served as reminders of second-class citizenship.Till's death served as a catalyst, igniting the Civil Rights Movement and its fight for racial equality.Officially known as the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, this demonstration was made possible through the collaborative efforts of civil rights leaders such as Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, John Lewis, A. Philip Randolph, and King, among others. Organizations including the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Congress of Racial Equality, Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People joined forces to address critical political, social and economic issues African Americans experienced at that time, including racial violence, segregated housing and schools, labor exploitation, and unemployment.Women played a vital role in organizing the march despite being mostly excluded from the official program. They did not accept their exclusion quietly, however. Individuals like Anna Arnold Hedgeman of the National Council of Churches strategized with others and convinced Wilkins to include a female speaker. Only one woman spoke: Daisy Bates, NAACP chapter president and an advisor to the Little Rock Nine. Activist and entertainer Lena Horne yelled a single word into the microphone: \"Freedom.\" The March on Washington remains a significant event in American history and resonates with people regardless of their race, nationality, religion and political affiliation. While the march demanded equal rights and human dignity, it is important to acknowledge that some issues of inequality still persist for women and people of color today.About the National Museum of African American History and Culture Since opening Sept. 24, 2016, the National Museum of African American History and Culture has welcomed more than 9 million visitors. Occupying a prominent location next to the Washington Monument on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., the nearly 400,000-square-foot museum is the nation's largest and most comprehensive cultural destination devoted exclusively to exploring, documenting, and showcasing the African American story and its impact on American and world history.For more information about the museum, visit nmaahc.si.edu, follow@NMAAHC on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram or call Smithsonian information at 202-633-1000 \n \n Caption: SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION\n \nThe March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on Aug.\n \n28, 1963, is shown in this photograph from the collection of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, a gift of Kitty Kelley and the Estate of Stanley Tretick. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A visit to a foreign country - the past\n\n September 1, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: George F. Will | Page: A7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 745\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - This nation is awash with heated and ungenerous judgments about its past and about Americans who lived before we ascended to today's sunny uplands of enlightenment.So, for your final summer read, try something tonally different: Drew Gilpin Faust's memoir \"Necessary Trouble: Growing Up at Midcentury.\" It concerns not her presidency of Harvard from 2007 to 2018 but her coming of age in the 1950s and 1960s.She was a high-octane student activist, involved in dangerous civil rights campaigning in the Deep South before becoming hyper-active in agitating against U.S. involvement in Vietnam.She is, however, an accomplished historian, and her book is most interesting, and needed, as a mellow, humane acceptance of an enduring truth from a forgotten novel (by L.P. Hartley): \"The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.\" Faust has gone back to a foreign country - America when post-1945 conventions and complacencies began to crumble - and has returned with a needed gift for today's nation: an example of mature assessment.Faust was born into a prosperous family in the caste system of segregated Virginia, a society thick with \"rules and roles\" governing - actually, suffocating - young white women and all Black people. They were entrapped, in not altogether dissimilar ways, in the viscosity of a society defined by strict racial and gender expectations that were unarticulated because they were unquestioned.Six decades ago, two braided emancipations began, the emancipation of women, and of Blacks nearly a century after the Emancipation Proclamation.Faust's family rode to hounds and sent children north to tony prep schools and universities. But from an early age, Faust was intelligent, opinionated, inexhaustibly curious, a voracious reader - and disconcerting to her determinedly conventional mother.A high school counselor would write of \"Mrs. Gilpin's bewilderment in connection with Drewdie's intellectual gifts.\" Drew's mother \"is like a hen that has hatched a duckling and cannot understand having a daughter who is not going to be a 'Southern belle.'\" Faust would not be - as that era expressed its aspiration - \"well-adjusted.\" Least of all adjusted to a society in which the chivalric protection of women was, Faust writes, \"inextricably tied to concessions of frailty and incapacity.\" Young Drew was immersed \"in a man's world and a white world.\" She sensed the connection and set about causing what John Lewis, the civil rights leader and congressman, called \"necessary trouble.\" In the decade when Black author Ralph Ellison published his great novel \"Invisible Man\" (1952), Life magazine reflected national perceptions and assumptions.\"With the exception of a butler serving a drink on a silver tray,\" everyone pictured in Life's 1950s advertisements was White, and working women - other than in Hollywood - also were mostly invisible.Faust relished rock music, which was saturated with sexuality - Pat Boone and Frankie Avalon elbowed aside by Elvis and Little Richard - but books were most catalyzing.The 36 volumes published before 1960 about an independent and resourceful 16-year-old, Nancy Drew, were formative also for Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Nancy Pelosi, Sandra Day O'Connor and others.Faust \"had never, at least as far as I knew, met a Jewish person\" when she met, through a diary, an adolescent who was \"an avid reader and aspiring writer,\" Anne Frank.Scout, the 8-year-old daughter of Atticus Finch in \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" exemplified for Faust children \"seeing clearly.\" Faust writes, \"These girls who dared - Nancy, Anne, Scout - were daring me.\" So, she went to Mississippi in 1964 for Freedom Summer, to Selma and Birmingham in 1965, this daughter whose father's car once had a hood ornament of Robert E. Lee mounted on Traveller.Faust, an academic who perhaps has not spent enough time around people who disagree with her about important matters, is uncharacteristically intemperate when she denigrates Vice President Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic 1968 presidential nominee, as a \"toady\" because he did not \"speak out\" against the war.Faust was 10 months old when Humphrey, the 37-year-old mayor of Minneapolis, successfully provoked the Democrats' 1948 national convention to put a civil rights plank in the party's platform.By challenging the upholders of Jim Crow - Southern Democratic governors and legislators - Humphrey ignited necessary trouble, which Faust would later join.Faust usually judges the past without rancor, contempt or preening, giving empathetic depictions of social contexts inherited by the people who inhabited them.When, generations hence, historians judge how we inhabited our context, they will be depicting the foreign country to which we then will be confined: the past.Reach George Will at georgewill@washpost.com. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nDrew Faust clasps hands with a graduate as she walks in the procession at Harvard's commencement ceremony in 2013 where she was university president. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The UN group estimates 52% of the refugees living in Bangladesh's largest camps are children.Humanitarian groups have outline stories of young children (some aged 10 or 11 or even younger) who are orphaned and trying to survive in Bangladeshi refugees camps. The sprawling camps have seen fires, sexual violence and have been hit by typhoons and other climate change-fueled storms.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken marked the Aug. 25 anniversary of the start of persecutions in 2017 against mostly Muslim ethnic groups in Buddhist-majority Myanmar The U.S. and human rights groups deemed the persecutions - which stems from a 1982 Burmese law that says Rohingyas are not citizens of the southeastern Asian country - as a genocide and ethnic cleansing.Blinken said in a statement that the U.S. wants \"accountability for the atrocities committed by the Burma military\" and voiced concerns about continued internal strife and fighting within Myanmar between government and opposition forces as making an already rough humanitarian situation even worse.\"The United States has provided over $2.1 billion to assist those affected by the crisis in Burma, Bangladesh, and elsewhere in the region since 2017, remaining the leading single largest donor of life-saving humanitarian assistance to those whose lives have been upended by the violence.The escalation of violence throughout the country has exacerbated the dire humanitarian situation, particularly for members of ethnic and religious minority communities, including Rohingya,\" Blinken said.The U.S. and other countries have imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar and visa restrictions on government and military officials deemed responsible for the persecutions of Rohingya peoples as well as other religious minorities and pro-democracy dissidents.Those include restrictions on supplying jet fuel to the Burmese government and military as well as prohibitions on doing business with state-controlled banks and financial institutions after a military coup took full control of Myanmar in 2021.But the UNHCR has voiced concerns about conditions at the refugees camps - including food supplies and the rise of sexual violence and trafficking of women and children - amid drops in international financial support.\"In Bangladesh, funding shortfalls are already adversely affecting the wellbeing of nearly one million Rohingya refugees.Any further cuts to the Rohingya response will severely impact access to food, shelter materials, cooking fuels, sanitation facilities, and livelihood activities,\" said UNHCR in a statement last month.A recent call for $876 million in new investment in helping the Burmese refugees is falling short, the UN says/\"The Rohingya response is facing a severe funding crisis, illustrated by two recent cuts in food assistance.There is an urgent need to invest in collective efforts to allow Rohingya to become self-reliant as they cannot, and do not wish to, remain dependent on humanitarian aid,\" said UNHCR Representative in Bangladesh Johannes van der Klaauw in a statement last month.The U.S. announced a $74 million humanitarian assistance package for Bangladesh including $61 million for refugees from Burma.By comparison, Blinken was in Kyiv Wednesday, Sept. 8, where he was slated to announce another $1 billion in U.S. military aid to Ukraine in it was against invading Russian forces. The U.S. has sent $75 billion in military, intelligence, technology and humanitarian aid to Ukraine and President Joe Biden is seeking another $24 billion from Congress. \n \n Caption: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/CREATIVE COMMONS/CAPTAIN RAJU\n \nA young girl at a Rohingya refugee camp in Ukhia, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh.

One colleague made a thoughtless comment about how both mine and the other colleague's nails were \"a little too ghetto\" for her. The problem is that the woman who made that comment is white, and the other colleague and I are Black. While I knew she was joking, the joke didn't go over too well with the other colleague.I have a closer relationship with the woman who made the joke, so I feel the need to fix this situation before the other colleague complains to the higher-ups.How do I fix the situation without getting the white colleague fired? - Bad Joke DEAR BAD JOKE: That joke was definitely in poor taste. Speak to the offender and let her know she crossed a line when she made that comment.Explain that calling something \"ghetto\" is inappropriate and has no place at work.Suggest to her that she apologize to your other colleague, admitting that she made a mistake and did not mean to offend either of you. People make mistakes. It's how they handle the aftermath that is essential. In this case, the offender has an opportunity to learn and correct her microaggression. But she needs to understand that it was wrong. Otherwise, it will just be lip service.You can make your recommendation to her, but don't defend her. She was wrong.Harriette Cole is a lifestylist and founder of DreamLeapers, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

    "content": "Federalsburg elects first two Black council members in historic election\n\n September 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones And Tom Mccall; tmccall@chespub.com, njones@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 814\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n FEDERALSBURG - Just under 300 voters braved a gray and drizzly Tuesday to cast their ballots in Federalsburg's bicentennial election, making history in electing two Black women to the town council.While the election falling during the bicentennial year is special on its own, the day was historic for a different reason - it was the first election held under the town's recently passed election plan, and it was the first time a Black resident had been elected to the town council in the town's 200-year history.According to Kristy Marshall, Federalsburg's interim town manager, 283 residents voted in Tuesday's election, accounting for 17% of the town's registered voters.The mayoral seat and all four council seats - two council members for each newly created district - were up for election.Incumbent Mayor Kimberly Abner held her position at the helm of the town, earning 191 votes and a five-year term as mayor. Jeffrey Stevenson, Jr., a first-time candidate, received 83 votes.In the newly created District 1, which has a majority Black population, representation was achieved for Black residents with the election of two Black women to the council seats.Darlene Hammond received the highest number of ballots, earning 70 votes and a five-year term on the town council.Brandy James received 52 votes, earning a three-year term on the council.James held a narrow lead over incumbent councilman Scott Phillips, who received 49 votes.In District 2, only two candidates - Debra Sewell and H. Torbert \"Toby\" Williamson - ran for the two open council spots, locking in their seats on the council even before the election.Sewell received 135 votes, earning a five-year term. Williamson received 90 votes and a three-year council term.The new election plan, passed in June, changed the town's former at-large, staggered term election system to a two-district system that ensured more representation of Federalsburg's Black residents.No Black resident had ever been elected as a mayor or council member in the town's 200-year history until Tuesday's election.The change was spurred by a federal lawsuit filed earlier this year, which contended that the former election system discriminated against Black voters by keeping them from being able to elect their chosen representatives.Abner, who has served as Federalsburg's mayor since 2019, faced a challenge from Stevenson, a lifelong town resident who hoped to bring change, leadership and caring for the future of the community.To Abner, time already served as an elected official mattered.\"People look at experience and pay attention,\" she said.Paying the town's debt, fixing pump stations and paving roads are also among Abner's priorities.When asked why he was running, Stevenson gave a simple answer: \"If not me, then who?\" \"Man, I always felt like I was a leader, and I was always willing to take the chances that everybody else won't take,\" he said.\"I'm getting older now, so I've had interest in politics because it matters to me now - I pay taxes, I'm invested in the city - so it's like the things that I wasn't concerned about as a child, as a man coming of age.\"For Stevenson, getting Federalsburg out of debt and bringing revenue to the city through encouraging new businesses to fill existing vacancies are two significant things he aimed to fix if elected.For James, a 25-year Federalsburg resident and first-time candidate, choosing to step up and run for one of the District 1 council seats came from a simple question she asked herself, \"Why not?\" \"It was more so like, 'Will I be here for another 25 years and just continue to complain and nag about things that need to be done, or will I be that person that tries to be a part of the change - you know, be the change you want to see,\" she said.To James, changing the town's level of transparency with residents is a major factor, especially when it comes to ensuring that the community knows what the town is doing, whether it's a municipal election or roadwork.\"I want to make sure that the information that is conveyed is information that is understood by anybody on any education level, like you shouldn't have to have a master's or doctorate degree to understand what they're talking about,\" she said. \"I just want to make sure that it's plain and simple and understood.\"On a similar note, James said the town should publish relevant information in both Spanish and Creole to serve Federalsburg's Hispanic and Haitian populations.For Federalsburg's Black residents, the first election under the new plan is one they've long been waiting for.\"I appreciate everybody that (would) listen to me, that listened to my cry, and took interest in doing what they've done to get this,\" said Roberta Butler.\"It took a while, it took awhile - can you imagine, 200 years? That's a long time.\" \n \n Caption: Federalsburg Mayor Kim Abner, left, poses for a photo with incumbent Councilwoman Debra Sewell, who ran in District 2 to preserve her seat.\n \nFederalsburg resident Roberta Butler spoke of the election in biblical terms.

Regional Office, said.Weisel noted that from what the ADL has seen so far in 2023, this year has the potential to be another record year.The audit categorizes antisemitic incidents as harassment, vandalism or assault and found that 2022 had about a third more incidents than the previous year, with just over 3,500 incidents reported.The majority of these antisemitic incidents have taken place in Jewish institutions like synagogues, schools and Jewish community centers, according to Weisel.\"The data confirms what Jewish communities have been saying first-hand across the country,\" Weisel said. \"This corresponds with a notable rise in antisemitic attitudes.\"Antisemitic conversations that had previously taken place on social media platforms are now transitioning into real world interactions in public spaces, Weisel added.The largest percentage of reported incidents appear in the form of harassment, according to the audit data, and harassment incidents have steadily increased each year for the past four years.\"The concern with this data is that the normalization of harassment has the potential to lead to even more incidents of assault,\" Weisel said. Assault saw a 26% increase from 2021.The data also shows increasing rates of vandalism.\"We are seeing a lot of instances of graffiti, whether it's a swastika in a school, carved on a desk, or outside in a shopping center somewhere,\" Weisel said. \"We are also seeing a lot of white supremacist propaganda in particular - which includes flyers blaming the Jewish community for a variety of things - that are being left on people's driveways.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's about antisemitism.\" \"It's not just about the Israelis,\" Hyman said.\"There are innocent people on both sides who suffer the consequences of all this stuff. It's painful, and it's hurtful.\" \"You know, my relationship with the local leaders of the Muslim community, I'm proud of,\" Hyman said. \"I like them a lot.They're good guys. We share experiences in many ways, historical and religious.\" Hanging on the wall in Hyman's office is a Muslim prayer rug featuring the 99 names of God. \"It's so beautiful, and I've always taken great pride in having that for a lot of reasons.\" Hyman also has long been involved with Boy Scouts organizations internationally, developing friendships across the Middle East.Hyman said Israel has \"a right to defend itself, as it should, and again, this goes beyond politics.This goes directly to antisemitism.It's heartbreaking.\" \"You're dealing with an organization that doesn't particularly have any sensitivity for life,\" he said. The organization, \"Hamas, definitely, have an agenda, but it's more than a political agenda.\" Saturday was an unsettling reminder of Hyman's stay in Israel 50 years before when, as a rabbinical student in 1973, he experienced the Yom Kippur War firsthand in Jerusalem.The morning after witnessing Israeli fighter jets fly low over the city, he and fellow students attended services.\"We go outside, and we're sitting on the steps to the Hebrew Union College which is right on King David Street,\" he said.\"And we notice that all the cars that are speeding by are filled with men and some women in army uniforms. And we're looking at each other going, 'Well that's interesting,'\" he said. \"The air raid sirens in Jerusalem went off, and when the sirens go off in Israel, it's not a test - it meant Israel's airspace was breached. That started the war, and the rest is history.\" The U.S. State Department defines antisemitism as \"a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\" According to a Sept. 11 Associated Press story, \"A network of Jewish security experts and religious leaders hosted several webinars to help prepare\" for the High Holidays, encompassing Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur \"as antisemitism surges.\" \"The High Holidays are about renewal - about trying to build a better world,\" said Rabbi Noah Farkas, president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles.\"But we can't do that without a security regimen that makes people comfortable to go to synagogue,\" the AP story stated.Hyman believes the attack was timed to coincide with Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, and the holiest day in Judaism.Hyman's friend, the Rev. James Nash is pastor of Sts. Peter and Paul Catholic Church, located across Easton Parkway from the synagogue.\"I just spoke to Father Nash,\" Hyman said. \"He just came back from a trip to Israel. He had another one planned for the springtime. And I was planning a trip to Israel in the spring as well.(The war) is going to impact that sort of thing.\" Nash said he was surprised to hear about the attack.\"When we were there, we felt safe. I'm not seeing everything, but people seemed to be getting along,\" Nash said. \"We would be in these restaurants, and there were Muslims there and Jewish people there. But that's just a tourist's view. Maybe we don't know the whole thing, but I was floored when I heard (about the attack.\" \"This has just got to be something that is just so, so difficult for Rabbi,\" Nash said. \"The rabbi is, first of all, a brilliant man.But second, he's worked so hard in the community. Whenever there's been some type of tragedy, he works hard to bring people together. He certainly is a man of peace.\" The Christian community needs to pray for their Jewish neighbors and the people of Israel, Nash said, but \"prayer has got to be followed by action.\" \"Whenever we hear antisemitic remarks, we need to respond to them immediately - not in a mean or hateful way, but calling people to task. As Rabbi was saying, there certainly seems to be a lot more antisemitism, and maybe it was always there. But now we hear it,\" Nash said.\"We need to make sure that we don't allow that kind of conversation to occur, where we're making antisemitic remarks and thinking that's all OK, just like any kind of derogatory remark about anybody is inappropriate,\" he said.\"Antisemitism is still upsetting and perplexing and I don't know how to fix it,\" Hyman said.\"When does it stop? That's the question: When does it stop?\" he said.As if to offer a solution, he told \"a great rabbinic story.\" \"This young rabbi is ordained, and he figures he's going to go out and change the world. So he tries and he realizes that the world is too big a place. So he says, 'I'll try to change the country in which I live,' and then he discovers that the country is too big, and he can't change the country. And he says, \"'I'll try and change my community,' but that turned out to be too big. And now that he's on his deathbed, he realizes if he had tried to change himself, he might have changed the world. That's always been a guiding story for me,\" Hyman said. \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT/\n \nHaving just returned from Israel in November 2018, the Rev. James Nash of Sts.

Browning, of Texas, who helped with the petition calling for Draper's admission.\"But by granting posthumous bar admission to Edward Garrison Draper, this court places itself and places Maryland in the vanguard of restorative justice and demonstrates conclusively that justice delayed may not be justice denied.\" Maryland Supreme Court Justice Shirley M. Watts said it was the state's first posthumous admission to the bar. People \"can only imagine\" what Draper might have contributed to the legal profession and called the overdue admission an indication of \"just how far our society and the legal profession have come.\" Judge Z. Collins Lee, who evaluated Draper in 1857, wrote that the Dartmouth graduate was \"most intelligent and well informed\" and would be qualified \"if he was a free white Citizen of this State,\" according to a transcription in a petition for the posthumous bar admission. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This 156th Nace Hopkins Day was to celebrate the freedom that Nace brought to light.The event dates back to 1867, when Hopkins, a formerly enslaved Union veteran of the Civil War, obtained permission from the Town of Trappe to celebrate the 1863 signing of the Emancipation Proclamation, which outlawed slavery in the United States.As time passed, the celebration came to be called \"Nace's Day.\" Hopkins was instrumental in the building of the first \"colored schoolhouse\" and in obtaining the permission to build a county road to Money Make Road. He was a founding member of Scotts United Methodist Church.\"He was my great great grandfather,\" said Chase. \"I met his grandson. His grandson was my grandfather. It was my mother's father. I got this uniform in Baltimore. My nephew got it. I was always wearing an Abraham Lincoln hat and dress. It is hot though.\" \"He was a slave. When he came out of slavery, he started the first Black church in Trappe and the first Black school. Where the graveyard is at, right across from the traffic light, that is where the school was. They called it the colored school,\" said Chase.Tywanda Griffin, Chase's niece, walked right next to Chase in the parade. She played Caroline, who was Nace's wife, and was dressed all in black, carrying a black leather bible.Griffin and Chase were followed by dozens of parade participants.\"We started planning this a year ago,\" said Eunice Roberts, a Nace's Day Committee member. \"Our goal was to have the best parade possible.We wanted good fellowship to all and to make sure we get Uncle Nace's name out there. We had 32 groups in the parade.\" The sounds of Stevie Wonder's classic \"Sir Duke\" filled the air as a full marching band came down Trappe's Main Street. There were drums and horns and glockenspiel working together.Tehara Wilson, Cassandra Cornish and Robin Watson were elevated on a podium at the end of the parade route.In front of them, dancing crews kicked skyward, muscle cars revved their engines, and the marching bands made their choreography come true. It was a celebration of freedom.The parade ended at Scott's United Methodist Church, where rows and rows of families, old and young, came out to see their neighbors march by. Kids ran into the parade route to get candy. There was a bouncy house, lots of food and a DJ.It was a great way to remember Nace Hopkins, organizers said. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nDavid Chase holds a sword and plays his great, great grandfather Nathaniel \"Nace\" Hopkins in the Nace's Day Parade.

    "content": "Controversy arises over new Frederick Douglass mural in Easton\n\n November 22, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 2 | Section: News \n \n 851\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Some county residents and descendants of Frederick Douglass are raising concerns about the appropriateness of a new mural depicting the famous local abolitionist along a prominent street in Easton.\"Liberty,\" a 21-foot-tall and 16-foot-wide mural by artist Adam Himoff, was unveiled earlier this month.The prominent artwork, featured in the alley next to Out of the Fire, portrays a modern version of Douglass, who is shown squatting down and wearing Converse All-Stars and a large wristwatch.The mural was commissioned by the Dock Street Foundation, members of which had seen the artwork and wanted to bring it to Easton.However, some local Black residents, including one of Douglass' descendants, spoke out at the Easton Town Council meeting Monday evening, raising concerns with how Douglass was represented and the mural's placement in a highly visible location, while others voiced upset about not being given a voice in the rendering.Moonyene Jackson, a former town council member and member of Fred's Army, an organization that worked to bring a Douglass monument in Easton, said those who applied for permission to erect the mural should have had the courtesy to reach out to residents who had worked to bring recognition of the African-American experience to the area.\"It's a real insult that people want to talk about my heritage and not consult me(and) the wider community,\" she said, adding that she wished there was an opportunity for herself and others to share their perspectives.Jackson also questioned the Historic District Commission's decision to approve the mural in its current location, asking the council for support in waiving fees to appeal the board's decision.\"There's a way we want to be portrayed - and this is not about the art or the artist - the art itself is wonderful, but it doesn't belong on the public building, in the public square, in the historic district,\" she said. \"That's the issue.\" Council President Frank Gunsallus briefly chimed in to clarify the building was private property and the art was funded by private donations, though the art's installation was approved by the Historic District Commission.Tarence Bailey, Sr., Douglass' five-time great-nephew, said when one of his older family members found out about the mural, he called Bailey, asking, \"Why is Uncle Frederick on that wall looking like a thug?\" \"That picture does not look like the ambassador to Haiti. It does not look like the Recorder of Deeds.It does not look like a U.S.Marshal. (It) does not look like the man who sat with Abraham Lincoln and convinced him to let Blacks fight for their own freedom in the 54th Massachusetts,\" he said. \"That doesn't represent that.\" Bailey added that even though Douglass is in the public domain, he's a family name in Talbot County. The family was not given a heads up or approached about the mural ahead of time, he said later.\"When stuff like that is done, just because you can - 'Oh, he's in the public domain, he belongs to everybody - well, he does, but these things have to be done with tact, taste and respect. He has family here,\" he said.Pamela Gates, who grew up in the 1950s and early 60s, said she wanted children of today to understand that they were to stand up, not stoop, for their beliefs.\"We witnessed the struggle and we saw the accomplishment, and I think that this particular picture, in the context which it is presented in Easton, is not encouraging or is not something we want our children to see,\" she said, later adding: \"Someone said we are not judged by the content of our character, and that character there - I don't want Frederick Douglass judged by that content.\" Easton resident John Mann countered some of the arguments made, pointing out that the Historic District Commission did not deal with content, only town guidelines.Regulating content that private citizens place on their property becomes a First Amendment issue, he said, and that could tread into \"dangerous territory.\" In an emailed statement, Himoff, who watched the testimony shared during Monday's council meeting, said he appreciated those who were inspired by the work, but he had also learned \"enormously\" from those who don't like or feel comfortable with the image.\"I think we can agree that there is so much work and healing left to be done. Should we keep our historical heroes frozen in time or should we explore their place in our current eraft I think the conversation is worth having,\" he said in the statement.At the close of the meeting, several council members thanked those who spoke up to share their perspectives.Speaking to the community as a whole, Ward 4 Councilman Rev. Elmer Davis Jr. said his own life had been threatened over the portrait, which he did not have involvement with as a council member. Still, he assured those who spoke, saying they had been heard. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nThis public art installation is 21-feet tall and 16-feet wide and depicts Frederick Douglass as if he was living in modern times.\n \nCOURTESY TOWN OF EASTON\n \nTarence Bailey Sr., a descendant of Frederick Douglass, speaks out against a new mural depicting Douglass during an Easton Town Council meeting Monday, Nov. 20. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Vicki Wilson, secretary of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society, introduced Bernier.\"Celeste is the Professor and Chair of United States and Atlantic Studies at University Edinburgh in Scotland,\" Wilson said. \"She is an author and world-renowned historian.\"Anna Murray was born free in Denton.Early in her relationship with Frederick Douglass, who was enslaved when Anna was free, she gave him all of her savings to run away to his freedom. He refused.When she told him she loved him and that he could return the money later, he finally agreed. He escaped and eventually returned the money. They got married in New York City in 1838.\"She lived her life by the conviction that her home was the council chamber of the free,\" said Bernier. Anna, working as an agent of the Underground Railroad, fed hundreds of people, day or night.She worked with Harriet Tubman on the Eastern Shore, said Bernier.In his writings, Frederick Douglass relates a story about a woman from Easton, who came to them for help.\"This poor woman's back and shoulders had been literally hacked to pieces,\" he said. \"Three months ago, her cheek was branded with burning irons. We sat with her, and all she said was 'I want to get to Canada.'\" Bernier, working from original source documents, delivered a lecture on Murray-Douglass with descriptions like, \"freedom fighter,\" \"revolutionary liberator\" and \"human rights philosopher.\"Anna did not just sit in her kitchen baking biscuits.According to Bernier, Anna was an expert cook and could whip up everything from dishes from the African diaspora to European styles of cuisine. There were a lot of hungry people to feed, and at times she had to ask her own family to sacrifice food and a warm bed for someone else.She was interested in how fashion could reflect a person's wholeness. She designed a silk plum colored wedding dress for herself in 1830 in New York City. Anna worked tirelessly to help newly emancipated slaves by feeding them and giving them dignified clothes.Anna knew the power of printing and publishing her own story. This control of her own representation was crucial. Her descendants knew this too and wrote to make the abolitionist cause manifest.Bernier called Anna an \"egalitarian human rights philosopher.\" And she raised her five children to carry on this fight against white supremacy.\"They took that intergenerational pain, that intergenerational trauma, that inter-generations suffering, and they turned it into intergenerational liberation, intergenerational activism and a blueprint for what a world based on equal human rights would actually look like,\" Bernier said.Bernier said it is hard to estimate how many slaves Anna set free. One estimate is 1,200, but Bernier wonders if it is much higher.The historian painted a picture of Anna as Frederick's equal and protector.She said Frederick had a way with words, and Anna had a way with numbers.Anna was always on the move to avoid persecution and to keep her husband safe, but the cause of liberty echoed loudly in the Douglass' homes. Their final home was on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. They bought it with her money.When Anna dies in 1882, 3,000 people attended her funeral.After Bernier's lecture, there was time for questions and mingling with coffee.The historian signed copies of her book \"If I Survive,\" which was also authored by Andrew Taylor.Bernier opened her laptop to share images of the Douglass family with some of the abolitionists' living relatives, who came to the lecture.One descendent, Thelma Nichols of Denton, is a spry 97. She shared stories that her father had told her.\"It is exciting to know that I am a relative of someone as important as Anna,\" said Deborah Murray-Dates of Cambridge, Anna's greatniece.\"Incredible.\"The Douglasses had five children.

    "content": "Black survivors nearly invisible in Catholic clergy sexual abuse crisis\n\n December 1, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 17 | Section: News \n \n 776\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BALTIMORE - As Charles Richardson gradually lost his eyesight to complications from diabetes, certain childhood memories haunted him even more.The Catholic priest appeared vividly in his mind's eye - the one who promised him a spot on a travel basketball team, took him out for burgers and helped him with homework.The one, Richardson alleges, who sexually assaulted him for more than a year.\"I've been seeing him a lot lately,\" Richardson said during a recent interview, dabbing tears from behind dark glasses.As a Black middle schooler from northwest Baltimore, Richardson started spending time with the Rev. Henry Zerhusen, a charismatic white cleric.Lauded as a \"super-priest\" when he died in 2003, Zerhusen welcomed his church's racial integration and implemented robust social service programs for struggling families, including Richardson's.For most of his life, Richardson kept the abuse a secret, a common experience for survivors of sexual abuse. But cases of clergy abuse among African Americans are especially underreported, according to experts, who argue the lack of attention adds to the trauma of an already vulnerable population.The U.S. Catholic Church generally does not publicly track the race or ethnicity of clergy abuse victims.Without that data, the full scope of clergy sex abuse and its effects on communities of color is unknown.\"Persons of color have suffered a long legacy of neglect and marginalization in the Catholic Church,\" said the Rev. Bryan Massingale, a Black Catholic priest and Fordham University professor whose research has focused on the issue. \"We need to correct the idea that all or most of the victims of this abuse have been white and male.\"Earlier this year, the Maryland Attorney General's Office released a scathing report on child sex abuse within the Archdiocese of Baltimore dating back several decades. The report documents more than 600 abuse cases but leaves out any context about race.There are clues, however, in the names of priests and churches listed.Out of 27 parishes in the archdiocese that have significant Black populations, at least 19 - 70% - previously had priests on staff who have been accused of sexual abuse, according to an Associated Press analysis.For parishes that experienced demographic shifts over time, these abusers were in residence in the years after Black membership increased and white membership declined.Not long after release of the attorney general's report, Maryland lawmakers voted to repeal the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse victims to sue. At age 58, Richardson retained a lawyer and decided to go public.Ray Kelly, a lifelong Catholic and chair of the pastoral council at St. Peter Claver, a Black parish in west Baltimore, said the archdiocese has repeatedly failed to address racial disparities, a trend that extends far beyond the clergy abuse crisis.In response to the 2020 racial justice protests, Kelly helped lead a working group convened by the Baltimore archbishop that focused on combating racism, but he said the archdiocese took little action after receiving the group's recommendations.He pointed to the Catholic Church's long history of treating African Americans like second-class citizens - beginning in Baltimore with the founding of the Oblate Sisters of Providence in 1829, when four Black women started their own religious order after being rejected by an existing sisterhood.The aftermath of the Civil War brought another new religious order to Baltimore: The Josephites were founded to minister to recently freed slaves. But despite their mission, for decades they largely did not admit Black men into the priesthood. The archdiocese now lists at least five Josephite priests as credibly accused of abuse.\"The Americanized Catholic Church still sees the Black population as a perpetual charity case, so to speak,\" Kelly said. \"And the predators are going to go where the prey is - Black communities relying on the church for support.\"Christian Kendzierski, the archdiocese spokesperson, said its leaders have taken significant steps to address the church's legacy of racism.He said the archdiocese's Office of Black Catholic Ministry works to \"lift up our Catholic social teaching related to the dignity of the human person and ensure worship is inclusive of the scope of the Catholic culture.\"Abuse also came from within the Black community.Among the alleged perpetrators were some of the archdiocese's few Black Catholic leaders.Survivors coming forward now, including Richardson, will likely receive smaller settlements since the archdiocese recently declared bankruptcy, allowing it to protect its assets more and shift the litigation to bankruptcy court, a less transparent forum.\"I feel like they are escaping responsibility,\" Richardson said.But for his part, Richardson recently found solace in telling his daughter about the abuse: \"A great weight has been lifted off my shoulders.\" \n \n Caption: Charles Richardson, of Baltimore, wipes his eye while discussing his alleged abuse decades ago by a Catholic priest. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'An Incredible Woman In A Difficult Time Of History' - Local Historical Tour Operator Discovers Rarely-Seen Photo Of Harriet Tubman\n\n December 14, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom Mccall; Tmccall@Chespub.Com | Page: B1 | Section: News \n \n 654\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - Alex Green has made a career out of studying Harriet Tubman and her legacy, so he was surprised when he found a photo he didn't recognize among his personal records. He thinks the world should know about the image.Green, who owns and operates Harriet Tubman Tours with his wife Lisa out of Dorchester County, had forgotten about the photograph and found it running through his research documents.\nHe said he was given the digital photo by a colleague 10 or 12 years ago. He has thousands of historical images in his data bank, but this one caught his eye years later.\n\"I have been studying Harriet Tubman for the last 13, 14 years because I live in Dorchester County on the byway system,\" Green said.\n\"This picture was shared with me from somebody else, and I am still trying to figure out who actually shared it or why it wasn't put in the byway system. I kept it in my digital information, and I just ran across it.\"\nThe Tubman Byway is a living history route that has audio tours, maps and historic landmarks that trace Tubman's journey out of slavery from Dorchester County to Philadelphia.\nThe picture rarely-seen Green found was taken about five years before Tubman's death in 1908. It shows a time when she was phasing out of running a home for the elderly.\nShe was running a farm and she was active with the women's suffrage movement. Her husband and adopted child were both deceased by this time. She was well into her 80s.\nThe photo shows Tubman wearing a black hat and cape.\nShe stands in front of an ivy-covered brick building, squinting in the strong sun with her hands clasped in front of her.\nThe conductor of the Underground Railroad had later photographs taken of her, but not many.\n\"This picture is taken in front of her home,\" Green said. \"This is a photo of her that no one has seen. Now we have something to highlight in 2023 - a photo of her. Look at this photo of her right before she is about to transition out of here. Here is another look at her life 100-and-some odd years later.\"\nGreen is also interested in the house in the background. The building is still standing, he said, so the photo can be used to tell how tall Tubman was.\n\"She is standing almost posture straight up, not stooped over. She is not very tall. Most older people get hunched over. Her posture is almost straight. She looks strikingly well for late 80s,\" he said.\nThe photo was taken by a journalist married to the niece of Sarah Bradford. Bradford wrote a biography about Tubman.\nGreen rates the photograph highly.\n\"My opinion is that it is one of the most powerful pieces of information shining a light into this incredible woman's life in today's times,\" he said.\n\"It brings to mind how impactful her life is.\"\n\"It brings to mind that her life transcends from one time to a lot of other times and is still surfacing up today. It shows an incredible woman in a difficult time of history,\" Green said.\nIn the years after her escape from slavery, Tubman made at least 13 missions to rescue approximately 70 people from slavery using a network of anti-slavery activists known as the Underground Railroad.\nShe served as an armed scout and spy for the Union Army during the Civil War and became heavily involved in the women's suffrage movement later in her life.\nGreen had some thoughts on Tubman's life.\n\"Her life is very relevant to things that happen to us today, like unselfish acts,\" he said. \"We can look at her life today and fix a lot of problems that we have today, like going beyond ourselves and helping others.\"\n\"We are blessed to be in the same area where all of this happened,\" Green said. \n \n Caption: CONTRIBUTED BY ALEX GREEN\n\n This 1908 photo of Harriet Tubman shows her in her 80s and living in upstate New York. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "King's granddaughter carrying forward his legacy\n\n January 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JESSICA A. JOHNSON | Section: Columns \n \n 673\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I happened to catch the recent \"CBS Mornings\" news interview of Yolanda Renee King, the only grandchild of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King. While promoting her new children's book honoring her grandparents titled \"We Dream a World,\" Yolanda gave a profound answer when asked what she would say to them if they were alive today. \"I think I would first start off with an apology,\" she said, which was surprising to CBS host Nate Burleson, who immediately asked the young activist what she meant by her response. Yolanda continued, \"An apology to where we are right now, as a nation and really as a world.\"Yolanda is only 15 years old, and it is evident that she has a deep understanding of what her grandparents fought for as leaders of the civil rights movement. In August of last year, during the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, Yolanda boldly declared that her generation would \"be defined by action, not apathy.\"\nAs Yolanda is growing up before our eyes, she has the youthful exuberance of her grandfather's resolve and displays the dignified grace of her grandmother. Yolanda saying she would apologize to her grandparents for our nation not yet reaching the potential they believed in should make us thoughtfully reflect on how Dr. King also warned about becoming apathetic.\nApathy is a brutal paralyzer of life. It can cause us to be ensnared in a dangerous mode of stagnation emotionally, spiritually, and sometimes physically. Apathy also triggers entitled disinterest in our society. In 2021, Tom Nichols, an instructor at Harvard Extension School and the U.S. Naval War College, asserted in an interview with The Harvard Gazette that \"narcissism and nihilism\" are the primary threats to our country's democracy and societal relationships. Elaborating on the latter, Nichols said that many people ask why our society is \"so mean and heartless and awful,\" but many of them do not contribute anything to make their communities better, or they will vote against policies that affect their well-being due to \"narcissistic beefs.\"\n\"We have become surly villagers,\" Nichols maintained, \"me, my family, my little plot of land, and everybody else can go to hell.\" This type of sullen attitude is what Yolanda is urging our country to overcome as she is an emerging voice on critical issues such as gun violence and homelessness.\nAs Yolanda continues to attentively study the Godly principles that enabled her grandfather to be that drum major for justice who changed the course of our nation, I am reminded of two of his sermons where he encouraged his followers to live with purpose and passion and to shower others with Christian love.\nThe first sermon is titled \"But If Not,\" a 1967 message that King delivered at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church. King expresses that the \"ultimate test\" of our faith is when we get to a \"but if not\" moment in life, a moment where we have to travel along an arduous journey with no other option but to lean on God's promises.\nThis passage stands out to avoid being gripped by apathy during a spiritual test: \"... somewhere along the way [in life] you should discover something that's so dear, so precious to you, that is so eternally worthful, that you will never give it up.\" The second sermon is \"Levels of Love,\" an Ebenezer address King gave in 1962. He implored the congregation to \"rise to agape, to Christian love\" because \"[t]he greatness of it is that you love every man, not for your sake but for his sake. And you love every man because God loves him.\"\nIt is remarkable that Yolanda exemplifies the love and compassion her grandparents demonstrated as she diligently works to uplift others. She is blazing her own path, and it is truly inspiring to watch it unfold. She probably has not had a \"but if not\" moment yet in her young life thus far, but I have no doubt she is developing the character and strength to face the challenges she knows are coming. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Within her first two years in the country, she moved to Easton.\n\"It's very exciting for me as well, because it's a way to represent the Eastern Shore (and) the Hispanic community, which is our main goal, mission and focus in this center,\" she said. \"So hopefully we can keep expanding this representation and working for the community.\"\nFor now, Gomez Lozano's focus on the commission is representation for the rural region and learning as she goes.\nBut in the future, she hopes to move forward policies to benefit Hispanic communities, which represent a fast-growing demographic in the state.\nGrowth in the Eastern Shore's Hispanic population is something Gomez Lozano and her colleagues at ChesMRC have seen in the 10 years since the nonprofit launched.\nThe organization served about 3,500 people last year, according to Matthew Peters, the center's executive director.\nLocally, Gomez Lozano wants to promote awareness of the expanding Hispanic community's existence and the services ChesMRC provides for residents.\nShe has served as the center's Hispanic outreach coordinator for over six years — a job that's had her acting in multiple capacities as an interpreter, a notary and a certified application counselor for health insurance, among others. She is also a resource for first-generation college students and works with ChesMRC's development committee.\n\"If everybody's aware (of us), then we can always offer a more welcoming environment,\" Gomez Lozano said. \"Because sometimes, even just visiting one agency can make a whole difference, just the way you receive and treat people.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After that, attendees walked over to the Decker Theatre at the Gibson Center for the Arts on campus to hear speeches and watch performances.\nThe program opened with a reenactment of the Greensboro Four, a group of college students in North Carolina protesting segregation laws through staging a sit-in at the Woolworth's lunch counter.\nSinging resounded through the theater at various times throughout the program, including a performance of \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" often referred to as the Black National Anthem, by Amiya Potts and a performance by singer, songwriter and author Ty Bolden, singing her song \"Free Woman.\"\nJamie \"Mixx\" Barrett was awarded the Commissioner William W. Pickrum Service Award.\nBarrett, a graduate of Kent County High School and Maryland Barber School, owns Big Mixx's Beautiful Beginnings Unisex Salon. A member of the Kent County Local Management Board, mentor and licensed foster parent, Barrett serves his community in more ways than one.\nPaul Tue III, co-executive director of Minary's Dream Alliance, said young people were infused throughout the program.\n\"And that's on purpose,\" he said.\nTue hosted a \"barbershop conversation\" during the program, with four Kent County High School students involved with Young Men Standing on Business. Tue asked the students questions about their takes on King's legacy.\nPat Nugent, the Miller Director of Civic Engagement at the Starr Center, said getting younger people involved helps to pass on the legacy.\n\"And that's really what the day is about,\" he said. \"To infuse younger generations with a sense of civic duty and obligation, as well as to connect them to generations of folks who have been doing that in Kent County for decades.\"\nThe keynote speaker of the program, Jermichael Mitchell, a writer, philanthropist and community activist who ran for mayor of Salisbury this past year, talked about purpose.\n\"No matter what your age may be, young or old, every last one of us is born with a purpose,\" he said. \"Every last one of us is born to do something in this world. And in order for us to live our dreams, we have to actually know that purpose and embody that purpose and move forward.\"\nMitchell talked about King \"walking in his purpose\" every day, no matter what he faced.\nShaila Parker, who attended the event said its important that King is recognized every year because he did so much to help unify people.\n\"(He) helped make sure everyone has access to different things, has rights, is respected, has dignity,\" she said.\nLisa Moody, who has been attending the event since 2017, said one thing special about Kent County is that when there is an event, the county comes out for it.\n\"So it's a great place to meet people or reunite with people,\" she said. \"And of course with today being the MLK holiday, it's a good reason for us to all come together for a specific purpose.\"\nSaturday, Jan. 20, at 3:30 p.m., the public is invited to back to Decker Theatre to watch the premiere of \"Get on The Bus,\" a documentary that follows local students and community members take a journey from Chestertown to The Legacy Museum in Montgomery, Alabama to deliver historic materials. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Eradicating Hamas in not a realistic goal\n\n January 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SARENA NEYMAN | Section: Columns \n \n 793\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n For me, being Jewish was never about religion or Zionism. My holocaust survivor parents sent me to Jewish day schools and Zionist summer camps, but none of that stuck.I haven't set foot in a synagogue for decades and have always been critical of Israeli politics. But up till now, I still retained a strong Jewish identity and felt a bond with other Jews because of what I perceived we shared: a commitment to a key tenet of Judaism — that one's role in life is to make the world a better place. Not that all Jews were social workers or social justice warriors, but I was proud that so many of us were willing to speak up and act against all oppression, not just our own.\nBut since Oct. 7 so much has changed. Hamas's sadistic attacks were calculated to trigger a sense of helplessness and shame, and to provoke a vengeful military overreaction. This is precisely what happened, quickly turning international sympathy into horror and aversion.\nIt's been painful to watch so many American Jews call out their detractors as antisemites and insist that \"context\" is a dirty word, unwilling to acknowledge that 75 years of misery imposed by Israel on Gaza played any role in fostering Hamas. They deny the devastating impact of unrelenting carpet bombing and are enraged that Israel is being accused of genocide.\nBut in less than 100 days the IDF's scorched-earth offensive has killed more than 24,000, injured more than 60,000, displaced 85 percent of the population, destroyed countless hospitals, schools, roads, religious sites, stores, and agricultural lands. People are dying from disease and starvation, suffocating under the rubble.\nThey have no food, water, sanitation, medicine, or anesthesia. If this is not genocide, it's certainly too close for my comfort.\nIn an earlier essay, I wrote about how disturbing it was to hear some of my former high school classmates voice the quote attributed to Golda Meir: \"We can forgive the Arabs for killing our children. But we can never forgive them for forcing us to kill their children.\" Journalist Michelle Goldberg, in her recent New York Times op-ed, \"America Must Face Up to Israel's Extremism,\" condemns this sentiment that \"positions Israel as the victim even when it's doing the killing.\"\nBut at least, she says, \"it suggests a tortured ambivalence about meting out violence.\" Now, however, writes Goldberg, even this ambivalence has disappeared.\nI see this reflected in my own social media feed which is filled with complaints that Jews are being unfairly singled out for what other nations have always done during wartime to defend themselves. Others write it off as Israel's bad PR. \"It's awful. They make us look like baby-killers.\" How did we become so willing to dehumanize the death of innocents?\nWhen political commentator Van Jones appeared at the D.C. March for Israel rally in November to take a stand against anti-Jewish bigotry, his call for an end to the bombing was met with heckling and booing. There will be no ceasefire, Netanyahu said, until Hamas is eliminated.\nBut eradicating Hamas is not a realistic goal. The death of so many innocent Palestinians has only increased support for this terrorist group.\nNot ending the war actually places Jews in greater danger. Israelis are now more vulnerable to attack from Iran than they have ever been before. And the rise of global antisemitism in response to this murderous war has made it more dangerous to be Jewish everywhere else.\nSince writing my first essay on this subject, so many Jews have approached me to tell me they share my views but will only express them in private. A Jewish friend who is a therapist told me she wasn't sure how much longer she could remain silent, but she chose not to say anything out of respect for the many friends in her circle she felt had experienced a form of PTSD from the events of Oct. 7. Her viewpoint — that the trauma of the Hamas atrocities reopened deep psychic wounds, generating blind rage — is the only way I can start to understand why so many of my fellow Jews are unwilling to recognize Israel is no longer the victim in this war and in fact has become the transgressor.\nOver the past few months, my high school classmates have been meeting to plan our upcoming 50th reunion that I had been looking forward to attending. But now I'm having second thoughts.\nHow will I feel standing alone as the rest of the group unites in their calls of Am Yisroel Chai, the rallying cry of support for the state of Israel. I worry that I may not be able to restrain myself from speaking up. I worry more that I won't have the guts to.\nSarena Neyman is a fundraising and marketing grant writer. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore to be on the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture. His term is from 2023 to 2027.According to MCAAH website, the purpose of the \"the commission is to identify and preserve buildings, communities and sites of historical and cultural importance to the African American experience in Maryland. This competitive program, offered once per year, is supported through an annual appropriation from the Maryland General Assembly and is administered as a joint partnership of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture and The Maryland Historical Trust.\"\nThey give away $5 million a year, and Moaney works with his commission to find suitable candidates who are either architecturally or culturally preserving Black history and identity.\n\"It is the first ever ethnic commission in the United States. It is something that our colleagues across the country look to as an example. I feel humble to join the group as the youngest. The commission, in general, documents, collects African American heritage across the state,\" said Moaney.\nHe covers Delmarva for the commission and currently lives in Cambridge with his wife. Moaney is a product of Talbot County Public Schools, where he played football. He went to Williams College in Massachusetts.\nMoaney said he hopes to energize the commission.\n\"I am trying to expand notions of Blackness that center on joy, that center freedom, agency and maybe push and highlight elements of our culture here on the Shore that often get overlooked. I think we have to reinforce accurate portrayals of Black life as well as ones that normalize our culture,\" he said.\nHe takes a long historical look at how Black people have suffered in America.\n\"Our country is really trying to reconcile with wounds that haven't fully healed or even the past few weeks, some that are opening up scars that are deeper than we could imagine. Like the people of Haiti, who have a large population in Salisbury now, or the people who were elected in Federalsburg for the first time in centuries — have the space to give it justice,\" he said.\nMoaney will bring the commission to Chestertown for a public meeting in April. That meeting will be in the Bethel AME Church, where the Freedom Riders came and stayed in 1962.\n\"We have regular commission meetings that will happen all over the state. It is a beauty to be at the sites we are trying to preserve. Some are trying to be restored, some have been restored, some are receiving grants,\" Moaney said.\n\"I was assigned two committees. One was African American Heritage Preservation Program. The funding for that just got raised by the assembly from $1 million to $5 million. Close to 50% of the awardees were on the Eastern Shore. It is a collaboration with the Maryland Historical Trust which is in the Department of Planning,\" he said.\nAmong the grants awarded by the commission through the Historical Preservation Program for fiscal year 2024 are:\n$250,000 for the American Legion Mannie Scott Post 193 Building in Denton.\n$138,000 to Alpha Genesis Community Development Corporation in Cambridge.\n$200,000 to Kent County Public Library.\n$250,000 to Bryan's United Methodist Church in Grasonville.\n$250,000 to the Mid-Shore Community Foundation in Royal Oak.\nThe grants will offer assistance to organizations and private citizens in their sponsorship of projects involving the acquisition, construction, or improvement of sites related to African American heritage, according to a press release from the governor's office.\nMoaney's other appointment is to the Inaugural Statewide Book Drive. \"The best part are the oral histories. There are so many discoveries. It's a privilege to be there,\" he said.\nOutside of his work on the commission, Moaney is the founder of literacy group called the Needle's Eye Academy.\n\"If you are familiar with Gil Scott-Heron. He was arguably the soundtrack to the Black power movement as a poet and a musician and an oralist. The song 'Needles Eye' is where the Academy's name emanates from. From the 1972 album 'Pieces of the Man,'\" he said.\n\"They have been asking, 'Are there any college age students who will speak to high schoolers and maybe even start a book club. We donated our old book sales into Berkshire County Public Schools (Massachusetts). In August of 2020 we started online in Talbot County Public Schools with three wonderful students.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ben Cardin hosted a roundtable discussion at Chesapeake College with several individuals featured in the Maryland Public Television documentary \"Water's Edge: Black Watermen of the Chesapeake\" and their families on Monday.Attendees included Dr. Cliff Coppersmith, Marc Castelli, Vera Meredith, Captain Tyrone Meredith, Kat De Shields-Moon, Dennis De Shields, Captain Marcus Wooley, Clayton Mitchell, Clayton Washington, Vincent Leggett and Edzel Turner.\nThis was an opportunity to better understand the plight of the Black waterman, their history on the Shore and determine what, if any role, the U.S. Government can play to help, Cardin's office said in a press release.\n\"From Western Maryland to the Eastern Shore, there are efforts across the state to preserve Black culture in Maryland. Each of these projects is important, but we need a coordinated effort to connect the dots to follow the history Black Marylanders including Black watermen. This is a story that needs to be more visibly told,\" Cardin said.\nPart of the discussion included ways to publicly memorialize Maryland's Black watermen. The numbers of Eastern Shore Black watermen have gone from a couple hundred decades ago to less than 20.\nThe discussion also included designating more towns, like Oxford, as heritage sites and ports of memory for the transatlantic slave trade and connecting the sites across Maryland.\n\"The Kennard African American Cultural Heritage Center in Centerville, Maryland, a place that's benefitting from the work Senator Cardin has done to restore and create that center, now heralds the history of Black watermen on the Eastern Shore,\" said Clayton Washington, president of Kennard Alumni Association. \"We love telling these stories, and it's really important that we have the means to do it.\"\nThe meeting was part of a day-long tour of the Eastern Shore, in which Cardin met with various locals involved in agriculture and aquaculture. In addition to meeting with the watermen, Cardin participated in tours of Teddy Bear Fresh in Easton and TechOps in Stevensville and a roundtable discussion with representatives from the Shore's agriculture, aquaculture and environmental conservation communities. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Black travelers want authentic engagement, not checkboxes\n\n February 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Alana Dillette and Stefanie Benjamin The Conversation | Section: Life \n \n 872\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After the murder of George Floyd in 2020, when travel brands — including Delta Air Lines, Hilton and Enterprise — pronounced their support for diversity and the Black Lives Matter movement, our research group was motivated to conduct a study that collected data of the travel experiences of more than 5,000 Black people and people of color.Our work, published in Afar magazine and Tourism Geographies, found that Black travelers expressed dissatisfaction with how the travel industry promotes itself as inclusive.\nAuthenticity mattersBlack travelers want more genuine and authentic engagement and representation, we found, that showcases an investment in the Black community by partnering with Black-owned travel businesses, guides and experiences.\nWe conducted in-depth interviews with several of the people who provided data to us. Those we interviewed told us plainly that they are weary of being perceived as a single, uniform entity. They want more attention paid to their intersecting identities. First coined by Law professor Kimberlé Crenshaw back in 1989, intersectionality has come to mean that all oppression is linked to people's complex identities related to their gender, race, class, sexual orientation, physical ability and more.\nJoshlyn Crystal Adams, CEO of Urbanista Travel, told us, \"It's definitely more than being Black. It's also as a woman, where do I feel safe going … if you go to this country as a gay person, just be mindful that if you're caught doing this or that, you can be arrested. So it spins far beyond race. It's definitely about gender and sexuality.\"\nWe also found that Black travelers notice the small things that add up to an experience of feeling valued and seen — or not.\nSome companies support Black-owned businesses by buying their products in limited amounts. For example, JW Marriott sells Diamond's Body Care in their spas. But the people in our study emphasized the need for brands and destinations to make a greater effort.\n\"What do you know about my hair? Nothing,\" travel media personality, pilot and avid adventurer Kellee Edwards said about hotel shampoo. \"Until they go ahead and mix that pot up and sprinkle some salt and pepper in it … this is what we're going to be dealing with.\"\nDiversity is not a box to checkIn the Jim Crow era, Black travelers were regularly denied access to crucial services such as gas, food, restrooms and lodging. Stopping in unfamiliar locations posed the threat of humiliation, threats or worse.\nWhile it's true that race relations and access to travel by Black people have improved in the United States since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, generational trauma has left a mark on Black travelers, affecting how and why they choose to travel.\nEdwards shared that identifying as a Black woman in a traditionally male-dominated industry is \"exhausting.\"\n\"Diversity is a lot of things, but … as women, we are very much underrepresented,\" Edwards said. \"While we need to focus on inclusion when it comes to race, we also must focus on gender.\"\nTravel often reinforces entrenched power dynamics, noted Christopher Carr, one of our study participants and an associate dean at George Mason University.\nCarr said that destinations often engage in \"rainbow washing\" — superficial LGBTQ-friendly gestures meant to elicit positive feelings about a brand in order to sell something — with no real support going to the community, such as promoting pride flags while passing anti-LGBTQIA corporate policies.\nThat leaves him to wonder if \"the attention that I'm receiving is genuine or is it because I'm somebody's box to tick?\"\nOur interviewees called for actions beyond symbolic gestures and real effort to engage the community.\n\"If companies want to understand how to be appeasing to our communities, they should go directly to us,\" study participant and AfroBuenaventura Transformative Travel founder Ronnell Perry said.\nChange the industry from withinBlack individuals hold fewer than 1% of top leadership roles — C-suite, director, CEO/president — in the U.S. hospitality industry, according to a report by Castell Project.\nOver the past decade, consultancies such as McKinsey have made it increasingly clear that companies with more diverse workforces perform better financially.\nIn our recent publication \"Black Travel Is Not Monolithic,\" we proposed a road map to help guide the travel sector toward authentic inclusion. However, change requires taking power from the hands of dominant white, heterosexual, non-disabled and first-world nation groups.\nOne of our top suggestions is to diversify human resource departments so that individuals from diverse identities and backgrounds can actively participate in the hiring process. From there, they can address culturally sensitive issues on a daily basis.

    "content": "Black travelers want authentic engagement, not checkboxes\n\n February 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Alana Dillette and Stefanie Benjamin The Conversation | Section: Life \n \n 872\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After the murder of George Floyd in 2020, when travel brands — including Delta Air Lines, Hilton and Enterprise — pronounced their support for diversity and the Black Lives Matter movement, our research group was motivated to conduct a study that collected data of the travel experiences of more than 5,000 Black people and people of color.Our work, published in Afar magazine and Tourism Geographies, found that Black travelers expressed dissatisfaction with how the travel industry promotes itself as inclusive.\nAuthenticity mattersBlack travelers want more genuine and authentic engagement and representation, we found, that showcases an investment in the Black community by partnering with Black-owned travel businesses, guides and experiences.\nWe conducted in-depth interviews with several of the people who provided data to us. Those we interviewed told us plainly that they are weary of being perceived as a single, uniform entity. They want more attention paid to their intersecting identities. First coined by Law professor Kimberlé Crenshaw back in 1989, intersectionality has come to mean that all oppression is linked to people's complex identities related to their gender, race, class, sexual orientation, physical ability and more.\nJoshlyn Crystal Adams, CEO of Urbanista Travel, told us, \"It's definitely more than being Black. It's also as a woman, where do I feel safe going … if you go to this country as a gay person, just be mindful that if you're caught doing this or that, you can be arrested. So it spins far beyond race. It's definitely about gender and sexuality.\"\nWe also found that Black travelers notice the small things that add up to an experience of feeling valued and seen — or not.\nSome companies support Black-owned businesses by buying their products in limited amounts. For example, JW Marriott sells Diamond's Body Care in their spas. But the people in our study emphasized the need for brands and destinations to make a greater effort.\n\"What do you know about my hair? Nothing,\" travel media personality, pilot and avid adventurer Kellee Edwards said about hotel shampoo. \"Until they go ahead and mix that pot up and sprinkle some salt and pepper in it … this is what we're going to be dealing with.\"\nDiversity is not a box to checkIn the Jim Crow era, Black travelers were regularly denied access to crucial services such as gas, food, restrooms and lodging. Stopping in unfamiliar locations posed the threat of humiliation, threats or worse.\nWhile it's true that race relations and access to travel by Black people have improved in the United States since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, generational trauma has left a mark on Black travelers, affecting how and why they choose to travel.\nEdwards shared that identifying as a Black woman in a traditionally male-dominated industry is \"exhausting.\"\n\"Diversity is a lot of things, but … as women, we are very much underrepresented,\" Edwards said. \"While we need to focus on inclusion when it comes to race, we also must focus on gender.\"\nTravel often reinforces entrenched power dynamics, noted Christopher Carr, one of our study participants and an associate dean at George Mason University.\nCarr said that destinations often engage in \"rainbow washing\" — superficial LGBTQ-friendly gestures meant to elicit positive feelings about a brand in order to sell something — with no real support going to the community, such as promoting pride flags while passing anti-LGBTQIA corporate policies.\nThat leaves him to wonder if \"the attention that I'm receiving is genuine or is it because I'm somebody's box to tick?\"\nOur interviewees called for actions beyond symbolic gestures and real effort to engage the community.\n\"If companies want to understand how to be appeasing to our communities, they should go directly to us,\" study participant and AfroBuenaventura Transformative Travel founder Ronnell Perry said.\nChange the industry from withinBlack individuals hold fewer than 1% of top leadership roles — C-suite, director, CEO/president — in the U.S. hospitality industry, according to a report by Castell Project.\nOver the past decade, consultancies such as McKinsey have made it increasingly clear that companies with more diverse workforces perform better financially.\nIn our recent publication \"Black Travel Is Not Monolithic,\" we proposed a road map to help guide the travel sector toward authentic inclusion. However, change requires taking power from the hands of dominant white, heterosexual, non-disabled and first-world nation groups.\nOne of our top suggestions is to diversify human resource departments so that individuals from diverse identities and backgrounds can actively participate in the hiring process. From there, they can address culturally sensitive issues on a daily basis. Of course, this is true not just in travel but across industries.\nFostering an inclusive workplace also requires nurturing diverse leaders, inclusive of intersecting marginalized identities.\n\"Until you get people in who can represent us to say, 'Hey, this is my community and I know something about this and we can represent this,'\" Edwards said, \"it's not going to change.\"\nAlana Dillette is an assistant professor in the L.

Woodson founded what is now the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. The following year, he began publishing what is now The Journal of African American History, a publication of history, research and book reviews.\nIn 1926, Woodson founded \"Negro History Week\" to honor the history, culture and contributions of African Americans. He chose February to coincide with the birthdays of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln. In 1976, President Gerald Ford extended the observation to a month, now known as Black History Month.\nWoodson believed that history was \"made by the people, not simply or primarily by great men.\"\nLocal writer, Niambi Davis had the opportunity to contribute to the Black History display at Bethel AME. The subjects, Davis said, \"are important and more than just the usual Douglass and Tubman stories; they're the unknown local, national and international folks.\"\nThe display is open to the congregation and anyone wishing to attend services. Service begins at 11 a.m. Sunday mornings. The church is located on Washington Road in Centreville. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Black watermen share about challenges, changes on the Chesapeake\n\n February 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ANNIE HASSELGREEN Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 847\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum's Van Lennep Auditorium was packed on Saturday, Feb. 17, for \"Troubled Waters: Black Watermen,\" co-hosted by the St. Michaels Community Conversations on Race, the St. Michaels Community Center and the American Association of University Women.Panelists included Captain Lamont Wright, Reverend Dr. William Wallace, Edzel Turner and James \"Captain Buck\" Lynch, all of whom have been longtime watermen in varying capacities.\nThe men came together to engage in a dialogue about the successes and challenges of being African American watermen in honor of Black History Month.\nThey shared their diverse experiences on the waterways of the Chesapeake Bay with a crowd eager to learn more about the history of Black watermen on the Eastern Shore. Though the men shared similar perspectives, their roles on the water ran the gamut, but all agreed that conditions in the waters have changed drastically during their careers spanning many decades.\n\"My family owned a seafood factory in Bellevue,\" said Edzel Turner. \"Back then, we'd catch so many crabs that my arms would hurt.\"\nAll of the panelists agreed that government regulations have drastically shifted the profession in many ways.\n\"Regulations and sanctuaries will eventually drive away most watermen,\" Lynch said, \"and disease and the Conowingo Dam are decimating populations. We keep having to go further south (to catch anything).\"\nPanelists concurred that Black watermen in particular are an aging population that can't be replaced quickly enough.\n\"The youngest Black waterman is 60,\" Lynch said, \"and there won't be any left in 10 years.\"\nMany of the men are actively advocating for programs for young people to learn about life on the water so they can take the mantle for future generations.\nPresent in the audience was Vince Leggett, named \"Admiral of the Chesapeake Bay\" in 2003 by then Governor Parris N. Glendening. This is the highest honor a Maryland Governor can bestow on a private individual in the environmental arena ,and Leggett has been working for more than 30 years on preserving Black Americans' contributions to the maritime and seafood processing industries, and the Chesapeake Bay's rich culture and heritage.\nIn 1994, the Blacks of the Chesapeake Foundation began documenting this through a range of historical, cultural and educational activities. This included the \"Chesapeake Bay Through Ebony Eyes,\" a book that offers a history of African American contributions in the Chesapeake's maritime industries and includes a collection of seafood recipes, poetry, photographs and sketches; and a book entitled \"Blacks of the Chesapeake: An Integral Part of Maritime History,\" which provides a photographic history of African Americans at work as ship captains, sail makers, watermen and seafood processing plant employees.\nLeggett joined the panel to echo the sentiments of his fellow watermen about the challenges facing the industry and to continue to support their common desire to honor the legacy of Black Americans who have contributed so much to it.\n\"African Americans have spent their lives feeding the state of Maryland,\" said Wright.\nConversation also included experiences shared by many of the men having been targeted by racially-motivated repercussions.\n\"It wasn't uncommon for the marine police to check the oysters of Black watermen and fine them, but didn't check those of the white watermen,\" Wright said.\nTurner had a similar experience: \"I've seen police come to an area with 10 to 12 boats and ticket only the Black watermen.\"\nLynch has been on the water for 53 years and articulated the challenges for Black watermen to success in the industry. \"Blacks were unable to borrow money,\" he said. This meant that \"white watermen had better boats and better rigs.\"\nAlthough receiving loans for their businesses and inequitable fines have been a challenge, Wallace stated that watermen on the whole are a supportive group.\n\"There is a camaraderie among Black and white watermen. That isn't what perpetuated the division,\" he said. Instead, he says, unfairly targeting Blacks occurred mainly by the marine police and those charged with seafood counts.\n\"When I was a kid, my dad was a waterman, and I noticed that he was always the lowest on the leaderboard. He always had the lowest numbers,\" Wallace said. \"There was a white man who I figured out was throwing a lot of his catch into an uncounted float.\"\nBlack representation in the watermen industry remains stunted. Of the 30 members of the Queen Anne's County Watermen's Association, for example, there are three Black members and 27 white, Lynch said.\nBut there is an active group of Black watermen and their supporters who continue to advocate for acknowledgement of the tireless efforts of their community. Also present in the audience were Drs. Dennis and Mary DeShields, founders of the Bellevue Passage Museum.\nDennis DeShields, a fourth-generation descendant of Bellevue, resolved to preserve the town's rich heritage and is leading the charge alongside wife to present this history to a wider audience and \"serve as a center of cultural conservation for the community.\"\nFor some of the panelists, being out on the water daily is a collection of fond memories, but Captain Buck still ventures out most days — and wouldn't have it any other way.\n\"If you're a waterman, you get up with the sun,\" he said. \"And I'm my own boss.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Despite efforts to remove them, Confederates, segregationists live on in Capitol statues\n\n February 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BRENNAN STEWART Capital News Service | Section: National \n \n 874\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n February is Black History Month, an observance meant to honor and celebrate the achievements made by African Americans throughout the history of the United States.But reminders of the oppression that African Americans suffered are still on display in the United States Capitol, taking the form of 12 statues of figures affiliated with the Confederate States of America and post-Civil War segregation.\nIndeed, visitors to the Capitol might be startled to see civil rights icon Rosa Parks just across the room from Confederate President Jefferson Davis. And the continued presence of Confederates and segregationists in statuary in a symbol of democracy amazes scholars as well.\n\"While the effects of having Confederate statues in Washington — much less in the nation's capital — should be quite clear, what still surprises me years after statues started being removed is that something like this is still a possibility,\" Lester Spence, professor of political science and Africana studies at Johns Hopkins University, told Capital News Service.\nMany of the offending figures stand in the National Statuary Hall, located just steps from the Capitol's iconic Rotunda. Once the meeting place of the U.S. House of Representatives, the massive semicircular room was transformed into a statue gallery in 1864. Under federal law, each state is allowed to provide no more than two statues to the collection.\nBy 1933, the hall became overcrowded with 65 statues making up three circular rows along the circumference. Not only did the room start to look visually unappealing but concerns also were raised about the chamber's structural integrity.\nAs a result, Congress passed a law saying that one statue from each state could remain in Statuary Hall while the others would be relocated to other areas of the Capitol.\nToday, five statues with Confederate ties remain in Statuary Hall, including Davis and his vice president, Alexander Stephens. Four others are located in the Capitol Visitor Center, two are in the crypt under the rotunda, and one more is in the Hall of Columns underneath the House chamber.\nArkansas, Georgia, Mississippi and North Carolina currently have both of their two permitted statues linked to the Confederacy or segregation, while Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina and West Virginia each have one.\nHowever, three of the 12 statues are facing replacement.\nThen-Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) signed legislation in 2019 to replace his state's statues of Uriah Rose, a Confederate sympathizer, and James Paul Clarke, a former U.S. senator and white supremacist. They are set to be replaced with statues of civil rights activist Daisy Bates and musician Johnny Cash.\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) signed a formal request in 2018 for the removal of the statue depicting former Gov. Charles Aycock (D), who served in office from 1901 to 1905 and was a supporter of segregation. Aycock is going to be replaced by evangelist Rev. Billy Graham, but there have been several delays in getting the statue to Washington.\n\"When we first started the process in 2018, we were shooting for 2021 but the global pandemic and a couple of other things threw us off,\" said Garrett Dimond, attorney for the North Carolina General Assembly. \"We would like to do [the unveiling] in the spring, but that's up to Congress to schedule the ceremony.\"\nFor a new statue to be displayed in the Capitol, it must first go through several stages of approval at both the state and federal levels, Dimond explained. The process starts with the governor, who submits the bill for a new statue to the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress.\n\"The next step is actually going through the artist selection process, putting together a full-sized clay model and then doing the complete stack — so there's a lot of approvals that happen with that,\" Dimond said.\nThe Confederate Monument Removal Act was introduced to Congress in 2017 by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), in the wake of the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville. Under her bill, all statues depicting individuals who willingly served in the Confederate States Army would be removed from the Statuary Hall collection within 120 days.\nIn February of last year, Lee reintroduced the bill with Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.).\nThere has been no action so far on that legislation.\nRep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) is another member of Congress who has pressed for the removal of the offending statues. Hoyer successfully passed bills twice in the House in 2020 and 2021 that would replace a bust of Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney, who ruled in the 1857 Dred Scott decision that a Black man was not a citizen, with a bust of Supreme Court Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first Black justice appointed to the high court.\nThe bill would also have removed the statues of Aycock, Clarke and Vice President John C. Calhoun, a supporter of slavery. But neither measure passed the Senate.\n\"We can't change history, but we can certainly make it clear who we honor,\" Hoyer said in a statement last week. \"I'm proud to have led efforts to remove statues and symbols honoring Confederate and white supremacist leaders, and I lament that this is not a priority for today's Republican House majority.\"\n\"I remain committed to working with members from either party who are committed to ensuring these symbols of hate have no place in Congress,\" Hoyer added. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lawmakers propose task force to probe long-term inequities facing Black women\n\n February 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TORRENCE BANKS Capital News Service | Section: National \n \n 817\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — The persistence of economic, educational and legal disparities in the lives of Black women and girls would be the target of a federal task force recently proposed by a group of House members.\"Simply acknowledging our country's history of targeted discrimination, harassment and violence against Black women and girls will not correct years of systemic racism and sexism,\" Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Illinois) said in a statement after the legislation creating the task force was introduced earlier this month.\n\"We must leverage the full weight of the federal government to seek justice for Black women and girls who deserve an equal opportunity for a full, happy, healthy life,\" Kelly said.\nKelly is co-chair of the Caucus on Black Women and Girls, along with Reps. Yvette Clarke of New York and Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, who also sponsored the measure. Reps. Jennifer McClellan (D-Virginia), Valerie Foushee (D-North Carolina) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pennsylvania) also have signed on to the bill, called the \"Protect Black Women and Girls Act.\"\nThe bill would establish a task force to examine several aspects of the lives of Black women and girls, including education, healthcare, economic development, housing and civil rights. The task force would look at the effectiveness of programs and policies at the state, federal and local levels and make recommendations for changes.\nKelly said that the bill would help governments be more proactive in ensuring that Black women receive equal opportunities.\nThe task force would be led by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice. Both would then share information with the United States Commission on Civil Rights (USCCR).\nThe civil rights commission also would conduct a study and collect data about the social justice, economic and health effects of discrimination and inequities on Black women and girls. The bill was originally introduced in 2021 with 15 co-sponsors. However, Congress took no action on it.\nMaryland Del. Jheanelle Wilkins, a Democrat, said the legislation would allow the state's government to look at the results from the research and craft more equitable policies.\n\"We know that signs point to black women being disproportionately impacted by many things whether it's maternal health — and in Maryland, Black women are four times as likely to die as a result of childbirth,\" said Wilkins, who also serves as the chair of the state's Legislative Black Caucus.\nIn 2021, the maternal mortality rate of non-Hispanic Black women was 69.9 births per 100,000 live births, according to the Centers for Disease Control. That was more than two times the rate for non-Hispanic white women.\n\"We are the caregivers for our community, we're the matriarchs of our home, but also of the Black community,\" said Kelli Richardson Lawson, founder of the mental health nonprofit organization The SonRise Project, based in Bethesda, Maryland. \"So we've always had to take care of everybody else before we take care of ourselves.\"\nLawson said that the passage of the legislation is crucial because of the socioeconomic challenges that Black women have faced.\nThirty-nine percent of white women earn a bachelor's or associate degree by the age of 29, compared to 21% of Black women, according to the American Association of University Women.\n\"Based on what I've seen, this bill would help mitigate some of the issues that we see involving Black women and girls in a variety of areas,\" said Lawson, whose non-profit serves as a safe space for Black parents to discuss issues involving teen mental health.\nBlack girls also face disadvantages in education. A 2020-2021 school discipline report from the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights found that \"Black girls were nearly two times more likely to receive one or more in-school suspensions, one or more out-of-school suspensions, and expulsions than White girls.\"\nIn addition, Black school-aged girls are four times more likely to be arrested in school than white girls, according to research discussed on Kelly's web page.\nJohn Berkley, coordinator for the National Pan-Hellenic Council in Maryland, Virginia and several other states, said that Maryland has many organizations working to help Black women. Knowing that Congress is backing them up with legislation would be a huge boost, he said.\n\"Now they could say that It's not only a community effort but also a national policy that we now have some teeth behind,\" Berkley said. \"And maybe with that, that will bring more awareness to what's going on with Black females in our various raised communities.\"\nBerkley said that he plans to travel with his fraternity to Annapolis in a couple of weeks to talk to his legislators to see what they're doing to help Congress move the bill along.\nLawson said the task force could lead to the creation of more programs and organizations like hers, where Black women are free to focus on themselves and have vulnerable conversations.\n\"Changing the narrative, so that we can take off that cape, we can take a deep breath and exhale, and we can start to focus on ourselves,\" Lawson said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The location where James Taylor, a 23-year-old Black man, was lynched in 1892.That soil would find its way more than 800 miles south in a powerful message to remember a bleak chapter in history.\nThat journey was followed in the documentary film \"Get on the Bus.\"\nForty-two Kent County youths and adults made the trek, traveling to Civil Rights era landmarks in Alabama and Georgia, including the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; the King Center in Atlanta, Edmund Pettus Bridge and the National Voting Rights Museum in Selma and the Equal Justice Initiative's Community Remembrance Project in Montgomery.\nDirected by Justinian Dispenza of Andover Media, the film debuted on Valentine's Day at the Decker Theatre in Washington College with almost 200 people in attendance. it was also shown the at Ocean City Film Festival earlier this month.\nAfter its debut, the powerful emotions it invoked resulted in people interested in screening it.\nFor Dispenza, it's uplifting to see his work yielding these results.\n\"That's what we're all aiming to do as filmmakers. To make a change in people's lives. It was an incredible experience,\" he said.\nAs people left the theatre, Dispenza reflected on the process of creating \"Get on the Bus\" in slight awe.\nBecause it did not start out as being a film.\nThe idea initially came from Program Director of Minary's Dream Alliance Paul Tue III and Co-Chair of the James Taylor Justice Coalition Philip Dutton, to take a trip, educating people about the past, to the roots of the Civil Rights Movement, Alabama.\nWhat started as a field trip where Dispenza was brought on to take pictures became something else.\nDispenza, no stranger to films about social issues, was eager.\nExcept there were obstacles.\nBefore they left, he was diagnosed with Lyme's Disease. Forced to take antibiotics on the road, he was told by his doctor to avoid the sun.\n\"That's kinda tough to do, July in the Deep South,\" Dispenza said, laughing.\nIt was five days in that sweltering heat with cameras rolling 24-7, no cloud in sight.\nWhile he and Lead Editor Tanner Presswood filmed, Dispenza used long sleeves like protective gear and a floppy hat to ward off the sun.\nPerhaps if he didn't feel a strong sense of purpose, he would have thought of his discomfort more than three times in the trip. But seeing through the lens of time how racism was a way of life for many, which seemed like a different universe to him, busied him in a beneficial way.\nThey went to sites like the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, where on Sunday, September 15, 1963, at 10:22 a.m., the church became known around the world when a bomb exploded, killing four young girls attending Sunday School.\nEastern Shore girls the age of those victims read that and marveled.\n\"How can someone hate someone so much that they could hurt them and have no consideration in their heart?\" Love Jackson asked.\nAs they ascended the steps to the upper part of the church they witnessed a reenactment of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.\nOvercome by the strong feelings standing where King stood, Pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Chestertown Joel Tolbert opened up.\n\"I sit in the pulpit every Sunday. But I tried to stand in that pulpit...it's a hard space,\" he acknowledged.\nThe emotions would heighten.\nJust down the road there were statues of attack dogs, replicas of what Black people faced in 1963. There was a statue of children against the wall in a firing line and statues of enslaved people in chains, heads down in despair.\nBroadcasted at the The National Memorial for Peace and Justice were some of the reasons they were lynched, horrific in their simplicity and ignorance.\nOne was lynched for not tipping his hat to the police officer.\nAnother to yield a better return in the sharecropping business.\nThere was one, where, since a man could not be found, his 2-year-old daughter was lynched in his place.\nThe group journeyed to Selma. At the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they crossed as others did in 1965, knowing that beatings, dogs and water hoses waited for them on the other side.\nFounder of Minary's Dream Alliance, Doncella Wilson, felt that weight. Crossing the same bridge that 600 Civil Rights marchers crossed, she had to stop in the middle and reflect, before walking on., head high.\nThe camera captured the moment.\nInside the Equal Justice Initiative Museum while delivering the soil as an addition to the Legacy Museum, Dispenza broke down himself.\nHe sat on the floor and cried, having taken some ownership of the atrocities committed. But through that pain and despair, the tears and sorrow, shone hope.\n\"People were not afraid to be vulnerable,\" Dispenza said. \"It led to healing.\"\nThey were receptive to the filming process too, seeing it as a tool to do good. \"It was a tough film but a beautiful film,\" Dispenza said.\nAnd the results of the film did not leave people in despair.\nOne resident leaving Decker Theatre told him the film \"had given him a peace and hope he's never had before.\"\nThroughout the film there were positive messages to the youth. Wilson told a group of children the activists they have read about and heard were no older than they were. Tue told the youths they don't know how powerful they are.\nDispenza's film echoed with its audience as well. After the debut, it has been featured at the Bill Johnson Film Festival in Indiana.\nTue, who was with them through the entire trip, was amazed at how the footage was compiled altogether.\nHe told Dispenza, \"My God, this is going places!\"\nWith eight or nine screenings already having taken place, he was certainly not wrong.\nDispenza sees this as an urgent message to spread. \"This conversation needs to be had as school districts try to suppress Critical Race Theory,\" he said.\nIt is a topic debated among educational groups. Dispenza is more than happy to pursue these challenges and encouraged those who have great story ideas to reach out to him at Andover Media.\nFor more of his projects, visit his Imdb page at imdb.com/name/nm14340956/ as well. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Under the employ of John Silcox, from Kennedyville, Taylor was accused of the rape of the former's 11-year-old daughter. When captured, he was brought to Chestertown and thrown in jail.\nRecords indicate that the Sheriff made attempts to keep Taylor away from the almost 500 people demanding him lynched.\nEventually, on May 19, \"a body of masked men carrying an assortment of weapons forced the Sheriff to open the (jail) door.\"\nThey busted in with a sledgehammer and hung Taylor's body outside of town limits. On Cross Street, they then hung Taylor on a tree.\nThere are reports that the mob met with Chestertown officials and agreed on terms of the lynching.\nIt couldn't be in the town, and they could not mutilate the body.\nTaylor proclaimed his innocence up to the hour of his death, as reported by The Sun. The people who killed him were not brought to justice.\nIt was this tragic story, Dutton, co-chair of the James Taylor Justice Coalition, wants remembered.\nHis organization is creating a marker in Taylor's honor and have been in talks with the town for several months about where to place it.\nDuring the March 4 Mayor and Council meeting, Dutton addressed town officials.\nHe wants the marker placed at Fountain Park. \"Chestertown can acknowledge the past failures and own up to the truth of the past to get healing in the future,\" he said.\nBy placing it there, the town would be sending a strong message to the public, he added.\nDutton shared support he's received for choosing this location, including that of Millington Mayor Kevin Hemstock.\nThere, it attracts more pedestrian traffic and sends a strong message about the town's diversity.\nFailure to do so sends the opposite message, Dutton believes.\nHowever, there are three proposed sites the marker could go — Fountain Park, the Kent County Courthouse or on Cross Street, beside Town Hall.\nThere are complications and arguments to be made for all locations.\nAt Cross Street, where Taylor was lynched, the council would need to seek approval from the State Highway Administration.\n\"Cross Street doesn't seem like a state road but it is,\" pointed out Mayor David Foster.\nDutton saw this location as a \"slap in the face,\" because there is already a marker there, for George Vickers, a known racist, he said.\nA member from the audience proposed Vicker's marker be removed and Taylor's put in its place.\nCouncil member Tim O' Brien said he'd study up on the issue further for future meetings.\nFor those arguing for the courthouse, there is historical precedence there too. As a resident pointed out, it's where the injustice began.\nDespite these reasons, Dutton maintained the park is the best fit.\nHowever, a member of the Chestertown Garden Club objected to this location. In her opinion, the club worked hard for years to beautify that area. She said it was once almost destined to be a parking lot and then sidewalks, lighting, trees and shrubs were put in to make a \"peaceful green place.\"\nShe said by putting it there, it might open up the floodgates.\nDutton said it was disingenuous of the Garden Club to not want a marker when they already have one.\nHe quoted Scott Ellsworth, author of the \"Groundbreaking,\" a book about the Tulsa Race Massacre in 1921, \"History is not just a chronicle of events but a mirror of where we want to be.\"\nHe made an appeal to the council.\n\"The town did a great injustice to Taylor. We have to announce those days are over. Putting a marker in Fountain Park will just be the thing to do that.\"\nFoster and the council seemingly agree the marker should be displayed, but haven't decided on the best location yet. They said the matter would be discussed further in upcoming sessions. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The state's attorney's office released the information Friday afternoon.According to charging documents filed by the Maryland State Police, the students displayed swastikas, made Nazi salutes and directed offensive comments to a classmate because of the classmate's religious beliefs.\nThe state's attorney's office press release stated the behavior began last December and \"continued over several months despite repeated requests to stop.\"\nThe matter was reported to the state police, who investigated and filed the charges against the juveniles. The press release does not report the names or genders of the charged students.\nThe charges will be forwarded to the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services for appropriate action. That entity has the discretion to refer the charges to the Calvert County Circuit Court for a hearing. The state's attorney's office then would be required to prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\"Calvert County Public Schools is committed to providing students and staff with an environment that is safe, welcoming and free from all forms of discrimination,\" Susan Johnson, chief academic officer and spokesperson for the school system, said in a statement released Monday. \"The civil rights of all individuals will be protected. All complaints are investigated promptly. Upon completion of an investigation, students and school personnel may be subject to disciplinary action or consequences for discriminatory behaviors.\"\nCalvert County State's Attorney Robert Harvey (R) issued a statement last Friday.\n\"Maryland was founded on the principle of religious toleration,\" Harvey said in the statement. \"It is frankly astonishing that nearly 400 years later some people continue to persecute others based upon their religion. I call upon parents, educators and community and faith leaders to make sure that our children know that religious persecution has no place in our society.\"\nOn Tuesday, Commissioner President Earl F. \"Buddy\" Hance (R) stated, \"We will not tolerate hate speech. That's not who we are. I hope they [juveniles] get the counseling that they need.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Settlement calls for apology, restorative measures in Federalsburg voting rights case\n\n April 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 921\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n FEDERALSBURG — Plaintiffs in a historic lawsuit against Federalsburg this week reached a $260,000 settlement that includes an apology to the town's Black residents and other requirements memorializing the case.At a table in the newly opened Harlem's Kitchen restaurant in Federalsburg, two Black residents of the town, Roberta Butler and Jeff Stevenson Jr., sat down Friday to discuss shifts in their hometown.\nMuch of the change in Federalsburg is visible. On Sept. 26, the town elected its first two Black council members, a result of the lawsuit leading to the town's settlement with the Caroline County branch of the NAACP, the Caucus of African American Leaders and Federalsburg residents regarding its discriminatory election system.\n\"It's a work in progress,\" Butler said. \"But I think we will get there.\"\nThe settlement is seen by many as not only a step forward for Federalsburg, but for the nation.\nThe conversation between the two Federalsburg residents echoed those happening throughout the town. Butler said Federalsburg's historically Black community is happy about the settlement.\nFor Butler, who was a plaintiff in the lawsuit, it's about the future generations. She said her grandchildren are \"very excited\" and added that if you talked with her granddaughter, her granddaughter would say \"'My mom mom is doing this for me.\"\n\"I'm proud of all my grandkids,\" Butler said. \"I'm doing it for them.\"\nStevenson, who was not named in the lawsuit but who ran for mayor in the September election, said a lot of the town's Black residents just want to see change.\n\"We just hope that they take us (seriously),\" he said.\nThe April 1 settlement includes a sweeping array of measures aimed at providing reconciliation after Federalsburg's previous at-large election system was determined to have prevented Black residents from electing their chosen representatives.\nThe town's Black population has grown steadily over the years, with Black residents now accounting for about 43% of the roughly 2,800-resident population.\nBut until last September, the town had never had Black representatives on the Town Council in its 200-year history.\nThe settlement came just over a year after the plaintiffs filed suit in federal court in Baltimore under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Through months of charter amendments, legislation and federal court rulings, the town's previous at-large election system was changed in June to a two-district system to ensure more representation of Federalsburg's Black residents. District 1 has a 64% Black population and District 2 is predominantly white.\nTwo Black women were elected to the Town Council during Federalsburg's Sept. 26 election — Darlene Pitt Hammond and Brandy James.\nThe settlement calls for a total of $260,000 in legal fees to be paid by the town to the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland Foundation. Within 30 days of the agreement, $50,000 to be paid to the ACLU, then $35,000 every October between 2025 and 2030.\nUnder the settlement, the town will be required to:\nDeliver an official signed and written apology addressed to those who brought the lawsuit. This apology will be framed and posed permanently in Federalsburg's town hall.\nAffix a plaque \"marking the town's voting rights victory brought about through the contributions of the Plaintiffs in this case\" to the town hall building.\nCreate a photo display in conjunction with the historical society and the plaintiffs featuring Black community contributions to the town, which will be displayed at town hall.\nRename Gerardi Boulevard to Brooklyn Avenue.\nErect a historical marker in the town's Black community of Brooklyn celebrating the contributions of the neighborhood's residents and their ancestors.\nProclaim Sept. 26 as Voting Rights Day in recognition of Black voters' historic win on that date in 2023.\nCreate a town committee to focus on community engagement in future elections and matters related to the promotion, engagement and enhancement of the town's diverse community. At least one elected town official and two community members from each election district will serve on the committee.\nEstablish an annual multicultural celebration for the town.\n\"The Town of Federalsburg formally acknowledges responsibility and expresses its deep regret for actions and inactions contributing to racial discrimination and exclusion of Black residents, including its use of an election system that prevented any Black person from holding a position on the Town Council over 200 years,\" reads the town's written apology. \"As officials of the Town, we accept moral accountability for the harms these actions inflicted upon Black residents, their families, and ancestors before them.\"\nCarl Snowden, convener of the Caucus of African American Leaders, said that in his more than 30 years of involvement in voting rights cases, he has never before seen a municipality willing to admit its wrongs and apologize for it.\nHe said this \"historic landmark decision\" is bigger than Federalsburg.\n\"What Federalsburg has done is become a model to what can happen throughout Maryland and the rest of the nation,\" he said.\nSnowden said he will use Federalsburg as a model in other cases the caucus takes on.\nWillie Woods, president of the Caroline County branch of the NAACP called the settlement rewarding.\nShe said they are focusing on what has been accomplished and plan to build on that success moving forward.\n\"Build on the foundation that's been put in place,\" Woods said.\nAn event to celebrate the settlement is in the works.\n\"There's a degree of optimism when you have achieved something you worked hard for and you wondered if it would come to pass,\" Woods said. \"And to see that that has happened — Yes, that's going to be a major celebration.\"\nSince the settlement, Butler has been thinking about her parents, grandparents and other Black Federalsburg residents that are no longer alive.\n\"I just wish my ancestors could have seen this,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Civil rights group calls for Malkus Bridge to be renamed\n\n April 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WENDY WEITZEL wweitzel@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1046\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In a virtual meeting Monday morning, the Caucus of African American Leaders voted to ask state officials to rename the Frederick C. Malkus Jr. Bridge, citing Malkus' \"resistance to desegregation.\"The group, a statewide consortium of civil rights groups including the NAACP, the United Black Clergy of Maryland and others, hand-delivered a resolution with their recommendation to Gov. Wes Moore's desk later Monday, according to Carl Snowden, convener of the caucus. Snowden said the group would continue discussions on the matter in their quarterly meetings with the governor to address any future steps.\nThe bridge was named for Frederick C. Malkus Jr., a long-serving state legislator from near Cambridge who was instrumental in finding the funding for the bridge's ultimate construction. The structure spans the Choptank River between Talbot and Dorchester counties.\n\"They recommend that Senator Frederick Malkus Memorial Bridge be renamed in honor of the late Gloria Richardson, a pioneer in civil rights and a leader in the State of Maryland,\" read a press release sent out immediately following the vote. \"The late Governor Harry R. Hughes opposed naming the bridge after Senator Malkus because of Malkus' resistance to desegregation in the 1960s and 1970s.\"\nThe caucus also passed a resolution calling for state officials to consider renaming of the Francis Scott Key Memorial Bridge, which collapsed last month after being struck by a cargo ship, resulting in the death of six construction workers who were performing late night repairs to the bridge.\n\"The Francis Scott Key Bridge was named in honor of a man who enslaved African Americans and wrote lyrics that scholars have indicated demeaned Black people,\" the Monday morning press release said.\nWith the 2024 General Assembly drawing to a close late Monday, Snowden said he did not anticipate any actions resulting from the caucus' resolutions until the next legislative session at the earliest.\n\"This may come up as early as next session. It's too late for it to happen now, but certainly in 2025 it may very well come up as an issue,\" he said.\nWhen Malkus retired from the Maryland Senate in 1994, he had spent nearly five decades as a legislator.\nIn the 1960s, while Cambridge was going through protests against racial discrimination and Freedom Riders challenged the region's deeply rooted segregation, Malkus' civil rights voting record largely reflected the segregationist views of his mostly white, rural constituency.\nThe Baltimore Sun referred to him in 1966 as a \"consistent opponent of civil rights legislation.\"\nIn 1962, then Gov. J. Millard Tawes called a special session of the Maryland General Assembly to consider a public accommodations law that would outlaw racial discrimination in inns, hotels, restaurants and other similar establishments.\nThe Eastern Shore contingent, led by Malkus, opposed the bill, and through their efforts, a provision was added to the legislation allowing counties to exempt themselves from the statute, according to Peter Levy, author of \"Civil War on Race Street: The Civil Rights Movement in Cambridge, Maryland.\"\nLevy wrote that Malkus participated in a debate on civil rights with then-Gov. of Alabama George Wallace at Goucher College in Towson, during which Malkus and Wallace denounced pending civil rights legislation as un-American.\nAt that debate, Malkus blamed Richardson and outsiders for the race-related troubles in Cambridge at the time, Levy said.\nRichardson was best known as the leader of the Cambridge Movement, a struggle for civil rights and economic opportunities for Black people in Cambridge in the early 1960s.\nIn July 1963, Attorney General Robert Kennedy — who Richardson had asked earlier to provide protection for demonstrators' constitutional rights — met with Richardson, other civil rights activists and government officials to broker the Treaty of Cambridge, an agreement covering desegregation, housing and employment issues.\nSnowden said past calls to rename the Malkus Bridge have drawn opposition.\n\"This has been controversial from day one,\" he said in an interview with the Star Democrat, \"and it's not unusual before decisions like this are made that it's a protracted, long, sometimes intense debate on whether or not to do it.\"\n\"We're under no illusion that there won't be opposition to this, as there has been in the past,\" Snowden said. \"The difference however is that more and more people are now becoming aware that these bridges, as well as public structures, are paid for by the taxpayers. And the question becomes, when you have a particular bridge named after someone, that person should be someone that represents all taxpayers.\"\nThose who want to see the bridge's name preserved have, in past discussions on the matter, pointed to Malkus' role in seeing the structure built.\nLater in his career, Malkus' efforts were instrumental in having the four-lane bridge that currently bears his name constructed. The bridge spanning the Choptank River replaced the deteriorating Emerson Harrington Bridge, a two-lane drawbridge constructed in the 1930s that struggled to keep up with the changing traffic needs on the Eastern Shore following the construction of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.\nFor several years, Malkus introduced legislation in the General Assembly calling for the bridge's replacement. The Washington Post quoted the state senator in 1980 as saying, \"This is one we're gonna win, not because they have any great love for us country boys but because the city boys will have a hell of a time getting to Ocean City without it.\"\nMalkus introduced the bill that would ultimately lead to the bridge's construction with funding from a newly-enacted gas tax in 1985. The bridge was opened in 1987.\nAfter the General Assembly passed legislation officially naming the bridge after Malkus, an unusual move given that Malkus was still alive at the time, then-Gov. Harry Hughes vetoed the bill.\nThe state legislature's override of Hughes' veto passed unanimously, according to a Washington Post article written for Malkus' retirement.\nSnowden said that the caucus' call to rename the Malkus and Key bridges came in the wake of several recent efforts it has supported questioning monuments to controversial figures from history. This included the push to remove the Talbot Boys statue, a monument to Confederate soldiers, from the Talbot County Court House lawn. The efforts resulted in the statue's relocation in 2022.\n\"There have been five major projects similar to this which we've been successful with,\" Snowden said. \"This is not something that focused just on the Eastern Shore. There's a national effort in the country today to begin to look at who buildings and institutions are named after.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Newark congregation standing strong after historic Black church is targeted with racist graffiti\n\n April 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 704\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A historic Black church near Newark, Delaware, was targeted with racist graffiti and other vandalism recently, forcing the congregation to relocate its Easter services.The damage was discovered Saturday, March 30, at St. Daniel's Community Church of Iron Hill on Whittaker Road. Pastor Joseph Field said he believes it was done sometime overnight Friday into Saturday.\nThe vandals scrawled racial slurs all over the outside wall of the church, including the N-word, references to the KKK and the word \"die.\" They also broke a window.\nAt the same time the vandalism was discovered, the church's heat stopped working, leading to fears that the outdoor propane tank had been tampered with. Field is still trying to determine exactly what happened, but as a precaution, the church canceled its Easter Sunday service and congregants instead attended service at a church in Glasgow.\n\"My first reaction was anger. I don't know why they would do this,\" Field said. \"We don't bother anybody. We come here and worship and then we go home, and we're always willing to help out in the community.\"\nThe church filed a police report, and Field is hopeful the culprits are caught soon.\n\"We don't know who did it. We don't even know the reason why they did it now, so we can't assume too much,\" he said. \"But as far as the racism goes, we know that's the climate in this country right now, unfortunately.\"\nLongtime congregant Donna Johnson was the first to discover the horrifying graffiti when she arrived to clean the church on Saturday. Several generations of her family have attended St. Daniel's, and her great-grandparents are buried in the church's cemetery.\n\"This is not just a building,\" Johnson said. \"This is our lives. This is our heartbeat.\"\nSt. Daniel's, which was recently listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was built in the 1850s, though there is some evidence of the congregation meeting earlier than that. Originally, it served the community of free blacks who lived in the Iron Hill area prior to the Civil War.\nToday, the congregation is small, approximately 20 people, but is a tight-knit community.\n\"We go with what we have. Jesus only walked with 12,\" Field said.\nMost members have longstanding family ties to the church, said Field, who has been pastor for 12 years.\n\"Right here, there's so much togetherness, the way they look out for one another and support one another,\" he added. \"I love that.\"\nField said this is the first time St. Daniel's has been targeted, at least in recent times, but the damage done at the church this weekend appears similar to incidents that have taken place at the nearby Iron Hill Museum, which is housed in a former Black schoolhouse.\nLast fall, the museum president said the property has been the victim of a sustained campaign of vandalism since January 2020. Some of the damage included racial slurs, and the worst came in March 2023 when vandals destroyed signage commemorating the legacy of Iron Hill's Black community.\nFreeman Williams, president of the Newark NAACP, said the vandalism at St. Daniel's is an affront to the church's history and an attempt to denigrate and minimize the role African Americans played in the Iron Hill area.\n\"We're not going to let anyone's actions or activities take away from what this community is all about,\" Williams said. \"It's strong. It's vibrant. The people here have a long legacy of strong families and pulling together. We look at this as a blip on the radar.\"\nWilliams visited the church Monday afternoon to pledge the NAACP's support.\n\"We're not going to stop until we find out who's responsible and we do everything in our power to make sure that person is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" he said.\nField said that, ultimately, the person or people behind the racist graffiti will have to answer to an even higher power.\n\"Because when you desecrate God's house, you're not getting in a fight with me, you're getting in a fight with God, and that's going to come back on you,\" he said.\nUntil then, he has a defiant message for anyone who thinks they can intimidate the congregation.\n\"We're not fearful,\" Field said. \"We're not going anywhere. We're here to stay. We've been here this long, you're not going to chase us away.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Barron said. \"We're serious about representing you, hearing from you.\"\nCommunity members gathered at the Harriet Tubman Center for Cultural and Educational Advancement to hear from Barron and Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Kristen Clarke and ask questions.\nClarke spoke about some of the Justice Department's highest priorities, including fighting hate crimes, holding law enforcement accountable, ensuring equal education opportunities, protecting the right to vote and combatting redlining.\nBarron talked about how civil rights laws can be enforced.\n\"First, you've got to put your money where your mouth is,\" he said.\nBarron said that is the reason he established the Civil Rights and Special Victims Section of the District of Maryland U.S. Attorney's Office.\nHe said that for civil rights laws to be enforced, the department needs to show up and establish a partnership with the community.\n\"That's why we're here,\" he said.\nClarke said there was more she could speak about regarding the efforts of the department.\n\"But we want to hear from you today,\" she said. \"The purpose of this convening is to make sure that we are hearing from and learning from people in this community to ensure that the resources of the Justice Department are put to work to address the most complex and challenging problems that you face here in this community.\"\nDuring the discussion, the Rev. James Jones, convener of the Caucus of African American Leaders on the Eastern Shore, said that people of color receive lengthier and more serious sentences locally and nationwide.\nBarron said he is attuned to this issue. He said that last year it was pointed out to him that the U.S. Attorney's Office doesn't seem to be prosecuting as many people.\n\"I said, 'That's correct because we can do it smartly,'\" Barron said. \"'We can enforce the laws and make our state, make our cities safer without just locking everyone up if we do it with policies that are efficient and smart.'\"\nLareese Cathey-Jackson, founder of the nonprofit Angels At A Distance — a prevention program for local youth — asked how programs like hers can get more funding and resources.\nClarke said that last week, the attorney general announced several new initiatives that would bring support to different communities in the nation.\n\"We're happy to help facilitate and make those connections,\" Clarke said.\nAfter the conversation, Cathey-Jackson said these conversations need to continue and need to be consistent. She said she has been to meetings like this before where those statements just seemed like talk, but she has hope that this one is different.\n\"I don't feel like that coming into this meeting,\" she said. \"I really do feel like they want to move forward.\"\nAlex Green, co-owner of the Harriet Tubman Center for Cultural and Educational Advancement, said it was an honor to host the event in partnership with the Civil Rights Division and the Maryland U.S. Attorney's Office. He said it was great to bring people together for a conversation.\n\"I think it's really essential in today's climate that we have conversations about the things we don't understand,\" he said. \"Because if we don't talk about them, ... We stay in our own little box, and we never come to a consensus or agreement on what we don't understand.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bridge should be named for Gloria Richardson\n\n April 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JIM JOHNSON jjohnson@chespub.com | Section: Columns \n \n 771\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Caucus of African American Leaders this week proposed renaming the Frederick C. Malkus Bridge across the Choptank River to the Gloria Richardson Bridge.The proposal is a good idea and should be approved by the Maryland legislature when it is introduced. Richardson is a far better representative of American values than Malkus was.\nRichardson was a leader in the Civil Rights Movement in Cambridge in the early 1960s, one of the only female leaders of the movement at the time. She was arrested for picketing against a segregated Cambridge business while the National Guard occupied Cambridge.\nHer fiery, steely, fearless personality was captured by an Associated Press photographer as Richardson pushed a bayonet-tipped National Guard rifle away as she moved through a crowd in Cambridge.\nAccording to a Washington Post obituary when Richardson died in July 2021 at age 99, she \"remained uncompromising in her demands for equal access to public accommodations such as white-owned restaurants and bowling alleys. A public-accommodations provision went to referendum in October 1963, but she persuaded followers to boycott the vote. She explained that it was grossly unfair to leave 'the constitutional rights of our people to the whim of a popular majority.'\"\n\"Throughout her life, she spoke truth to power and continued to inspire people around the world — and in her hometown,\" reads Richardson's biography written by the Maryland Commission for Women.\nIn a Star Democrat article written after Richardson's death, Dorchester County Orphans' Court Chief Judge the Rev. George Ames noted leading the movement in Cambridge was not easy.\n\"She was an inspiration because she stood up at a time when people, and women in particular, didn't stand up,\" he said. \"It had to be hard for her.\"\nAfter stepping down from her leadership role, Richardson married photographer Frank Dandridge and moved to New York, where she spent much of her life working on anti-poverty issues and programs for the aging in New York City, according to the Washington Post.\nBy contrast, Frederick C. Malkus, the bridge's current namesake, fought to maintain the second-class status of African Americans in Cambridge and Maryland.\nWhen Malkus retired from the Maryland Senate in 1994, he had spent nearly five decades as a legislator.\nIn the 1960s, while Cambridge was going through protests against racial discrimination and Freedom Riders challenged the region's deeply rooted segregation, Malkus' civil rights voting record largely reflected the segregationist views of his mostly white, rural constituency.\nThe Baltimore Sun referred to him in 1966 as a \"consistent opponent of civil rights legislation.\"\nIn 1962, then Gov. J. Millard Tawes called a special session of the Maryland General Assembly to consider a public accommodations law that would outlaw racial discrimination in inns, hotels, restaurants and other similar establishments.\nThe Eastern Shore contingent, led by Malkus, opposed the bill, and through their efforts, a provision was added to the legislation allowing counties to exempt themselves from the statute, according to Peter Levy, author of \"Civil War on Race Street: The Civil Rights Movement in Cambridge, Maryland.\"\nLevy wrote that Malkus participated in a debate on civil rights with then Alabama Gov. George Wallace at Goucher College in Towson, during which Malkus and Wallace denounced pending civil rights legislation as un-American.\nThe bridge between Talbot and Dorchester counties was not the only one proposed for renaming by the Caucus of African American Leaders this week.\nThe caucus also passed a resolution calling for state officials to rename the Francis Scott Key Memorial Bridge, which collapsed last month after being struck by a cargo ship.\n\"The Francis Scott Key Bridge was named in honor of a man who enslaved African Americans and wrote lyrics that scholars have indicated demeaned Black people,\" a press release from the Caucus of African American Leaders said.\nBoth proposals face opposition.\n\"This has been controversial from Day 1,\" said caucus organizer Carl Snowden in an interview with the Star Democrat this week. \"It's not unusual before decisions like this are made that it's a protracted, long, sometimes intense debate on whether or not to do it.\"\nI hope public officials in Dorchester and Talbot counties endorse this proposal as soon as possible before the intense debate begins.\nGloria Richardson was a leader in the fight for equal rights for African Americans in Cambridge at a time when segregation was the rule. Her words, quoted by the Maryland Commission for Women are as much a beacon today as they were in the 1960s.\n\"A first-class citizen does not beg for freedom,\" Richardson said. \"A first-class citizen does not plead to the power structure to give him something that whites have no power to give or take away. Human rights are human rights, not white rights.\"\nJim Johnson is executive editor of the Star Democrat. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But after the state of emergency ended and prisons filled up again, the share of Black incarcerated people reached a five-year-high late last year, a Capital News Service data analysis has found.In March 2020, around 18,500 people were incarcerated in the state's prisons. By summer 2021, there were almost 4,000 fewer prisoners. Never before had the state prison population decreased so dramatically in just one year.\nSince then, the prison population has swelled again to more than 16,000 people as of last October — still significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels.\nBlack inmates accounted for 72.4% of state prisoners in the last quarter of the fiscal year 2023, although Black people make up less than a third of Maryland's population overall.\nThe share of incarcerated Black people is up from 70% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and higher than the 72% at the beginning of the pandemic, data by the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services reveals.\n\"One percentage point in this context is quite substantial,\" Brennan Klein, associate research scientist at Northeastern University, told CNS. Since prisons incarcerate large populations, even small changes can be significant, he added.\nKlein was the lead author of an earlier study published in the science journal Nature that found sharp increases in the share of Black and Latino prisoners at the beginning of the pandemic across the nation. Maryland was among only five states that did not follow the national trend.\nIn fact, the share of Black prisoners declined while Maryland was under the coronavirus state of emergency. Only after it ended, the percentage of Black people incarcerated in state prisons climbed.\nIn October, Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown and Public Defender Natasha Dartigue announced a new partnership to reduce mass incarceration of Black people in the state.\n\"It is a sad reality that the vast majority of people who have been removed from communities across the country and put behind bars are Black,\" Brown said in a press release.\nThe Maryland Equitable Justice Collaborative, which brings together government, academic and criminal justice experts, will present plans for reforms early next year.\nFour years ago, then-Gov. Larry Hogan issued an executive order to slow the spread of the coronavirus in prisons.\nThose scheduled to leave within the next four months were eligible for early release. Incarcerated people over the age of 60 were considered for accelerated parole if they had a good record, a home plan and had not been convicted of a violent crime or sexual offense.\nAccording to the DPSCS, 484 people were eligible to leave prison. Department spokesperson Latoya Gray said that Hogan's executive order made accelerated placements in home detention possible. According to her, placements stayed 30% higher a year after the first executive order.\nA second Hogan executive order came in November 2020, again allowing early releases for a fraction of prisoners.\nThese early releases likely had a negligible effect on the total size of prison population.\nThe number of prison intakes, however, dropped sharply in the first pandemic year. Right before the coronavirus hit Maryland in March 2020, the intakes hovered around just under 450 per month. In April, only three people were incarcerated. All of them were Black men.\nIn the same month, 515 people left state prison. A lack of intakes while releases continued caused a significant reduction in the state's prison population.\nNationwide, lower crime rates and court closures halted incarceration early in the pandemic. This caused a historic drop in prison populations, but also exacerbated racial inequalities, according to Klein's study.\nKlein traced back racial disparities to differences in sentence lengths. Black people are more likely to serve long sentences and white people tend to be incarcerated for shorter periods.\n\"On any given day, if someone's being released, they're more likely to be white,\" Klein said.\nMaryland data shows that Black prisoners are much more likely to serve sentences longer than 25 years. According to Klein, the pandemic effect was weakened because the state hands out fewer short sentences overall, slowing down turnover that mostly benefited white prisoners in other parts of the nation.\nStill, racial disparity in Maryland prisons is more than double the national average, according to a 2019 report by the Justice Policy Institute, a think tank that aims to reduce mass incarceration.\nThe Justice Policy Institute found that incarcerated people disproportionately come from poor communities such as Southwest Baltimore. A 2022 report established a connection between incarceration and neighborhoods with high unemployment, low income and fewer people with a high school diploma.\n\"Instead of investing in those communities, the state has invested into the justice system,\" said Keith Wallington, director of advocacy at the Justice Policy Institute.\nExperiencing the spread of the coronavirus behind bars was scary, people incarcerated in Maryland told researchers.\nPoor ventilation and close quarters can contribute to the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, Lauren Porter, associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Maryland, told CNS.\nAccording to the Covid Prison Project, Maryland prisons had a lower COVID-19 death rate than the general population. Again, the state was an outlier.\nThose leaving prison at the height of measures against the pandemic faced challenges as well.\n\"There's an incredibly high risk of death immediately following release, especially from things like overdose,\" Porter said.\n\"The liquor store was open during COVID, but not the reentry programs,\" said Janette Graham, founder of the reentry service organization No Struggle No Success. During the stay-at-home orders, newly released people couldn't immediately access in-person services, such as substance abuse therapy, she said.\nJacob Kang-Brown, research fellow at the criminal justice nonprofit Vera Institute of Justice, said that the tight labor market might have actually helped those trying to re-enter society after serving time in prison.\nHe predicted that states will continue to explore large releases of people from prison \"as a way to correct years and years of heavy sentences.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bush, Starr Center for the Study of the American at Washington College Deputy Director Jaelon T. Moaney, St. Mary's College of Maryland senior Phoebe Tate and Roderick Lewis, who is Sen. Ben Cardin's Southern Maryland field representative.\n\"They are incredible leaders who are starting to move forward in this world,\" Historic Sotterley Executive Director Nancy Easterling said of the panel, \"and making a real difference, and their ideas and perspectives will be appreciated.\"\nA news release stated the Civil Rights Act was a milestone in American democracy and justice, dismantling Jim Crow laws and paving a way for racial and gender equality. But with all the progress made, equality is still something that eludes many in the nation.\n\"Sixty years might seem like a long time ago for some of us,\" Bush said. \"But as they say, 'Time and even age are relative.' To put it into perspective, in our world today there is an affinity to denigrate young voices because of their lack of experience or they need to show respect. However, we forget that many of the voices that led to the Civil Rights Movement belonged to young people, especially for them to say, 'Enough.' Young people have been leaders and voices of change, and over time were proven that they were correct.\"\nThe panel discussed how they view the progress that has been made in the previous 60 years, and the challenges that they feel we still see face today.\n\"One of the greatest achievements of the Civil Rights Movement is the ability for people of diverse backgrounds to actually come together and actually have the opportunity to interact with one another,\" Tate said. \"It also gives many voices that have been marginalized and disenfranchised for much of the history of this country to have that opportunity to join in.\"\nBush asked how the Civil Rights Act of 1964 impacted the panelists' lives and those around them.\n\"I see it as a guarantee that I am valued pretty much in the workplace,\" said Tate, who interned at Historic Sotterley last year and is working on a St. Mary's Project adapting slave narratives into a graphic novel. \"And no matter what, I cannot be discriminated against, and if this does happen I have the backings of the legality and the government that this cannot stand.\"\n\"I immediately think to what type of opportunities my grandparents, my parents would have had if it wasn't for the Civil Rights Amendment, let alone the opportunities my siblings and I would have been able to have,\" said Lewis, who is a graduate of St. Mary's College of Maryland and a member of the St. Mary's NAACP. \"It really opened up society in many ways for Black Americans to have access to spaces that they were not allowed to be in before, so it was a major achievement in the struggle to advance civil rights in this country. It's really hard to think how life would be without it.\"\nBush welcomed Moaney to the conversation, whose appearance had been delayed by computer issues.\n\"Much like the theme for tonight's conversation is 'We Prevail,' I'm grateful to have gotten over those technical difficulties,\" said Moaney, who is a descendant of founding Black families in Kent and Talbot counties, and who was appointed by Gov. Wes Moore to the Maryland Commission on African American History & Culture.\nBush asked the panelists what challenges still exist in achieving true equity for all regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation or identities.\n\"We need to be very cautious about who we're speaking on behalf and for,\" Moaney said. \"I think there are so many well-intentioned people, eager people intent on joining those on the side of equality, but it is dangerous territory to be paraphrasing and even to the extent of appropriating. We still stand to benefit from hearing so many more voices, and I don't want us to leave this call thinking that solely precluded to those being elected.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Group remembers thwarted slave escape from D.C.\n\n April 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: HAILEY CLOSSON Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 797\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Rev. Brian Hamilton tapped his microphone, signaling the beginning of his service at Westminster Presbyterian Church in honor of the 176th anniversary of the greatest attempted escape of enslaved people in American history — which happened in Washington.\"Resistance is a mandate then and now … you and I have a ton of work to do,\" Hamilton told the Sunday crowd.\nSeventy-seven enslaved men, women, and children made the abortive attempt on April 15, 1848, to flee the slave-holding District of Columbia for freedom in the North.\nThe church has been commemorating the event for four years.\nIt was a Saturday evening when the 77 enslaved people gathered to board a two-masted vessel called The Pearl. A formerly enslaved man named Daniel Bell drew up the escape plan after he and his wife lost a case to free their six children through the court system, according to the history YouTube channel CuriousPeople.\nBell contacted abolitionist Capt. Daniel Drayton, who agreed to lead the ship's journey and rounded up as many enslaved people as he could ahead of their departure. Full families snuck away from their plantations, beating Washington's 10 p.m. curfew for all Black residents, and boarded the ship.\nDrayton intended to sail down Washington's southwest waterfront and down the Potomac River to the Chesapeake Bay and break north to freedom, according to The Pearl Initiative, a Washington community group dedicated to spreading awareness about the escape.\nBut meager winds prevented the ship from sailing away to safety. Without the cover of darkness, The Pearl was spotted the following morning by a slaveholder who noticed several of his slaves were missing and overtook the ship with a mob on his steamboat Salem, according to CuriousPeople.\nThe 77 escapees were shackled, returned to Washington, and resold by their owners to Southern plantations. Many families were separated during the tragedy. Records detail the lives of a few after their capture.\nA woman named Grace Russell was among the captured. Her family saved her at an auction in Richmond, Virginia, but could not afford to save her sister, Emily, when she was sold two years later by the same person who enslaved Grace, according to The Pearl Initiative.\n\"Oh mother, my dear mother, come see your distressed and heartbroken daughter once more,\" wrote Emily Russell to her mother from Bruin Jail in Alexandria, Virginia. Emily Russell died soon after on a coffle traveling to the South.\nWestminster Presbyterian Church was founded in 1853, five years after The Pearl incident.\n\"This is extremely important for us because Westminster is totally committed to inclusion and diversity… So the Pearl project was a natural when we realized that this whole thing happened right in our backyard,\" Hamilton said.\nThe institution of the church historically has served as a forum for social justice initiatives and community-building for African Americans. Churches have played an instrumental role in mobilizing political action, such as during the civil rights movement.\nWashington native Sonia Adams brought her son Joseph to The Pearl remembrance so he could learn African American history. She had seen a brochure about the event at a local library.\n\"Social justice wouldn't be what it is without the African American church because that was our basis,\" Adams said. \"That was the framework for social justice here in America and continues to be. … It plays a role because you have community and the community is working together to solve this problem.\"\nThe story of The Pearl helped to fuel the abolitionist movement and inspired anti-slavery publications.\nAuthor and renowned abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe began her 1852 novel \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" as a series of installments in a Washington newspaper.\nWhile raising money to try to free members seized aboard The Pearl, Stowe produced a follow-up novel in 1854 called \"The Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" The book told stories of enslaved people, including those on The Pearl, to dispel national skepticism of the conditions she described in her previous novel.\nHamilton and The Pearl Initiative held a procession on Monday at Washington's southwest waterfront with community members to read the names of the passengers on The Pearl and toss flowers into the Potomac as a tribute.\nDr. Christopher Williams, a resident of the neighborhood and board member of The Pearl Initiative, said that during his time at the organization, people told him that they did not know the story of the escape attempt on the ship.\nWilliams said that the story of The Pearl invites Americans to \"return to their origin story.\"\n\"We cannot be that kind of society where we fail to remember. … Given how highly consequential The Pearl escape was, it would not be in our interest to forget and not be able to contextualize these historic figures,\" Williams said. \"If we become ignorant of history, who are we really? Do we really know who we are? Do we really know ourselves?\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Malkus led the Maryland opposition to defeat Maryland's 1962 Civil Rights bill, as proposed in the federal Civil Rights bill created to outlaw racial discrimination. This was the primary legislation outlining today's law of the land. When Malkus and a few other segregationists failed, he led the group to try to exempt individual counties from state legislation. Again, that failed, but in return, Malkus then tried to exempt bars from the accommodations portion of the bill.All of his various efforts to dilute the national and state civil rights bills failed, and the landmark national bill passed with the Maryland legislature complying.He publicly decried civil rights legislation of any kind as being \"un-American.\"He proposed a bill to provide criminal penalties for anyone claiming discrimination.He proposed a bill that would make it a crime to make false statements about a community — another unconstitutional act. He continually blamed the media and \"outsiders\" for all of Cambridge's troubles, without helping to correct its real economic and racial problems.He voted against the repeal of a state law forbidding interracial marriage.On national TV, he said Martin Luther King was a \"communist troublemaker\" and Gloria Richardson was a \"media-hungry agitator.\"He publicly supported Gov. George Wallace's bid for president in 1964.At a Goucher College televised conference with Gov. Wallace, he said, \"Cambridge's Nonviolent Action Committee employed the same tactics as Hitler.\"He sent a letter to President John Kennedy complaining that his attack by three black boys in Baltimore was not given as much news coverage as the shooting of Medgar Evers. This is the only letter on record to either President Kennedy or Attorney General Robert Kennedy addressing the issue of racial problems in Cambridge with an attempt to calm the issue – an odd letter for a state senator (of the same party), who never asked for federal assistance.\nCorrection: Gov. Hughes did not veto the building of the bridge – he vetoed naming the bridge after Sen. Malkus. The governor said: \"It didn't seem right for the bridge to be named after the state's staunchest segregationist.\"\nPATRICK HORNBERGER\nTrappe \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We had a lot of older generations that had a lot of knowledge of what happened and it was never told to the kids, so the kids never knew what was going on.\"\nThe event also included exhibits featuring historical and cultural institutions, authors, quilts and poetry.\n\"They're amazing. They're just so detailed,\" St. Mary's College North Campus Area Coordinator Meghan Pushee said as she gazed at story quilts. \"I love the collage aspect and the multi-media aspect. I'm in awe of them.\"\nLater, speakers took to the stage at the Nancy R. & Norton T. Dodge Performing Arts Center on campus.\n\"Now, more than ever we must expand this history in your voice, from your memory, from your attics, from your archives,\" Southern Maryland Equity in History Coalition Hugh Davies said. \"Let us commit to doing so to bring this history forward.\"\nThe event was dedicated to longtime Calvert County NAACP officer Malcolm Funn, who died in 2022.\n\"It has been said that before we can travel forward or even truly understand why we're here today, one must understand the past,\" Piscataway Conoy Tribe Tribal Chairman Francis Gray said. \"History is our willingness to connect the past to the present. It provides us with a sense of purpose, of who we are, a sense of being … and it's here that we all have the opportunity to obtain that knowledge. The Piscataway Conoy people are excited to have this opportunity to unearth the narrative of Maryland's history.\"\nSt. Mary's College Community Affairs Liaison Kelsey R.

The ancestry and history of all … will be accessible to all. Our ancestors would be proud.\"\n\"Since all stories start at the beginning, we have started by working directly with the Piscataway people to see if this was a story they would trust to be told,\" Southern Maryland National Heritage Area Executive Director Lucille Walker said. \"That's why this particular initiative is so critical. Because why are we telling any stories if we're not telling the whole story? If we're not doing it for the next generation then what are we doing?\"\nThe coalition, which is administered by \"Big Conversation: Partners in Dismantling Racism and Privilege in Southern Maryland,\" which was started at Middleham and St. Peter's Episcopal Parish in Lusby, and is supported by public school systems, libraries, museums, colleges and churches.\nSt. Mary's College President Tuajuanda Jordan said the coalition \"is a testament to the realization that we have work to do to create and sustain an inclusive community free of racism and prejudice.\"\nFor more information or to see the new website, go to www.equityinhistory.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The display featured color-coded flags representing the groups of people who were killed in the Holocaust. It was approved by the university, and similar displays have been set up in previous years.\nWitnesses saw Kandeel damaging 10 flags and spitting on them. They also heard her say \"Fn n n the Jews,\" \"Jewish people are nasty, free Palestine\" and other vulgar statements, according to court documents.\nWitnesses called police, and dispatchers were able to use security cameras to watch the incident in realtime. Police responded and stopped Kandeel as she was walking away.\nKandeel told officers that she was \"frustrated and triggered\" by the Holocaust memorial and admitted to damaging the flags out of frustration, according to court documents.\nA resident of Pennsylvania, Kandeel has been banned from campus.\nUD reportedly mentioned the arrest in an email to students but did not disclose the incident publicly, as it typically does when there is a significant crime on campus.\nThe incident was not announced publicly until five days later, when Attorney General Kathy Jennings issued a statement condemning the antisemitic vandalism on Monday.\n\"We have a proud history of protecting free speech in this country, including and especially political dissent,\" Jennings said. \"But we need to be lucid enough to recognize the daylight — miles of it, in this case — between protest and hate. The Holocaust is not ancient history. Eighty years later, the world's Jewish population still has not recovered; its survivors are still with us; and I fear that we still have not learned its lessons. Seeing this ignorance on display, particularly in an increasingly antisemitic climate, should be a wake-up call. We still have work to do.\"\nA UD spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn April, an earlier display set up by Jewish students was vandalized three times within a 24-hour period. The final time, someone picked up all the flags and threw them in a trash can.\nThat display on the UD Green was intended to mark the six-month anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, in which Hamas militants killed more than 1,000 people and kidnapped hundreds more. It featured hundreds of tiny Israeli flags, some arranged to form a Star of David, as well as signs featuring photos of the hostages and the message \"Bring them home now.\"\nUD Police said that incident was investigated as a hate crime, but no arrests were announced.\nThe incidents at UD come as campuses nationwide deal with tensions related to the Israel-Hamas war. Many campuses have seen large protests by students condemning Israel, some of which have drawn accusations of antisemitism.\nAt UD, pro-Palestinian students held a march and a small, three-day \"occupation\" outside the Biden School of Public Policy and Administration last month, but it remained calm and peaceful. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Police investigating after council meeting is disrupted by racial slurs\n\n May 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 485\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Police in Delaware have launched an investigation after a Newark City Council meeting was disrupted by online provocateurs yelling racial slurs — including the n-word.The incident happened May 13, shortly after the meeting began.\nNewark allows members of the public to participate virtually through the Microsoft Teams online teleconferencing platform.\nTwo of the virtual participants — it appeared to be a female voice, followed by a male voice — unmuted their microphones during a presentation by a University of Delaware representative and suddenly began yelling racist remarks. The comments, which included the n-word, were audible to everyone attending the meeting in person as well as online.\nShocked council members quickly condemned the comments.\n\"I can tell you that this government and this public body absolutely finds comments like that to be absolutely abhorrent,\" Mayor Jerry Clifton said. \"No one in this government endorses or agrees with that kind of comment and language. I want to tell the people online and the people here, on behalf of the seven of us on city council and our staff, that we're sorry that happened. We're sorry you had to hear that.\"\nCouncilwoman Dwendolyn Creecy, the first and only Black woman to serve on Newark City Council, called the incident offensive and horrendous.\n\"It's quite funny that you have to do it on a phone line and not here in my face,\" Creecy said.\nShe said that, unfortunately, she's no stranger to being targeted by racist remarks.\n\"But I'm here to take it,\" she added. \"So the next time you want to make a comment about anything that has to do with the African American or minority race and you want to say something so derogatory, I dare you to come say it to me. And let's see how you feel after that.\"\nDuring the meeting, Clifton briefly stepped down from the dais and conferred with a police officer providing security at the meeting. Police and technology staff will try to use IP addresses to identify and track down the people who disrupted the meeting.\nNewark officials will also look at ways to prevent a similar incident. Participants' microphones are muted by default, but they are able to unmute themselves in order to speak during allotted public comment periods. That had not caused issues previously, but tighter restrictions are likely to be implemented for future meetings.\nDisruptions to online meetings, sometimes referred to as Zoombombing, became common early on in the pandemic when many meetings switched to Zoom and other similar platforms. Provocateurs would find public Zoom links and then crash government meetings, college lectures and even elementary school classes to disrupt them with offensive comments and explicit images. Incidents were often coordinated through online forums and message boards.\nIn April 2020, the FBI warned that Zoombombing is far from a harmless prank and could lead to criminal charges, including disrupting a public meeting, computer intrusion, using a computer to commit a crime, hate crimes, fraud or transmitting threatening communications. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Civil rights group, AKA ask Cambridge council to support renaming Malkus Bridge\n\n May 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MAGGIE TROVATO mtrovato@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 1008\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — A wave of pink and green formed among a sea of residents and visitors at the start of a Cambridge City Council meeting on May 20.The pink-and-green-clad women, members of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, had come to the City Council meeting with members of the Caucus of African American Leaders to ask that a resolution regarding the Frederick C. Malkus Jr. Bridge be introduced.\n\"You may have heard about some of our other members,\" said Erma Barron, a former North Atlantic regional director of the sorority. \"Coretta Scott King. Maya Angelou. The Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris. And Gloria Richardson.\"\nBoth Alpha Kappa Alpha and the Caucus of African American Leaders asked the City Council to introduce a resolution that calls on Gov. Wes Moore and the Maryland General Assembly to rename the Malkus Bridge for Richardson, a civil rights activist who grew up and spent many years living in Cambridge.\nThe request brought a variety of comments from residents and commissioners later in the meeting.\nThis is not the first time this idea has been discussed. In early April, the caucus voted to ask state officials to rename the bridge, citing Malkus' \"resistance to desegregation.\"\nMalkus, a long-serving state legislator from near Cambridge, was instrumental in finding the funding for the construction of the bridge, which spans the Choptank River between Talbot and Dorchester counties.\nIn the 1960s, while Cambridge was going through protests against racial discrimination and Freedom Riders challenged the region's deeply rooted segregation, Malkus' civil rights voting record largely reflected the segregationist views of his mostly white, rural constituency.\nDuring a presentation for the request, which kicked off the City Council meeting on May 20, Caucus Convener Carl Snowden acknowledged that the decision to rename the bridge ultimately rests with state government.\n\"But we're asking for support from local communities and local elected officials to make this request specifically to the governor and others,\" he said.\nSnowden gave examples of statues in the country that have been taken down due to the views and values of the people they represent.\n\"Even national government is beginning to look at: Who do we want to name buildings, bridges after? People who divide us or people who bring us together?\" he said.\nRichardson — best known as the leader of the Cambridge Movement, a struggle for civil rights and economic opportunities for Black people in Cambridge in the early 1960s — met with Attorney General Robert Kennedy and other civil rights activists and government officials in 1963. The meeting resulted in the Treaty of Cambridge, an agreement covering desegregation, housing and employment issues.\n\"Gloria Richardson stood firm,\" Barron said. \"She stood strong. And it wasn't just for herself and for people like me. When you talk about human rights, you're talking about everyone.\"\nRESPONSES TO THE PRESENTATION\nAlthough the presence of those in support of the resolution request didn't go unseen, there were those who felt differently about the proposal.\nResident Terry Wheatley, who worked for Malkus for 23 years, said Malkus loved Dorchester County and, \"most importantly,\" the people he represented.\nWheatley said that as a lawyer, Malkus had as many Black clients as white clients \"because they knew they could trust him.\"\nWheatley also spoke about Malkus' efforts to get funding for the construction of the bridge that now bears his name.\n\"If Mr. Snowden doesn't want to cross the Frederick C. Malkus Jr. Bridge, I suggest he stay on the other side,\" she said.\nResident Dave Thatcher called naming infrastructure and buildings after people \"a sign of the times\" and argued that to put an end to the \"divisive atmosphere\" in the country, infrastructure should no longer be named after people.\n\"Back when all these old things were named, segregation was rampant,\" he said. \"White America and Black America. Everything got named after white people. Things have changed. Now they want to name everything after Black people.\"\nThatcher recommended the Malkus Bridge be renamed the Choptank River Bridge.\nRather than speak about the bridge named after her father, Betsy Malkus opted to speak about plans for a Juneteenth celebration she is organizing during public comment at the meeting. The event is dedicated to the late Shirley Jackson, who was a trustee on Handsell's board. Betsy Malkus shared the discovery that 130 United States Colored Troops from Dorchester County were \"on the ground\" in Texas at the original Juneteenth.\n\"I just wanted to let you know good news,\" she said at the meeting. \"I don't feel like this is the time or place I have other things to say. I'll do that somewhere else.\"\nCommissioners also responded to the presentation at the meeting Monday. Commissioner Laurel Atkiss thanked the presenters for coming out and called Richardson a hero and inspiration, later adding that heroes are personal.\n\"There's no way that the entire community is ever going to agree on this subject,\" she said. \"There's a part of me that really harkens to Mr. Thatcher's comments about how as long as we're naming things after people, we're turning essential infrastructure into monuments for certain people. There's always going to be some disagreement.\"\nCommission President Lajan Cephas said she thinks the city should take on the role of being a fact-finder for the state when it comes to the bridge's name.\n\"There's a lot of history and there's a lot of families on both sides and a lot of ties,\" she said. \"And I want to be respectful of families.\"\nCommissioner Sputty Cephas, who said he doesn't have a position on the bridge's name, agreed with Atkiss and Lajan Cephas. He also talked about the importance of showing up for other issues affecting Cambridge.\n\"We have a lot of issues that our Black community, let's be honest, is struggling with,\" he said. \"And seeing this support continually, we can make things happen.\"\nSputty Cephas mentioned that none of the city's last three managers have been Black.\n\"I appreciate this energy, this momentum,\" he said. \"But let's keep it going. Not just talk about a bridge that, unfortunately, this legislative body has no authority to change, whether we agree, whether we disagree. But there is a lot more that we could do.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Eighteen volleys of musket fire.\nThe men fought for the Union. They fought for freedom. Their freedom.\nThe 18 were Black Union soldiers who fought in the Civil War. They are buried in the cemetery behind St. Stephens AME Church in Unionville, the town named to honor their fight for freedom.\n\"Hearing the names is the best part,\" Pamela Roberts Price said. She has relatives in the graveyard.\nAround 70 people gathered at St. Stephens on a recent Sunday. There was a contingent of Union-garbed men with rifles, flags and shiny brass buckles.\nThe sounds of \"Amazing Grace\" drifted over gravestones that are worn by thousands of rainy days. A solo violin played \"Taps.\"\nSt. Stephens Pastor Eddie Scott opened the ceremony with a prayer. \"Comfort us in knowing that these soldiers that we stand on their shoulders, that we can have life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"\nHarriette Lowery has more than 10 relatives in the cemetery.\n\"I am related to one of the soldiers, definitely,\" she said. \"Benjamin Demby is my great-great-grandfather. My grandfather's mother was Agnes Demby Green. That was Benjamin's mother.\"\nLike Price, Lowery loves hearing the names.\n\"Every time I hear the names it gives me such pride,\" she said. \"Thinking about the chaos that is happening in our community or somewhere else, thinking about what they did, what they went through really touches me.\"\nShe noted that there were no promises to these soldiers.\n\"They did it hoping they would be free,\" Lowery said. \"They hoped they would get emancipation.\"\nShe noted some of the local Black soldiers traveled as far as Texas, and some of them had to walk from Texas to get home.\n\"I want the history to be told over and over again because not only do our young people, all races of young people, need to know what they went through,\" Lowery said. \"They sacrificed for us to do better. So don't give up on education and things like that. They need to know what people sacrificed.\"\nDan Cowgill of Middletown was master of ceremonies for the event. His ancestors were Quakers who donated the land for Unionville where freed slaves settled after the Civil War.\n\"We are honoring the 18 soldiers from the U.S. colored troops during the Civil War that created the town of Unionville,\" he said. \"It is amazing I still get choked up when I read these words.\"\nThe African American history within 10 miles of St. Stephens Church is remarkable. Not all of it is known or even written about. Sandy Johnson is working to change that.\n\"I am a budding historic preservationist,\" she said. \"It is good to honor those that came before us. It gives us a direction to know where we are going in life. Without the past you really can't move forward.\"\nThere were white participants in the crowd whose roots go way back too. Some of their relatives had owned big estates. Some have tilled this land for generations. A few got together to swap stories and show old black and white photographs. You could hear them saying old names too.\nThe Green Meadows Bluegrass Band finished playing \"Amazing Grace,\" the sounds of the music falling softly on the worn gravestones marked with the names of the Union soldiers — John Blackwell, Ennels Clayton, Isaac Copper, John Copper, Benjamin Demby, Charles Demby, William Doane, William Doran, Horace Gibson, Zachary Glasgow, Joseph Gooby, Joseph H. Johnson, Peter Johnson, Edward Jones, Enolds Money, Frederick Pipes, Henry Roberts and Mathew Roberts. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Celebrating diversity and promoting inclusivity for all members of our community is not an \"ideology\" — it is a fundamental principle of equality and human rights that should be upheld by our elected officials.\nHis characterization of the LGBTQ+ movement as \"antithetical to America\" and a \"socialist endeavor\" is not only factually incorrect but also deeply offensive and discriminatory. The LGBTQ+ community is a vital part of the fabric of our society, consisting of law-abiding citizens who contribute to our nation's progress and deserve the same rights, respect, and recognition as any other group.\nThe LGBTQ+ flag is a symbol of pride, visibility, and acceptance — values that should be celebrated, not condemned. By displaying this flag, our town is sending a powerful message of inclusivity and solidarity, recognizing the dignity and worth of all our residents, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\nHis suggestion that supporting the LGBTQ+ community is \"antithetical to our country, our principals and our Constitution\" is both historically inaccurate and morally reprehensible. The United States was founded on the principles of liberty, justice and equality for all, and our Constitution protects the rights of every individual, including those in the LGBTQ+ community.\nAs an elected official, it is Gunsallus's duty to represent and serve all members of our community, not to promote divisive rhetoric or discriminate against marginalized groups. Your comments have caused deep hurt and concern among many of our residents, and they undermine the values of inclusivity and respect that our town should strive to uphold.\nI urge Gunsallus to reconsider his stance, educate himself on the issues facing the LGBTQ+ community, and work toward fostering an environment of understanding, acceptance and unity for all our citizens. Failure to do so will only serve to further divide our community and tarnish his reputation and that of our town.\nDREW KOSLOW\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This was the first in-person meeting the Caucus of African American Leaders has held in Cambridge in four years.Over 60 people and a half dozen Maryland political leaders attended the meeting at the Harriet Tubman Cultural and Educational Center, where they discussed the caucus' involvement around the state and in matters concerning the Eastern Shore.\nCarl Snowden, convener of the caucus, spoke to the power of collective action in addressing civil rights issues. He pulled examples from history. Snowden said that the 13-month bus boycotts succeeded through collective activism, and the people were able to make sacrifices together and accomplish goals together.\nSnowden spoke of the bumblebees and the hornets to drive home the point. Though the bumblebee is bigger than the hornet, the hornet is by far more feared, he said.\n\"There can be a thousand bumblebees, and you can kill each bumblebee one at a time, but not a single bumblebee will do a thing. They just wait their turn,\" Snowden said. \"But if you put your hand on a hornet, every hornet in that mess will come out. They organize their collective. They understand when you touch one of us, you touch all of us.\"\nHe continued, \"The purpose of the Caucus of African American leaders is to make it crystal clear that … wherever Black people are, when you go to injure one of us, you're going to have all of us to deal with.\"\nSnowden encouraged attendees to join the Caucus of African American Leaders and be prepared to \"be like hornets to deal with an issue.\"\nIn the crowd, Snowden pointed out Kionte Williams-Taylor, who Snowden said had been beaten and, as a result, hospitalized by police in a Somerset County community last Saturday. According to Snowden, the case is being reviewed by the ACLU and involves a video of the incident.\n\"For those of you who don't know it, we have a young man among us who was the victim of police brutality,\" Snowden said to attendees. \"... according to what he told me, the police officer told him, 'Nobody can do anything about this. Nothing will be done.' He's about to experience what happens when hornets come together.\"\nRobert Johnson, a representative for the campaign to elect Angela Alsobrooks, spoke of the importance of working together as a community and looking closely at the systems that make communities fight each other and divide against each other.\nHe urged attendees to register to vote and take the time to be politically active.\n\"The biggest enemy against us right now is complacency and individuals saying that it doesn't matter,\" Johnson said. \"Do whatever it takes to get people off of the couch. And here, if they don't want to, if they're not thinking about the top of the ballot, politics of what? Local. Start local and work your way up.\"\nStudents were honored during the meeting for their academic high achievements and leadership. Those who earned recognition were Armani Black, Willoh Ryans, Aliyah Black and Tearra Brown.\nToward the end of the meeting, Carl Snowden spoke again. He expressed the importance of working together to rename the Frederick C. Malkus Bridge, which spans the Choptank River, in honor of Gloria Richardson, a civil rights activist and leader of the Cambridge Movement.\nSnowden stressed the importance of not waiting around for an official change by the government and that the collective power of the Black community has the power to effect change regardless of official documents. Snowden said about 50 years ago, in Washington, D.C., Black people decided to honor Malcolm X, an American revolutionary and human rights activist, by renaming Meridian Park after Malcolm X.\n\"Now, the government did not officially change it,\" Snowden said. \"The government didn't pass any resolution. The government didn't approve it. But Black people said, 'We want to remember Malcolm X,' and they named Meridian Park after Malcolm X. Well, I would request those of you here, when you cross the bridge and go into the bridge, just tell people you are going into the Gloria Richardson Bridge.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This family-friendly event had live music, drag queens, belly dancers, funnel cakes and 85 vendors, which filled Market Street.The festival received a proclamation from the Town of Denton that claimed June 1 as Pride Day. It said, in part, that Caroline County is a place that strives for inclusion and welcomes everybody.\nThe motto of the festival was \"Diversity Creates Community.\"\nAngel Perez, the founder of the festival, said, \"Pride represents an opportunity to raise awareness about diversity, inclusion and respect and the importance of a society based in equity. Pride Month reminds us we need to continue to fight for our rights to be included, to feel welcome and be respected as a human being.\"\nAfter marking the significance of the 1969 Stonewall Riots, which many see as the beginning of LGBTQ+ movement, he continued.\n\"We need to continue to educate our community, because a community where there are no labels, where each person respects their neighbors regardless of sexual orientation, will be a strong, united and thriving community. Together we can achieve it,\" Perez said.\nHe guessed that 500 people were milling around the vendors and the stage area. He expected around 1,000 visitors for the whole day.\nPerez wanted to emphasize the events's growth over the past few years.\n\"Our first year, we had 40 vendors. This year we have more than 85 vendors. The festival also serves to raise awareness and educate our community,\" Perez said.\nDavina Reign Escade, the reigning 2024 Miss Trans Maryland, took the stage and introduced Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller.\n\"We are going to build a state where no one gets left behind. What that means is that we want to make sure that every individual in the state of Maryland can live their authentic lives. They can love who they want to love, because love is love, right?\" Miller said.\nBefore taking the stage, Escade got a chance to talk with Miller for about 45 minutes.\n\"She invited me and the rest of the board of directors of Caroline Pride to take some students from the high schools and bring them over to meet the Governor and get their opinion on what they think they need in their community,\" Escade said.\nShe had a few ideas she said could improve the lives of youths in the LGBTQ+ community.\n\"I want to see more sensitivity training in our schools. And I would love to see more HIV care out there on the Eastern Shore. There is not a lot,\" Escade said. \"When I was 15, I contracted HIV. I have lived with it for almost 15 years now. It is very important that these kids know that there is someone to guide them. They are going to be ok. HIV positive is not a death sentence anymore. I am 15 years positive and I am thriving and healthy and beautiful. I am doing cartwheels at Pride.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And that was the focus of my comments from the last meeting. I apologize if my intent was not clear.\"\nGunsallus drew support from Montgomery. The councilman supported Gunsallus' statements about the flags on May 20, and he doubled down Monday evening.\n\"We were discussing first an issue about the town displaying Pride flags,\" Montgomery said. \"… I do not believe it is the town's business to make everyone feel good about their identity.\"\nMontgomery continued, stating the country is being \"torn apart by identity politics.\" He called out the transgender community's involvement in the LGBTQ+ movement specifically.\n\"This is about the hijacking of the movement by a transexual ideology,\" he said.\n\"I've listened to everyone here, and I've noticed that every one of you misstated what Frank and I were talking about,\" Montgomery said, referencing the May 20 comments. \"What I stated was that there is a danger to our community from promotion of this transexual ideology.\n\"... This town has no business putting up flags that promote the notion that you will feel better, you will solve your teenage problems if you decide that you should go out and demand your sex be changed,\" he continued. \"That's what I object to, nothing about any individual.\"\nGunsallus and Montgomery were alone in their views on the council.\nMayor Megan Cook summed up the views of the other three council members, denouncing Gunsallus' original comments.\n\"I feel those comments were dangerous, and they do foster a climate of intolerance and exclusion,\" Cook said. \"Asserting that the Pride flag or support of our LGBTQ community is antithetical to our country or our Constitution is incorrect.\"\nThe mayor sees damage to Easton when such comments are made by elected officials.\n\"When such divisive comments are made, it begins to tear at the fabric of our town.\"\nGunsallus and Montgomery are consistent in their opposition to Pride events and recognition in Easton. They voted against a permit for the Pride festival, and now they are challenging the display of flags and banners in the town.\nThat is their right. They were elected to the council, and they need to vote for what they believe is in the best interest of Easton. They should not, however, expect to voice such opinions without drawing vehement opposition as they did last week.\nFlags and banners are displayed throughout the year. The town should support a wide range of people, lifestyles and viewpoints. The Pride festival deserves Easton's support as it strives to be an inclusive, welcoming community.\nThe Rev. Elmer Davis Jr. is a voice of reason on the council. Gunsallus and Montgomery should heed his words.\n\"We should learn to love everybody,\" Davis said. \"We're not all going to agree on things.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

James Lawson Jr., an apostle of nonviolent protest who schooled activists to withstand brutal reactions from white authorities as the Civil Rights Movement gained traction, has died, his family said Monday. He was 95.His family said Lawson died on Sunday after a short illness in Los Angeles, where he spent decades working as a pastor, labor movement organizer and university professor.\nLawson was a close adviser to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who called him \"the leading theorist and strategist of nonviolence in the world.\"\nLawson met King in 1957, after spending three years in India soaking up knowledge about Mohandas K. Gandhi's independence movement. King would travel to India himself two years later, but at the time, he had only read about Gandhi in books.\nThe two Black pastors — both 28 years old — quickly bonded over their enthusiasm for the Indian leader's ideas, and King urged Lawson to put them into action in the American South.\nLawson soon led workshops in church basements in Nashville, Tennessee, that prepared John Lewis, Diane Nash, Bernard Lafayette, Marion Barry, the Freedom Riders and many others to peacefully withstand vicious responses to their challenges of racist laws and policies.\nLawson's lessons led Nashville to become the first major city in the South to desegregate its downtown, on May 10, 1960, after hundreds of well-organized students staged lunch-counter sit-ins and boycotts of discriminatory businesses.\nLawson's particular contribution was to introduce Gandhian principles to people more familiar with biblical teachings, showing how direct action could expose the immorality and fragility of racist white power structures.\nGandhi said \"that we persons have the power to resist the racism in our own lives and souls,\" Lawson told the AP. \"We have the power to make choices and to say no to that wrong. That's also Jesus.\"\nYears later, in 1968, it was Lawson who organized the sanitation workers strike that fatefully drew King to Memphis. Lawson said he was at first paralyzed and forever saddened by King's assassination.\n\"I thought I would not live beyond 40, myself,\" Lawson said. \"The imminence of death was a part of the discipline we lived with, but no one as much as King.\"\nStill, Lawson made it his life's mission to preach the power of nonviolent direct action.\n\"I'm still anxious and frustrated,\" Lawson said as he marked the 50th anniversary of King's death with a march in Memphis. \"The task is unfinished.\"\nCivil rights activist Diane Nash was a 21-year-old college student when she began attending Lawson's Nashville workshops, which she called life-changing.\n\"His passing constitutes a very great loss,\" Nash said. \"He bears, I think, more responsibility than any other single person for the civil rights movement of Blacks being nonviolent in this country.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Yes that is part of our story and part of our legacy, but as Maya Angelou said, 'And yet we rose and we continue to rise.'\"\nA news release said the story map \"highlights places spanning from the landing of the first enslaved Africans in English-occupied North America to the creation of Black entertainment venues during the time of Jim Crow,\" and that information was gleaned from sources such as the Negro Motorist Green Book.\n\"I think it's a good thing if they can connect with the youth,\" Janice Walthour, education committee chair for the St. Mary's County NAACP, said. \"That's the key — make it relevant to today's youth. I think they have no idea what life was like.\"\nIn Southern Maryland, Charles County has three sites — Glymont, Camp Stanton and Wellington Beach/Payton's Landing.\nThe story map states that \"during the time of Jim Crow, Black patrons could not purchase a ticket for a steamboat cruise,\" so instead local groups would organize trips, such as one to Glymont in 1876.\nAt the north end of the Port Tobacco River was Wellington Beach/Payton's Landing, which the map said was \"most likely one of the stops for the two steamships that brought Black people down the Potomac.\"\n\"I am happy to see we are preserving the history, and we are seeing now that there are challenge and opposition in our society today that is trying to rewrite history,\" Charles County NAACP President Dyotha Sweat said. \"They are trying to basically erase it but the beaches are just as important as any other contribution that we made in this country, so I'm glad that we have this one piece of history that's not going away.\"\nCalvert has Dares Beach and the Lore Oyster House.\n\"It's very important because the people that know about [the sites] are slowly dying off,\" Michael Kent, former Calvert County NAACP president and longtime historian, said. \"And when they're gone no one's going to know about them.\"\nThe map states Lore Oyster House \"was a successful seafood packaging company\" and that shuckers working at the plant \"were mainly local Black women and men who were paid a set rate for each gallon of oysters they opened.\"\n\"It was a job center for many, many Blacks,\" Kent said of the facility, which held a grand re-opening on June 11. \"You could either work there or in the tobacco fields. In the 1950s when they started building roads, there was more money to be had on road crews than shucking oysters.\"\nKent felt the story map should have included the Blacks-only camp and pool at Kings Landing and Seagull's Beach, which was located just south before the Route 231 bridge over the Potomac River.\nHe said many Black beaches were on the river as many of the towns on the Chesapeake Bay side were sundown towns, in which Blacks had to leave by dusk. Seagull's Beach had pavilions, a house band called The Hounds, a dining area and drew entertainers such as James Brown and Ray Charles.\nKent said the area was \"very popular and supposedly high class,\" and added his family never went because they were unable to afford the 75 cent admission.\nSt. Mary's is represented by Notely Hall and River View.\nThe map states the area had two amusement parks in the 1890s — Notely Hall for Black people and River View for white people. Notely Hall was owned and operated by Black business owners and Black residents from Washington, D.C., visited after a newspaper called it \"a collection of attractions unsurpassed by any place of amusement on the river.\"\nBoth parks were abandoned by the 1920s.\nWalthour's uncle Leroy Thompson owned an area called Longview just south of the same general area where she worked as a waitress. She said she liked it \"pretty much, but realized it wasn't for me\" after working dances the night before and getting up at 6 a.m. the following morning.\n\"It's so important that we continue to do the hard work of ensuring that the story of the Chesapeake is told through ebony eyes,\" Leggett said in the release.\n\"At the end of the day we need to stop pigeon-holing the African American story\" Sweat said, and added, \"We need to share the holistic story of the African American experience in America.\"\nFor more information or to see the story map, go to www.chesapeakeconservancy.org.\nTwitter: @MichaelSoMdNews \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Among their number were regiments of the United States Colored Troops. Their purpose was to issue General Order No. 3 \"to inform the people of Texas that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free.\" Although June 19th has been a day of remembrance in communities nationwide, in 2021, Juneteenth became a federal holiday.On Saturday, June 8, the Kennard African American Cultural Heritage Center celebrated Juneteenth as a day of family, friends, festivities, food, and community service. Activities began early in the Center's basement. At 8 a.m., barbers welcomed men for a free Father's Day haircut and a buffet breakfast, sponsored by the Queen Anne's County Health Department. Outside the building, the Baltimore-based Sharp Dressed Man made a selection of suits available for men re-entering the workforce. Attendees were entertained by an \"All I Want to Do is Dance\" performance, the a capella music of Sombarkin' and the Burke Family Singers. Art, African fabrics, clothing, and jewelry shared space with community organizations and food trucks.\nAs in previous years, the ability to connect with family and community history has become an anticipated part of the day's activities. The Washington College Starr Center's Chesapeake Heartlands table became the gathering place for families, classmates, and community members to reminisce, find their younger selves, and identify photos for the Center's Museum archives. A young visitor was overheard expressing her pleasure at the unexpected discovery of family history: \"It's nice to learn about my mom's history. She always tells me about it but to come here and actually see members of my family is wonderful.\"\nInside the Center, a selection of artwork created by Yolanda Acree, Charlese Phillips, Janet Adams, Alani Pauls, and Niambi Davis was put on display. \"A Homecoming\", the larger mixed media exhibit, is on display at the Queen Anne's County Centre for the Arts at 206 S. Commerce Street until the end of June. Posters of published articles on the region's people and history were placed on chalkboards. Dr Clara Small, Professor Emerita of Salisbury University, discussed the film \"Water's Edge; Black Watermen of the Chesapeake and Compass Points, her series of books on African Americans from the Delmarva Peninsula.\" If one would plot a compass on the Delmarva Peninsula and expand it to 60 or 90 degrees, one would cover the locations or sites where the most famous African Americans lived in this country's history,\" she said.\nClayton Washington, Kennard Alumni Association president considered the day a success. \"We were pleased with the turnout and the support we received. Next year we plan to expand it to an even greater celebration.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "NAACP calls for 'swift and decisive action' after Zoombombing of council meeting\n\n June 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 892\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Newark NAACP is calling on city council to take \"swift and decisive action\" in response to an incident last month in which a council meeting was interrupted by online provocateurs yelling racial slurs.\"The Newark, Delaware, NAACP branch stands in unwavering support of Councilwoman Dwendolyn Creecy, who was subjected to racial slurs, a hate crime, during a recent public meeting,\" said the Rev. Blaine Hackett, pastor of St. John AM Church and vice president of the local NAACP chapter. \"Such abhorrent language has no place in our city discourse and only serves to divide our community.\"\nAddressing city council Monday night, he asked the city to launch a thorough investigation, prosecute the culprits to fullest extent of the law and implement stricter protocols to prevent a similar incident from occurring.\n\"We call on the city council to forcefully condemn this reprehensible behavior and take all necessary steps to ensure a safe and respectful environment for all participants in public meetings,\" Hackett said. \"The Newark branch of the NAACP also urges the entire community to reject racism and discrimination in all its forms.\"\nThe incident happened during the May 13 council meeting.\nTwo people participating virtually through the Microsoft Teams online teleconferencing platform unmuted their microphones during a presentation by a University of Delaware representative and suddenly began yelling racist remarks. The comments, which included the n-word, were audible to everyone attending the meeting in person as well as online.\nThe incident is an example of so-called Zoombombing, which became common early on in the pandemic when many meetings switched to Zoom and other similar platforms. Provocateurs find public Zoom links and then crash government meetings, college lectures and even elementary school classes to disrupt them with offensive comments and explicit images. Incidents are often coordinated through online forums and message boards.\nIn April 2020, the FBI warned that Zoombombing is far from a harmless prank and could lead to criminal charges, including disrupting a public meeting, computer intrusion, using a computer to commit a crime, hate crimes, fraud or transmitting threatening communications. However, prosecuting the perpetrators can prove difficult, as many mask their IP addresses and may not even be located in the U.S.\nDuring the May 13 meeting, Mayor Jerry Clifton quickly condemned the comments and then briefly stepped down from the dais and conferred with a police officer providing security at the meeting.\n\"I can tell you that this government and this public body absolutely finds comments like that to be absolutely abhorrent,\" Clifton said. \"No one in this government endorses or agrees with that kind of comment and language. I want to tell the people online and the people here, on behalf of the seven of us on city council and our staff, that we're sorry that happened. We're sorry you had to hear that.\"\nOn Monday, Clifton said that incident remains an ongoing investigation and the Newark Police Department is working with \"higher level\" law enforcement agencies in an attempt to track down the perpetrators.\n\"As soon as they determine whatever they're going to determine from the investigation, when it's appropriate to do so, it will be made public,\" he said.\nLt. Andrew Rubin, a spokesman for the Newark Police Department, confirmed there is still an active investigation into the incident but had no further information to share.\nThe city also changed the way it handles virtual participants in meetings.\n\"The way it was set up was everybody's microphone, when they were online, was enabled, and we were trusting them to stay muted until it was their time to talk,\" City Solicitor Paul Bilodeau said. \"After that, the big change we made is everybody that's online now, their microphone is disabled and will not be allowed to be used at all unless we physically enable it from here. That hopefully should avoid what happened on the 13th. And if somebody does make comments like that, we'll know exactly who they are when it happens.\"\nHackett asked council to go a step farther and stop allowing virtual participation, which has been a mainstay of public meetings since the pandemic.\n\"We truly believe that Zoom should be shut down until we get this matter settled,\" he said.\nCreecy, who is the first and only Black woman to be elected to municipal government in Newark, thanked the many NAACP members and other residents who packed into council chambers to show support for her Monday night.\n\"Thank you so much for coming and supporting me in this situation,\" Creecy said. \"That day was one of the loneliest days here for me.\"\nMara Gorman, a Newark resident, told Creecy and the other council members that she felt it was important for residents to speak out.\n\"I just want you to know, Councilwoman Creecy, that although you felt so lonely in that moment, you are not alone. I'm a big believer that the work of anti-racism is an unending process for white people,\" Gorman said. \"I think it is our responsibility to stand up and show the ways that we are allies.\"\n\"It's our responsibility to make sure that a person who is the victim of a situation like this, of a crime like this, does not feel alone,\" she added. \"I can't understand exactly how you felt, but I appreciate how terrible that must have been for you and I'm deeply sorry. I personally will continue to work in my community in Newark to make sure that nothing like that happens again.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "LGBTQ community sees fear, persecution in Easton\n\n June 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RUDY REYES | Section: Columns \n \n 733\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n \"We the people,\" the words that begin the Constitution are words that refer to us, all of us. The Declaration of Independence states we are all created equal. Not some people: all of us. We are a free people in a land we love and cherish, who should live without fear of persecution for being who we are.But unfortunately, we have seen the Republican Party promote fear and persecution against the LGBTQ community, and it has reared its ugly head in our town. The queer community in Easton and Talbot County at large is a strong, vocal and diverse community that has always been here. It's not a new phenomenon, we didn't just come out of nowhere.\nOnly recently have we shown how proud we are and appreciate the sacrifices that have been made by those who came before with Delmarva pride. But some on the Easton Town Council see us as a threat.\nOur esteemed Town Council President, Frank Gunsallus, and Councilman David Montgomery seem to believe that the freedom of expression by the LGBTQ community here in Easton, granted by the Constitution, is abhorrent, not only to themselves but also to society.\nWe as a community are not \"a socialist endeavor\" as the council president asserted. Councilman Montgomery said on June 3, \"I did not hear a single word in our last meeting that in any way constituted an attack or a slur on any individual person who is lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans-sexual, queer or anything else.\" Yet he uttered in the same breath, \"We were discussing, first an issue about the town, displaying Pride flags, and that I would simply say that I do not believe it is the town's business to make everyone feel good about their identity.\"\nIf that's the case, then you could make an argument about other town events like Waterfowl, St. Patrick's Day parade, Christmas parade, Fourth of July festivities, and the art and ice sculpture festivals. These events, you could say, make people \"feel good about their identity,\" whether a Christian celebrating Christmas, someone of Irish heritage, an artist, a resident of the shore, or even as an American.\nGunsallus failed to mention any other \"ideological group\" he would disfavor, further proving his deliberate attack on gay pride. At the crux of the uproar is his proposed legislation to prohibit the expenditure of county funds to support \"ideologies.\" He proposes it as a measure merely aimed at fiscal responsibility. Ironically, it is fiscally irresponsible, as the measure would jeopardize annual events that bring revenue to the town. This is first a discrimination issue for the town, but also an economic issue.\nThis isn't a game. Pride is and was meant first as a protest, fighting for the same basic rights that heterosexual people enjoy.\nI will always remember the six words displayed on the town council dais in which the council sits: \"Trustworthiness, Respect, Responsibility, Fairness, Caring and Citizenship.\" I question if this council is upholding these principles that are the foundation of our town.\nCan Easton citizens now feel they can trust the council to represent these values? Councilman Montgomery and council President Gunsallus don't seem to care about or respect the people who have opened their hearts inclusively to all who visit Easton.\nWe, as a community, stand united against this latest insult by two of the town council members. Fortunately, the council does not speak as one voice on this issue. Mayor Megan Cook, council members Maureen Curry, Don Abbatiello and the Rev. Elmer Davis, who constitute a majority of the council, spoke for themselves and made their support for the LGBTQ community clear. This speaks volumes. I know that their support is appreciated.\nIf President Gunsallus dares to bring up for a vote this measure that he proposes, I hope it will be resoundingly defeated.\nGunsallus will serve as council president until April 2025. We don't know if he will run for re-election. I implore all residents of Easton to remember this sorry incident during the campaign for election of the next council president.\nWill the new council president uphold the values of the town inscribed on their dais? Do we want more political fights and controversy that divide us? Or do we want someone who will stand up for us all and protect the values Easton purports to uphold? I leave you with that choice.\nRudy Reyes is a resident of Easton and a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Energy justice needs to uplift our communities",
    "date": "2024-06-16",
    "author": "GARY BAXTER",
    "content": "Energy justice needs to uplift our communities\n\n June 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: GARY BAXTER | Section: Columns \n \n 746\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Earlier this year in Annapolis, just down the road from Baltimore, where I played for the Ravens, I helped kick off the Energy and Poverty Awareness Center, known as EnPAC. This organization is a beacon of hope committed to addressing the persistent issue of energy poverty — a challenge that disproportionately affects minority communities across the United States.My journey toward founding EnPAC, as a former NFL player turned entrepreneur, was sparked by a deeply personal experience. It was a moment that starkly revealed the urgent need for equitable energy solutions.\nEnPAC, in response to the acute energy poverty experienced by minority communities across the U.S., is dedicated to advocating for equitable energy solutions. Our mission, inspired by the disparities witnessed during winter storm Uri's devastating impact on Texas in 2021, is to champion policies that alleviate poverty and enhance economic growth, particularly in marginalized communities, through sustainable solutions.\nThe numbers paint a grim picture: Black households are almost 2½ times more likely to be disconnected from utility services than other American households. Furthermore, more than a third of Black Americans report difficulties in affording their energy bills. These aren't just figures; they represent families and communities grappling with choices no one should have to make — between heating their homes, feeding their families or paying for medications.\nA particularly pressing issue exacerbating energy poverty is the impact of electric vehicle mandates. While intended to reduce carbon emissions, these policies disproportionately burden lower-income and minority communities. The situation worsens as states move toward banning internal combustion engines by 2035 and federal standards aim for 70% of new vehicle sales to be electric by 2032. EVs remain predominantly luxury vehicles, inaccessible to many, and when consumers turn to the used vehicle market, prices surge for everyone, further disadvantaging vulnerable populations.\nAdditionally, access to EV charging infrastructure and the financial means to transition from gasoline to electric vehicles are disproportionately skewed against these communities. A recent Gallup poll shows that only 2% of households earning less than $40,000 own an EV, with 61% expressing no intention to buy one.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state and federal leaders must reconsider these poorly crafted energy policies. While aiming for environmental benefits, they risk exacerbating energy poverty and socioeconomic disparities. Additionally, the looming threat of higher electricity rates and potential brownouts and blackouts could worsen challenges for vulnerable communities.\nMuch like in football, where we prepare multiple plays to adapt to any scenario, we at EnPAC embrace the necessity for diverse strategies to tackle systemic issues in energy policy. By recognizing that one-size-fits-all solutions are inadequate, we support tailored policies that promote energy efficiency and renewable sources, ensuring an inclusive energy sector. Our commitment extends beyond advocacy; we actively engage with communities to understand their challenges and develop effective programs that deliver real benefits.\nOur recent community reception in Annapolis was just the start of ongoing dialogues with local residents, leaders, and stakeholders who are as invested in the community's future as we are. The evening was filled with meaningful discussions, yielding insights shaping our strategies to enhance the community's economic and social well-being.\nThe community's enthusiasm fuels our commitment to light up homes and transform them into hubs of hope and prosperity. Their feedback highlights a readiness for sustainable change and an eagerness to tackle unique challenges together. As we progress, these dialogues will continue to guide our strategies to ensure they align closely with the actual needs of the communities we serve. By maintaining these partnerships and conversations, we aim to create lasting impacts that extend beyond mere energy access, promoting thriving and equitable communities.\nAt EnPAC, our mission is driven by a commitment to community-based solutions and the belief that energy justice is a fundamental human right. We aim for a future where all Americans, irrespective of their economic or racial backgrounds, can access clean, efficient, and affordable energy. This commitment extends beyond simple utilities to empowering entire communities through equitable policies. EV mandates often place a disproportionate burden on minority and lower-income groups who may lack the infrastructure or financial means to adapt, illustrating the need for policies that are both inclusive and equitable.\nI remain optimistic about the future of energy justice. The challenges are significant, but the opportunities to make a meaningful difference are even greater. By thoughtfully tailoring energy policies, we can illuminate a path forward, not just with electricity but with opportunity and justice for all.\nGary Baxter is founder of the Energy and Poverty Awareness Center and aformer Baltimore Raven's cornerback. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In the future they will introduce actors and actresses portraying Harriet Tubman, Henry Highland Garnet, and many more, he said.\nQueen said, \"I'm proud our events don't emphasize the negative aspects of Black history either,\" Queen said, \"It's not having a victim mentality. It's a way to look ahead, to move into the future and embrace positive achievements in African American culture. And to ask ourselves how we can bring sustainable equity to the table for the African American community.\"\nGood music, good food and good entertainment is what's to be expected, Queen said.\nJuneteenth kicked off with a Block Party on High Street at Fountain Park Friday. Best Kept Soul performed followed by the performance from Richardson/Douglass, and the return of Best Kept Soul to the stage. The Block Party included a game truck, food vendors, giveaways and more.\nOn Saturday, a bingo disco and brunch took place.\nThen the Sombarkin' Band played, Richardson performed again, followed by the dance styling of Bento Owino, singer Yvette Hynson and finally Richardson closed the festival.\n\"Come on out,\" Queen encouraged. \"We got something for everybody in the community. It's going to be a good time.\"\nThe Heroes of the Chesapeake event is sponsored by the Black Union of Kent County, the Peoples Bank, Chesapeake Bank and Trust and Stories of the Chesapeake Heritage Area.\nTo learn more about the Bayside HOYAS Inc., organization, annual events and programs visit baysidehoyas.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ethan O'Donnell, a rising high school sophomore and resident of St. Michaels, was one of those first-timers.\n\"I really wasn't expecting to see this many queer people,\" O'Donnell said. \"... I didn't realize there was actually this large community of people.\"\nKyle O'Donnell, the chair of the Delmarva Pride Center's board of directors, said the Easton location has been a good fit for the event, thanks to the business and people that are \"already friendly to everyone.\"\n\"The response from the community and the residents and people all over Delmarva has just been wonderful,\" Kyle O'Donnell said. \"99% of the people are coming at us with love, and positivity and kindness, and they recognize that we're their neighbor.\"\nSome businesses and nonprofits set up booths with free giveaways, clothing and accessories for sale, and informational brochures. Deanna Zakes ran a tent for Free Mom Hugs, a national nonprofit that aims to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community.\nZakes is the organization's Eastern-Shore-area leader. She was adorned in rainbow attire and traversed the festival giving out hugs to attendees.\n\"It means acceptance, and love, and kindness and caring,\" Zakes said of the hugs. \"Being wrapped in a hug by a mom … is one of the most healing things in the world. Every time I give a hug, I kind of feel like maybe I healed a little part of somebody who got broken somehow.\"\nOriginally from Baltimore, Zakes said she was at first unsure of the Eastern Shore's acceptance and tolerance toward the LGBTQ+ community.\n\"Being part of this has been really great because I'm finding like-minded people, and they're great,\" Zakes said.\n\"You just get to be reminded of how large of a community it is,\" attendee Ghost Carter said. \"It's really nice to have that reminder.\"\nFESTIVAL PERMIT\nWhile the festival went on without a hitch Saturday, the public assembly permit for the event was passed by a narrow 3-2 vote in January at the hands of the Easton Town Council.\nCouncil President Frank Gunsallus and Ward 3 council member David Montgomery were the two votes against the permit, with the latter expressing concerns of \"overtly sexualized performances and behavior\" at the festival in 2023.\nDuring this year's event, Kyle O'Donnell said he was disappointed that there was not full support for the festival's permit from the council.\n\"I feel sad personally at where we are currently,\" O'Donnell said. \"Because when we think back to our first year when we submitted the request to have a street festival, I didn't know what the response was gonna be from the town council. And it was unanimous and bipartisan. And so I feel that we've slid back a little bit.\n\"So if there is a request to make a change for Pride, that change needs to be for all the street festivals. We shouldn't be treating Pride Festival differently than anyone else.\"\nO'Donnell said the center told musicians and performers to avoid curse words and keep it a \"family-friendly event.\"\n\"We've got parents here with their kids,\" he said. \"… This is representative of Easton, this is representative of Delmarva.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Agreed: We should respect members of our community who identify as same-sex attracted or other forms of LGBTQ+ — and the Town Council must be fiscally responsible with the budget.Perhaps a four-day Pride festival brings in revenue. I don't have the facts on that, but I believe the festival politicizes a personal sexual preference.\nSome of the events even seem designed to promote shock as well as pride. I understand that is a personal viewpoint, but it may be shared by others in the community. We live here together.\nMay I offer additional thoughts I have not seen addressed. As a mom, grandmother, teacher and active member of the community — I fail to see the wisdom in activities that sexualize or sensualize adults or children.\nAs a teacher I reminded students — and in a couple of cases adults — to show a little more modesty, and a little less PDA, high school \"code\" for \"public display of affection.\"\nEverything doesn't have to be public. We think it does, but it doesn't. Other recent Star Democrat articles have addressed internet activities that harm kids, teens (and adults).\nWe are working diligently as a society and a school system to teach kids that they are total human beings with brains, talents and abilities. They are not sexual objects. Online or in public.\nNewspaper photos and events that entertain families sexually cannot in the long game be helpful. The human body is beautiful, but it is only one part of a person.\nI think we as a society may be missing the big picture. Whether heterosexual, same-sex attracted, LGBTQ+ or any label we attach to our sexuality, our pride should never be in that.\nPublicly flaunting a particular sexual preference seems to teach the next generation that their pride is in sex. That seems counterproductive to a healthy society and may do a disservice to all families and individuals.\nPlease consider my thoughts before you dismiss them. What we do in public matters. How we treat each other is a two-way street. I agree that this is not a game, so we need to respectfully talk this over.\nHEATHER CROW\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And now this is our 13th year throwing this celebration, so everyone's feeling more comfortable with this space.\"\nThat comfort was apparent Saturday afternoon — even in the sweltering heat — as event-goers danced, listened to live music, ordered from food trucks and drank lots of water. Anna Wilson, who has been attending the museum's Juneteenth celebration for more than a decade, said she couldn't complain about anything but the heat.\n\"It's hot, but it was wonderful,\" she said. \"Everything was excellent.\"\nSavoy said the museum was giving out free water and welcoming attendees inside the museum to cool off.\nThroughout the afternoon, there was plenty of entertainment, from musical performances by Ayla Dennis, Ruby Fisher and Mid Shore Voices United to a fashion show featuring Black Squirrel Company, Buzz-Arts, NOT A PHASE Clothing and Dinah Wilson. Howard Barnett Jr., also known as DJ E-Shore, provided music for the event, and Devon Beck emceed it.\nBeck, who is on the Juneteenth Committee, said the celebration had \"family reunion vibes.\" He said that even in the heat, people stuck around.\nWilson, who said this celebration brings togetherness, said it's important that Juneteenth is celebrated.\n\"Because we need to know our history,\" she said.\nJuneteenth, which became a federal holiday in 2021, marks the emancipation of enslaved African Americans.\nSavoy's favorite part of the day was the fashion show. She said she was nervous because there was no dress rehearsal beforehand.\n\"But they brought so much energy,\" she said. \"I mean it was just awesome.\"\nBringing the community together is part of the museum's mission, and holding events like this does just that, Savoy said. Over the years, she has noticed familiar faces from the museum's events come into the museum at other times throughout the year.\n\"They feel welcome,\" she said. \"And now that the admission is free, it breaks all barriers. No one has to feel left out.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It also has drop-in hours on Tuesdays and Saturdays.\n\"We have all types of activities from socials to support groups to game nights,\" O'Donnell said. \"And we just want to have positive, family-friendly activities for people to come out and meet other queer people in the community and know that there is a home for them on Delmarva.\"\nEvents for the center include arts and crafts evenings, parents and allies groups on Saturdays, tabletop games, monthly social events at different locations, movie days, weekend coffee chats, and Dungeons and Dragons nights.\nO'Donnell said the Dungeons and Dragons game nights were a great example of listening to community members. The game was a great way for people to engage in good fellowship together, to engage imagination and creativity and to think of who their ideal hero or champion would look like.\nFor members of Delmarva Pride Center like Rebecca Hutchinson, the center has given her a community of people who know what it's like to be LGBTQ+ while living in a conservative community.\n\"I can go to their events and know that I am safe, and I can be myself,\" Hutchinson said. \"I know that I have emotional support if needed.\"\nHutchinson said she grew up on the Eastern Shore and now works as a mental health clinician. She has informed her clients, who are LGBTQ+ and seeking community, about the events and support groups that Delmarva Pride has.\nThis includes a Gender Expression Movement meeting every month hosted at the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship in Easton. This support group is for those who are exploring or identifying anywhere along the gender spectrum.\nO'Donnell said the Elder and Intergenerational Social has been included on their calendar, an event to gather LGBTQ+ members from all generations to share their stories, experiences and wisdom.\nAccording to O'Donnell, this event allows people to talk and learn how society has grown over time and what still needs to be resolved.\nHutchinson said that throughout her life as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, it has meant so much to her to have a center that provides the kind of support she sought as a native of the area.\n\"I grew up here, and I know what it was like to not see anyone that I thought was like me,\" Hutchinson said. \"I didn't have any person or place to help me understand what I was struggling to figure out.\"\n\"Because of the Pride centers, there is representation, visibility, fun events and support available to anyone trying to figure out who they are or wanting to be around people who understand some of their experiences,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Opinions are not persecution\n\n June 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 394\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On June 16, in an op-ed in The Star Democrat, Mr. Rudy Reyes accused the Republican Party of causing \"fear of persecution\" in the LGBTQ community, particularly in connection with a meeting of the Easton Town Council on June 3. While registered Republicans and members of the Talbot County Republican Central Committee may have attended that meeting, they attended as concerned citizens on their own behalf, not as representatives of the GOP.As for the council members themselves, Mr. Frank Gunsallus is not a Republican. Mr. David Montgomery is, but like the other Town Council members, he spoke on his own behalf, not on behalf of the Republican party. While individual members, myself included, may agree with Mr. Montgomery, he was not in that instance representing the GOP.\nTo be clear, the Republican Party, the party of Lincoln, does not endorse \"persecution\" of anyone. At any rate, after reviewing the video of the meeting, I fail to see how the words of either Mr. Gunsallus or Mr. Montgomery rose to the level of \"persecution.\" If someone does not choose to celebrate or promote the LGBTQ agenda, it does not signify persecution. It may mean, however, that many people have come to view the Pride movement as a political movement which heavily identifies with the far left of the Democrat party.\nThat is where the words \"socialism\" and \"ideology\" come in. And we Republicans are as free to disagree with you Democrats about your ideologies as you are free to disagree with us. For instance, a Democrat might disagree with me about the human rights of an unborn child, but that does not mean I am being persecuted.\nAs for traditional holidays being about \"feelings\" let us be clear that Christmas is about the birthday of Jesus Christ, not feelings. St. Patrick's Day is about a man who preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ under brutal circumstances. On July 4, 1776, our founders were putting their lives in danger for their country. Most of our holidays are about sacrifice for the sake of God or country. Not feelings.\nWhat I am wondering about is how drag queens came to epitomize the LGBTQ movement. I noticed on the Delmarva Pride Festival schedule that five drag queens are named as hosts. To many people drag is seen as mockery of women and degrading to femininity. Maybe women should feel persecuted.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Dirksen: A champion in advancing civil rights\n\n June 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 793\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On June 19 every year, Americans observe Juneteenth. It is a civil rights milestone in remembrance of an order issued in Texas in 1865 to enforce Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.Nearly a century later another civil rights milestone occurred in the United States Senate.\nIn the early morning hours of June 11, 1964, senators approved a cloture motion that effectively ended further debate on legislation to extend civil, political and legal rights to Black Americans. It was one of the most meaningful pieces of civil rights legislation since the 12-year Reconstruction Era immediately following the end of the American Civil War.\nToday a largely forgotten unsung hero on that issue was conservative Republican Sen. Everett McKinley Dirksen of Illinois. At the time, Dirksen was the minority floor leader.\nIn February 1964, the U.S. House approved a civil rights bill originally proposed by former President Kennedy. The bill immediately encountered fierce opposition primarily, but not exclusively, from Democratic U.S. senators from Southern states. Unable to kill the bill in the House, their strategy was simple — ensure there would not be 67 senators to vote for cloture to close off debate on the House bill and ensure there would not be a majority of senators to vote aye on passage of the House bill if that bill ever did make it to the Senate floor.\nEarly in the debate, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Kike Mansfield and Democratic Sen. Hubert Humprey (the floor leader on the bill) reached the same conclusion — Republican Sen. Dirksen would be a pivotal player in providing enough Republican votes to end the debate and pass the bill.\nMansfield said candidly and prophetically, \"The key is Dirksen.\"\nPrior to his assassination, Democratic President Kennedy concurred with that assessment. Democratic President Johnson did as well after succeeding Kennedy.\nInitially, Dirksen could only guarantee that 12 to 14 of his 33 Republicans would join with 41 Democratic senators. Even with those combined votes, proponents of the bill were still short of the votes necessary to shut down the opposition efforts led by Southern Democratic senators.\nDirksen soon rose to the occasion. He was the right man in the right place, at the right time.\nDirksen was a pragmatic politician and took the \"big view\" of his position as Senate minority Leader. He knew taking hard line partisan stances would not be good for America.\nDirksen also knew that the bill as written when it passed the House was dead on arrival in the Senate.\nUndaunted by long odds and despite serious health issues, Dirksen rewrote the bill with the help of several legal experts. Together they came up with almost 70 amendments all designed to fashion a bill that could get enough votes in the Senate to end a filibuster, get enough votes to be approved in the Senate, get enough votes in the House to concur with the Senate version of the original House bill, and be signed into law by the president.\nDirksen's revised bill was not a perfect bill. None ever are. It did honor the timeless approach for progress in the legislative arena — acknowledging that success ultimately results from focusing on the art of the possible.\nOn June 10, 1964, Dirksen's strategy was put to test. Immediately after the original House bill was brought forward for Senate debate and consideration, West Virginia's Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd launched a speech in opposition. That speech lasted over 14 hours. Following Byrd was Georgia's Democratic Sen. Richard Russell, a decades long leader of Southern states opposition to federal civil rights legislation.\nEventually Dirksen spoke on his revised bill. He put country first and political party second.\nDirksen said, \"The time has come for equality of opportunity in sharing in government, in education and in employment. It will not be stayed or denied. It is here.\" For emphasis, he included Victor Hugo's quote: \"Stronger than all the armies is an idea whose time has come.\"\nDirksen's amendment strategy, his unwavering commitment to doing the right thing and his eloquence worked.\nTwenty-three Republican senators voted to close debate. They also voted for his bill resulting in a final approval vote of 71 ayes and only 29 nays. Given that level of Senate support the House quickly agreed to Dirksen's version of their original bill.\nOn July 2, 1964, President Johnson signed the bill that banned discrimination in public facilities, provided voting rights protection and established equal opportunity as the law of the land.\nTime magazine (coincidentally published on June 19, 1964), included Dirksen's picture and the following observation on their front cover: \"The Civil Rights Bill Product of Principle and Compromise.\"\nWith all due respect to Juneteenth, I suggest June is also an appropriate time to ensure Everett Dirksen is not forgotten as a champion in advancing civil rights in America.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He stated that the Pride flag was \"antithetical to America\" and that he believes \"that it is a socialist endeavor parading beyond or behind the guise of a socialist movement, and I think that we should not be using taxpayer funds to support a cause that is antithetical (in stark contrast to) our country and our principles and our Constitution.\"\nMr. Montgomery voiced support, and so do I and the majority of people I am acquainted with. I've been been appalled at the negative responses of the LBGTQ community and their supporters since this happened and the vitriol which Mr. Gunsallus has been subjected to from this loud and angry societal fringe of people who supposedly stand for freedom.\nI am a proud white, English-American, evangelical Christian, heterosexual, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, nurse, teacher and fervent American patriot. But I do not feel the need to publicly celebrate with flags celebrating any of these titles. The American flag covers them all, including the LGBTQs of the country, and is all that is needed to fly in the cities, towns and villages of our country as it stands for freedom for all.\nUnfortunately this fringe community has a goal of determination to legitimize and normalize their deviant lifestyle choices by forcing those with differing beliefs, especially those based on biblical standards, not only to validate but to celebrate these choices. They represent less than 20% of the population, yet they insist that diversity, equity and inclusion requires everyone to not only agree with them but celebrate them and their aggressive agenda.\nMr. Gunsallus is like the boy who recognized that \"the emperor has no clothes\" pointing out the absurdity of this agenda which only serves to divide us. He and Mr. Montgomery should be applauded for their boldness and not allow themselves to be overcome by the noise.\nThere is a quiet majority of concerned citizens behind them.\nLINDA HOUCHENS\nSt. Michaels \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It was put on to raise awareness for and money to create an African American cultural center in Easton.\nTarence Bailey, who helped organize the event, said Talbot County should be one of the first places people think of when it comes to African American history. He called the Eastern Shore a \"holy ground\" for Black history and said the county should have a facility to preserve that history.\n\"There's no getting around it,\" he said. \"It's got to be preserved.\"\nBailey said it's important that the cultural center goes in The Hill Community in Easton, which is a free African American community that has been around for over 200 years.\n\"Because how do you preserve a community if you're not in it?\" he said.\nOnce created, the center would showcase African American culture and history. Plans for the center include lecture halls, small business incubators and a trade department. Bailey said he wants it to be an epicenter for Black history and culture.\nThere are also plans to restore a property in The Hill on South Street.\n\"We want to do an agreement where we're going to restore the house back to period and then it can be a part of the Hill tour,\" he said.\nBailey thinks the the South Street property would compliment a cultural center.\n\"So when you go in the cultural center you see the history,\" he said. \"(And then) there be an actual place where you can go and look at the house that was back to period of when the Hill first started.\"\nAshley Chenault, who owns the property, said Bailey brought the idea to her.\n\"But I was looking for a way to restore the home and provide community access and something for the community,\" she said. \"So (I) really found it to be a great partnership.\"\nChenault, who was at the event on Saturday, said she was having a great time. She said she enjoyed eating crabs, socializing and listening to good music.\nIndia Thomas of Thomas Family Catering, who catered the event, said it was a good day.\nThomas and her crew made fish, chicken and barbecue chicken at the event on Saturday. She said that events like these bring everyone together.\n\"There's enough separation in the world,\" she said.\nBailey, who called the event \"a lot of hard work,\" said the people who came out made the day a special one.\n\"Seeing people actually enjoying the hard work and supporting the Eastern Shore family of Frederick Douglass,\" he said is what he enjoyed most.\nBailey hopes to make the event, which fell on the weekend between Juneteenth and Fourth of July, a bigger one next year.\n\"This is a good event to bring people together,\" he said. \"This is a great middle ground.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Pride goes before destruction'\n\n July 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 383\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I take issue with two significant arguments in two letters published in the July 7 paper. Numerous individuals present these arguments, beyond the two letter senders. But they are wrong and dangerous. They contribute to the divisions in the country.One writer claims to be a proud, white, American, Christian, heterosexual, parent, grandparent, etc. Her pride in belonging to privileged groups is weaponized against those who make what she calls \"deviant\" life choices.\nThe writer should read the Bible.\nProverbs 16:18: \"Pride goes before destruction...\" The seven deadly sins go back in Christian tradition to Pope Gregory I. The worst of the deadly sins is pride. Pride places one above God. The writer asserts her pride in being white, American, Christian and heterosexual, seemingly dismissing any contributions by God. She did not make herself. God made her. And God made those she dislikes. She isn't better than them.\nPride is an excessive focus on oneself at the expense of others. It is evil. It fosters a mentality of \"us\" versus \"them.\"\nAnother writer puts the \"us\" vs. \"them\" distinction in terms of insiders vs. outsiders. The Eastern Shore has a long history of this distinction. I bet the first beaver to settle here was angry when another beaver moved onto the Delmarva Peninsula. The writer claims there are positive things here. But let us not forget the \"outsiders,\" who aren't positive. They are bad people who want to mess up Easton. They should go somewhere else. They are LGBTQA+ people.\nThese days, it seems socially acceptable to pick on LGBTQA+ people. Both letter writers do that. Supposedly it is OK to bully them, pass laws denying them rights and punch down on them. This attitude is unethical and dangerous. Assaults on LGBTQA+ people have risen every year, year after year, since 2017.\nSo, what about \"Pride\" as in the Pride Festival? That is a celebration of being, of being a child of God, how God or nature made you. It is not the Pride the Bible warns us about. It is not divisive. I attended the Pride Festival in Easton. No one went around hating others, yelling that others are \"deviant\" or \"outsiders\" or talking as if they were superior to others.\nWe need more positive community events like that. Vote out the Easton politicians who object to it.\nMICHAEL DAVIS\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Chief Donna Abbott of the Nause-Waiwash Band thanked the state for partnering with the nonprofit group — which includes around 300 people who are descendants of the Choptank, Nanticoke and Pocomoke tribes — and led a prayer during the ceremony.\n\"This sign is more than just words printed on its face,\" Abbott said. \"It is one of the first steps in telling our own story (and) preserving our history.\"\nThe reservation was occupied by Choptank people throughout the late 1700s and was the \"last colonial-era reservation where the Choptank people lived together,\" MDOT secretary Paul Wiedefeld told attendees.\nFollowing the unveiling of the sign, a smudging was performed around the sign. It involved the burning of herbs and the guidance of a feather meant to cleanse the surrounding area.\nJulie Schablitsky, the cultural resources director for MDOT, and Mike Detmer, a Dorchester County Council member, each spoke at the ceremony.\n\"This is their home,\" Schablitsky said at the podium. \"The Maryland Department of Transportation acknowledges the painful history of forced removal of native people from their territory. We honor the diverse, indigenous cultures still connected to this land.\"\nTom Bradshaw, a Nause-Waiwash member and the vice chair of the Maryland Commission on Indian Affairs, provided a background of the Choptank Reservation and its indigenous occupants.\nIn cold months, he said, their ancestors moved to the forest, and in warmer months, they would live near the river or the bay.\nWhen English explorer John Smith came in the early 1600s, \"things changed forever,\" Bradshaw said. Native people were pushed out of their lands and converged upon by settlers.\nBradshaw said a \"remnant\" of native ancestors stayed and \"hid in the forests,\" often marrying into English or Irish families and quietly telling the history of their tribes.\nErin Kennedy, a member of the Nause-Waiwash Band who grew up on Taylor's Island, is a historian working to preserve this history. She has combed through land deeds and records to understand the history of the Choptank people and their relationships with English settlers.\nShe emphasized that since the Choptank people moved as the seasons changed, they helped \"minimize the burdens on the environment.\" Kennedy said it's important to \"become intentional\" and take lessons from that environmentally-conscious way of life.\nTransparency about land use and monitoring invasive species are two areas in which Kennedy would like to see improvement.\n\"Is there any consultation that we can have that can bring back the richness of biodiversity in our ecosystems?\" Kennedy said in an interview with The Star Democrat. \" … Any education surrounding the environment and basically how we got to this point is important.\"\nDecades of work by historians like Kennedy and descendants of indigenous people has preserved the history of the land and its original inhabitants, Bradshaw said.\n\"We know we're here,\" he said. \"We never left.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The group preserves the tradition of the indigenous people who fled in the 1700s to the marshes after being converged on by foreign settlers.\nAbbott's passion for exploring the county's native history began when she enrolled in the Nause-Waiwash around 20 years ago, though she wasn't always dead set on joining.\n\"There were probably two, three, maybe four generations that were brought up believing that it was disgraceful to claim your heritage, so they didn't teach it to their children,\" Abbott said. \"And my grandmother was one of those.\"\nAbbott's cousins convinced her to enroll around 10 years before she became the band's second chief in 2014, following the death of former Chief Sewell Winterhawk Fitzhugh.\n\"They brought up a very good point, and that was, 'If you don't (join), how are we going to preserve the history?'\" Abbott recalled her cousins telling her. \"'Because it's fading, it's dying quickly. And what are you going to tell your grandchildren?'\"\nThe Nause-Waiwash is made up of around 300 descendants of not just the Nanticoke, but Choptank and Pocomoke people as well. Nause was a Nanticoke village outside of Vienna and Waiwash a Choptank village outside of Cambridge, Abbott said.\nIt's a \"matrilineal society,\" one where the women hold the power to elect a chief and make important decisions. At meetings, the nonprofit organization plans upcoming events and collaborations with other tribes in the state, along with discussing heritage and history.\nTwo churches — Hughes African Methodist Episcopal Chapel near Cambridge and Wesley Chapel south of Cambridge in Andrews — are being renovated so the Nause-Waiwash can provide services and have a resource center. The organization is hosting its 32nd annual Native American Festival on Sept. 14 in Vienna.\nSuch outreach events are meant to educate people on the history of who occupied Dorchester land, but also how Native Americans treated the land and surrounding waters.\nUNCOVERING HISTORYDespite living on the Western Shore, Erin Kennedy, a member of the Nause-Waiwash, often combs through records and land deeds in and around Taylor's Island, the community in which she grew up, hoping to piece together her mother's side of the family.\nShe took inspiration from her uncle, who created a family tree for her father's side of the family.\nOnline resources, records from the Maryland State Archives and discussions with fellow indigenous descendants on the Eastern Shore have helped Kennedy and other members of the Nause-Waiwash understand their line of ancestors.\nAbbott emphasized that she's learning every day as well. She's uncertain if permanent state recognition is in the Nause-Waiwash's future given that it's not quite as large as other tribes. However, recent recognitions such as a historical roadside marker next to the Choptank River have raised the prominence of the dedicated nonprofit's work.\nNearly 10 years in, Abbott is developing a love and commitment to the work of the Nause-Waiwash.\n\"I have this passion for it, which I never really knew I had until I became involved,\" Abbott said. \"And I do know that a lot of our history is gone. I want to read all these books and see if I can't find some new information out that I don't know. So I'm reading books that I'd never thought I'd ever read before.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

A statewide project launched last fall aims to reconnect these lost identities with the lineal descendants or communities that the remains are culturally affiliated with.Gov. Wes Moore (D) last fall announced the project, Engaging with Descendant African American Communities, highlighting the collaborative efforts of the Maryland Commission of African American History and Culture and the Maryland Historical Trust.\n\"The core of this project is love,\" Chanel C. Johnson, executive director of the Commission and the Banneker-Douglass Museum, said. \"It's painting a human picture of individuals that are lost and I'm really honored to be able to be a part of such a big project, a meaningful project.\"\nThe Maryland Historical Trust said the project at the Maryland Archaeological Conservation Laboratory, which is located within Jefferson Patterson Park and Museum in St. Leonard, will use genealogical records, land record research and possibly DNA testing to determine how the remains can be appropriately returned to the ground. Work is being down in accordance with the Maryland's Regulations for the Transfer of Human Remains and Associated Funerary Objects.\n\"There's definitely going to be challenges and new discoveries and maybe some pain uncovered,\" Johnson said. \"The end point is going to be really fantastic and have a real, generational impact.\"\nJohnson said this project should take approximately three years and the museum is focused on heavily documenting the process and the results.\n\"Having a report documenting all of the research work is going to is paramount,\" Johnson said, \"as well as doing some type of exhibition, maybe some illustrations or facial reconstruction, to really bring to life who these individuals were, what community life was like in the time that they were alive and to really build on the Maryland story.\"\nThe trust said most of the remains were recovered in the 1960s through the 1990s. Properties associated with these remains include sites near Deep Creek in Anne Arundel County, the Gott Cemetery in Calvert County, Chapel Point in Charles County, Bennetts Point in Queen Anne's County and Twin Oaks in Wicomico County.\n\"These individuals were precious. Their lives were precious. Their stories, as all of our stories do, deserve to be told,\" Johnson said. \"We have that opportunity in 2024 with new technology, with a community and with institutions that are dedicated to make sure that these sacred stories are shared.\"\nElinor Thompson, co-chair of the Ancestral Remains Committee for the commission, said this will be an ongoing project, and the learning opportunities it may provide will last forever.\n\"As we go along, we're going to learn about the histories of the communities that connect to the Underground Railroad,\" Thompson said. \"It's not going to stop.\"\nThe Maryland Historical Trust said the project aims to \"actively engage with descendant communities in an ethical and inclusive manner\" that results in \"a plan for the respectful reburial of the remains that recognizes their cultural importance and historical legacy.\"\n\"To really understand American life and how it was shaped you have to have a knowledge and understanding of Black history,\" Johnson said. \"Anytime that we have an opportunity to really amplify, uncover, document and share histories that have been lost … that's a sacred thing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The next day, another window was broken. The day after that, someone broke her back door and her back windows. They stole her son's football trophy.It wasn't just Speed. Two other houses on her street had windows and doors broken. That's unusual for the neighborhood established in the late 1800s, Speed says. Until recently, residents all lived in peace, without fear of crime.\nSo Speed, the unofficial matriarch of Turner Station, decided to get to work.\n\"I did not feel that spirit from God to get the police,\" she said in an interview on July 24. \"So now we are trying to work with the children of new families that have moved to historic Turner station.\"\nOn Saturday, she held an event to educate new residents about the neighborhood's history. It started with a service inside the dimly lit Union Baptist Church.\nJaBrea Rodgers presided over much of the service and told about a dozen attendees about her great-grandmother, Henrietta Lacks, whose \"immortal cells\" helped a Johns Hopkins Hospital researcher study cancer cures.\nLacks moved to Turner Station in 1941 so her husband could work at the nearby Bethlehem Steel plant. She was hospitalized with cervical cancer, and a surgeon removed her cells and sent them to Dr. George Gey, the researcher. He shipped the cells to Philadelphia, Speed said. When the cells returned, they were still living — in fact, they had multiplied.\nHer cells still live.\nAfter the service finished, Speed led the small crowd to the headquarters of her movement, Save the Nation of Turner Station, at 411 Main St., where tables, chairs and a vendor selling watermelon pieces and chips awaited them.\nBill Barry, a retired labor studies professor at the Community College of Baltimore County, Dundalk, held a lecture about Turner Station and Bethlehem Steel, which employed many residents during its heyday.\nThen Andrew Morton, who worked at Bethlehem Steel in the blast furnace smelting metals, reminisced to the the dozen-strong crowd about his time — the good, the bad and the ugly.\n\"OSHA didn't come into the plant until 1974,\" he said. \"Every other week, somebody was getting killed or maimed. Three or four of my buddies that went down there with me are not here today. They got killed on the blast furnace.\"\nAlong with educating new residents, Speed worked to raise money for the revitalization of the somewhat blighted Turner Station. She's asking 1 billion people to donate $1 to the cause.\nIn previous years, Barry said, the event had a much larger turnout and included horses, games and kids. Speed said the organizers didn't have time to distribute flyers to the new neighbors, the rainy forecast gave many pause and the horses were unable to come because of the collapsed Key Bridge.\nStill, Speed called the event a success.\n\"Put us down, Lord willing, for next year. If we are gone, the next generation that was here, we have asked them to come on,\" she said. \"So we're going to replicate, repair and repurpose.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is now on display in his office. That rug includes 99 names of God in Arabic. Rabbi Hyman views it as a metaphorical bridge connecting people of different faiths.\nHe once asked the leaders of a mosque if they could help him translate some of the Arabic words on his rug. They did so, amazed that such an inclusive rug was owned and displayed by a rabbi.\nFor Rabbi Hyman, it was simply his belief that \"building relationships not only creates friendships, but they also cement ties.\"\nA partial list of his local efforts to improve the quality of life in our community and beyond, includes serving as a member, program vice president and president of the Talbot Association of Clergy and Laity. He received an Award of Appreciation for Outstanding and Inspiring Interfaith Work in Talbot County for a Temple B'nai Israel February Lecture Series: \"Introduction to Islam.\"\nHe was a recipient of the NAACP Dorothy Webb Black Community Service Legacy Award and a recipient of a Governor William Donald Schaefer Helping People Award. He was a member of The Frederick Douglass Celebration Committee and delivered the sermon at the Community Interfaith Worship Celebration, which was a part of the \"Douglass Returns\" statue dedication.\nAn author and teacher, he served as a presenter and instructor at Chesapeake College's Institute for Adult Learning and collaborated with Bishop Joel Marcus Johnson to launch a \"Downtown Lunch and Learn\" program. He was elected to the board of directors at the YMCA of the Chesapeake and appointed chair of the board at the Easton YMCA.\nSupport for Scouting has been a huge part of Rabbi Hyman's life since he earned his Eagle Scout award, as did his two sons. That is an achievement that has been earned by only 6% of all Scouts since 1912.\nHe has served as a scoutmaster and a chaplain at Scout World Jamborees in Thailand, England, Sweden and Japan and a National Jamboree in the United States. He was the first national chair for the Messengers of Peace Program, BSA, after having served as a national chair of the Jewish Committee on Scouting and as national Jewish chaplain — Boy Scouts of America. He was the keynote speaker at a national annual meeting of the BSA \"Duty to God Breakfast\" in Washington, D.C.\nHe is a recipient of the Silver Buffalo Award for distinguished service to youth awarded by the National Council of Boy Scouts of America. He is also a recipient of the Bronze Wolf Award, which is the Scouts' highest honor. It is presented by the World Scout Committee to recognize the service, commitment and contributions of volunteers to the Scout movement. Not surprisingly Hyman received the award for his interfaith activities and his lifelong commitment to \"building bridges between people and nations.\"\nRabbi Hyman represented the BSA in Saudi Arabia at Saudi Nation Day when they received an award for the work of the BSA with the Messengers of Peace Program. This program promotes service projects through social media in effort to achieve world peace.\nHyman recalls that trip as the most amazing experience of his life because he was welcome in a Muslim country.\nWhile the news of Rabbi Hyman's impending retirement is bittersweet, there is some good news.\nHe is not planning to leave the Eastern Shore.\nWhether he stays here for the short term or long term, one thing is certain. He has made countless selfless contributions to help make Easton, Talbot County, and our world a better place.\nEach one of them has earned Rabbi Hyman a well-deserved thank you and Godspeed.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant based in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A celebration of community, history and culture\n\n August 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: NIAMBI DAVIS Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Local News \n \n 682\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Each year on a weekend in mid-August, Sumner Hall celebrates Legacy Day, a \"Celebration of Community, History and Culture.\" This year in partnership with the Historical Society of Kent County, it explored African American fraternal and community organizations in Kent County.\"Our theme this year was African American fraternal and community organizations,\" said Airlee Ringgold Johnson, community historian for Washington College's Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience. \"Our citizens had a chance to step out of our usual work uniforms of drudgery into our finest of clothes. We stepped into leadership roles and strategized to service our community's needs.\"\nSumner Hall, located at 206 S. Queen Street in Chestertown, is the home of Charles Sumner Post #25, Grand Army of the Republic. The GAR was formed by Union veterans on April 6, 1866; in 1882 GAR Post #25 was chartered by local Black veterans. In a fitting tribute, Sumner Hall was named for Sen. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, an advocate for emancipation and voting rights for African Americans.\nThis year's Legacy Day weekend began at Sumner Hall on Friday, Aug. 16, with the opening of \"Pride Without Prejudice,\" an exhibit celebrating the Tri-States Elks Cotillion and the young women introduced to society as debutantes.\nOn Saturday, despite the threat of rain, Johnson led participants on an African American Walking Tour through the streets of historic Chestertown. Designed by Washington College students Heather Lamont, Evan Cooley and Tiana Edwards, the tour highlighted what was then a thriving African American community.\nThe walk included a Queen Street residence, purchased in 1796 by Henry Phillips, a formerly enslaved man who bought his freedom and became the wealthiest African American in Kent County. It included the Cannon Street home of Thomas Cuff, a free businessman who used his wealth to purchase the freedom of enslaved African Americans.\nFrom Janes United Methodist, the first African American house of worship in Chestertown to Memorial Park and the monument to United States Colored Troops of Kent County, a rich and often unknown history of Chestertown was revealed.\nJohnson describes this work as gratifying. \"I am proud to share knowledge of Black history with our entire community. African Americans established a very rich culture despite the oppressions we endured. Too much of Black history has been hidden, lost, or ignored. As we uncover many interesting facts, we're sharing a sense of pride for what we as downtrodden people were able to accomplish.\"\nAt the foot of Cannon Street, participants boarded the Schooner Sultana, an exact reproduction of a Boston-built merchant ship and the smallest schooner in the British Royal Navy. After firing the ship's cannon, the captain and crew presented the Sultana as a school ship for hands-on environmental studies and history.\nIt was that mission for which Sonja Hayes braved Chesapeake Bay Bridge traffic on a Saturday morning. Hayes, a librarian and history teacher at the Siena School in Silver Spring, was on board for an exploratory tour for her students with dyslexia and language-based learning disabilities. \"I was at a summer institute at Salisbury University and was invited by Chesapeake Heartlands to come this weekend. I wanted to experience knowing about African American history in Maryland and to make a plan for my students' visit,\" she explained.\nAll day, blocked-off downtown streets hosted community organizations, vendors, food trucks for every taste, purveyors of ice cream, and community organizations. The fish fry, that staple of community events, boasted an assembly line of workers to satisfy the demands of loyal customers. Long before the step-off time of 4 p.m., parade watchers had already taken their places on the sidewalk. Nearby a sound check previewed the upcoming street party, a promise to keep the crowd on their feet and dancing in the street, and looking forward to August 2025.\nThe Exhibit of American American Fraternal and Community Organizations is on display until Aug. 31 at the Kent County Historical Society, 301 High Street, Chestertown.\nPride Without Prejudice: The Debutantes of Kent County, is on display until Sept. 30 at Sumner Hall, 206 S. Queen Street, Chestertown.\nFind The Sultana Educational Foundation at 200 S. Cross Street in Chestertown. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

MICHAELS — People gathered at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum Aug. 24 for a moving ceremony honoring the millions of captive Africans who perished during the transatlantic crossing known as the Middle Passage.Founded by Universal Sailing Club member Regina Hartfield in 2013 and presented annually by the Baltimore-based club, \"Souls at Sea\" honors the ancestors and ensures their lives are not forgotten. After stops around the Bay region, the event came to St. Michaels for the first time last year to celebrate its 10th anniversary. It returned to the Maritime Museum for its 11th year.\nA handmade quilt was presented by the National African American Quilt Guild with the names of slave ships stitched into it.\nAround 50 people watched from the museum's new welcome center bleachers as a full drum corps got both the dancers moving and also the participants jumping out of their seats. The sounds of drums echoed off the walls. The drums were made using goat, calf and antelope skins in Ivory Coast and Guinea.\nOne drummer in the African Arts Ensemble, Bill Caudle, said, \"The drumming is used to call the spirit forces. It is an instrument of fortification and spiritual development. The ancestors come through the rhythm.\"\nThere was also a ritual part of the program, during which the departed were called in and honored. The Souls at Sea leaders recognized all those lost at sea in Middle Passage. Names were called out as libations were poured forth.\nThere was an altar with many objects. Molasses, salt, honey, palm oil, gin and fruit were all on the altar to be offered. The audience was asked to call out the names of people in their lives who had died.\nAll of this was performed in front of the Mitchell House, which was owned by Eliza Bailey Douglass, a sister of Frederick Douglass.\nWhen the land portion was done, there were three 45 foot sailboats that took participants and drummers out to the Miles River.\nLydia Williams, interim director of Water's Edge Museum, said to the crowd, \"Oxford is the only documented Middle Passage arrival port on the right side of the Chesapeake Bay. From 1763 to 1772, 30 ships arrived in Oxford carrying captured Africans from Senegal.\"\nShe continued saying that 634 captives were transported through the Middle Passage to Oxford. 99 people perished, and 535 were sold.\nThose sold into slavery were made to do jobs like tonging for oysters, picking crabs and building ships.\n\"I am always appreciative of and in awe of the number of Black sailors who had been on the waters of the Chesapeake,\" Hartfield said. \"It gave me a strong sense of the historic significance of Black sailors on the water. Our ancestors didn't have a choice, and to be able to have choice to be on the water now is a privilege and a responsibility to honor.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

His talks on the county's United States Colored Troops veterans, those enslaved and free men who gave their service and lives to the Union Army during the Civil War, have honored descendants and enhanced public knowledge of the County's diverse history.On Aug. 13, joined by veteran's representative Jim Barnett; fine artist and charter Captain Tilghman Hemsley, and Marcia Landskroener, Pupke presented a proposal to the Queen Anne's County Commissioners for the creation of a statue to honor the county's USCT veterans.\nAccompanied by visual aids, his presentation featured the regiments and military campaigns in which Queen Anne's County free and enslaved men courageously served. In describing the invaluable service of the nation's USCT veterans, Abraham Lincoln proclaimed that \"without the military help of the black freedmen, the war against the South could not have been won.\"\nMore than 120 Queen Anne's County men fought with the 39th USCT in the Battle of the Crater, part of the July 1864 Siege of Petersburg. They were trained to lead the attack until a last-minute change proved to be disastrous. When the USCT were sent in to salvage the operation, they discovered the mission was lost. \"But they stood fast. These heroes stood in reserve, ready to do their duty, to honor their oath to the country, for which they paid a dear price,\" Pupke declared.\nJames Bond of Centreville, described as a \"mulatto\", was enslaved by Dr. James Bordley of Centreville. Bond enlisted on December 17, 1863 and was immediately made a sergeant. Sgt. Bond may have been among the casualties of the Battle of the Crater.\nIn the fall of 1863, more than 125 men from Queen Anne's County enlisted in the 7th USCT Regiment. The fight took them to the barrier islands from Hilton Head to Jacksonville. \"You know these men were brave,\" Pupke told the audience of commissioners and interested citizens. \"If you've ever walked the beach and seen the movie Glory, it was that kind of fight.\"\nParticularly poignant was the recollection by Colonel James Shaw of the September 1864 Battle of Chaffin's Farm: \"Not a man faltered, but all who did not fall reached the work, charged boldly, and did all in their power to take it….they are all missing.\"\nBefore Queen Anne's County's Robert Riley enlisted in Company B, 7th USCT Regiment, he had been enslaved on the Wye River. His Pension File included a surgeon's note of \"scars of whip on back when a slave.\" But as a USCT soldier, Private Riley was present at the Battle of Fort Gilmer and among his fellow African American troops at Lee's surrender at the Appomattox Courthouse. Riley is buried in Chesterfield Cemetery in Centreville.\nTo honor these men who fought for their freedom and for their country, a group of veterans approached Tilghman Hemsley with the idea of creating a statue in their memory. \"I thought it was a very worthy idea,\" he stated. After walking the grounds of the Courthouse, Hemsley believed the best placement for the monument would be set in the same promenade as the memorial honoring county POWs; \"not a large monument but certainly worthy of their service.\" The inscription would include the quote by Abraham Lincoln with the USCT story engraved in granite. Hemsley shared concept drawings of the proposed statue with completion for the monument expected for 2025, the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\nOn Sept. 7, from 5-7 p.m., the Queen Anne's County Historical Society will host a free fall picnic at Wright's Chance, 119 S. Commerce Street in Centreville. This event replaces the July event which was postponed due to the intense heat experienced throughout the entire month. Pupke will discuss Queen Anne's County USCT history. Kay Brown, a member of Bryan's United Methodist Church, will share church history and the success of Bryan's United Methodist Church in preserving a significant piece of Queen Anne's County history. This opportunity was provided by a grant awarded to the church by the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture and the Maryland Historical Trust's African American Heritage Preservation Program. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "State caucus criticizes Hogan on LGBTQ+ issues\n\n September 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIJKE FRIEDMAN Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 856\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — Members of the Maryland Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus are accusing former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan of not standing up for the LGBTQ+ community.Hogan, the Republican nominee for Maryland's U.S. Senate seat, has proven he is not an ally to LGBTQ+ Marylanders, a statement from five members of the caucus reads. All are Democrats. Caucus members said it is critical that the Democratic candidate, Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, beats Hogan in November.\n\"I see the indifference that Larry Hogan expresses, and it causes me great pause,\" Del. Kris Fair (D-Frederick) told Capital News Service. \"It should cause every LGBTQ+ community member great pause about his ability to support our community.\"\nThe caucus spoke out after Hogan recently dismissed an LGBTQ+ Maryland voter's concerns about his record at a campaign event, according to the statement and reporting from The Advocate.\nIn addition to Fair, who is the chair of the Maryland Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus, the statement was signed by Del. Anne Kaiser (D-Montgomery), Del. Joe Vogel, (D-Montgomery) Del. Ashanti Martinez (D-Prince George's) and Del. Bonnie Cullison (D-Montgomery).\nDuring his time as governor, Hogan elected to not sign several LGBTQ+ rights bills, including one that protects victims from hate crimes based on their identity. Hogan did not veto or directly oppose the bill, and it ended up becoming law without his signature.\nHogan choosing not to sign bills that would protect LGBTQ+ individuals indicated to Cullison that he doesn't understand the challenges facing the community. LGBTQ+ people rely on laws to give them protections, she said.\n\"For political reasons, he felt it was important that his name not be on those bills,\" Cullison told CNS.\nIn 2018, Hogan signed a bill into law that bans conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth. Cullison — who was a leader in this effort — said it was \"an easy one for him to sign.\"\nAnti-conversion bills were already passing across the country and politics were on his side, she said. Since Hogan signed the bill, similar laws have been enacted in Utah, Virginia and Michigan.\n\"He's just been responsive,\" she said. \"He hasn't been proactive.\"\nMartinez thinks Hogan has been silent about the concerns of LGBTQ+ community members and that indicates how the former governor would act in the U.S. Senate if he is elected.\n\"He decided not to sign these bills,\" Martinez told Capital News Service. \"I think that's a clear indiciation to LGBTQ folks and our allies across this state that he is not the champion that we know Angela Alsobrooks will be.\"\nAs governor, Hogan allowed measures to take effect that extend coverage of IVF treatment to same-sex couples and allow transgender people to revise their birth certificates, Hogan campaign spokesperson Blake Kernen said said in a statement. He also appointed the first openly LGBTQ+ person to serve as chief judge of a Maryland appellate court, Kernen wrote.\n\"After calling for 'tolerance and mutual respect' in his inaugural address, Gov. Hogan supported LGBTQ community priorities throughout his time in office,\" she wrote. \"Maryland has a bipartisan legacy of supporting the LGBTQ community, and Gov. Hogan looks forward to building on this work in the Senate.\"\nHogan walked in the Annapolis Pride Parade in June, sporting a Pride sticker and lei. His campaign posted on Facebook dozens of pictures of Hogan with attendees at the parade.\n\"Maryland is a mosaic of diverse communities and cultures, and that's one of many things that makes our great state so special,\" Hogan said in a statement. \"As governor, I was proud to represent all Marylanders, and that's exactly the leader I'll be in the United States Senate.\"\nMartinez, a resident of Prince George's County, said he has witnessed Alsobrooks supporting the LGBTQ+ community during her time as county executive. He appreciates that prominent members of her staff are part of the LGBTQ+ community.\nAlsobrooks has held listening sessions, attended Pride events and created an LGBTQ+ liaison position in her office, Martinez said.\n\"It is really important that we have ourselves represented in all facets of government,\" Martinez said.\nCullison agrees that Alsobrooks is the candidate for U.S. Senate that will stand with LGBTQ+ community members.\n\"Angela Alsobrooks will be the senator who will fight the fight with us,\" she said. \"She's supportive and advocates and won't back down and won't hide behind not signing something.\"\nIf elected senator, Alsobrooks said she plans to co-sponsor the Equality Act — a bill that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation and gender identity in public accommodations and facilities — and oppose Republican efforts to undermine equality, she wrote in a statement to CNS.\nThe Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ civil rights organization, endorsed Alsobrooks this summer.\n\"What we understand is that this race in Maryland will likely decide whether Democrats or Republicans control the Senate Majority. Republicans have made it clear that no such votes to protect and elevate our LGBTQ+ community will come to the Floor if they take back the Majority,\" Alsobrooks wrote in her statement.\nFair said that while Hogan may not propose bills that directly harm the LGBTQ+ community, he will likely allow other Republicans to do so.\n\"Larry Hogan is the symptom of a problem coming down the road that's going to be devastating for our community,\" Fair said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dozens of businesses and organizations from throughout the Eastern Shore partook in the festival to better engage with the local Hispanic community.\nVictoria Gomez Lozano, deputy director of the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, led in organizing the event and said she is proud of how much it has grown over the years.\n\"As you can see, we have a lot of things to do,\" Gomez Lozano said, gesturing to the many tables of activities and food. \"We have really good food. We have a lot of agencies visiting and giving us information. We're gonna have activities for the children, like piñatas, face painting. So I'm just very, very thankful to have everyone here to join us and celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month.\"\nNational Hispanic Heritage Month is celebrated from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15 each year. It recognizes the contributions of Hispanic people to the history, culture and achievements of the United States.\nAmong the many businesses tabling for the event Saturday, the vast majority were Hispanic-owned, offering everything from handmade soaps and lotions to authentic Hispanic foods. Many Latin American countries were represented, with offerings from Mexican horchata, tacos and buñuelos to fresh Venezuelan cheese and bread.\nAdditionally, there were organizations at the event to provide support for the Hispanic community. English language learning teachers from Talbot County Public Schools passed out coloring sheets of different Latin American countries to young people.\nPatty Hamsher and Brianne Niewinski, teachers at Easton Elementary School, said they were happy to be at the event to celebrate the culture and heritage of their students.\n\"So many of our families, we hope, will be here today,\" Hamsher said. \"So we're just out to give an opportunity for kids to color flags of other Hispanic countries and also take home some supplies, because a lot of them come to school with supplies, but they might not have supplies at home to do this kind of stuff, so we're just providing fun to connect with families.\"\nSurrounding their table were young children wearing soccer jerseys representing their countries looking through the pictures of flags and pointing out the ones for the countries they were from. On their faces were flags and symbols of different Latin American countries including Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.\nNiewinski said it's important for teachers to celebrate the heritage of their students, especially when they are learning English.\n\"I think it's important for the students to see us celebrating their culture and understanding that we, as teachers, want to teach them English. We don't want them to ever forget about their culture and their native language,\" Niewinski said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She had grown up in Talbot County, but she had never known it was the famed abolitionist's birthplace.\n\"The historical society had put a notice in the paper asking for people to respond to a question — 'Is anybody interested in honoring Frederick Douglass in some way since he's our native son.' And I read that and thought, 'I knew a lot about Frederick Douglass, but I did not know he was from Talbot County,'\" she said Saturday, surveying the crowd outside the Talbot County Free Library that had assembled for the annual Frederick Douglass Day celebration.\n\"... I was a little embarrassed by that but more interested in doing something because of that,\" Lowery said.\nLowery and her late husband became founding members of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society, the group that spearheaded the process of having a statue of Douglass erected on the Talbot County Court House lawn. The statue was unveiled to a crowd of thousands in June, 2011, after years of sometimes tense back-and-forth between the honor society, members of the community and local governments.\nFrederick Douglass Day evolved from that unveiling ceremony in an effort to continue the honor society's mission of educating the community about Douglass.\n\"Since 2011, the Frederick Douglass Honor Society decided that it wanted to continue efforts to continue the legacy of Frederick Douglass,\" said Walter Black, another founding member of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society. \"So the main thing that we concentrated on is the Frederick Douglass Day.\"\nOn Saturday, Frederick Douglass Day filled downtown Easton with a parade, a ceremony, a lecture, a children's village and a city block filled with vendors, nonprofits and live entertainment.\n\"The event gets bigger and better every year,\" said Debbi Dodson, the Frederick Douglass Day event coordinator. \"More people get involved and more people attend, so that is a sign that people appreciate it and really support it.\"\nThe keynote speaker for this year's event, Keidrick Roy, said that although this was his first time visiting Talbot County, he has been working with the Frederick Douglass Honor Society for several years.\nKeidrick Roy, a fellow at Harvard University, signed copies of his new book, \"American Dark Age: Racial Feudalism and the Rise of Black Liberalism,\" at the event. Roy said Douglass is heavily featured in the work.\n\"I've always wanted to be in the place where Frederick Douglass walked and talked and had many of his formative experiences, so it's very special for me to be here to do this,\" he said. \"I loved the celebration this morning, seeing so many people from different parts of the city, different parts of the town come out and honor Douglass in a variety of ways.\"\nIn holding the event every year, Lowery said the honor society hopes to ensure that all members of the community are aware of Douglass's ties to Talbot County and of how the principles of equality and freedom that Douglass espoused are still relevant today.\n\"What we wanted was for everybody to look at Douglass as an American hero and not an African American hero,\" Lowery said.\nOn Saturday, Lowery remarked that Talbot County had made progress toward that goal since 2011.\n\"We're always growing and getting better, or we should be anyway,\" she said. \"Every year, I know that there's progress.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The tests discriminated against candidates while failing to \"meaningfully distinguish between applicants who can and cannot perform the position of Trooper,\" according to a Department of Justice press release.\n\"Discrimination in any form has no place within the Maryland State Police, and it will not be tolerated,\" Col. Roland Butler Jr., superintendent of MDSP, told the board Wednesday. \"We're committed to making meaningful and lasting change … [and] to develop new policies and procedures that ensure equitable treatment for all applicants.\"\nThe board — made up of Gov. Wes Moore, state Comptroller Brooke Lierman and Treasurer Dereck E. Davis — signed off on the settlement. The agreement must also be approved by a federal court before moving forward.\nIn response to the investigation, MDSP will change its current testing methods to prevent future discrimination in hiring, but the new practices will not be ready until after the next two MDSP classes start, Butler said. To adapt, he said, MDSP intends to change existing standards, including eliminating time requirements from different portions of the physical fitness tests.\nMembers of the Board of Public Works raised concerns about this interim period, with Davis questioning whether the unclear guidelines would lead to more discrimination.\n\"Now it becomes subjective, so doesn't that lend itself, potentially, to be more discriminatory?\" Davis asked. \"Now we don't know what's good or what's not as it relates to that time.\"\nButler assured Davis that strict monitoring of who passes and fails the tests would be in place, allowing MDSP to monitor areas of improvement.\n\"We won't have the other test in place at this time,\" Butler said. \"However, we're relaxing the standards that we have … We will be allowed to use those tests under the condition that we provide strict monitoring to see what the results are, to see who's passing, who's failing and we do think that we'll get a larger pool of applicants when we start to look at how we measure that test and how we evaluate it.\"\nOfficials said the new tests would emphasize fairness while maintaining safety requirements, including a test that would receive ongoing validation to guarantee it was modern, fair and relevant, as well as an aptitude test to look for integrity, self-motivation, critical thinking and judgment skills.\nThe settlement involved 48 Black and female individuals who were prevented from becoming state troopers due to the discriminatory practices, according to Butler.\nSince his appointment in 2023, Butler said, he has worked to evaluate and modernize the agency's practices.\n\"I remain steadfastly committed to cultivating a culture that will ensure inclusiveness,\" Butler said, \"one that allows the fulfillment of our mission, of values centered around integrity, fairness, and service.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The community gathered over several days to celebrate.Many Black residents of the town and NAACP members marked the occasion by observing Voting Rights Day on Sept. 26, participating in Unity Day activities on Sept. 28, and appreciating the new signage placed at the entrance to the primarily Black residential community of Brooklyn in Federalsburg.\n\"Federalsburg was hosting. The town was the organizer of the event. It is the first anniversary,\" Willie G. Woods, president of the NAACP Caroline County Branch, said. \"We were there to support what was happening in Federalsburg. They had a cross section of vendors and participants and music and food.\"\nWoods said it is important to stand up and be heard.\n\"You have to come together and share your ideas, your viewpoints and your respective cultures. And you have to respect the contributions that the diverse population is making,\" she said.\nBrandy James, a Federalsburg Town Council member elected in last year's historic election, said the event was a success and that there was a good crowd.\n\"It symbolized unity to me. We had people from every aspect of Federalsburg. The faith-based community was there. Law enforcement was there. Not just Federalsburg police, but also the Caroline County Sheriff was there,\" said James.\nShe said there were many vendors there, including the Caroline County Health Department and smoking cessation resources.\n\"The NAACP has a table, Men For Change, there were churches with tables out there. They were giving away free cotton candy, and the kids had a blast. It was a great way to see everyone from across the lifespan come together and celebrate the unity of Federalsburg,\" James said.\nShe said the actual business of sitting on the council is slower than she would like, but she said everyone is being fairly heard.\n\"I am hopeful to see more African American people run for office in the future, and I am hopeful that the town business will get a little more streamlined and more organized,\" she said.\nThe Sept. 26 celebration and plaque were requirements of a settlement in a 2023 lawsuit brought against the town in federal court under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Through months of charter amendments, legislation and federal court rulings, the town's previous at-large election system was changed in June to a two-district system to ensure more representation of Federalsburg's Black residents. District 1 has a 64% Black population and District 2 is predominantly white.\nThe sign that was placed at Brooklyn said, in part, \"In coordination with the Mayor and the Council of Federalsburg, created an opportunity for Federalsburg's Black community to elect two representatives to the Federalsburg Town Council. Through their efforts, with support of the ACLU of Maryland and the guidance from the United States District Court, the town adopted and implemented a new and fair election system, undoing the 200 year exclusion of Black residents from town government. Federalsburg's historic election on September 26, 2023 resulted in two Black women winning seats to the town council: Darlene Pitt Hammond and Brandy James. This day forever marks a turning point in Federalsburg's diverse community.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Martinez said her story stems from an immigration story.\n\"I'm really proud of that because of (my parents') struggle, and their survival and their grit, I'm able to stand here in front of you today,\" she said.\nHer mother migrated from Mexico and her father from El Salvador. She grew up in Chicago, which she describes as \"a city that really appreciated and celebrated what it means to be Latina,\" though the city was heavily segregated.\nAfter meeting her husband and getting married, she moved to New York and became a teacher in the South Bronx, known as the poorest school district in the country. There, Martinez learned of excellence.\nShe said she was expected to perform at a level of excellence that she had never been asked to before, and in turn she learned to expect it from the people and students around her.\nShe said the South Bronx \"will forever be a part of my story and my legacy.\"\nAfter spending her time in the South Bronx, Martinez moved to Talbot County. It was a culture shock, but to her surprise, she found a growing Latino population. Her new home also forced her to affirm and challenge her own identity as a Latina.\nMartinez worked for Talbot County Public Schools and then founded Mid-Shore Scholars, a college prep program that serves first-generation college students.\nWhen leading the program, she decided it was time to focus on the marginalized student population. The program was meant to target a population of students who had the potential to go to Ivy Leagues, but she pushed for a different perspective. Martinez said it was important to focus on the students who lacked the resources to get to college.\n\"It's these students who don't have any help at home, who don't have any representation, whose parents want to give them the best life but didn't go to college here, who don't know the ropes or don't know how to navigate the system,\" Martinez said.\nDuring the pandemic, she decided to focus on building an institution to better assist marginalized communities and helped create the Polaris Village Academy. Martinez said the academy centers joy, celebrating culture and empowering students and families, making them feel safe and seen.\nMartinez ended her presentation with photos of her family visiting their native countries and the importance that focusing on her roots allowed her the opportunity to help those around her to grow.\n\"My superpower is that I am bicultural, that I have roots in (El Salvador) and in Mexico, and I have roots here, and that I can be both from there and from here, and then it's not 'and/or.' I could bring my whole self,\" Martinez said. \"And I encourage all the students here who are questioning their identity or wondering if they can be authentically themselves when they go to class or when they step into white institutions that yes, you can.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Can America elect a woman president?\n\n November 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editorials \n \n 769\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n There are many reasons why Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump.She failed to articulate how her presidency would differ from the highly unpopular term of Joe Biden.\nVoters had tired of high prices that in effect reduced their income and spending power.\nThere were the millions of immigrants who streamed across the country's southern border following Biden's election.\nAnd Harris was burdened by Biden turning a blind eye to the atrocity of tens of thousands of Palestinian women and children being killed by the Israelis while others claimed he did not do enough for Israel.\nThose are understandable reasons for voters to cast ballots for someone else.\nWhat is not understandable are the many voters who would not vote for a woman for president.\nThis is 2024. We should be long past the patriarchal notions that see political power and leadership as male domains. Sadly we are not.\nThose stereotypes could be heard in voter interviews throughout the campaign. Sometimes the prejudices were thinly veiled. Too often they were overt. I can't see a woman as commander in chief. She doesn't look like a president.\nDonald Trump contributed to this with his derogatory comments on Harris' intelligence. He called her lazy and stupid.\nThe Associated Press wrote about Maya Davis, a 27-year-old North Carolina attorney who theorized that Harris' identity as a Black and South Asian woman \"absolutely\" played a role in her defeat. As a Black woman herself, the 27-year-old North Carolina attorney said she is constantly forced to prove herself.\n\"I don't think there's anything she could have done differently unfortunately,\" she said of Harris. \"Maybe not be a woman.\"\nThe discrimination Harris faced is not new. This country has had a long history of holding women back from fulfilling their potential. America denied women the right to vote until 1920. They are vastly underrepresented in the corner offices of corporations. Women were kept from military front-line combat positions until 2013. They often are paid less than men for doing the same jobs. Some elite universities barred women from attending until the 1970s, about the time that women could finally get a credit card on their own.\nA commercial in the 1970s said, \"You've come a long way, baby.\" Yes, but there is much farther to go.\nThere have been pioneers who have blazed the way for women in a male-dominated world. They faced many challenges of people — both men and women — who frequently questioned the appropriateness of the example these women provided to young girls.\nThose people who raised questions were wrong. The women shattering stereotypes were excellent role models for young girls. They showed that girls could grow up to follow their dreams, to be whatever they dreamed they wanted to be. Young girls saw someone who looks like them in these roles.\nAs Harris gave her concession speech on Wednesday, cameras panned through the predominantly female audience. Faces were streaked with tears, but there was something else in those faces — something far sadder. Those faces conveyed hopes that were crushed.\nA friend recently took her 3-year-old daughter to the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. Walking through the grandeur, majesty and elegance of the presidential portrait hall, the youngster asked, \"But where are the girls?'\n\"There are none,\" her mom replied, repeating wistfully, \"There are none.\"\nHopefully that will change. Hopefully that girl will see a woman leading the most powerful country in the world.\nThere are promising signs on the horizon, signs that old stereotypes are becoming a relic for history books rather than a reality.\nKamala Harris has been a trailblazer all of her life. First as the first woman attorney general in California. As a U.S. senator. As the country's first female president. As a major party nominee for president.\nIn Maryland and Delaware this week, voters sent two Black women to the U.S. Senate, where they will be both race and gender minorities in the chamber. Angela Alsobrooks and Lisa Blunt Rochester are pioneers. They are leading the way, just as Harris has done throughout her career.\nEven Donald Trump made history this week announcing the appointment of the first woman chief of staff.\nThese are strides, but they are not enough.\nCan America elect a woman president?\nChanging public attitudes, more females in political offices and a surge in women running for leadership positions suggest that the country may be on the cusp of electing a woman to the nation's highest office.\nThere is no doubt that one day the highest glass ceiling in American politics will shatter and a woman president will be elected. Then our friend's 3-year-old one day will walk the presidential portrait gallery and see a painting of a girl hanging among all of the male portraits. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Our presence has been documented by anthropologists and archeologists.\"\nTayac's son, Naiche, spoke and performed at Saturday's program.\n\"We are not part of the past, relics in museums. … We are human beings, and we are still here today,\" he said.\nEspecially during Native American Heritage Month in November, Tayak explained participating in celebrations such as the one held at the park gives them an opportunity to educate people about their culture, a culture that is thousands of years old.\nBy the time the Europeans embarked on the New World at the dawn of the 17th century, the Piscataway was the largest and most powerful tribal nation in the lands between the Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River, according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources website.\nTraditional territory primarily included present-day Charles, Prince George's and St. Mary's counties, and extended north into Baltimore County and west toward the Appalachian Mountains.\n\"We are now centrally located in Southern Maryland,\" Tayac said.\nThe Piscataway people faced many challenges in Maryland, colonization being among the largest. English colonists began taking over the Piscataway's homelands in 1634, converting them to Catholicism and forcing them to surrender their beliefs.\n\"There was a time in history when Native people were not allowed to practice their culture,\" Tayac said. \"The history is hard to talk about, but it must be talked about. That's how we begin to comprehend that we are all the same, that we all have the same heart.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Federalsburg unveils sign to recognize historic 2023 election, people who made it possible\n\n November 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 744\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n FEDERALSBURG — The Rev. Jeffrey Butler, a Federalsburg resident, remembers when Brooklyn Avenue went from being a dirt road to a paved one in the late 1970s. He also remembers the more than 40 years it took for the town to get that road repaved.\"It was so bad,\" he said. \"I mean, just tearing cars up. And we went to the town to complain. They still didn't do nothing.\"\n\"Finally, along with this lawsuit, came them also fixing this road up after 40 years,\" Butler said.\nSince a lawsuit led to the election of the town's first two Black council members last year, the road — which is situated in a historically Black area in town — has been repaved.\nOn Saturday, with the newly paved Brooklyn Avenue in view, Federalsburg Mayor Kim Abner and the Federalsburg Town Council unveiled a new sign that commemorates the town's historic election and the new election system that made it possible.\nThe sign recognizes the individuals and groups who helped make it possible for Black Councilwomen Darlene Pitt Hammond and Brandy James to be elected to the Town Council in September 2023.\nA MARKER OF PROGRESSAfter the unveiling, Hammond looked at the sign, tears forming in her eyes.\n\"It's a lot,\" she said, taking a pause, \"to think that this small little town was able to stand for the rights of all people, not some people.\"\nHammond, who was a plaintiff in the lawsuit against the town, said the progress that has been made in the town is \"heartwarming\" and \"breathtaking.\"\n\"It's a dream come true for me and for others that (came) before me, that we have established that everybody should be represented no matter what the color of your skin is,\" she said.\nAlthough Black residents now make up nearly half of the town's population, the town had never had a minority representative on the council in its 200-year history. In June 2023 — through charter amendments, legislation and federal court rulings — the town's at-large election system was changed to a two-district system to ensure more representation of Federalsburg's Black residents.\nIn April, a $260,000 settlement was reached in the lawsuit filed against the town by the Caroline County branch of the NAACP, the Caucus of African American Leaders and Federalsburg residents regarding its discriminatory election system.\nThe settlement included a sweeping array of measures aimed at providing reconciliation after the town's previous election system was determined to have prevented Black residents from electing their chosen representatives. This includes the town apologizing to those who brought on the lawsuit, affixing a plaque to its town hall building, proclaiming Sept. 26 as Voting Rights Day and erecting the historical marker in the town's Black community.\nHammond said this sign unveiling and the first annual Voting Rights Day celebration, which was held in September, point to \"a new era\" in Federalsburg.\n\"It is a new era where everybody has a voice and everybody will be heard,\" she said.\nAfter years of Butler speaking out about the need for Brooklyn Avenue to be repaved, Hammond said the new council was able to get the project done in about a year.\nBefore the sign was unveiled, Mayor Kim Abner said she and the council are excited about the direction that Federalsburg is going in.\n\"We have great things to come,\" she said. \"We are making great progress in the town, and we are super excited that you're all here to celebrate.\"\nButler said he is hopeful more positive changes are coming with the current council in place.\n\"It's coming,\" he said. \"We know Rome wasn't built in a day, so it's coming.\"\nSherone Lewis, a Federalsburg native and first vice president for the Caroline County branch of the NAACP who was a plaintiff on the lawsuit, called it surreal to be celebrating the changes that have been made.\n\"But I must say, the struggle continues,\" she said. \"We still have a lot of work to do for diversity, equity and inclusion. I know those are buzz words these days. But I do believe that because I want this for my children, my grandchildren.\"\nWillie Woods, president of the Caroline County branch of the NAACP, said the new sign is something that will be seen and read for generations.\n\"I hate to talk about it from this standpoint, but in the future, we will be passed on and there will be other generations,\" she said. \"And this signage will remind them of the stance that was taken and of the progress that Federalsburg has embraced as we are moving forward.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trump’s return has these conservative Latinos excited\n\n November 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ROBERT STEWART Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 817\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ROCKVILLE — Juan Leo Salazar is on a mission to awaken a dormant political power in Maryland — the state's conservative-leaning Latinos.He has compiled a list of 28,000 names he believes he can galvanize for conservative causes. He says his organization of Maryland Latino Republicans has roughly 300 paying members.\nHe and many of his conservative friends had been working and keeping their heads down, he said. Now they're not afraid of sharing their views, he said, despite possible criticism and even retaliation.\n\"Now that Trump is in,\" Salazar said, \"nobody's afraid.\"\nExit poll data on Latino voters had some analysts' heads spinning. Nationwide, 46% of this group voted for Donald Trump in the general election.\nBut that turnout for Trump was not surprising for some Latino Republicans like Salazar. He and others had watched the ways people in their networks were responding to the Biden-Harris administration and saw the writing on the wall.\nSalazar, who came to the area in the late 60s, has many thoughts on how Trump will benefit folks in Maryland.\nTo start, he praised Trump's promise to cut taxes on tips and overtime as a win for the working-class Latino community.\n\"Now with the tips, no tax on tips. That is wonderful,\" he said, \"you should see how the Latino community, Hispanics, are so happy about (that).\"\nHe also thinks the Republican victory can help improve cultural issues conservatives care about at the state level.\nConnected with Latino Republicans across six counties in Maryland through his organization, Salazar has a good sense of how politically transformative the issue of parental input into school curricula is. He believes it unifies many minority immigrant groups in the state. This, he said, could change the state's political map.\n\"If those (other) minority groups can get organized … with chapters in different counties,\" he said, \"I'm sure we can turn this state at least orange.\"\nBut to strengthen the Republican hand in a state overwhelmingly run by Democrats, you need friends.\nAlirio Martinez is one of Salazar's friends in that mission.\nMartinez, 50, lives in Easton with his wife Ann and their six cats. Outside of his entrepreneurial work — the two have an online business — Martinez enjoys connecting with fellow partisans.\nThe two men met this October outside of an early-voting polling precinct in eastern Montgomery County. Martinez was in the area and wanted to see if his buddy was canvassing. Salazar happened to have a table set up there, where he was doing outreach to the Latino community.\nMartinez said there are a number of reasons why he's hopeful that Trump's return to Washington could help Latinos in the state.\n\"I tell people it's about what's going on, they're hurting people's pockets big time,\" Martinez said. \"They're seeing the price of the eggs, the milk … the gas.\"\nMartinez, who went as a Republican delegate to the Republican National Convention in 2016, said he can remember the time under Trump when his favorite sandwich cost him $5 and when gas prices were more affordable. Things changed under Biden, he believes. \"Everything,\" he said, \"started going up.\"\nInternational politics also plays a role. The two presidential candidates took different stances on the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. Where Trump embraced the so-called \"world's coolest dictator,\" Harris expressed concerns about a decline in the country's democratic institutions.\nMartinez said that many Salvadorans, who comprise the largest foreign-born population in Maryland, were disgruntled with what they perceived as Harris attacking a national hero. He said Bukele has done an amazing job of fighting crime in El Salvador.\nThen, there's the elephant in the room.\nPrior to the elections, immigrant rights groups warned that Trump's return to power would spell devastation for immigrant communities. But both Martinez and Salazar pointed to a greater number of deportations under President Obama than under Trump, in Trump's defense.\n\"When he won in 2016, they were saying the same thing, exactly,\" Martinez said.\nHe also said people should remember that Trump extended Temporary Protected Status to Salvadorans in 2019. Martinez, who perceives Democrats as more lenient towards illegal immigration, believes Harris was worse for immigrants in the state. Trump extended Temporary Protected Status after revoking it in 2018.\n\"There are bad and good people,\" Martinez said.\nHe added that many Latinos in the state support tougher immigration. The vast majority who come to the U.S., he believes, are good and hardworking people. It's the small percentage of undocumented individuals doing bad things in the country, he said, that makes Americans perceive all Latinos as criminals.\nSalazar believes Trump would not undergo mass indiscriminate deportations.\n\"He's not going to do this,\" said Salazar, \"because if that happens, we will be here to say, 'Hey, that's not right.'\"\nBoth men plan on attending Trump's upcoming inauguration on Jan. 20. They both hope to meet the administration and lobby for what they believe is important for Latinos in the state, and they are embracing optimism.\n\"For the Latino community,\" said Salazar, \"there are a lot of good things that are happening.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Protest to progress: Righting centuries of wrongs in Federalsburg\n\n December 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editorials \n \n 740\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Federalsburg last week took another step toward righting two centuries of ignoring its Black residents.The town unveiled a plaque commemorating the town's progress driven by a lawsuit requiring an overhaul of the election system that systemically prevented the election of Black council members for 200 years.\nThe court settlement announced in April was heralded as a landmark victory for Black voting rights.\nThe sign was one part of the settlement, which included an apology from the town.\n\"The Town of Federalsburg formally acknowledges responsibility and expresses its deep regret for actions and inactions contributing to racial discrimination and exclusion of Black residents, including its use of an election system that prevented any Black person from holding a position on the Town Council over 200 years,\" read the town's apology. \"As officials of the Town, we accept moral accountability for the harms these actions inflicted upon Black residents, their families, and ancestors before them.\"\nThe town's apology concluded: \"Through this expression of regret to those who endured race-based hardship and injustice, we seek to turn the page on this shameful history, and to begin a process of reconciliation among all of the Town's residents.\"\nThat apology is framed and displayed at Town Hall.\nIn addition, the settlement included:\nCommissioning the plaque \"From Protest to Progress: Events that Changed the Face of Federalsburg\", celebrating Black voters' historic voting rights victory.Installing a photo display at Town Hall, in collaboration with the historical society and the plaintiffs in the lawsuit featuring Black community contributions to Federalsburg.Restoring the name Brooklyn Avenue to the portion of the avenue in the Black district that had been renamed Gerardi Boulevard.Issuing a proclamation naming Sept. 26 of each year as Voting Rights Day in recognition of Black voters' historic win on that day in 2023, the town's bicentennial year.Establishing a Town Unity Committee of elected officials and residents from each district to focus on community engagement in future elections and matters related to the promotion, engagement and enhancement of the town's diverse community.Establishing an annual multicultural celebration.\nThe lawsuit was filed as Federalsburg celebrated its bicentennial. It challenged Federalsburg's election practices, including its longstanding use of at-large and staggered elections, as violations of the Voting Rights Act.\nThe suit said Federalsburg maintained a \"white stranglehold on municipal power\" with its long-standing use \"of a racially dilutive at-large, staggered term election system, rather than a racially fair system that would afford Black Federalsburg voters an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.\"\nIn 2023, under a judge's supervision to create a plan that did not violate the Voting Rights Act, town leaders changed the election from at-large representation into a two-district system. The plan called for two of the four town council members to represent the predominantly Black part of town.\nThe election was held in September 2023, resulting in the election of the town's first two Black council members. Darlene Hammond received the highest number of ballots, earning 70 votes and a five-year term on the town council. Brandy James received 52 votes, earning a three-year term on the council.\nAfter the plaque was unveiled last week, Hammond had tears in her eyes.\n\"It's a lot,\" she said, taking a pause, \"to think that this small little town was able to stand for the rights of all people, not some people.\"\nHammond, who was a plaintiff in the lawsuit against the town, said the progress that has been made in the town is \"heartwarming\" and \"breathtaking.\"\n\"It's a dream come true for me and for others that (came) before me, that we have established that everybody should be represented no matter what the color of your skin is,\" she said.\nSherone Lewis, a Federalsburg native and first vice president for the Caroline County branch of the NAACP who was a plaintiff in the lawsuit, called it surreal to be celebrating the changes that have been made.\n\"But I must say, the struggle continues,\" she said. \"We still have a lot of work to do for diversity, equity and inclusion. I know those are buzz words these days. But I do believe that, because I want this for my children, my grandchildren.\"\nFederalsburg has come a long way in the past year. The struggle continues, but the plaque unveiling was an occasion to celebrate progress.\n\"This day forever marks a turning point in Federalsburg, beginning a new chapter that celebrates Federalsburg's diverse community,\" the last line of the plaque reads.\nOther Eastern Shore communities would be wise to see that their election results are reflective of their communities. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bringing Latino Christmas traditions to Oxford\n\n December 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 347\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n OXFORD — The Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center hosted a Posada Navideña, a Mexican Christmas tradition of community and song, on Friday evening at the Oxford Community Center. The event provided new experiences to Eastern Shore natives and a piece of home to those missing their native countries during the holidays.Posada Navideña involves people, often children, gathering outside and going door-to-door singing Spanish holiday songs in order to reenact the Christian story of Mary and Joseph seeking shelter for the birth of Jesus.\nIn certain areas in Mexico, people will provide the singers with treats while they listen to the songs. The singers will sing around the neighborhood before going to one house that has food and warm treats awaiting them.\nVictoria Gomez Lozano, deputy director of the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, said this was the first time the center has hosted a Posada and hopes to continue the tradition in upcoming years.\n\"I think the reason, as with any other activities that we are organizing here, is just so our clients can have a little piece of their countries,\" Gomez Lozano said. \"Some of the traditions that we would like to keep and maintain, so maybe they can also feel at home.\"\nGomez Lozano said the event received a lot of support from Oxford neighbors who eagerly awaited the crowd of singers to reach their homes.\nThroughout the Posada, people of all ages enjoyed the event and especially enjoyed the various treats including tamales, champurrado (a chocolate-based thick drink made with corn flour), chuchitos (Guatemalan tamales), apple Christmas salad, fruit salad, cookies, coffee and apple cider.\nThe evening provided attendees the opportunity to give back. Gomez Lozano said a table at the event held handmade ornaments that could be purchased through a donation.\nThe donations will benefit the center's after-school program. People also could sponsor a child of the program for a year. Sponsorships will give the donor an ornament, a thank you card from the child sponsored and a tour of the after-school program.\nGomez Lozano said ornaments still are available. Those interested can call the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center for more information. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Nause-Waiwash's 1st female chief fights for identity, equality and preservation\n\n December 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Andrea Durán Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 1402\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — A little over five feet tall, the chief of the Nause-Waiwash walked quickly. Despite a limp from a recent total knee replacement, she zipped up and down the stairs at the Dorchester County Visitor Center.The chief beamed as the overhead lights caught in her silver dreamcatcher earrings and white-streaked hair. Her blue-gray eyes darted over the various exhibits displaying pieces of her culture and history: a photograph of her uncle fishing, a miniature Nause-Waiwash longhouse and a taxidermied white muskrat.\nThe Nause-Waiwash tribe is one of the seven Native American tribes that are represented on the Maryland Commission of Indian Affairs, although the tribe is not state-recognized. The tribe, whose origins and traditions were once nearly lost but now are being revitalized, does statewide educational outreach to, as their chief says, \"tell their story in their own words.\"\nChief Donna Wolf Mother Abbott is the first woman chief of a Maryland tribe in known recorded history.\nAbbott has now been \"Chief Donna\" for 10 years. However, when she was first approached to run, she had serious doubts about whether she even wanted to become chief.\n\"But then I got thinking again, it's not about me,\" she said. \"If I didn't step up and take on the responsibility I felt like that, all that would have just disappeared, and again, we would have lost our history one more time.\"\nAs chief, Abbott is in charge of planning the tribe's annual festival, overseeing educational outreach and acting as a liaison between the tribe and conservancy groups.\nDeborah Barber, director of land conservation at the Nature Conservancy's Maryland chapter, has worked with Abbott on a handful of projects and said she admired Abbott's willingness to work with others within and outside of the native community.\nBarber said a conversation with Abbott made her realize that what she was doing with her own children, being intentional about the values she is instilling in them, Abbott is doing with her own family and the whole tribe.\n\"She's doing it times 150,\" Barber said in an interview with Capital News Service.\nIt wasn't until Abbott was in her 30s and already a mother that she became fascinated with researching and passionate about preserving her culture.\n\"Growing up, I knew I was Native American, but it wasn't something that we shouted from the rooftops,\" she said. \"It was just who we are.\"\nAbbott said it was her cousin who approached her and told her she needed to join the tribe, but when Abbott resisted, her cousin told her, \"It's not about you.\"\n\"It's about preserving what we have and learning and teaching and then teaching it for our next generation,\" Abbott said.\nSince then, she has been dedicated to learning about her culture and educating others.\n\"I myself, I want to learn it all,\" she said. \"Just not enough hours in the day.\"\nHowever, as she became more involved in the native community, she also encountered stereotyping from both native and non-native people because she passes for white.\n\"'How much Indian are you?' How much do you want me to be? How much do I have to be? Does it make a difference?\" Abbott said. \"Not just the Nause-Waiwash—but not all tribes are tall, thin, with black hair and high cheekbones, riding bareback.\"\nHowever, Abbott said that when she does encounter stereotyping or unfamiliarity with her culture, she turns to optimistic grace.\n\"I really try to blame it on the lack of knowledge,\" she said. \"I'm like, 'These people don't know any better, so let's teach them.' So, I try not to take it personal. But I go through the 'okay, I'm mad now.' … and then I get over it.\"\nBeyond tackling the prominent misconception that there were no more Indigenous people in the region, Abbott faced a multitude of challenges to increasing tribe membership. One of them is sexism from within and outside of the native community.\n\"…Here we are (in) 2024, and there's still so much gender discrimination and thoughts out there about, 'Oh, you have to be a warrior to be a chief,' And I'm like, 'Says who? No, you're practicing Western history,'\" Abbott said.\nAbbott said that some had used her gender against her and shamed her for not being as firm as the previous chief.\n\"I have been told I'm a pushover. I am a people-pleaser. And 'Who's ever heard of a woman chief? Who's ever heard of a chief or an Indian with blue eyes?'\" she said.\nJerry \"Gentle Bear\" Hughes is 34 years old and serves as the Nause-Waiwash Band of Indians' vice chair and social media administrator. He is also Abbott's son, and he said it was his mother becoming chief that persuaded him to become involved with the tribe in his 20s.\nAlthough Abbott's leadership might be controversial to some, Hughes said it's led the tribe to new opportunities.\n\"Oh, she's been an inspiration to everyone involved,\" Hughes said. \"We've seen a lot of people who had stepped away because people had rubbed them the wrong way or made them angry or said something out of line. We've seen a lot of those people come back. We've had a lot of olive branches extended to us since she's been elected.\"\nProspective chiefs in the Nause-Waiwash tribe are nominated by the tribe's council to run, and the tribe's women vote for them. In 1988, the Nause-Waiwash Band of Indians was formed to preserve the Nause-Waiwash culture. A council of elders was created, and the tribe's women elected Fitzhugh as the chief.\nTwenty-six years later, Chief Fitzhugh died, and in November 2014, Abbott was elected as his successor.\nShe has had doubts about making the right decisions for the tribe and questioned her own leadership.\n\"I have actually considered stepping down, and my son has said, 'If you step down, then who's gonna do it?'\" she said. \"But if I step down and nobody does it, then I feel I'm going to feel responsible for letting everything go and being a part of what caused us to lose our history again. And I don't know that I would be happy with myself if I did that.\"\nThe Nause-Waiwash people have always been in Dorchester County, which is known for its lush wetlands, diverse wildlife and crabbing and fishing on Maryland's Eastern Shore. They are descendants of the Nanticoke and Choptank tribes of modern-day eastern Maryland and Delaware. Unlike other Native American tribes, the Nause-Waiwash escaped persecution and death by hiding in plain sight for centuries and sometimes marrying Europeans.\n\"When I was in school, there were three paragraphs about the Trail of Tears that didn't apply to us,\" Abbott said.\nHowever, even within the Nause-Waiwash community and Abbott's own family, people's connections to their Indigenous heritage can be complicated.\n\"My own sister does not identify as Native American,\" she said. \"It just is not important to her. However, I do. Same mother, same father.\"\nWhen someone wants to join the tribe, Abbott and other members must do a lot of genealogical research to verify connections to the tribe.\nOne major challenge for the tribe is getting younger people more involved.\nAnother is that younger tribal members are moving away from the area because of rising sea levels.\n\"It is just my opinion, but in the next hundred years, the Eastern Shore is probably not even going to be here based on what I see on our trapping grounds,\" she said. \"That part of the county probably won't be here in the next 50 years.\"\nDorchester County is one of the regions in the country with the fastest sea-level rises, according to research by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. In 2020, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a study that said, for example, sea levels for the Chesapeake Bay increased twice that of the global average over the 20th century.\nFor Abbott, who said she feels she's only scratched the surface of her people's history on her ancestral lands, the environmental changes feel especially tragic.\n\"I think that's going to be a part of our history that we're going to lose, that we can't get back because a lot of our ancestral land will be gone,\" she said. \"There are probably hundreds of cemeteries that have washed away. We are never to get those back.\"\nBut Abbott stays optimistic about the future of her tribe.\n\"I think the culture can survive because the history in the culture, in their traditions, are the ones who practice it,\" she said. \"And I think if we all pull together, then yes, absolutely, it'll survive whether we have our ancestral land or not.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "During the holidays, LGBTQ community remembers the importance of chosen family\n\n December 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Christmas \n \n 631\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — For many members of the LGBTQ+ community, who sometimes are outcast from their biological families, spending time with loved ones looks different during the holidays.Many members of the community rely on their chosen family for support and kindness.\nChosen family allows members of the LGBTQ+ to find community, support, kindness and love. For many, chosen families are there in all aspects of their lives, including during the holiday season.\nTina Grace Jones, co-founder and treasurer of the Delmarva Pride Center, said chosen family is particularly important to members of the LGBTQ+ community, especially since biological families sometimes cast people out due to their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\"Chosen family really is about being there when somebody needs you and knowing that they'll be there for you no matter what the circumstances are,\" Jones said. \"It's not based on blood or this lineage that you can trace, but it's based on love.\"\nLauren Fierman, a member of the board of directors at Delmarva Pride Center, said even for those who are still connected with their biological families, chosen family can allow for people to be truly themselves.\n\"Your chosen family is there for you that everyone brings something to the table, whether it's like a physical resource, an emotional shoulder to cry on,\" Fierman said. \"Your chosen family is there for you because they choose to. That's in the name.\"\nFor Jones, the impact chosen family can have in an LGBTQ+ person's life is incredibly important. Chosen family can help members of the LGBTQ+ community stay safe due to the community's high rate mental health struggles and suicidal inclinations.\n\"It's not because there's something wrong with us, but it's because we don't have those connections,\" Jones said. \"We don't always have those connections that we need. And the one thing that the studies have shown again and again is the one thing that does the most good in reducing suicide rates among LGBTQ people is having one affirming person in your life.\n\"That's that chosen family.\"\nJones said chosen family will be there for you and support you in all ways. She recalls a time when one of her friends faced a medical emergency, and she was the first one to be called. Through contacting proper medical intervention, Jones was there to support and possibly saved her friend's life.\nFor Fierman, chosen family can also help people explore gender expression. Fierman recalled a time when one of their close friends, who was not assigned female at birth, asked Fierman to teach them basic makeup application skills. Together, they were able to explore different aspects of femininity in a safe and welcoming space.\nJones said the moments where your chosen family shows up for you can be more than essential.\nJones recollects a time when she and her wife were foster parents for a gender nonbinary child who was not welcomed by any of their birth parents.\n\"Unfortunately, this child took their own life in our home two years ago because they couldn't just deal with the pain of not having been accepted by their birth parents,\" Jones said. \"That's probably the most difficult thing I've ever dealt with in my life, but the outpouring of love and support that we got from, not only blood family, but especially from the chosen family, was so amazing and so comforting.\"\nThough Jones understands it can be difficult for people to take initial steps toward community, she encourages all people, regardless of gender identity and sexual orientation, to find community at the Delmarva Pride Center\n\"Everybody needs hope, and everybody needs a place where they can say, 'You know what, it's okay. It's OK to be who you are.' And so that's why we do what we do with our love of pride,\" Jones said. \"We can't solve everything but one little step at a time.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Families salute Maryland women of 'Six Triple Eight'\n\n January 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ROBERT STEWART Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 713\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CATONSVILLE — Nineteen women from Maryland served during World War II in the 6888th Battalion, the predominantly black postal unit now the subject of the blockbuster film \"The Six Triple Eight.\"After decades of hearing their stories only as family lore, if they heard them at all, the families of these Marylanders are watching those stories come alive — and enjoying the long-awaited recognition for their service.\n\"I have wanted my mother and my aunt to be honored and to be appreciated for a long time,\" said Karen Taylor, \"and now because of the Tyler Perry movie the world knows what they accomplished.\"\nAlthough not main characters in Perry's movie, Taylor's mother and aunt were both members of the postal unit featured in the film.\nThe Six Triple Eight, officially the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, deployed to Europe for roughly a year during World War II. Some 855 women came from across the U.S. to process mail in the European theater of war.\nThey were a twice-segregated unit, as women served separately from men at the time, and women of color served separately from white women.\nThe film release prior to Christmas has reanimated discussion of the unit, bringing their accomplishments into public consciousness. For descendants and family members, it's a culmination of a multi-year effort to bring awareness to their family's military service.\nTaylor, a 78-year-old retired dental hygienist, points to her living room wall lined with pictures of family members in her Catonsville apartment. Several items, including pictures, a U.S. flag, a certificate and a movie poster indicate a connection to the 6888th.\n\"These women were fighting for us,\" Taylor said, \"Even if someone tells you you can't do something, you don't let it go at that. You keep on going and prove that you can.\"\nTaylor says that's how her mother raised her.\nTaylor's mother, Vivian Elzie Taylor, was one of 19 women who enlisted in Maryland and deployed with the 6888th. After serving in Europe and meeting and marrying her husband, Elyseo J. Taylor, in Paris, she settled in Salisbury, Maryland.\nShe and her husband, a tanker in the first Black tank battalion, eventually divorced. Elzie Taylor went to teach art at the all-Black Salisbury High School in Maryland's then-segregated school system.\nFrom a segregated army to a segregated school system, Elzie Taylor's mid-century career was emblematic of the challenges Black women faced in Maryland and around the country.\nShe passed a lesson on to her daughter about persevering in the face of obstacles.\n\"My mom pushed me,\" Taylor said. \"She made me.\"\nAfter her mom died, Taylor began exploring the military oral history her mother had shared with her. It wasn't just her mother who served. Taylor's aunt, Marian Elzie Wilson, enlisted in Pennsylvania and also deployed with the 6888th.\nThe more she learned, she said, the more she understood the groundbreaking territory the group charted.\nAnd she wasn't the only one.\nVashti Murphy Matthews, from Baltimore's multi-generational publishing family of AFRO American Newspaper, also served overseas with the 6888th.\nShe was a taciturn woman who — despite a drill sergeant-like leadership style — never spoke about her time in the army, according to her daughter, Betty Schuler.\n\"Had it not been for me finding some pictures, we would never have known that she served at all,\" said Schuler. \"Not one word did she speak.\"\nSchuler and her cousin first learned about the 6888th when a monument was being erected in honor of the unit. Researchers and fundraisers were reaching out to descendants and media organizations, which led them to Schuler and her cousin, Frances Murphy Draper, CEO and publisher of the family business.\nThe Buffalo Soldier Educational and Historical Committee created a monument for the 6888th in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, outside of Kansas City, in 2018.\nA few years later, Congress passed legislation awarding the unit the Congressional Gold Medal. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore even designated March 9 as a day honoring the 6888th in Maryland.\nBut it wasn't until the movie that the unit really caught people's attention. Draper compares the Six Triple Eight to other overlooked stories about people of color.\n\"I think it also speaks to the 'argument' about the need to really teach African American history,\" said Draper. \"There's a whole history of people, and the more we understand about people … the more we understand that we have more in common than we have different.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton town hall meeting delves into expectations for LGBTQ+ community in new administration\n\n January 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 521\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — In the final days before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office, Maryland's LGBTQ+ community is preparing for what could lie ahead.\"With the upcoming change in administration, the United States is poised to experience significant rollbacks in federal protections for LGBTQIA+ people, with transgender people squarely in the crosshairs,\" Delmarva Pride Center Board Chair Tina Jones said during a town hall event Wednesday evening.\nJones said that although state laws in Maryland provide more protections to LGBTQ+ people compared to many other states, protections in Maryland vary based on where people live, attend school and seek healthcare.\nThe town hall, which was held at the Waterfowl Building in downtown Easton, brought together a panel of experts to share their expectations for the next four years as well as their thoughts on what the state can do to ensure and expand protections for Maryland's LGBTQ+ community. Along with the Delmarva Pride Center, the event was hosted by DoCo Pride and the Maryland Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus.\nThe four-person panel — which included Del. Kris Fair (D-Frederick), Fair's Chief of Staff Camila Reynolds-Dominguez, FreeState Justice Executive Director Phillip Westry and Maryland Office of the Attorney General Civil Rights Division Chief Jonathan Smith — answered questions related to schools and workplace, health care and family law.\nCaleb Holland, an attorney and the chair of DoCo Pride, who moderated the town hall, said the goal of the event is \"to prepare, not scare.\"\nOn the topic of education, Smith said he expects the Trump administration will try to push through executive orders around funding schools that are based on sports issues, bathrooms or the ability to deadname or misgender students. But Smith said there are \"very significant responses\" states can make.\n\"There's been a body of law that's developed that says the United States government cannot, through its funding powers, coerce states to take policy decisions that are not for the function of funding,\" he said.\nWestry said organizing and getting active in politics, like school boards, is a good way to get involved.\nAlthough part of Wednesday night's conversation focused on bracing for what could happen in the country, the panelists also talked about what gives them hope.\nFair, who is the chair of the Maryland Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus, recalled the 2018 midterm elections. He said the country elected more women, more queer people and more people of color than ever before.\n\"In 2018, we figured out that in order to protect our rights, we need to do everything we can to put as many people who look like us into positions of power,\" he said. \"What I am hopeful for is that 2026 looks just like that.\"\nReynolds-Dominguez, who was previously a policy advocate and legal impact coordinator at FreeState Justice, said that in the last couple of years, the state has taken an \"aggressive stance\" on doing everything possible to anticipate rollbacks. She said Maryland is \"situated to weather this storm\" and that should be used as a catalyst for doing long-term work.\n\"The core of all of this is shifting people's hearts and minds,\" she said. \"And if we're not doing that work, we're spending our time in the wrong place.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "MLK's 'beloved community' has inspired social justice work for decades - what did he mean?",

    "content": "MLK's 'beloved community' has inspired social justice work for decades - what did he mean?\n\n January 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jason Oliver Evans The Conservation | Section: Opinion \n \n 1054\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Since 1983, when President Ronald Reagan signed Martin Luther King Jr. Day into law, many Americans have observed the federal holiday to commemorate the life and legacy of the civil rights leader, Baptist minister and theologian.MLK Day volunteers typically perform community service that continues King's fight to end racial discrimination and economic injustice — to build the \"beloved community,\" as he often said.\nKing does not fully explain the phrase's meaning in his published writings, speeches and sermons. Scholars Rufus Burrow Jr. and Lewis V. Baldwin, however, argue that the beloved community is King's principal ethical goal, guiding the struggle against what he called the \"three evils of American society\": racism, economic exploitation and militarism.\nAs a Baptist minister and theologian myself, I believe it is important to understand the origins of the concept of the beloved community, how King understood it and how he worked to make it a reality.\nOlder originsAlthough King popularized the beloved community, the phrase has roots in the thought of 19th-century American religious philosopher Josiah Royce.\nIn 1913, toward the end of his long career, Royce published \"The Problem of Christianity.\" The book compiles lectures on the Christian religion, including the idea of the church and its mission, and coined the term beloved community. Based on his readings of the biblical gospels, as well as the writings of the apostle Paul, Royce argued that the beloved community was one where individuals are transformed by God's love.\nIn turn, members express that love as loyalty toward each other — for example, the devoted love a member of the church would have toward the church as a whole.\nWhile Royce often identified the beloved community with the church, he extends the concept beyond the walls of Christianity. In any type of community, Royce argued, from clans to nations, there are individuals who express love and devotion not only to their own community, but who foster a sense of the community that includes all humankind.\nAccording to Royce, the ideal or beloved community is a \"universal community\" — one to which all human beings belong or will eventually belong at the end of time.\n'Beloved' diversityTwentieth-century pastor, philosopher, mystic, theologian and civil rights leader Howard Thurman retrieved Royce's idea of the beloved community and applied it to his life and work, most notably in his 1971 book \"The Search for Common Ground.\"\nThurman first used the term in an unpublished and undated article: Desegregation, Integration, and the Beloved Community. Here, he argued that the beloved community cannot be achieved by sheer will or commanded by force. Rather, it begins with transformation in each person's \"human spirit.\" The seeds of the beloved community extend outward into society as each person assumes the responsibility of bringing it to pass.\nThurman envisioned the beloved community as one that exemplifies harmony — harmony enriched by members' diversity. It is a community wherein people from all racial, national, religious and ethnic backgrounds are respected, and where their human dignity is affirmed. Thurman was convinced that beloved community was achievable because of the dedication he saw from activists during the struggle for racial integration.\nDuring his lifetime, Thurman sought to build this beloved community through his activism for racial justice. For example, he co-founded the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples, an interracial and interfaith community in San Francisco, which he co-pastored from 1943 to 1953.\nThurman's writings and activism deeply influenced King. Burrow argued that it is not entirely clear when and where King first learned the concept of beloved community. Yet King emphasized its importance in much of his writing and political action.\nLove and actionIn simplest terms, King defined the beloved community as a community transformed by love. Like Royce, he drew his understanding of love from the Bible's New Testament. In the original Greek, the Gospels use the word \"agape,\" which suggests God's self-giving, unconditional love for humanity — and, by extension, human beings' self-giving, unconditional love for each other.\nAccording to Baldwin, however, King's understanding of the beloved community is better understood against the backdrop of the Black church tradition. Raised in the Ebenezer Baptist Church of Atlanta, King learned lessons on the meaning of love from his parents, Rev. Martin Luther King Sr. — Ebenezer's pastor, who was also a leader in the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People — and Alberta Christine Williams King.\nOne of the distinctions in King's thought is that he believed the beloved community could be achieved through nonviolent direct action, such as sit-ins, marches and boycotts. In part, he was inspired by Thurman, who had embraced the nonviolence at the heart of Mahatma Gandhi's resistance against the British in India. For King, nonviolence was the only viable means for achieving the United States of America's redemption from the sin of racial segregation and white supremacy.\nFor King, therefore, the beloved community was not merely a utopian vision of the future. He envisioned it as an obtainable ethical goal that all human beings must work collectively toward achieving.\n\"Only a refusal to hate or kill can put an end to the chain of violence in the world and lead us toward a community where men can live together without fear,\" King wrote in 1966. \"Our goal is to create a beloved community and this will require a qualitative change in our souls as well as a quantitative change in our lives.\"\nSearching for the beloved community todayKing's idea of the beloved community has not only influenced people affiliated with the Christian tradition but also people from other faiths and none.\nFor instance, scholars Elizabeth A. Johnson, bell hooks and Joy James have reflected upon the meaning of the beloved community amid ongoing challenges such as global climate change, sexism, racism and other forms of structural violence.\nPeople around the world continue to draw insight and inspiration from King's thought, especially from his insistence that love is \"the most durable power\" to change the world for the better. Questions remain about whether his beloved community can be realized, or how. But I believe it is important to understand King's ethical concept and its continuing influence on movements that seek an end to injustice.\nJason Oliver Evans is a research associate and lecturer at the University of Virginia\nThe Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.

He was 14 years old.\"As we were coming up to the bridge, you could hear horses, dogs, screams,\" he recalled.\nOnce Davis reached the center of the bridge, he could see what he had been hearing: horses, dogs and people getting beaten with billy clubs and sprayed with tear gas.\n\"I was scared,\" Davis, a Selma, Alabama native, said.\nDuring a Martin Luther King Jr. Day commemoration event at Christ Episcopal Church in Cambridge on Monday, Davis shared his recollection of the famous Alabama marches, which took marchers three times before they were able to cross the bridge.\nDavis said they marched about 15 or 16 miles each day until they arrived in Montgomery.\n\"It wasn't bad on me,\" he said about the distance. \"I was 14 years old. I could run and walk all day.\"\nHis mother didn't know about Davis' involvement in the first march, but she was proud when she found out. \"She was calling my relatives in Chicago, New York and everything,\" he said.\nMARCHING ONDavis remembers being on the playground during recess after he had gotten back to Selma from the march.\n\"And kids were coming to me (saying), 'Roy, you're on Newsweek Magazine,'\" he said.\nDavis didn't believe them. But sure enough, on the cover of the April 5, 1965 edition of Newsweek, Davis is seen marching with two other young men on the road to Montgomery.\nAlmost 60 years later, Davis continues to champion issues important to him. These days, that issue is homelessness in Dorchester County.\n\"These people have no business being homeless,\" he said. \"Can't get nothing to eat. ... And that's what we are doing these days. Helping them try and get housing.\"\nAfter the event, attendee Lametha Elbert said Davis' experience in the march and as a kid in Alabama in the 1960s struck her. She talked about the importance of people sharing their experiences.\nDorchester County Democratic Central Committee Chair Sarah Gavian said the event had \"universal appeal,\" bringing people together.\n\"It comes on a day that's very important for people, certainly for Democrats, to be turning their energies forward constructively and figuring out how to be more community (service-oriented) and engage better.\" Across the bridge in Washington, D.C., Republican President Donald Trump had been sworn in a few hours earlier.\nAlong with Davis' story, the Martin Luther King Jr. Day event — hosted by the Dorchester County Democratic Central Committee — included a variety of speeches and songs. First United Methodist Church of Hyattsville Rev. Yvonne Wallace Penn and Cambridge Mayor Lajan Cephas' fiancé Joe Johnson-Bey both spoke. Vocalist Maris Wicker sang \"This Little Light of Mine\" and \"Balm in Gilead.\" Marie Anderson closed out the evening singing \"If I Could Help Somebody.\"\nJohnson-Bey spoke for Cephas, who couldn't be at the event. He shared the importance of loving each other through everything.\nWallace Penn said that King lived love.\n\"He said, 'I have decided to stick to love' because I don't have time to waste to hate anybody. But I have time to love you,\" Wallace Penn said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Several of these focus on immigration and mass deportation throughout the country.\nThe orders include, but are not limited to, closing off access to the CBP One App and asylum protections at the U.S. border; sending more troops to assist with border barriers and removal flights; and opening the door for immigration authorities to arrest immigrants in schools, churches and hospitals.\nAccording to Matthew Peters, executive director of the center, since the announcement of the executive orders, the center has received an influx of phone calls from worried community members.\n\"A lot of people are calling, very concerned about all the things they see in their social media and all the things they're hearing from the media about the executive orders,\" Peters said. \"So people are just (trying to) understand what consequences they may or may not have. What do (the orders) mean? And that's obviously going to take time for everyone to kind of absorb a lot of those executive orders and see what they mean in the real world.\"\nThe Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center is working to distribute Know Your Rights guides, implement additional immigration services and offer classes for citizenship.\nVictoria Gomez Lozano, deputy director of the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, said red cards are being shared at the center, providing information to help people assert their rights and defend themselves in situations with officials such as immigration agents and police officers.\nGomez Lozano said she hopes the red cards can provide needed information for people who find themselves in situations where their families or themselves are in need of immediate assistance but are unable to quickly get it.\nThe center has released a Know Your Rights guide for everyone who is in need of the information. This guide addresses the rights that all people, regardless of immigration status and criminal history, have to protect themselves.\nThe guide addresses what people need to know and what to do when encountering immigration agents, police or FBI in different places; how to read a warrant; preparing emergency planning checklists; and what to do if a loved one calls from an immigration detention center or police station.\nAdditionally, the center has announced Ingrid Diaz Lopez as a newly promoted immigration specialist. Diaz Lopez has recently been awarded recognition and accreditation by the Executive Office for Immigration Review.\nDiaz Lopez said she will be working alongside Peters, taking on immigration applications and assisting the community.\nDiaz Lopez has been doing extensive work for high-risk communities on the Eastern Shore, including coordinating free citizenship classes, preparing immigration forms and applications and overall demonstrating a deep commitment to the well-being of those she serves.\nThe responsibility of truth is not one that is taken lightly by the team at the center, and Diaz Lopez said it is important to see the humanity of the Hispanic immigrant community that has been targeted for mass deportation.\nAs an immigrant herself, Diaz Lopez can attest to the importance of hard work and dedication in shaping her journey and sees that work effort and dedication in the community she works to protect.\n\"It's important to recognize that welcoming immigrants aligns with the core values of opportunity and compassion that we hold dear,\" Diaz Lopez said. \"I urge you to be mindful of your words and actions, as we are all human beings, and we all have feelings. Remember, either you or your ancestors were once immigrants, and consider how you would have wanted them to be treated.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But in recent years, the game has been claimed by LGBTQ+ people who have found the fantasy and community aspect comforting, especially if they feel isolated.\n\"Just creating that space of safety for yourself and for the people at your table is so important because it can become such a beautiful thing,\" Silver said. \"And it's OK if it's not transcendent. If you just play a silly game and kill a bunch of goblins, that's fun.\n\"But just the joy of friendship at the table of community collaboration is what makes this game so good. Especially now more than ever, community is what we need.\"\nThough character building is an important aspect of the game, other players said the game provides an opportunity for them to create LGBTQ+ representation that is frequently left out in the media.\nZack Parreco, a player, said often LGBTQ+ characters' stories use \"queerness\" as something that is othering and aimed at larger audiences to gawk at. In Dungeons and Dragons, LGBTQ+ people can build characters and stories where they can control what is important and what is normal.\n\"There is no pressure for queerness to be a performance for others. It is allowed to just exist,\" Parreco said. \"Maybe we make it big or maybe it's just a normal trait in the world. Either way, we get to fully control our queerness and its expression.\"\nOutside of the game world, players are able to take aspects of their fictional characters into their real lives. Some bring with them new pronouns, and others, like Silver, bring back more courage.\nSilver shared that when she started playing, she was \"an anxious little mouse,\" and, when she was comfortable, she began playing a bold character whose main trait was being able to stand up for everybody.\n\"It was a really fun character, and in the process it gave me permission to find my own courage in my real life and now, in my professional life,\" Silver said. \"I'm an adviser for a Pride group. I volunteer in a bunch of different spaces, and I work to help people and I think that's something eight years ago I would have been terrified to do.\"\nAccording to Fierman, this space is particularly important due to the rise in policies rolling back LGBTQ+ protections since President Donald Trump's inauguration. These policies include executive orders prohibiting gender-affirming health care for those under 19 and designating that the country recognizes only two sexes.\nFierman said now more than ever community and joy needs to be prioritized. This game provides a space to escape from the pressures of the outside and create a physical, mental and emotional space for anyone that needs to get away.\n\"The goal of a lot of these anti-LGBTQ policies and misinformation is to take away our joy. They want us to go away, and I think combating hate with love and combating hate with joy is the most powerful thing you can do because that's what's going to keep us going. That's what kept our community fighting back for generations.\"\nDelmarva Pride Center hosts monthly events including Gender Expression Movement, Elder and Intergeneration Social and Parents and Allies Groups. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Delmarva Pride Center to vote on having chapters across the Shore\n\n February 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 633\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On Sunday, the Delmarva Pride Center Board of Directors will vote on a significant change to its bylaws.If the amendment passes, LGBTQ+ groups and organizations like DoCo Pride will have the ability to join the Delmarva Pride Center as a chapter of the organization. Each chapter would also get two seats on the pride center's Board of Directors.\nDelmarva Pride Center Board Chair Tina Jones said the center has found that for organizations in small, rural areas, keeping up with the administrative side of things can be difficult. She said the center would help take care of the administrative tasks for organizations that become members so the organizations could focus on providing services.\n\"Each community here on the Shore is different,\" Jones said. \"Talbot County's very different than Dorchester, than Queen Anne's, than Kent. They know their communities. It allows them to build programs or events that will help better serve their different communities. That's the idea.\"\nJones said amendments to the bylaws have been drafted. She expects the board will vote to pass them Sunday.\nIf the amendments to the bylaws are approved, DoCo Pride, an organization located in Dorchester County, will become a chapter of the center.\nDoCo Pride Chair Caleb Holland said it all started when DoCo Pride reached out to the Delmarva Pride Center about the need for administrative supports. He said that conversation evolved into the idea of coming together and pooling resources.\nHolland said that as a chapter of the pride center, DoCo Pride would keep its name.\n\"Basically, the individual chapters will take the lead on programming, events, things that are specific to that geographical area,\" he said, \"but with the support of the larger Delmarva Pride Center infrastructure.\"\nAlthough DoCo Pride isn't currently a chapter of the pride center, Holland has already gotten a taste for what this collaboration could bring. He said the pride center helped DoCo Pride advertise for a pride walk in December.\n\"And because Delmarva Pride helped us advertise that, we had people coming down from Kent,\" Holland said.\nHolland said DoCo Pride knows what kinds of events and programming will be successful in Dorchester County and in Cambridge.\n\"But that doesn't mean that it wouldn't also be interesting for somebody that's in Kent or Talbot,\" he said.\nWith the Delmarva Pride Center's help and advertising, local events could reach a larger audience across the Eastern Shore.\nJones said this has basically been the Delmarva Pride Center's vision from the beginning.\n\"We just didn't have it quite set up right,\" she said. \"We want to make sure that we're a resource for anybody LGBTQ in the area.\"\nLaurel Atkiss, who founded DoCo Pride in 2021, said she is excited about the possibility of the organization becoming a chapter of the Delmarva Pride Center.\n\"I think that working with an organization that has already gotten their feet under them, has done a few events, has already kind of gone toe to toe with city councils and things, I think there's a lot of wisdom and guidance there that we can benefit from,\" she said. \"And I think that's very exciting to have them available to us.\"\nHolland said one of the reasons he moved to Cambridge in 2023 was because he saw \"so many\" pride flags around the city when he visited.\n\"And so it's really neat for me to now kind of spearhead this effort and bring that kind of visibility that was important for me,\" he said. \"Now I can do that for hopefully other people.\"\nJones said that when they started the Delmarva Pride Center in 2021, there weren't many resources and places to go for area's the LGBTQ+ community.\n\"And so we've just got to make sure that we can come together and have a place where we can just be ourselves,\" she said. \"It's nothing more than that. We just want to be ourselves.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Breakfast and Observance, urged attendees to remain steadfast in their pursuit of justice. The event, originally delayed by snow, brought together community members committed to honoring King's legacy of resilience and activism.\nSponsored by Minary's Dream Alliance, the Chester Valley Minister's Association, and Washington College's Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience, the Feb. 1 event was well attended, with around 150 people gathering in solidarity against racism and injustice.\nFollowing breakfast at Hodson Dining Hall, the program featured music, poetry, and an inspiring address by Beck, owner of Beck Excellence and a diversity, equity, and inclusion facilitator. He emphasized the importance of perseverance, telling the audience, \"Pivot, don't panic.\"\nCo-Executive Directors of Minary's Dream Alliance, Doncella Wilson and Paul Tue III, highlighted the event's theme: \"Mission Possible: Protecting Freedom, Justice, and Democracy in the Spirit of Nonviolence365.\" Wilson and Tue, drawing inspiration from the King Center in Atlanta, Georgia, encouraged attendees not to lose hope even in challenging times.\nTue, a football coach, used a sports analogy to illustrate the need for action. While his role is typically on defense, he urged the audience to go on offense against policies that threaten rights and freedoms at both local and federal levels.\nBeck expanded on Tue's sentiments, acknowledging the weight of unkept promises and progress under siege. Quoting King, he reminded listeners that \"injustice anywhere is a threat everywhere.\" He urged people to resist panic and instead pivot toward collective action, reinforcing that freedom is not merely an individual right but a shared responsibility.\nThe program began with Amiya Potts of New Life Community Methodist Church leading the audience in \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" a hymn written by NAACP leader James Weldon Johnson in 1900. Washington College President Mike Sosulski welcomed attendees and paid tribute to the late Rev. Jethroe Moore II, a civil rights leader dedicated to youth advocacy. Sosulski called on the audience to reflect on the sacrifices made for freedom in 1860, 1960, and to envision what it must look like in 2060.\nLaMonte Cooke, warden of Queen Anne's County's Department of Corrections and recipient of the Maryland Association of Counties' Service Award, read a proclamation on behalf of the Kent County Commissioners, officially declaring Jan. 20, 2025, as Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\nThe Chester River Voices, led by Assistant Director Stephanie LaMotte, performed the traditional African American spiritual \"Soon-a-will Be Done,\" followed by Clare Harner's poem \"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep.\" Washington College students also showcased their talents: Zhanglin You delivered a moving piano performance, while Ayanna-Jalen Harris captivated the audience with her rendition of Rihanna's \"Lift Me Up.\"\nA highlight of the event was the presentation of the Commissioner William W. Pickrum Service Award to Tilise Brown, a dedicated advocate for Kent County youth. Brown, the school counseling secretary at Kent County High School, also serves as the coordinator for the Achieving Academic Equity and Excellence for Black Boys Initiative, a former Kent County Spartans Cheer Commissioner, and the planner of the senior awards ceremony.\nKent County High School Principal Kris Hemstetter, who presented the award, praised Brown's transformative impact over the past seven years. \"She is a powerful force for good, a mentor, guide, and relentless advocate for students,\" Hemstetter said.\nBrown, moved by the honor, expressed gratitude to her mother, grandmother, daughter, and husband for their support. She reflected on her journey, recalling how an injury derailed her dream of cheering for the Baltimore Ravens. However, she found fulfillment in mentoring and leading young people in her community, demonstrating resilience in the face of setbacks.\n\"I will be forever grateful to be in this community,\" Brown said, closing with a King quote urging leaders to prioritize justice over wealth.\nThe celebration continued with a performance by the MLK Steppers, a group of youth girls who executed intricate cheer routines, including a step-up shoulder stand set to Beyoncé's \"Crazy in Love.\"They were trained by Brown, LaToya Johnson, Nichole Blake and Taliyah Russell.\nNext, a historically Black fraternity Omega Psi Phi, specifically the Psi Nu Nu Chapter, followed with a presentation of their Achievement Week honorees.\nBefore concluding, Tue rallied the audience to remain engaged. \"Now is the time to stay in tune with local politics, galvanize, organize, strategize, and then execute,\" he said. \"Let's not cower—let's be courageous, and we will get through it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The galleries around the museum tell the stories of Maryland's founding Black families.\nElinor Thompson, a member of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture, spoke in front of the large crowd. She emphasized the importance of passing down and preserving history.\n\"I'm so glad that we, as a community, this community, can come together and share some of this rich history that we can pass onto the next generation,\" said Thompson, a Kent Island native.\nKay Brown, co-director of Water's Edge Museum, thanked those who came out, including local leaders and community members. The crowd was welcomed by musician Leroy Potter and his group at the Maryland Spirituals Initiative.\nDuring the anniversary celebration, the museum's team provided tours of the galleries, which dive into Oxford's Black history as well as that of the Eastern Shore. Brown said bringing the younger generations into the museum is a key goal moving forward.\n\"We need the seed planted,\" Brown said. \"And we are enthusiastic with our team, and I cannot do this without my team.\"\nDuring the event, Brown asked the Moaney family to stand, honoring the late Tissier Moaney, who died last month. She is described as a founding backbone of the museum's collection.\nJeffrey Moaney is a genealogical advisor for the museum and Tissier Moaney's grandson. He said his grandmother was friends with Water's Edge Museum Founder Barbara Paca for the last 15 years.\nThe two amassed a collection of work and history before the museum ever existed.\n\"It is my grandmother who helped make that connection between the historians of our family like myself and a couple of others to bring this collection to life,\" Jeffrey Moaney said. \"And as an exhibition, as well as a book.\"\nWhile giving a short presentation, Thompson asked attendees to sit down with their families to protect and explore family histories.\n\"We need to have generational sustainability for the next generation,\" Thompson said. \"We need to put our gifts and talents back into our community. We need to start with our businesses and things like that.\"\nThompson asked parents to encourage their children to learn cursive writing, as most papers and documents she preserves are written in cursive. \"We want to put those things back into our communities, back into our children,\" she said.\nAs Black History Month began Saturday, Brown said it's the perfect time for the community to \"show off and show out\" by commemorating its roots, just like the Water's Edge Museum has been doing for four years\n\"You all can make your own memories, make your own museum, in your own churches,\" Brown said. \"We need to start pulling out our photos of grandparents, uncles and aunts, and preserve those photos. Our kids need to see what things look like.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Patterson II, a Democrat, last June sought to rename Black History Month — a recognition that was passed by Congress in 1986.\n\"The reason is, looking back at all the wonderful months we have where they celebrate all different heritages, February is the only month that has \"history\" in the name,\" Patterson said at the June 25, 2024, meeting of the commissioners.\nHe sought to rename the month to \"African American Heritage Month,\" at least locally.\n\"Black History Month never got the same recognition that the other months have received,\" Patterson said at the time. \"We have Asian American, Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Native American Heritage Month, Arab American Heritage Month, so on and so forth.\"\nNow, the results of months of surveying are in, and a good number of Charles County residents were not on board with the name change.\nA majority of the respondents to surveys were in the 45 to 54 age group and the 55 to 64 age group, which each contained just over 28% of participants.\nLow engagement was received from residents ages 34 and under. Just over 2% of participants were in the 25 to 34 age group and just under 3% of participants were in the 18 to 24 age group.\nFive meetings were conducted in person about the topic, with at least one in each county district.\nIn a summary presented Tuesday by Renesha Miles, the chief equity officer for the county, several key findings were summarized.\nThe majority of participants did not support the proposed name change, concerns were raised about how and why the name change was brought up and many participants felt that \"Black History Month\" is a more inclusive term, capturing the contributions and experiences of Black people from various backgrounds, including those from the Caribbean, Latin America and other regions outside of Africa.\nConcerns echoed Commissioner Amanda Stewart's (D) comments when the topic first arose.\nStewart said last year, \"Some folks identify as Black, some folks take offense when someone calls them African American. ... I respect everyone's position. I'm not offended if someone calls me Black, I'm not offended if someone calls me African American. I've heard people say, 'I'm not from Africa, so I'm not African American.'\"\nSome participants in favor of the change referenced the importance of recognizing history, heritage and present accomplishments related to African American culture.\n\"I know at this point, I'm not willing to move forward on this,\" Patterson said.\nThe commissioners settled with a consensus that the name change was not something to move forward with; no vote was conducted. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jones said the center opposes a potential repeal of the diversity statement.\n\"One of the things that our government is supposed to be is representative of all people, and that includes people in marginalized communities,\" Jones said.\nThe resolution's title on the agenda states that it would repeal two 2020 resolutions \"regarding diversity training and development of a Talbot County diversity statement, respectively.\"\nThe first 2020 resolution implemented an annual report of diversity training opportunities offered to staff. The second facilitated the creation of Talbot County's diversity statement, which is now found in its employee handbook.\nThe statement defines diversity, equity and inclusion, explains its purpose and details the county's approach to ensuring diversity. It also outlines how employees can report discrimination.\nStepp, who joined the council in 2022, confirmed to The Star Democrat that he is bringing forward the new resolution.\n\"I certainly think there's a lot of folks that are out there that are trying to make this something that it isn't,\" Stepp said in an interview. \"It's all financial in nature.\"\nIn a letter written to residents Tuesday, Stepp stated the resolution's purpose is to keep Talbot County \"in good standing with the federal agencies providing funds\" to the county. He said it's not an attack against the county's diversity and inclusion.\nStepp's letter makes mention of President Donald Trump's Jan. 20 executive order to end all diversity, equity and inclusion policies and programs in the federal government.\n\"What this proposed resolution will do is protect the Talbot County taxpayer from potentially not receiving the millions of dollars Talbot County already receives annually from the Federal Government,\" Stepp wrote.\nFormer Talbot County Council President Corey Pack brought forth the initial resolutions in the summer of 2020. In an interview Tuesday, he said the diversity statement was meant to \"memorialize\" what the council was already doing regarding diversity, equity and inclusion in the workforce.\nPack hopes any attempt to repeal fails and said he's disappointed the council may be looking to remove the statement.\n\"Put your money where your mouth is,\" Pack said. \"If this is what you are about as a governmental body, what's wrong with putting that in writing? If you are a governmental body that believes in diversity, that believes in inclusion, that believes in equality, what's the fear?\"\nCounty Council Vice President Pete Lesher was on the council when the two resolutions were passed in the summer of 2020. He said he hasn't noticed anything that would lead him to \"try to attempt to remove them.\"\n\"I've gone back and read over the language of the diversity statement, and I can't imagine what in there anybody would find objectionable,\" Lesher said in an interview.\nLesher added that he's worried removing the diversity statement could hurt the recruitment and retention of county government staff.\n\"I don't know that somebody would come here on the basis of whether or not we have these statements,\" he said, \"but the publicity of actually proactively removing such a statement might send a signal that some people aren't welcome here.\"\nBefore Tuesday's meeting was canceled, groups such as the Delmarva Pride Center and Talbot County Democratic Forum encouraged members to attend the meeting and speak against the proposal.\n\"Our community voices matter. Together we can defeat this transparent challenge to the Eastern Shore value of treating others with dignity and respect at all times,\" wrote Michele Dappert, forum president, in a newsletter Saturday. \"The community must speak out to ensure this progress is not erased.\"\nThe proposed resolution is expected to be on the agenda for the Talbot County Council's next meeting on Tuesday, Feb. 25. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge Woman's Club hosts presentation about obtaining citizenship\n\n February 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 492\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Seeing herself as a voice for Federalsburg's Haitian community, Gelard Merilus Loulou attended the Cambridge Woman's Club Friday to gather helpful information that she can take back to Federalsburg.Friday afternoon, the club hosted Lindsay Waite, a retired attorney who currently volunteers at the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center in Easton to help those who are applying for United States citizenship prepare.\nMerilus Loulou said Federalsburg's Haitian community is \"in crisis,\" with many fearful about what could happen in the county in the coming months when it comes to immigration.\nWith a new administration in the White House, there has been a push to crack down on illegal immigration, which has caused concern among migrants in the United States.\nDuring her presentation, Waite spoke about the process for naturalization in the U.S. She explained that to gain citizenship, a person must file a Form N-400 application for naturalization, have their biometrics taken, pass a background check, pass the citizenship test and complete an interview with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. If the person is approved after these steps, they will need to take the Oath of Allegiance at a naturalization ceremony.\nWaite said she believes the process costs about $800 to complete.\nAt the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, Waite and other volunteers help prepare those with green cards who want to obtain citizenship. She said volunteers help go over the Form N-400 application, review questions that could be on the test and practice reading and writing.\nWaite said the citizenship test includes an English portion and also asks questions about democracy, the constitution, history and geography.\nOffering some of the more difficult questions to the audience at the event, Waite said the people she works with come in for about 10 weeks to review questions and practice English.\n\"They learn a lot more than I think my nephew, who went to high school and college, could probably know,\" she said, causing people in the audience to laugh.\nClaudia White-Cooke and Joyce Dowling, who attended Waite's presentation, said after hearing some of the questions on the test, they weren't sure if they'd be able to pass it. White-Cooke said the process to become a citizen seems complicated and the people who apply are really committed.\nWhen one person at the event asked if the new presidential administration has affected the naturalization process at all, Waite — who said she is not an expert on what's happening at the national level — said she did notice a change in priority for legal entry into the U.S. from Venezuela.\n\"To a limit, a certain number of people from Venezuela were being given entry legally and now that's stopped,\" she said.\nWaite said she believes the naturalization process in the U.S. will continue, however. She said people still want to be American citizens.\n\"And I and others will do what we can to help,\" she said.\nThose who are interested in volunteering with the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center or want to learn more can call 877-772-9832 or visit chesmrc.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Fearing ICE raids, Delmarva immigrants mostly stay home\n\n February 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: PAUL KIEFER Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1304\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n GEORGETOWN, Delaware — Race Street, usually the busy commercial core of a Central American neighborhood, was deserted on a clear weekday evening.A man named Delmar sat in an otherwise empty restaurant, sipping a hot drink from a styrofoam cup. Unlike many of his neighbors, he told a visitor, he's not reacting prematurely to the possibility of immigration raids.\nHe's remaining hopeful, he said, but he's also prepared.\n\"El plan A es esperarse,\" he said. \"El plan B es prepararse.\"\nThe region's key industries, Delmar added, should see the empty businesses on Race Street as a sign of oncoming trouble. Without undocumented immigrants like him, the Delmarva Peninsula's construction, agriculture and hospitality employers could face a critical labor shortage.\n\"What's going to happen to the workforce?\" he asked in Spanish. \"They need the value that immigrants provide.\"\nNot all immigrants in Georgetown without legal status are as relaxed as Delmar.\nAs rumors of pending raids circulate through rural communities on the Delmarva Peninsula, places like Race Street have grown eerily quiet. The mere possibility that the Trump administration might follow through on its mass deportation plans is enough to have a chilling effect in rural towns where many immigrants feel especially visible.\nCapital News Service is not using the last names of undocumented immigrants or those in the asylum process at their request, to protect their identities.\nDrawn initially by the region's poultry industry and other agricultural work, thousands of immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean settled in small towns and cities on the peninsula over the past five decades.\nThe peninsula remains a destination for new migrants. Since 2020, Wicomico County has received more new immigrants with cases in federal immigration court — including asylum seekers — per capita than any other county in Maryland, according to an immigration court case database maintained by the Department of Justice.\nThe same data indicates that both Wicomico County and Accomack County on Virginia's eastern shore received more post-2020 immigrants per capita than Los Angeles County.\nChildren and grandchildren of those immigrants now make up a large share of the student body at North Georgetown Elementary, which serves children from the neighborhood surrounding Race Street.\nJennifer Nein, a multi-language learning coordinator who works at the school, said her students are on edge.\n\"I've noticed a few kids who are a little bit quieter than they normally are,\" she said. \"When I say, 'Are you alright,' they come right out and tell you, 'I'm just really scared. I'm scared that I'm going to go home and my parents are going to be gone.'\"\nAnother student recounted panicking at the sound of someone knocking on the door of their home, Nein said, only to discover that the visitor was a family member.\nNein noted that while her school has yet to see attendance drop substantially, some families are planning for the worst-case scenario, including arranging powers of attorney and identifying family members or neighbors who could take their children in if they are deported.\nMargarita, an immigrant from Mexico who works at a restaurant on Race Street, said she's watched families in her orbit prepare to take their U.S.-born children with them if they are forced to leave the country.\n\"Those who were born here and have immigrant parents — their parents are looking for ways to obtain passports and send their children to Guatemala,\" she said in Spanish.\nLina, a Guatemalan immigrant in Selbyville, a town twenty miles south of Georgetown on the Delaware-Maryland border, told CNS that she plans to take her two children with her if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ramps up its enforcement efforts on the peninsula.\n\"For me, it would be ideal to first see if they really do start arresting people around here,\" she said in Spanish. \"Then I would leave with my daughters.\"\nAt least a few of her acquaintances, she added, decided to preemptively cut their losses and return to their home countries.\nFrom behind the counter of a restaurant in Selbyville, Maria, an immigrant from Mexico, said that the same anxieties are straining businesses that rely on immigrant customers.\nSince President Trump's inauguration last month, Maria said that the restaurant has seen few dine-in orders as worried regulars try to minimize the time they spend in public spaces. Some take-out customers, she added, insist that she check the parking lot for signs of immigration enforcement before they come to pick up their meals.\n\"When sales go down, work goes down,\" Maria said. While the restaurant usually requires two servers per shift, she worked a weekday lunch hour alone in late January. At that rate, she said, some businesses in small towns like Selbyville may not survive.\nThose precautions aren't unique to undocumented immigrants.\n\"There are citizens here,\" said Jean-Frandy Philogene, the outreach and field coordinator with the Maryland office of a farmworker assistance nonprofit Comité de Apoyo a los Trabajadores Agrícolas, or CATA. \"But even though they are [citizens], they are scared — some of them — because they don't know exactly how they're going to do the deportations.\"\nPhilogene said he's met naturalized citizens in the Salisbury area who, despite carrying proof of their citizenship, are still cutting back their non-essential visits to workplaces and businesses.\nSo far, he added, only a handful of the immigrant workers in his orbit have decided to avoid their workplaces.\nBut the Rev. Roosevelt Toussaint, president of the Haitian Development Center of Delmarva, thinks that may not last.\nHis organization serves thousands of Salisbury-area Haitian immigrants who entered the country after the Biden administration launched a \"humanitarian parole\" for immigrants from four countries, including Haiti, in January 2023. That program allowed parolees to live and work in the United States for two years.\nThe Biden administration later opted not to renew the legal status of immigrants who arrived through the program, and Trump formally ended the program by executive order on his first day in office. While those immigrants generally still have legal status, Toussaint said it's unclear whether the Trump administration will offer an alternative path for them to remain in the country.\n\"There's a fear among the business owners,\" he said, that Haitian workers might disappear if they are left in legal limbo. \"So they are looking for options — what options are there for those employees to seek [legal status]?\"\nTom Super, the senior vice president of communications for the National Chicken Council, told CNS that his industry has yet to see workforce impacts.\nBut Leila Borrero Krouse, an organizer in CATA's Maryland office, said it's unclear whether the migrant farmworkers who come to the peninsula in the summer to pick watermelons, tomatoes and other produce, will return this year.\nWhispers about upcoming workplace raids have already begun to spread in Georgetown.\nLt. Joel Diaz, the city's deputy police chief, said his department received a flurry of calls about alleged ICE arrests at restaurants and other businesses last month, none of which proved accurate.\nEarly last week, however, ICE agents appeared in Georgetown to detain a fugitive, giving the police department advance notice of their arrival.\nDiaz said the operation wasn't the first of its kind in Georgetown, but his department is now trying to dispel misinformation and calm the town's nerves.\n\"That initial blast is what makes folks uneasy,\" he said.\nImmigration raids are nothing new on the Delmarva Peninsula. In 1996, federal immigration agents arrested more than 100 workers at two poultry processing plants on Maryland's Eastern Shore.\nThat era's raids prompted some Haitians to depart for Canada, Toussaint said, as did Trump's first term in office.\n\"Every time there's a change in the federal government, there's always a stir for people to move,\" he said.\nCelsa, an immigrant from Mexico who came to Georgetown in the early 2000s, told CNS that while more recent arrivals might be alarmed by the Trump administration's rhetoric on immigration, she doesn't believe the next four years in Georgetown will be meaningfully different than the last two decades.\n\"Todo el tiempo ha sido lo mismo,\" she said. It's always been like this. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

I know, given the national use of the word \"woke,\" you want to be on the non-woke side.\nI am proud to be woke because the word in this context means: to be aware of social injustice.

We further understand that this may be done in a way that flies below the radar, without input — perhaps to push a political agenda without public scrutiny.First, we must say that we are strong supporters of the underlying concept of providing, enhancing and maintaining a diverse, equitable and inclusive community. We live our lives accordingly, and hope that each of you do, as well.\nIf the council were to remove the DEI statement from the county handbook, are you saying that you, the council and by extension, Talbot County and its citizens, do not agree with providing a supportive and equitable workplace? Are you saying that not all county employees are valued, but that some are and some aren't? Which are not, and why?\nAre you saying that you reject a workplace that values respect, understanding and acceptance of all employees or just some? What could possibly have changed to make Talbot County less accepting, understanding and committed to fostering a safe and equitable workplace for all of our valuable county employees? This can only be the result of the current political climate that has demonized the concept of DEI far beyond what it actually is and the wonderful spirit with which the prior Talbot Council unanimously approved this statement.\nPlease do not let politics pollute and degrade the admirable traits contained in the statement, and let's continue to honor and respect all of our fellow citizens equally. We urge you to keep Talbot County great by keeping the diversity, equity and inclusion statement not only in the employee handbook, but in our hearts, minds and actions as a community.\nWhich of these things, specifically, are you no longer committed to, and why?\nThe county is committed to: (1) maintaining an inclusive, productive, supportive, open, innovative and equitable workplace environment in which every individual is valued for his or her unique characteristics; (2) fostering respect, understanding and acceptance of differences; and (3) enabling employees to reach their full potential, thus enhancing the relationships among ourselves and optimizing the quality of services to our residents and our fellow employees.\nPEG AND RICK HUGHES\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Fountain case sparked animosity between papers",
    "date": "2025-02-21",
    "author": "JOSEPH KOPER",
    "content": "Fountain case sparked animosity between papers\n\n February 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JOSEPH KOPER | Section: Columns \n \n 1200\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n During the two-plus years of the contentious Isaiah Fountain case (1919-1921), Easton and Talbot County were rocked with many controversies and side stories that derived from the the original case. In April 1919, Isaiah Fountain — an African American — was accused of raping a local white girl. Fountain's case generated hundreds of news articles relating to his case resulting from: his two trials and convictions, multiple lynching attempts, two escapes and manhunts, armed infantry troops surrounding the Talbot County courthouse, questionable court decisions and his controversial execution.The general sentiment in conservative Talbot County was that Fountain was guilty of raping the white girl. Of course, during the Jim Crow era, any allegations of sexual or even suspicious social contact between a Black man and a white female were taken extremely seriously by the white population. During this period there were many locals who felt the need to to resort to the \"Lynch Law.\" Similar sentiments were echoed — or even promoted — by the Easton Star-Democrat. Contrary viewpoints were quickly and passionately disputed by the paper. As with most local editors of the era, though, the Star-Democrat's Samuel E. Shannahan was determined to present Easton and Talbot County in the best light possible.\nAccording to Norman Harrington's book, \"Easton Album,\" Shannahan was the longtime editor of the Easton Star-Democrat. Harrington described Shannahan as: \"chauvinistic, elevating the interests of Talbot County above all else.\" Shannahan was the ultimate local \"booster\" for Talbot County and didn't stand for any criticism about his home county.\nCertainly, he didn't accept the implications of Lynch Law, Jim Crow, mob violence and racism that the events of Fountain case cast over Easton and Talbot County. He was determined to uphold the honor and reputation of his hometown, regardless of what \"outside\" publications printed.\nThe Baltimore newspapers (Sun, Evening Sun, News and Afro-American) viewed the Fountain case with a somewhat more balanced journalistic eye. They generally reported evidence that suggested that Isaiah Fountain was innocent of the rape charges.\nThe reporting of the \"big city\" newspapers infuriated editor Harrington, who took issue with just about everything the the Baltimore papers printed. When the Baltimore papers reported that a 2,000-person mob attempted to lynch Isaiah Fountain, the Easton weekly minimized the lynching attempt and blamed the \"excitement,\" on people from other counties or troublemakers from Delaware.\nShannahan was furious that the Baltimore press would dare impugn the dignity of local citizens by reporting opposing accounts of events. A Star-Democrat editorial labeled the \"big city\" newsmen as \"a mob of cub reporters\" and called their reporting \"not only unfair but disgusting.\" In another article the Star-Democrat used bold type to complain: \"Of all the things to be resented, next to the crime itself, the absolute contempt for the truth, the utter barefaced lies published by the press of Baltimore city, is most to be condemned.\"\nIn short, there was very little that the Baltimore and Easton papers agreed upon regarding the Fountain case. This visceral journalistic animosity even extended beyond the matters of the Fountain case. For example — in an attempt to mend journalistic fences — the Baltimore News sent a reporter to Easton to write a sort of travelogue about the town. The News published the article on Sunday, Feb. 1, 1920, and the Star-Democrat reprinted the story a week later.\nSurprisingly, the local press expressed dissatisfaction with the article and ignored its very positive depictions of Easton. A person reading the story today, would think that it was crafted by a public relations firm hired by the Easton Chamber of Commerce. Still the article's praise for Easton didn't matter to the local weekly. The paper continued its journalistic feud with the Baltimore News by it's headline for the story it reprinted on Feb. 7, 1920: \"Says Easton is slow/Baltimore news man does not flatter Talbot's county seat in review in Sunday's issue/Says we pride ourselves on quality instead of quantity — sees us as serene and satisfied'\nThe Star-Democrat prefaced the News article with this statement: \"Some of the story is good, some untrue, and none of it as good as Easton is entitled to.\" Today, a reader of the article would probably agree that Easton was as desirable a place to visit and live then as it is now.\nThe only comments that I could discern as being even remotely negative involved the \"high cost of living\" (i.e., the \"two-bit\" bus ride from the railroad station) and this statement: \"... Easton, Talbot's lovely county seat, grows with that slowness that is akin to sureness. ...\"\nThe article is chock full of complements, calling Easton: \"Serene and satisfied\" and \"lovely.\" The article praises \"the well-paved thoroughfares,\" \"charming homes\" and \"ancient and worthy trees.\" The Baltimore News reporter wrote with awe about visiting The Old Friends Meeting House and described his visit to the nearby Wye House and its \"wonderful old garden.\" He called the Wye House \"one of the most beautiful and historical estates on the Eastern Shore.\"\nReading the Baltimore News review about Easton over a century later, I confess that I don't understand the Star-Democrat's stubborn viewpoint about the article being \"untrue\" or unkind to Easton. The apparently offending comment about Easton's \"slowness that is akin to sureness\", strikes me as a very positive comment.\nThe complaint about the \"high cost of living\" and the \"two bits\" it cost for transportation from the train station are hardly condemnations, but merely observations that many of us might make today about the economy. The Baltimore News reporter gushed with praise for Easton, describing it as: \"this attractive town\" \"Easton gives constant pleasure to the artistic eye\" and \"well-groomed, well-bred, and unobtrusive.\"\nThe writer also portrayed the town as \"lovely\", and \"the most pleasing of the larger cities of the Eastern Shore.\" The News reporter then described Easton as: \"the Queen City of the glorious Eastern Shore of Maryland\" and \"richly endowed by nature as a manufacturing center and place of residence.\" The reporter praised the \"well-paved\" streets, \"splendid sidewalks\" and the sewerage system \"of the most advanced type.\" The article even cited the town's \"efficient lighting plant,\" and its plan to purchase a modern motor fire engine.\"\nAfter reading the Star-Democrat's hyper-critical and fussy comments about the Baltimore News article, one must ask: \"What's wrong about this gushing review of Easton?\" The News article about Easton sure makes it seem like the kind of place one would like to visit or live. I think most readers would agree that the lovely town of Easton is still much the same as described in the newspaper article from over a century ago — except for the century-old vitriol shown for the \"big city papers\" and the comment about having to spend \"two bits to ride in the omnibus.\"\nWith his stanch anti-Fountain editorial viewpoint and disdain for \"big city\" newspapers, Editor Samuel Shannahan remained fiercely devoted to his hometown and the Easton Star-Democrat. Under his editorship, in 1937 the Maryland Press Association named the Easton Star-Democrat as the best weekly newspaper in Maryland. Ever the newsman, Shannahan died on December 7, 1942, while working at his editor's desk — some 22 years after he declared the Isaiah Fountain case to be \"... one of the most noted in the State's annals.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "State, county leaders join Frederick Douglass descendants to unveil new plaque\n\n February 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 482\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Exactly 130 years after Frederick Douglass' death, the Talbot County-born abolitionist and civil rights leader was honored for his lasting impact on freedom, equality and education.Descendants, county leaders and state transportation officials gathered to unveil a historical marker honoring Douglass at the Talbot County Courthouse Thursday morning. They were joined by Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller.\nMiller spoke at the unveiling, noting that Douglass' calls for justice still demand answers to date. She pointed out the crucial role he played in advancing education for Black Americans during a time when it was not widely accepted.\n\"Frederick Douglass dared to see beyond the chains that bound him,\" Miller said. \"He knew that true liberation was not just freedom of the body, but freedom of the mind.\"\nThe marker, one of nearly 800 official historical signs created by the Maryland Department of Transportation, will be placed at Tappers Corner Road and Route 303, just northeast of Cordova and near Douglass' birthplace.\nJulie Schablitsky, cultural resources chief for the Maryland Department of Transportation, said after working with Douglass family descendants and community members, an addition was made to the text on the historical marker: Anna Murray.\nMurray, Douglass' first wife, was \"strong\" and \"loyal,\" Schablitsky said. Many speakers Thursday maintained that Murray's fight for equality and justice was just as important as Douglass'.\nSchhablitsky noted Murray was crucial in Douglass' escape from slavery, sewing the sailor suit he used to disguise himself while fleeing north.\nKenneth Morris Jr., Douglass' great-great-great-grandson, called Murray an \"equal partner\" to her husband.\n\"It was Anna who made his escape possible,\" Morris said. \"Her strength, sacrifice and unwavering support ensured that his journey to freedom was not just his alone, but part of a greater fight for justice that continues today. I'm just as proud of her as I am of him.\"\n\"Her story reminded me that during difficult and challenging times, we must rely on each other and sometimes risk our own safety for the ones we love,\" Scablitsky said.\nOther local and state officials spoke during the event, including Department of Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld, Talbot County Council President Chuck Callahan and Easton Mayor Megan Cook.\nEdward \"Boots\" Robinson, president of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society, and Tarence Bailey, Douglass' five-time great nephew, provided words as well.\n\"No place is more important to mark his footsteps than where Frederick Douglass experienced his first taste of freedom while living with his grandparents, enjoying those few spiritful, joyful years,\" Robinson said.\nBailey said that when he was growing up in Easton, many of his elders didn't openly discuss the history of slavery in the area. Descendants of Harriet Tubman weren't allowed to talk about Tubman outside their houses, Bailey said.\nThe roadside marker will give the younger generations a chance to learn about that history and the local legacy of Douglass, Bailey said.\n\"We didn't have this,\" Bailey said. \"So to be able to give it to the next generation is really special.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County’s United States Colored Troops fought with valor and honor\n\n February 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: PAUL W. CALLAHAN Talbot County Historical Society | Section: Local News \n \n 566\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Though President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, issued on Jan. 1, 1863, did not free the enslaved people in Maryland, it allowed African Americans throughout the nation to serve in the Union Army as part of the United States Colored Troops. This gave Black Americans the opportunity to fight not only for their nation, but also for their freedom and citizenship — and fight they did.Frederick Douglass, a native son of Talbot County and a leading African American abolitionist, writer, orator and newspaper publisher, placed steady pressure on the Lincoln administration to include African Americans in the Union Army. Douglass met with the president, used his influence to the fullest, and has received great credit towards the creation and support of the United States Colored Troops.\nDuring the Civil War, nearly 180,000 African Americans served in the Union Army, with almost 80,000 recruited from states that remained in the Union. Of this number, 8,718 were from Maryland. Talbot County led all Maryland counties in total enlistments.\nBy the start of the war, African Americans in Talbot County were nearly equally divided, with half enslaved and half free. Many enslaved individuals from Talbot earned their freedom by enlisting in the United States Colored Troops.\nThe Civil War saw the first draft in U.S. history to enroll men for battle. There were four draft rounds during the war, but Talbot County was only subjected to the first. The enlistment of Talbot's African Americans counted toward the county's quota of men required for the Union Army. Because so many Black men enlisted, no white men from Talbot were drafted after the first round.\nMany senior Union commanders voiced skepticism about how African Americans would perform in battle and questioned their willingness to fight. Many formerly enslaved men had little experience with firearms and could neither read nor write, as they were often prohibited from learning. Time and time again, Black soldiers proved their mettle in combat, exhibiting great valor, courage and a ferocious fighting spirit.\nMen from Talbot County served in every United States Colored Troops regiment formed in Maryland and in the United States Navy. They participated in major battles in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina in 1864 and 1865, including the battles to capture Petersburg and Richmond.\nTalbot County soldiers were also involved in the final battles leading to the defeat of General Robert E. Lee's army and were present when Lee surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse.\nThis May, the Talbot Historical Society, located in downtown Easton, will present an exhibit titled \"With Valor and Honor — Talbot County's United States Colored Troops During the Civil War.\"\nThis exhibit will feature numerous images and artifacts that tell the story of the courage, honor and valor displayed by these men.\n\"They served their nation at a time when many Black people in the Union states were still enslaved, and those who were free had no rights of citizenship,\" the Historical Society said in a press release. \"Our staff has been working diligently to research this history and, most importantly, to identify the names of the men who served. To date, we have uncovered the names of over 550 men from Talbot County who served in the Union's United States Colored Troops — and we are still discovering more.\"\nDuring this exhibit, the Talbot Historical Society will have these men's military records available so those who are interested, including these men's descendants, can have direct access to this rich history. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot council tables vote on diversity statement as residents push back\n\n February 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: News \n \n 553\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot County Council chambers filled to the brim for Tuesday's meeting, with many of the more than 100 attendees there to oppose a potential removal of the county's diversity statement.On the meeting's agenda was a resolution to remove the statement from the employee handbook. Proposed by Council Member Dave Stepp, the resolution would repeal two 2020 resolutions — one that developed the diversity statement and another that implemented an annual report of diversity training offered to staff.\nStepp's resolution was tabled and will be on the council's March 11 meeting agenda. However, its chances to pass appear slim, as a majority of the council — Council Vice President Pete Lesher and Council Members Keasha Haythe and Lynn Mielke — indicated their opposition to the resolution Tuesday.\nMielke said she was \"surprised\" by the resolution and doesn't believe there are reasons to remove the diversity statement.\n\"It's just a statement of who we are, what we recognize,\" Mielke said, receiving loud applause from the public. \"I see no reason to withdraw this.\"\nStepp stated his requested resolution would keep Talbot County in good standing with the federal government and agencies that fund the county. He made mention of President Donald Trump's Jan. 20 executive order to end all diversity, equity and inclusion policies and programs in the federal government.\nStepp said he spoke to county employees and all of them supported the statement's removal.\n\"All of our county employees that I spoke with were kind. They're hard working and fully supportive of repealing these policies,\" he said. \"I heard from a grand total of zero county employees that requested to keep these DEI policies in place.\"\nDuring a lengthy public comment section, nearly all residents who spoke regarding Stepp's resolution did so unfavorably. That resident opposition was voiced in the chambers throughout the meeting and earlier in the day, too.\nMore than an hour before the meeting's onset, many gathered outside the courthouse holding signs opposing a potential repeal.\nGloria McVeigh said removing the county's diversity statement would be a setback.\n\"We really need our leadership at every level of government to stand for the principles that make us America,\" McVeigh said. \"And diversity, equity and inclusion, that's what that is. Everybody is part of this country, everybody has something to contribute.\"\nMary Pellicano held a sign reading \"DEI = DEMOCRACY\" and expressed worry for if the county acts in an \"anticipatory\" manner to comply with executive orders.\n\"When people just capitulate before things are tested, that's the demise of our democracy,\" Pellicano said. \"So I really feel like people need to speak up, come out, show up, state their concerns and understand what this means for our country and democracy.\"\nEaston resident Steve Parks, who attended Tuesday's meeting with his wife, Elizabeth, said the entire discussion surrounding DEI feels political. He pushed back against the idea that diversity initiatives are simply apart of a \"woke\" movement.\n\"What it means is to be awake to injustice in the world,\" Parks said. \"What's wrong with that?\"\nMcVeigh said if the council weakens its commitment to diversity, the wrong message is sent to the people of Talbot County.\n\"We're actually looking at the safety of employees who can be labeled DEI hires and their families,\" McVeigh said. \"We can't pretend that that's not what's at stake here. So I am pleading to them to do the right thing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Rooted Wisdom partners with Bloomberg for guided history walk at Adkins Arboretum\n\n February 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 694\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n RIDGELY — Adkins Arboretum and Beech Works are have been collaborating on the Rooted Wisdom Podcast for months. Now, they are working together on a similar project, but with a twist — Rooted Wisdom Walks.Rooted Wisdom Walks consists of audio walking guides for three trails at the arboretum. For listeners of the podcast, the voice sharing history along the 45-minute to hourlong walks will sound familiar.\nRooted Wisdom Walks historian Anthony Cohen guides the listeners through the trails.\nAccording to Rooted Wisdoms producers, Adkins Arboretum best shows natures' role in the Underground Railroad through its diverse landscape.\n\"Adkins is one of the few places where you can go and see examples from these narratives of the landscape in one place,\" George Burroughs, one of Rooted Wisdom Walks producers, said.\n\"It leverages Adkins as a place to come and try to understand and put yourself in the footsteps of a freedom seeker by observing what they might have observed.\"\nRooted Wisdom Walks offers a digital guide from Beech Works with technology supplied by the Bloomberg Philanthropies Connects app for mobile devices.\n\"We were looking for an app ... and what would work best for it,\" Burroughs said. \"There is not WiFi on a 400-acre forest. That's another issue. So we came across Bloomberg Philanthropies, and they developed this app, this platform for it, and it's downloadable.\"\nAnother big component of choosing the Bloomberg app is the ability to add pictures and videos to the audio, producers said.\n\"The key to with the Bloomberg Connects digital guide is that it's a multimedia platform. Like, we can put video in there,\" Burroughs said. \"We didn't do it for this one, but we put photographs that were taken by us and Adkins staff to help listeners identify what's being discussed.\"\nCohen travels with listens and stops at certain points in the trail to give a little background on what the listener is seeing at the park. But the recordings also give the listener some points of independence with the walk as well.\n\"There are times where there's something that matches that they're talking about specifically,\" Lauren Giordano, one of Rooted Wisdom Walks' producers, said. \"So visitors are prompted to walk to that space and then listen to the conversation there, and then the next stop there.\n\"They're walking and listening to the next segment of the conversation. So there are times where it's really kind of self-guided, but there's also a choice from the participant, where you can take more time at a spot for reflection.\"\nCohen believes that time gives listeners a chance to reflect on different wayfinding tactics that were used during the Underground Railroad.\n\"The probably far too simply put story of the Underground Railroad, or part of it, is the story of wayfinding,\" Cohen said. \"How do you get from point A to point Z and what propelled you along that journey?\"\nAdkins Arboretum helps tracks attendance via their map box and general attendance at the park each year.\nGinna Tiernan, executive director at Adkins, expects the arboretum will see an uptick in visitors with the new guided walks.\n\"We have a visitor center here. We have a map box outside that they could use,\" said Ginna Tiernan, executive director at Adkins. \"Of course we have a big, beautiful sign as well. Bloomberg did a fantastic job in allowing the producers to find just the right sign makers, and Lauren Giordano (producer) did all the graphics, fabulous icons that show you the way, what trail to take.\"\nWith Rooted Wisdom Walks, listeners don't have to be at the park to experience the audio. They can also just listen at home.\nThe producers credit Cohen's creativity and knowledge of history to making to audio captivating.\n\"You have people that know the history, and it's very hard to find people that can help you experience it a bit and get you connected to it,\" Burroughs said. \"But what Tony does so well is the connective tissue in between that someone needs to be conduit and facilitate, and that's what Tony does best.\n\"That's the experiential history part, we haven't been on anything else around any other subject, where someone performs the work that Tony does, and they and provides that unique perspective that he does.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Mielke disagreed, adding that Trump's executive order hasn't gone through the legal process yet. Some provisions of the measure have been blocked by a federal court.\nStepp said Talbot County's diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives are failing. He noted that the percentage of Black and African American employees in the county government has dropped from 17.5% in 2020 to 15.8% this year.\n\"It's time we, as Talbot County, the employer, stop letting a politicized DEI product get in the way of true and real unity that is displayed daily in all of Talbot County,\" Stepp said.\nVOTE DELAYEDAfter initial discussion on the resolution, Haythe asked that the council table a vote until the council heard public comment and allowed the legal process to play out regarding Trump's executive order.\nHaythe, Stepp and Council President Chuck Callahan voted in favor of tabling, while Lesher and Mielke opposed.\nThroughout the meeting, some residents called for the vote to not be delayed to a future meeting. County Attorney Patrick Thomas told the council that since the resolution was tabled, it could not be voted on Tuesday unless at least four council members voted to suspend normal procedures and revisit the resolution.\nFollowing public comment, Haythe moved for procedures to be suspended in hopes of holding the vote. Lesher and Mielke joined her, but Stepp and Callahan voted no, meaning the required supermajority wasn't secured.\nSome residents in the chamber voiced displeasure with Stepp and Callahan, shouting, \"shame.\" One person said, \"we will be back.\" Callahan said the resolution will reappear at a March 11 meeting.\nIn an interview, Haythe said her intention when first tabling the resolution was to hear public comment and then vote. She said there was \"a little bit of miscommunication in regards to bringing it back up and being able to vote and get it done with tonight.\"\n\"I think the public wanted to certainly have it done tonight,\" Haythe said. \"But March 11, and we'll get it done. We'll get it done.\"\nPUBLIC OUTCRYMembers of the public filled the council chambers during Tuesday's meeting, overflowing into the hallway and outdoor courtyard. Many held signs opposing DEI rollbacks.\nResident Gloria McVeigh stood in the back corner of the council's meeting room holding a sign that read \"SUPPORT DIVERSITY.\" At one point, Callahan asked her to put the sign down.\n\"That's not the way (clerk Susan Moran) explained it to me,\" McVeigh said. \"She said as long as we're not blocking anybody's view.\"\n\"The protocol is what I'm telling you. No signs,\" Callahan said. He then said she could stand outside the meeting room door and display the sign through the window.\n\"That's not the protocol,\" McVeigh said, shortly before Callahan acquiesced.\nDuring public comment, nearly all who spoke pushed back against Stepp's proposed resolution. Resident Maegan White expressed feelings of fear.\n\"As a queer woman who lives on the Eastern Shore and lives in this community, I'm scared,\" White said. \" … What I'm being greeted with is disrespect, rejection, exclusion.\"\nTalbot County NAACP President Richard Potter spoke to the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion, adding that \"if anything, we need to put more teeth to this statement.\"\n\"The significance of DEI lies in the ability to drive innovation, enhance decision making and improve organizational performance by bringing together diverse voices and experiences,\" Potter said.\nTina Jones, chair of the Delmarva Pride Center, provided comment on her own behalf. Jones, a transgender woman, said lives are at stake.\n\"When you say DEI doesn't matter, it says to other folks, it's fair game on these people now,\" Jones said. \"And it's time to stop it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Immigrants are essential and deserve our respect\n\n March 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RICK HUGHES | Section: Columns \n \n 590\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In this highly divisive time, it's safe to say that every American agrees that there should be immigration laws. However, opinions mainly differ in what the end goals are and how they're to be accomplished: deporting the undocumented, providing pathways to legal status, amnesty, Dreamers, birth-right citizenship and so on.The Trump administration appears to be painting all non-US citizens (immigrants with Green Cards, Temporary Protective Status, asylees and the undocumented) with the same broad brush by often referring to them as if they were all insane, criminals, gang members or rapists and here to cause trouble. That is not the case, and it is most certainly politically, if not racially, motivated.\nThe U.S. economy and our comfortable way of life depends on immigration and these hard-working people and their money. Those entering the country with a non-immigrant visa are under extremely strict guidelines and working conditions and are entirely dependent on the business sponsoring the visa. They can only enter the country under the terms of the visa agreement and must depart the moment the visa ends.\nThere is no limit on seasonal H2A agricultural visas because we critically rely on the workers. We need these people to have food on our tables. The H2B non-agricultural temporary worker visa program met its annual statutory limit by Jan. 7, and Homeland Security nearly doubled the cap from 66,000 to more the 130,000 just to meet the need for people to do the jobs that couldn't be filled by \"ready, able and qualified American workers.\" On the Eastern Shore, large numbers of people are needed to \"pick crabs\" and without them an entire industry would be at grave risk.\nMy fear is that the ultra-MAGA rhetoric that blasts from the White House on a near daily basis is dehumanizing all non-US citizens and creating an us-versus-them paradigm that will desensitize the public to inhumane treatment of these people. Yes, some undocumented people live here, most are contributing members of our society, and many have spouses and children who are, in fact, U.S. citizens.\nThey pay taxes and rent and shop in local stores and are in every way a member of our society except for a piece of paper. These undocumented immigrants need a commonsense path to citizenship. They are here to realize the American dream of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Many had to flee their homeland under threat of violence and death. They are here and contributing more than they are taking.\nAt the very least, in this supposedly law-abiding country, every person should be granted the opportunity for legal representation and shouldn't be subjected to the threat of arrest, having their families ripped apart, being whisked away to unknown and perhaps foreign detention centers with no warning and deported without formal charges, opportunity for due process or even evidence. The America that I respect and honor protects the poor, the rich, the citizen and non-citizen.\nSince so many reduce everything to dollars and cents, you also should know that according to the comptroller of Maryland's State of the Economy Series: Immigration and the Economy, released in April 2024, \"The American Immigration Council estimates that in 2021 Maryland's combined population of immigrants paid $13.3 billion in federal, state, and local taxes and had total spending power of $33.1 billion.\"\nAnd this doesn't include the huge financial contributions of workers with non-immigrant visas. These people are our neighbors, our friends and coworkers, and we need them. They deserve our respect and appreciation for doing hard work, doing it well and often being overlooked and unappreciated. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to the Associated Press, changes to the webpage included the removal of a photo of Tubman from the top of the page and text edits that removed references to slavery and changed descriptions.\nThe changes to the site came amid the efforts to remove diversity, equity and inclusion policies in the federal government.\nLast week, it was announced that changes to the webpage had been reversed.\nAccording to the Associated Press, a National Park Service spokesperson said the changes were made without approval. The spokesperson said the agency celebrates Tubman.\nIn her statement, Harris said she is \"saddened\" to know the current administration \"is making a concerted effort to rewrite and erase history.\"\nHarriet Tubman, an abolitionist and social activist who was born into and escaped from slavery in Dorchester County in the 19th century, became well known for her work on the Underground Railroad, a network of routes and safe houses that helped slaves escape to their freedom. At the Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational Center in Cambridge, visitors can learn about the legacies of Tubman and other influential African Americans from the Eastern Shore.\nHarris said that along with Tubman's legacy, the center will never forget Frederick Douglass, William Still and others who \"documented and informed the nation of the atrocities of slavery.\"\n\"Tributes shall be given to freedom seekers, abolitionists and the many who endured and fought to end slavery in America!\" Harris said. \"We are evermore emboldened to tell their stories.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "An age in America comes to an end\n\n May 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Columns \n \n 890\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The small town of Oroville, California, drifted into the 20th century as a shadow of its former self.Back in 1848, when gold was discovered in the area, prospectors had poured into the place. But by 1900 the vein had long since petered out, and the town had become little more than an agricultural backwater.\nMeanwhile, the modern world marched on. In Los Angeles, California's first movie theater opened for business in 1902. The next year, the Wright brothers made the first heavier-than air flight at Kitty Hawk. And in 1908, Henry Ford brought the automobile within reach of everyday Americans when he introduced the reliable, relatively inexpensive Model T.\nStill, news of these wonders would have arrived in Oroville as little more than rumors of a wider, more sophisticated world.\nThen, on Aug. 29, 1911, a teenaged layabout named Floyd Hefner strode into the corral of the local slaughterhouse, intending to hitch up a team of horses, and found a nearly naked man leaning unsteadily against a fence-post. The last living member of a Native American tribe had come in from the cold.\nPerhaps not surprisingly for the time and place, guns were drawn, dogs were held at bay, and someone used the telephone in the slaughterhouse to call the law. By the time the sheriff arrived, a butcher's cloak had been thrown over the shoulders of the man, who spoke no language anyone understood. The sheriff handcuffed the man, drove him into town in a wagon (the first time in his life he'd ever ridden in a wheeled vehicle), and locked him up in the county jail.\nIt wasn't long before newspapers throughout the state were reporting the discovery of America's \"last wild Indian.\" Learning of the news, Alfred Kroeber, a renowned professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, sent a colleague, Thomas Waterman, up to Oroville.\nMeeting with the prisoner in his cell, Waterman thought he might be speaking a language related to the Yana tongue. Waterman knew a little Yana, and when he tried it out on the prisoner, the man's face lit up.\nFor the first time since the only other members of his Yahi band had died, he had heard another human being speak a word or two he understood.\nWaterman was able to ask the man his name. Using a combination of gestures and simple Yahi, the man explained that in his culture it was taboo to speak his name aloud to someone else until another member of his tribe had formally introduced him. As this was now impossible, Waterman ended up simply calling him \"Man\" in the Yahi tongue.\nAnd so it is that this Native American man comes down to us in history under the false name of \"Ishi.\" We will never know what his real name was.\nWaterman's fellow professor at Berkeley, Alfred Kroeber, was a remarkable man. He had earned his doctorate in 1901 from Columbia University, studying under Franz Boaz, the father of modern anthropology. Kroeber took Ishi in and gave him a place to live in the university's museum, where Ishi worked as a janitor. This allowed Kroeber and the other anthropologists in his department to study Ishi closely over the remaining five years of his life.\nYou might expect that much of what Kroeber and Waterman learned from Ishi would have been horrifying. This was a man who, from boyhood, watched his tribe and immediate family whittled down by ceaseless slaughter. Norman Kingsley, an eager participant in one of the last massacres, later recounted that, in the middle of his attack, he exchanged his .56 caliber Spencer rifle for a .38 caliber pistol, because the rifle \"tore them up so bad,\" especially the babies.\nBut after his introduction into modernizing California, accounts say Ishi didn't speak of the horrors he'd witnessed, nor did he give in to melancholy or despair. He adapted with grace to his new life and embraced many of the changes happening in the world around him.\nI learned of Ishi from Alfred Kroeber's wife and fellow anthropologist Theodora Kracaw Kroeber, who, in 1961, wrote \"Ishi in Two Worlds,\" now considered a classic of modern anthropology. I first read the book 40 years ago, and rereading it recently, I found myself placing Theodora Kroeber in the same league as Claude Lévi-Strauss. Without ever leaving any of her anthropological principles behind, she consistently writes clear, compelling prose.\nIt isn't easy reading the first part of Kroeber's book, watching as Ishi and the remaining members of his band are forced to withdraw further and further from the whites encroaching upon their world; until, finally, they retreat into that world's last untouched cañon, and, ultimately, its last bushy slopes.\nBut Kroeber's description of the way Ishi handles the world he is then brought into, the way he maintains his Yahi dignity in the face of that world's awesome power (while never losing his ability to see through its sometimes absurd idiosyncrasies) is somehow reassuring. It gave me hope for humanity at large.\nI reread \"Ishi in Two Worlds\" thanks to an Inter-Library Loan, but a copy of the book has now been placed in our collection at the Talbot County Free Library. You'll find it in the Easton library on the Biography shelves under the call letters ISHI. If you're in St. Michaels, you can place a reserve on the book and it will be sent down there for you. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Local veterans and residents gathered April 28 to dedicate the monument to these long-overlooked heroes.The soldiers served in the United States Colored Troops, which consisted of free and enslaved African Americans who fought for the Union during the Civil War. Queen Anne's County has identified about 435 men from across the county who served in these units, according to local historian Chris Pupke.\nMaryland contributed more than 8,000 men to the United States Colored Troops, and by the end of the war, Black soldiers represented about 10% of the Union force, he said.\nQueen Anne's County soldiers predominantly served in the 19th, 39th and 7th regiments, and participated in battles and sieges instrumental to turning the tide of the war and shaping the history of the divided nation, he said.\n\"These men, these heroes, fought, bled and died for this country and we are grateful,\" Pupke said.\nFollowing the war, these men started schools, built churches, searched for loved ones sold into slavery, and helped create the community known today, he said.\n\"Too often today their stories remain missing from our history books, from our community conversations, and from family histories,\" Pupke said.\nWhile more work is necessary to continually recognize the tremendous sacrifices made for freedom, \"today we celebrate these heroes, their bravery and sacrifices, accomplishments and contributions to our community,\" he said.\nAn initiative more than a year in the making, members of the Centreville Veterans Information Committee as well as local artists, masons, community members and county commissioners helped bring the project to fruition.\nKennard African American Cultural Heritage Center Executive Director Tara Coursey noted it was incredible to recognize the legacies of county Civil War soldiers.\nKennard stands as the repository of African American history in the county, so it is only fitting the plaque found a home there, she said.\nPerforming a dedication prayer, Deacon Frank Hessen of St. Christopher's said, \"With courage born of hope they marched from this very soil answering the call to defend the dignity of all people and forge a nation united in liberty. Their sacrifice, steadfastness, and unwavering resolve inspire us still, reminding us of the cost of freedom and the power of unity in the face of adversity.\"\nCommittee member Robert Simms teared up at the performance of taps dedicating the plaque. As a Vietnam-era veteran, Simms understood the loss of friends to war as well as a lack of recognition upon returning home.\nNoting the plaque's meaningfulness to him and others, \"It's been a pleasure to be part of this group,\" Simms said.\nThe Centreville Veterans Information Committee looks forward to the eventual installation of a 6-foot statue to further honor Queen Anne's County United States Colored Troops.\nThe committee's Veterans Coffee House welcomes veterans supporting veterans community and conversations every Monday at the American Legion Jeff Davis Post 18 at 11 a.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tubman's service did not end with the Underground Railroad\n\n May 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: News \n \n 564\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n DORCHESTER COUNTY — Harriet Tubman escaped slavery and became a conductor of the Underground Railroad, leading around 13 missions to free over 70 enslaved individuals around Maryland before the Civil War, but her work didn't stop there.During the war, Tubman was a nurse, Union spy, scout and cook, which prompted the Maryland National Guard to posthumously commission her as a one star general at the American Legion Dorchester Post 91 in Cambridge last year.\nTubman began her service in 1862, when she aided sick and injured Black Union soldiers and newly freed slaves in South Carolina. \"And she did it with a massive bounty on her head,\" said National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom member Bob Nelson.\nShe managed to evade capture all while operating as an agent for the Union Army.\n\"Getting into the byways, where she traveled with the enslaved people that she held free, you really get a sense of how rough it was, how remote it was, how terrifying it was at night. And thus the incredible bravery of these people,\" said Nelson. \"And again, in Harriet's case, the bravery to go back into that over and over again. And then go to South Carolina and help with the war.\"\nTwo years into the war, under the command of Union Colonel James Montgomery, Tubman became the first female to lead an armed military operation, one that many have called her most extraordinary accomplishment. During the Combahee River Raid, Tubman, Montgomery and 150 Black Union soldiers rescued more than 750 slaves.\nThe success of the raid is owed to Tubman's intelligence gathering. Tubman learned from those she helped free where the Confederacy hid torpedoes along the river and the proper routes to rescue people.\nAlongside freeing over 750 enslaved individuals, Union troops came on shore as slaves boarded the military vessels to destroy influential estates along the river. By the time Confederate forces learned what was happening, most of the damage was done.\nHonoring Tubman\nTo honor Tubman and those she fought alongside this Memorial Day, founder of the Menare Foundation Tony Cohen suggests learning more about her story.\n\"There is a new book called 'Combee,' which is one of the Pulitzer Prize Winners, and it's about her service to the Union Army in South Carolina,\" Cohen said.\nCohen is intimately familiar with Tubman's story, having followed in her footsteps in 1996.\n\"I walked from Montgomery County, Maryland to Canada along the route of the Underground Railroad. And so I walked 10 to 25 miles a day for about seven weeks. I stopped in all the towns along the way asking people what they knew about the Underground Railroad, sought out documentation and historical societies, and museums. I spoke with descendants of those folks who made the journey and those who helped them along the way. And I even stayed in people's houses every night, some of them being stops on the Underground Railroad,\" Cohen said.\nCohen is planning on commemorating the 30-year anniversary of his journey by doing it again. He wants to bring the story of the Underground Railroad to a new generation while bring attention to our National Parks on the nations 125th anniversary.\n\"She experienced some of the most harrowing aspects of the slavery system, but her legacy is about pushing through and transcending those situations to bring about change. And I think that's the legacy that folks on the Eastern Shore can be very proud of,\" said Cohen. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Turning back the clock? Five years after George Floyd’s death, race in America faces Trump-driven changes and crossroads\n\n May 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: National \n \n 1397\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in May 2020, Irving Joyner and Rob Carpenter saw some signs of change when it came to race relations in America.Police agencies were pressed for more transparency and greater ability to charge officers accused of wrongdoing. Major employers, federal agencies, universities and progressive communities launched diversity and inclusion initiatives.\nFive years after Floyd's death and ensuing protests and unrest, Joyner, a law professor at North Carolina Central University, is less optimistic.\n\"Now the opposite is occurring,\" Joyner said. \"There is a retrenchment.\"\nHe points to efforts by the Trump administration and other conservatives to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion programs and affirmative action hiring requirements, the directions of policies related to immigration and refugees and rollbacks of legal oversight sought by the Biden administration with the Minneapolis and Louisville police departments after the killings of Floyd and Breonna Taylor in 2020.\n\"The playbook seems to be pretty clear. There is an effort to undermine all the racial progress,\" Joyner said, contending DEI programs criticized by conservatives aim to be pathways to seeing the benefits of a pluralistic society.\n\"We see the parallels and the perils,\" Joyner said of the current landscape and America's history with race.\n'PROTECTING COMMUNiTIES' Since returning to power in January, President Donald Trump has shut down DEI programs (including in the U.S. military) and affirmative action hiring requirements for federal agencies and contractors.\nTrump argues for a \"merit-based society\" and conservatives say DEI and affirmative action policies disadvantage white people and continue to classify people along racial lines.\nThe U.S. Justice Department on May 21 said that it is dismissing federal lawsuits and proposed consent decrees with police in Minneapolis and Louisville in response to the Floyd and Taylor incidents.\n\"Overbroad police consent decrees divest local control of policing from communities where it belongs, turning that power over to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, often with an anti-police agenda,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.\nDhillon said the moves aim to end the Biden administration's \"failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments.\"\nA White House spokesperson said Trump is focused on safety and prosperity \"for all Americans\" and empowering law enforcement.\n\"President Trump is tirelessly enacting policies to ensure America's safety, prosperity, and success for all Americans. Through his Make America Safe Again agenda, the Trump Administration is committed to stopping crime, upholding justice, protecting communities, and empowering federal, state, and local law enforcement,\" said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields.\nThe White House said the president is not considering a pardon of Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer convicted of killing Floyd in May 2020.\nTrump has pressed the District of Columbia to remove Black Lives Matter street murals near the White House and wants to restore names of military bases that bore the names of Confederate generals.\nJoyner and Carpenter, an author and communications professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, feel undercurrents to Trump's rhetoric and agendas.\nThey see cultural and racial undertones to Trump's hard lines on immigration (including his efforts to end birthright citizenship), his nostalgia for a \"Golden Age\" of America and his administration's cuts to foreign aid and refugee programs for developing countries while launching a new one for white Afrikaner farmers from South Africa.\n\"Trump is perceived as turning back the clock,\" Carpenter said.\n'HUMAN NATURE'S SCRIPT'Carpenter sees societal swings after Floyd's death went viral on social media, highlighting police misconduct and America's complicated history of racial and social inequities.\n\"I do think there has been some progress,\" Carpenter said, noting some of the efforts related to policing.\nBut Carpenter said plenty of challenges remain citing research showing 75% of white people do not have friends of color and 66% of Black people don't have any white friends.\nCarpenter said African Americans still face obstacles and discrimination with jobs, noting a 2024 study that found job applicants with 'white-sounding' names were 50% more likely to get callbacks from employers than 'Black-sounding' names.\n\"It's an ongoing trauma. It's still a daily experience,\" Carpenter said of America's racial challenges.\nBut he also said the experiences of race in America and the current pushback to diversity and affirmative action programs have global and historical parallels.\n\"It's all throughout history where a majority population tends to favor themselves and dismiss the complaints of minorities,\" Carpenter said.\nHe said when minority rights are focused on, majority populations tend to feel they are being aggrieved.\n\"It's nothing new under the sun,\" Carpenter said. \"They are just following the human nature script.\"\nECHO CHAMBERSOthers on the frontlines of the social landscape see a mixed bag with the current state of race in America.\nErica Williams, executive director of A Red Circle, a St. Louis-based racial equity group, welcomed post-Floyd police changes such as body cameras and civilian review boards, but said the community distrust of law enforcement persists.\nShe said the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic \"deepened every pre-existing divide — especially in food access, education and health care.\"\nHer group has launched community food programs to help with post-pandemic inflation with U.S. prices up 25% since the pandemic.\n\"We grew more produce, hired youth interns, launched workshops and distributed thousands of pounds of fresh food to families,\" she said.\nAdanté Pointer, a California-based civil rights attorney, sees ups and downs with policing since 2020.\n\"We are seeing officers prosecuted more frequently than before,\" he said. \"However, police shootings and killings have gone up.\"\nLast year, police killings of civilians totaled 1,365 persons, the highest on record, according to Mapping Police Violence.\nThere were 1,159 police-involved deaths in 2020.\nWhite people made up 42.7% of the 2024 deaths while accounting for 59% of the total population. Black people accounted for one-quarter of fatal police incidents while making up 13% of the population.\nPointer said the dominance of social media in contemporary discourse offers an opportunity to learn more about others and their paths. But it also mirrors societal biases and beliefs and technology algorithms allow users to stay in their ideological and social lanes.\n\"It becomes an echo chamber,\" he said.\nGOODBYE DEI?Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York, sees racial pendulums throughout American history.\nHe said there has been progress in narrowing racial income, education and employment gaps but worries about Trump \"appealing to white grievance.\"\nNeiman said. \"It also assumes that Black people have used racism as a weapon to win special privileges at the expense of whites .. It is dangerous: It diverts attention from the real racial disparities in our society and from developing policies to address them.\"\nThe U.S. poverty rate stands at 11% with 18% of African-Americans, 17% of Hispanic Americans, 19% of immigrants and 8% of white Americans living in poverty, according to U.S. Census data and FederalSafetyNet.com.\nSome of the companies and organizations that embraced DEI efforts after Floyd's death have jettisoned those efforts amid pushback from Trump and conservatives.\nOthers have faulted DEI programs as patronizing and self-serving.\n\"DEI is embraced by the business community when they think it will enhance their bottom lines,\" Pointer said. \"They are more than willing to walk away when it's not popular.\"\nSeveral large U.S. businesses, brands and technology firms have sought warm relations with Trump since he returned to power, attending and bankrolling his inauguration and attending other White House events.\nMuneer Panjwani, CEO of Engage for Good (which connects businesses and nonprofits) said DEI programs have driven \"meaningful progress.\"\n\"Companies have become significantly more aware of systemic racism and structural barriers faced by marginalized communities, taking actionable steps toward equity,\" he said.\nBut Panjwani acknowledges Trump has leveraged feelings of alienation among some white people. He also said equity conversations have sometimes been framed too narrowly, overlooking class, gender and other factors.\nCarpenter said white working-class Americans, who have seen stagnant wages and high inflation, have felt unheard in contemporary discourses.\nAll that comes amid post-pandemic financial strains and concentrations of wealth.\n\"Economic inequality has reached alarming levels, with the richest 1% holding over 31% of the nation's wealth while nearly half of Americans still struggle with unexpected financial burdens,\" Panjwani said.\nWilliams said her Missouri-based stays focused on its local work, including a community farm that grows its own food and is looking to offer its own grocery store and food production kitchen.\n\"We've seen an escalation of rhetoric and policymaking that undermines inclusive education, equity initiatives and even basic access programs. In that environment, I stay focused on building what my community needs,\" she said\nCarpenter agrees that it takes popular and grassroots changes in mindsets to move the needle.\n\"Politicians never lead,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trump rebrands 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy\n\n June 7, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TONY WOODS | Section: Columns \n \n 730\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In 2008, I was kicked out of the military because of my sexual orientation under \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" More than a decade after the military overturned that policy, the Trump administration is playing politics and bringing discrimination back to our armed forces. But this time, instead of purging troops for who they love, it punishes them for who they are.Today, brave transgender service members serve in uniform, many of whom have deployed, commanded troops, and put their lives on the line for this country. They serve at twice the rate of the general population, choosing military service at an extraordinary level of commitment.\nThe new order banning transgender personnel is written in broad strokes, just as the original Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy was. That meant nearly anyone could get caught in the dragnet — service members who had never spoken a word about their identity, those outed by others, even those falsely accused. The effects of this policy are even more sweeping as it mandates proactively kicking out any trans service member who has sought basic evidence-based, medically-necessary care just like any other service member.\nThe justifications for this policy echo the baseless justifications once used to discriminate against Black Americans, women, and gay people. While opposing the integration of Black troops into the military, then-Army Chief of Staff General Dwight D. Eisenhower warned that \"the army is not a sociological laboratory\" and that such \"experiments\" would harm morale and discipline.\nIn 1941, Sen. David Walsh argued that allowing women in the Navy \"would tend to break up American homes and would be a step backward in the progress of civilization.\"\nMore than half a century later, in defense of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Sen. Chuck Hagel insisted that \"the U.S. armed forces aren't some social experiment.\" And as recently as 2015, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee used nearly identical rhetoric to oppose women in combat roles, saying, \"The military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military is to kill people and break things.\"\nThis kind of thinking was wrong then, and it's wrong now.\nThe reason my grandfather, a Black man, was able to serve in an integrated military was because we retired those old, backward ideas. The reason my mother was able to serve in the armed forces was because people rejected the notion that women didn't belong in uniform. And the reason I am able to serve today is because \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" was finally tossed onto the ash heap of history.\nBut sometimes, bad ideas don't die. They get repackaged and rebranded. That's what we're seeing now.\nUnder this new policy, even service members who have fully transitioned and are operationally fit will be discharged. Military academies will be forced to expel trans cadets and midshipmen. Recruiters will turn away talented individuals who want nothing more than to serve their country. It is a deliberate purge, one that echoes the discrimination that kept LGBTQ+ Americans out of the military for decades.\nThe U.S. military is already struggling to meet its recruitment goals, missing its target for the Army by 11,000 in 2023 and barely reaching its recruiting goals for 2024 after dramatically lowering them. Why would we turn away trained, capable warfighters — people in whom American taxpayers have already invested millions in training — at a time when we need them most?\nHistory will look back on this decision as a shameful moment, just as it now does on previous efforts to bar women, Black Americans and LGBTQ+ individuals from serving openly. And as before, this policy will not last. It will be challenged, it will be overturned, and one day, we will wonder how it was ever considered acceptable to turn away Americans willing to serve.\nBut the cost in the meantime will be real. Careers will be destroyed. Lives will be upended. Our national security weakened. And America's promise — that anyone who steps forward to serve will be judged by their ability, not their identity — will be broken.\nTo those who have worn the uniform, this moment is not just about policy. It is about principle. Service members swear an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. That oath does not ask for gender identity. It does not make exceptions. It simply demands the courage to stand up when the nation calls.\nThe question now is whether our leaders will do the same. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Booths varied from the Caroline County Democratic Club, Fairy Awesome Secrets by Loralie and Kaiser K9 to the Chesapeake Voyagers Inc. Wellness and Recovery Center.\nCaroline Pride founder and CEO Angel Perez started creating the organization during the pandemic and hosted the first festival in 2021. \"And the year after, as an outcome of the first festival, we opened the Caroline Pride organization,\" he said.\nFor Perez, events like these are particularly important during the current political climate. \"Having events like this one and celebrating pride month is another way to put the message out there regardless of what other people say, 'We are there for you. We hear you. We see you, and we don't want you to go anywhere,'\" he said.\nThe Caroline Pride nonprofit works to support LGBTQ+ members of the community by hosting youth programs, coffee talks, pride socials and other events year-round.\nMiss Trans Maryland, Davina Reign Escade, was one of the first to speak at the event in downtown Denton Saturday. She said it was difficult growing up in a body she didn't feel was hers and that it was especially tough because she didn't have a supportive community.\n\"I am proud to be here as a citizen of this town at one point, and I'm proud to be here to be a voice for our community because we all know what's going on in the world,\" she said. \"We're fighting. We're fighting to be visible, we're fighting to stay here, we're fighting to be loved. We're fighting to just exist,\" Escade said.\nThe event's keynote speaker was recent North Caroline High School graduate Connor Christopher, who expressed gratitude towards his family and friends for making his coming out process easy. Christopher acknowledged this is not the case for a lot of individuals.\n\"Many queer people have been kicked out of their homes, disowned by their families, shunned by their loved ones, harmed or even killed because of their identity,\" he said. \"I have the honor and privilege to be standing on this stage before you today at a festival where we are free to celebrate who we are and what it took to get us here.\"\nChristopher recognized the Stonewall Riots of 1969, and gave the audience a mission to continue to fight for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\"Unfortunately, we are still far from done with our fight,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Tents set up by local businesses and nonprofits packed Harrison Street during the five-hour event.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook spoke to the crowd from the performance stage, commending the sense of community festivalgoers brought to Easton.\n\"Pride is more than just a festival,\" Cook said. \"It's a powerful reminder of the strength it takes to live authentically and the importance of creating a town where everyone feels safe, valued and supported.\n\"I've been proud to stand with you over the years, and I'm especially glad to be here today with my son. It means a lot to me, both as a community leader and as a parent of a son in the LGTBQ+ community, that we live in a place that embraces diversity, celebrates people for who they are and leads with love.\"\nJair Devereaux, a first time festivalgoer, said he was impressed with the vendors and musical performers. Devereaux came from the protests earlier that day.\nWhile he said the festival was great, he said there are still challenges the LGBTQ+ community faces in a rural area like the Eastern Shore.\n\"I don't think that people know that they have a home here,\" Devereaux said. \"It's like having a food desert.\"\nThe Pride Festival has faced controversy and pushback in its four years, namely from the Easton Town Council. A public assembly permit for the 2024 event narrowly passed by a 3-2 vote, and in the months after, multiple council members spoke opposing the Pride festivities.\nBut this year, the council approved the festival's permit 4-0.\n\"I think a lot of things have happened,\" Jones said. \"Of course some council members have changed. But also, I think more importantly, conversations have been happening.\"\n\"Look, we don't all agree on every topic,\" Jones added. \"But there are more things that we agree on than we disagree on. ... Let's get to know people. And this (festival) is a great way.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Extensive research dating back months has helped uncover the names and details of more than 500 Black soldiers from Talbot County.\nBefore the exhibit's soft opening to the public Tuesday, retired Salisbury University professor and historian Clara Small delivered a moving lecture to a packed room in the Talbot County Free Library.\n\"This exhibit will help to put flesh on those names,\" Small said. \"The goal is that it's not just a name anymore, but a human being. One of your ancestors.\"\nThe exhibit — \"Talbot County's United States Colored Troops: A Story of Valor and Honor\" — is located on South Washington Street in downtown Easton. The list of names hangs on one end of the exhibit, though that catalog is continuously being updated as historians learn more about the local soldiers.\nDuring the Civil War, as Small noted, the border state of Maryland did not meet its quota for Union Army soldiers. Many white soldiers avoided fighting through fees or purchasing substitutes, she said.\n\"The solution was to use free Blacks and slaves because they provided an unlimited reservoir of manpower,\" Small said, noting how many Marylanders and slaveholders rejected the idea of using Black troops, fearing a loss of labor.\nAbolitionist and Talbot County native Frederick Douglass advocated for the inclusion of Black soldiers in the Union Army. His work, along with Abraham Lincoln's authorization for the recruitment of slaves, made the United States Colored Troops possible.\nSmall noted around 180,000 Black men served in the Union Army, with more than 8,000 from Maryland and around 600 or 700 from Talbot County.\nResearch conducted by the Talbot Historical Society and partnering groups sheds light on the many free and enslaved Black men from Talbot County who answered the call but never received the same recognition white soldiers were granted.\nHistorical Society member Paul Callahan said it took hours of research, collaboration with local organizations like Easton's American Legion Post 77 and consultation with Small to prepare the list of names.\n\"I saw so many family names, friends that I grew up with in Oxford,\" Callahan said. \" ... I don't even think they knew that their ancestors were American heroes who fought in the war so valiantly.\"\nThe exhibit has records and an electronic database where people can learn specifics about the soldiers: birthplace, date of death, height, eye color, regiment, rank and more. Callahan says it's a tool to empower Talbot County residents to learn more about history and their ancestries.\nHistorians relied on the online military record database Fold3, as well as records in the library's Maryland Room and from local families or veteran groups.\n\"It was very tedious,\" Callahan said.\nSome of the artifacts and items on display in the exhibit come from a Civil War reenactment group in Philadelphia. Project leaders also consulted descendants of the 18 U.S. Colored Troops who founded the Unionville community after the war.\nDuring her lecture, Small said the research makes the Civil War more \"personable\" for local residents. She emphasized that Black families will be better able to trace their heritage.\n\"There should be very few people in this county that are not connected to some of these men in some way, whether it is by marriage, as cousins or as cousins of cousins,\" Small said.\nThe renowned professor highlighted the unfair and discriminatory treatment Black soldiers received even after the Union's victory in the war. She encouraged attendees to tell the accounts of the free and enslaved Black soldiers, stories that aren't told nearly enough.\n\"That is a legacy that is often forgotten, neglected or is purposely left out of our history books,\" Small said. \"It is way past the time to correct those myths, perceptions and erroneous beliefs.\"\n\"This is just the tip of the iceberg,\" Small added. \"We have a lot of work to do.\"\nThe Talbot County United States Colored Troops exhibit is located at the Talbot Historical Society at 25 S Washington St. It is open Wednesdays through Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Moore unveils investment into marginalized communities during event on Pine Street\n\n June 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: News \n \n 653\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — Gov. Wes Moore made a historic announcement at the historic Civil Rights meeting ground of Bethel AME Church in Cambridge on Juneteenth.Moore announced the allocation of $400 million to address discriminatory practices like redlining, mass incarceration and urban renewal in over 400 \"Just Communities.\"\nMaking the announcement at the Pine Street church on the holiday designated to commemorate the ending of slavery in the United States was no coincidence.\n\"This was the Black Wall Street operating in America,\" said the Rev. Devan Martin Thursday of Pine Street as he acknowledged the historic significance of the day, place and announcement. Martin energized the people sitting in pews, reminding them of those who have come here before.\n\"It's not an accident that we've come here on Juneteenth to not only stand on our own two feet, but to stand on the shoulders of our ancestors,\" he said. \"The Harriet Tubmans and Fredrick Douglasses who walked literally enslaved people through these grounds.\"\nCambridge's past\nDuring a time of civil unrest in Cambridge in the 1960s, Bethel AME served as a headquarters for the Civil Rights Movement, according to Dorchester County's tourism department. Many rallies and meetings were held at the church.\nIn the early 1960s, unemployment skyrocketed, exposing the Cambridge's severe racial divide. Although segregation was ruled unconstitutional in 1954, Cambridge maintained separate schools and recreational areas in the Second Ward for 10 more years.\nProtests endured for weeks in the summer of 1963 after promises of desegregation were backpedaled. Gov. J. Millard Tawes imposed martial law and deployed the Maryland National Guard to Cambridge, where it remained for 25 days. Martial law would remain in effect for a year.\nIn July of '67, H. Rap Brown, an emerging Black militant and chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, gave a speech in the town. On the corner of Pine and Ceder streets, Brown said, \"If this town don't come around, this town should be burned down.\"\nOn July 24, 1967, Pine Street went up in flames. The origin of fire remains unclear, though there has been a lot of speculation and finger pointing over the decades. Cambridge's Second Ward is still recovering from the fire, the segregation and the discrimination that followed.\nMoore's announcement\nA key theme among speakers at the Juneteenth event was that now is the time to rectify systemic and economic injustices affecting the community.\nMartin said this will not be a pull-yourselves-up-by-your-bootstraps approach. Instead, a path forward will be provided offering hope beyond self resilience, he said.\nAt Bethel AME., Moore announced over 400 \"Just Communities\" in Maryland, including Cambridge. The communities, 419 of Maryland's 1,463 census tracts, were determined by the state's Department of Housing and Community Development to be historically underserved.\nAccording to Moore, $400 million has been designated to address exclusionary policie in these communities. The \"Just Community\" designations will go into effect July 1.\n\"Today, Gov. Moore and Sec. (Jake) Day embodied how Maryland is setting a national standard for disrupting systemic inequities and ushering inclusive paths towards healing in and with communities from all zip codes,\" said Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture Vice Chair Jaelon Moaney, who is from Cambridge, in a press release Thursday.\nDuring his visit to Cambridge, Moore also announced an executive clemency order adding nearly 7,000 cases to his historic June 2024 mass pardon of 175,000 cannabis-related convictions. The 6,938 additional pardons, which are for simple cannabis possession convictions, are \"the result of continued partnership with the Maryland Judiciary to review cases since the first order was signed last June,\" Moore's office said in a press release.\n\"I also want to be very clear, we are not going to celebrate the benefits of (cannabis) legalization if we do not deal with the consequences of criminalization,\" Moore said to those gathered at Bethel AME. Thursday.\nMoore said both initiatives announced Thursday aim to address the long-term impacts of discrimination like that experienced by Cambridge's Pine Street community.\n\"Liberation is good, but we demand freedom,\" Moore said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Families flock to Delmarva Pride Festival\n\n June 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BROOKE ENSMINGER | Section: News \n \n 582\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The fourth annual Delmarva Pride Festival brought together both young and old last weekend. Notable among the festivalgoers were families with young children.In recent years, the Pride Festival has faced defunding threats from several Easton Town Council members, who have argued that certain aspects of the event could be harmful to children. However, the festival organizers have made an effort to make the event family-friendly and appropriate for young children.\nKyle O'Donnell, the treasurer and co-founder of the Delmarva Pride Center, said the Center strives to create a welcoming environment for everyone.\n\"We thought that by default, Pride on the Shore should be family-friendly,\" O'Donnell said. \"And to us, that meant asking the musical performers and bands to review their songs and we ask them to please not sing any songs or do any dance routines with curse words in them.\"\nMany parents take their children each year, saying the event provides an opportunity to instill inclusivity from an early age.\nErin Shimko, of Easton, attended the festival with her husband and two children. She said she brings her children to help normalize self-expression and authenticity.\n\"We live nearby, so we've been going to this ever since we moved here,\" Schimko said. \"So, it's just part of their life, and they don't question it.\"\nSome attendees, like April Schmidt, drove an hour from Annapolis to attend the Pride Festival in Easton, where her children's grandparents live nearby in Preston. She was joined by her wife, their two children and the children's grandparents. Schmidt has a 2-year-old son and a 5-month-old daughter.\n\"I think it's really special for them to see other families that are similar to ours, but also just to celebrate Pride month in general, so they get a feel for accepting all,\" Schmidt said.\nMany parents said they appreciated the positivity at the festival, with attendees smiling and enjoying themselves. Local Easton resident Angie Lavezzo walked around the festival with her two children and said she enjoyed the welcoming atmosphere.\n\"You're getting hugs from strangers, and everybody's so kind to each other,\" Lavezzo said. \"It's just such a powerful statement of love.\"\nSimilar to many parents at the festival, Lavezzo brought her children to the event to show them people being \"who they are to their core\" and to teach them to accept everyone.\nSome parents expressed gratitude for having a Pride Festival and a space to promote inclusivity in such a small town.\nBlakely Barlev attended the festival for the first time with her daughter. A former New York resident, Barlev now lives in Easton and said it is important for children growing up in small towns to go to events like these since they aren't as frequently exposed to other communities.\n\"I lived in New York City for a while, so I'm used to seeing that all the time, but they don't,\" Barlev said. \"So, I love bringing them to places like this, and I think it inspires them to be quirky and weird and be themselves.\"\nSome parents offered suggestions on how the festival could become more engaging for children. Jaclyne Schettini, of Cambridge, said she remembered the festival having face painting in the past and would like to see it again. This year's festival had a temporary tattoo station instead.\nSchmidt said she had been to other festivals with designated kids' areas and thinks that could be a good addition to the Delmarva Pride Festival going forward. But each parent interviewed said they would return for next year's festival to continue showing their children the importance of inclusivity. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "DEI is about giving everybody an opportunity\n\n June 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEPHEN RIDEOUT | Section: Columns \n \n 600\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I am reading \"How We Learn to Be Brave\" by Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington.In her book, she writes about Thurgood Marshall and the challenges that he faced during his life.\n\"When he was denied admission to the University of Maryland School of Law on the basis of race, he reluctantly applied to Howard University School of Law, which he considered a far less reputable institution,\" she writes.\nThat interested me because I was aware that when he became a lawyer, he and the NAACP successfully sued the University of Maryland Law School in the case of Murray v. Pearson for denying Black students admission because of their race. It also interested me because of conversations I had with two men who had similar experiences.\nOne was a retired judge, who told me that he had gone to Howard and graduated as valedictorian. Thurgood Marshall asked him to apply to the University of Virginia Law School thinking that they would deny him admission, despite his qualifications, so that he could be Marshall's plaintiff in a lawsuit against the university.\nWhen he applied to UVA, he was not denied admission. Rather, he was approached by a wealthy benefactor of the university with the offer to pay for his law education at any other law school that would accept him. The retired judge accepted the offer, went to law school in New York, and had to tell Mr. Marshall that he would not be the plaintiff in that lawsuit.\nGregory Swanson became the successful plaintiff in that lawsuit against the rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia brought by the NAACP with Thurgood Marshall being one of the lawyers where Mr. Swanson was granted admission to the law school.\nSeveral years after my discussion with the retired judge, I had a chance meeting with Rep. Alcee Hastings from Florida. I sat near him on a plane trip and told him the story of the experience the retired judge had as a student. Interestingly, Congressman Hastings told me that it was not an isolated event, as the same thing had happened to him and had also happened to African Americans who had applied to medical schools in the South.\nSchools and alumni offered to pay their way to a graduate school in the north to avoid the litigation that might come from the denial of admission to the school to which they applied. While some may have been denied admittance, others were offered some benefit to go elsewhere such as the payment of their tuition at a law school or medical school elsewhere in the U.S.\nWhen I hear complaints about diversity, equity and inclusion, I never hear the full story of the background or reasoning for these complaints. I see the DEI effort not as promoting unqualified people to a position but rather giving all people the opportunity to be considered for a position who might otherwise be excluded from being considered. Giving everyone the opportunity to compete and learn from the experience, whether hired, admitted or not, seems to me to benefit everyone.\nColleges and universities have done something similar for many years for the children of alumni of their institutions where the child might not be considered the most qualified candidate but is admitted. How is that not favoritism based on connections rather than on skills and past accomplishments? In Cambridge during my time in city government, the search for qualified city employees included anyone interested and always tried to find people who were a good fit for our community who had the potential to become great and long-term workers for the city. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is set to be placed on Maryland Route 16.The marker is the result of work by Chief Archaeologist for the Maryland Department of Transportation Julie Schablitsky, whose team seeks to help people to better understand Tubman's early life through her home and her descendants.\nSchablitsky and her team began searching for signs of Tubman's early life in Dorchester County in late 2020. Through discoveries made during that time, the archeologists were able to tell a larger story of Tubman's young life.\nTubman's childhood was unearthed through the beams and bricks of her father Ben Ross' cabin. The team discovered a chest of drawers with an iron for pressing clothes inside, a variety of white ceramic dishes from England with designs similar to West African textiles painted on them, buttons and a tobacco pipe with an eagle motif.\n\"Perhaps this was a subtle, yet symbolic, public display of resistance, strength and even future aspirations for freedom,\" Schablitsky said about the eagle on the pipe.\nThe discovery of Ross' cabin, which is presumed to be Tubman's birthplace, has not only allowed for historic insights, but has allowed for Tubman's descendants to know her on a more personal level.\nTonet Cuffee, a fourth generation great niece of Tubman's, visited the site of Ross' cabin with Schablitsky's team. \"Harriet Tubman was born here in a rut of pain and injustice, but it was here that she learned faith, resilience, courage and compassion,\" Cuffee said.\nAccording to Schablitsky, Tubman spent much of her time in the area until being moved to Bucktown with her mother, eight siblings and enslaver, Edward Brodess. When Tubman became a teenager, she moved back to the Ross cabin in the wooded wetlands along Harrisville Road and the Blackwater River and began working with her father in logging, cutting and hauling timber.\nThe discoveries made by Schablitsky's team allow people to \"see the places she may have walked, the structures she may have known and the world it was that she was born into,\" Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) said.\nDorchester County Council Vice President Mike Detmer made a point to remember Tubman's humanity at Monday's event. \"It's easy for us to celebrate and to honor her now, knowing how her extremely cinematic story of heroism, and tenacity, and toughness and single-mindedness. We know now how it turned out,\" he said.\nThough she lived through immense adversity, Tubman never gave up on her faith and freedom, her descendants said at the event.\nGov. Wes Moore spoke about Maryland's complex history as the \"northernmost southern state.\" He said this complexity is perfectly personified in Maryland's state flag, which is a combination of flags from the Civil War's Union and the Confederate armies.\nOn Monday, Moore spoke of the many hats Tubman wore throughout her life, including during the Civil War. Last year, Tubman was posthumously recognized by Moore as a one-star Brigadier General in Maryland's National Guard for her service in the Civil War.\n\"I learned and realized Harriet Tubman is the original 'leave no man behind,'\" Moore said.\nThe Harriet Tubman historical marker will be installed Monday near the Woolford Store along Route 16 east of Harrison Road. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Crackin my shell: Emotional detachment and war\n\n June 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SARENA NEYMAN | Section: Columns \n \n 827\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Every spring, someone in my town posts hand-drawn \"turtle crossing\" signs near the roads where turtles lay their eggs. I'd never actually seen one crossing and used to wonder why anyone bothered with these signs.But recently, I spotted a small painted turtle inching across the road, likely returning to the pond after burying her eggs. I considered moving her but worried I'd throw off her inner compass.\nThe next day, on a morning bike ride, I saw a massive snapper the size of a watermelon, slowly making her way across the asphalt. I got off my bike and paused the podcast I'd been listening to: Peter Beinart's interview of Israeli journalist Gideon Levy.\nLevy said many Jews, both in Israel and the U.S., shut their hearts to Palestinian suffering. They skip the disturbing images of destruction and starvation, avoid the headlines, ignore the unbearable. His words brought to mind \"The Zone of Interest,\" the Oscar-winning film about an Auschwitz commandant's family unmoved by the screams beyond their walls. What's chilling is how ordinary people adapted, how they built lives alongside atrocity by refusing to see the victims as fully human.\nAs I stood by the turtle, a car pulled up. The driver rolled down the window. \"Should we move it?\" she asked. We both admired the majestic prehistoric-looking creature, its jagged shell and ancient eyes, like a living dinosaur that had somehow lumbered out of the deep past. These animals have not changed in 90 million years.\n\"I don't think it's safe to move a snapper unless you've done it before,\" I said.\nShe nodded, rolled up her window and carefully drove around it.\nI was pulling out my phone to take a photo when I saw another car approaching. I assumed they saw the huge turtle. I didn't wave or signal. Surely they'd slow down.\nBut then, in an awful instant, I realized they weren't slowing down at all. The impact was immediate. The snapper was thrown into the air. When she hit the ground, I heard a sound I will never forget: her shell exploding beneath the tire — a violent, cracking thunder that tore through my ears. The car never even slowed down.\nIt felt like something in me had cracked too.\nI'm not someone who cries easily. I have a hard shell — quicker to think than to feel. Maybe it started in childhood. I was the one who had to wake my grandmother from her nightmares. No one else heard her cries at night, but my room was next to hers. I hated the job. A Nazi soldier had ripped her 4-year-old daughter from her arms. She never saw the little girl again.\nShaken by the turtle's death, I got back on my bike and resumed the podcast. Levy was describing a Palestinian friend in Gaza with only two days of insulin left. This is everyday life in Gaza, Levy says. We all know what happens when severe diabetics can't get their insulin, he adds.\nThe death of the turtle reminds me of how vulnerable the earth's creatures are and the cruelty of humans. I hear the high-pitched screech before a bomb explodes, the scream of a father pulling his daughter's body from the rubble, the cries of hungry children with ribs like bird cages.\nIt's strange what breaks through. It's rarely facts or numbers. Dozens of Israeli children were killed by Hamas on Oct. 7. Thousands upon thousands of Palestinian children have been killed since that date. Among much of the Jewish community I grew up in, one number evokes national mourning. The other is met with silence.\nIn a recent interview, Ezra Klein spoke with writer Kathryn Schulz about the challenge of staying emotionally awake.\n\"I spend days covering efforts to rip health care from people and torch the global economy,\" Klein said, \"and then I'm supposed to go to a birthday party.\"\nWe can't live every second in full awareness, Schulz tells him. We'd collapse. But, she says, if we're lucky enough to feel suffering only indirectly, we must choose, again and again, not to look away. Even if we don't know how to intervene.\nThroughout the day, I keep remembering the snapper's death. The arc her body made in the air. The shattering crunch. These turtles can live for up to 100 years. Who knew how many years were cut from her life? She had survived predators, pollution, drought. And then in an instant, she was smashed to pieces.\nI am haunted by my inaction.\nWhy didn't I wave at the car? Why didn't I hold up my hand? I keep thinking about how preventable it all felt. How easily we destroy what we don't slow down to see. How easy it is to detach from it all.\nOver time, the memory of this day will fade. But I want to remember that sound. That cracking. Because in its violence it connected me to the fragility of life, the tragedy of indifference, the ease with which one becomes numb — and how dangerous that can be. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Native American communities underscore untold stories of American independence\n\n July 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 656\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n VIENNA — July 4 is a day many Americans celebrate to honor the country's independence from Great Britain. For many Native Americans, the meaning behind the holiday is more complicated, and their story of Independence Day often goes overlooked.The narrative surrounding Fourth of July often highlights the triumphs of American independence while overlooking the injustices that accompanied it.\nNative Americans existed on this continent long before white colonial settlers, and according to Director of Native American Studies at the University of South Carolina Lancaster, Stephen Criswell, The American Revolution likely would not have been accomplished without the help of the Indigenous population.\n\"It is less likely there would have been a successful revolution, we may have ended up as Canada or Australia,\" Criswell said on indigenous participation in the Revolutionary War. \"That doesn't really get acknowledged,\" he said.\nDonna \"Wolf Mother\" Abbott, chief of the Nause-Waiwash Band of Indians based in Dorchester County, said the story of July 4 is bigger than the colonists gaining independence from Great Britain.\nShe said it is important to tell the whole story.\n\"When the colonists came here, the Native Americans were already free, and the colonists had to experience our lifestyle, our culture and our traditions,\" Abbott said. \"What they experienced and what they learned from us was a part of the story that's missing.\"\nCriswell said while the Declaration of Independence called Native Americans \"merciless Indian Savages,\" those who wrote it relied heavily on the indigenous peoples' knowledge of the land.\n\"You know, they called them savages but shortly after referred to them as the Five Civilized Tribes, so which is it?\" Criswell asked. \"Of course, this is the same document that says all men are created equal, except for those that don't own land, or aren't white or aren't male,\" Criswell said.\nThe wording of the Declaration of Independence underscored a pervasive attitude that dictated centuries of discriminatory policies toward Native American people, including forced displacement, land theft and suppression of identity.\nCriswell said July 4 is a holiday that's not as hotly debated among Native American communities as other holidays, like Christopher Colombus Day. Usually, he said, the Fourth of July is an opportunity for family and friends to come together.\nThe Fourth of July has historically been an opportunity for Native American people to practice their own ceremonies, especially in the late 1800s, when Congress passed the Religious Crimes Code, banning all Native American ceremonies and dancing, according to Smithsonian Magazine.\nFor 50 years, Native Americans either held religious ceremonies in secret or didn't have them at all due to the extremely harsh punishments like imprisonment or withholding treaty rations. Indigenous ceremonies during this time were held on or near July 4 under the guise of American celebration. Because of this, many tribal gatherings today take place on or near the Fourth of July, according to the Indigenous Foundation.\nWhile there is no formal Nause‑Waiwash event on July 4, Abbott said members of the tribe do celebrate the holiday. \"It's a celebration where families get together and spend time together, and we are all about family and friendship,\" Abbott said about the holiday.\nAbbott said a good way to honor Native Americans on the Fourth of July is to tell the whole story of American independence and to learn more about Indigenous history. \"I find a good resource is the Maryland Archives,\" she said.\nIn 2023, The state of Maryland began the Indigenous Archive Project for the Eastern Shore of Maryland where seven members from different tribal communities record and keep their oral histories. This archive is publicly accessible.\nWithin the Maryland Archives, stories of Indigenous veterans of the Revolutionary War can be found.\nThe Nause-Waiwash Band of Indians will hold its 33rd annual festival on Sept. 13 of this year. \"Each year we have tried to do something a little different and add something to it that's different so we don't fall into the rut of having the same thing every year, so we're proud of that,\" Abbott said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cambridge becomes a Just Community\n\n July 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 634\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — On Juneteenth at Bethel AME Church on Pine Street, Gov. Wes Moore announced the Just Communities designation of 419 locations across Maryland, including parts of Cambridge. Moore said it was not a coincidence this announcement was made in a city where the Civil Rights Movement took center stage.The Moore-Miller administration established the Just Communities Designation in 2024 to address policies that have disenfranchised generations of families, such as redlining and exclusionary zoning.\n\"We wanted to hold it in one of the communities that rose to the top tier of places that had experienced the most harm and from which, the least improvement has occurred,\" said Secretary of Housing and Community Development Jake Day of the Juneteenth event.\nThe initiative is the result of work by The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development Division of Just Communities. Day said he has worked closely with Division of Just Communities Assistant Secretary Cat Goughnour.\nDay said the Just Communities Act not only acknowledges past harms but returns resources to those communities. As part of the initiative, Day said Cambridge residents will see community-nominated projects for revitalization, such as facilities, housing and economic developments.\n\"We want to make sure that we understand what the community wants and not show up with development when people aren't asking for it,\" he said.\nAccording to Day, early indicators of success for the Just Communities Act would be more project activity in neighborhoods with visible scars, like the Pine Street corridor of Cambridge, formerly known as Black Wall Street.\nThis could include more home repairs for legacy homeowners, increased homeownership, new homes on vacant lots, new community buildings and more businesses. Long term outcomes include improved public health and reduced criminal justice involvement, Day said.\nCambridge Mayor Lajan Cephas said she feels this is a framework for justice. With Cambridge's history of slavery, Jim Crow, discriminatory policies and segregation among wards, Cephas is hopeful the Just Communities designation will begin to rectify past harms.\n\"It's being unwound,\" Cephas said. \"It's just great to finally address, you know, the financial instabilities and other opportunities that were held back in communities just like Cambridge.\"\nCephas said along with the investments made in the community, the Just Communities initiative pushes grant requests to the front of the line.\n\"I say, Gov. Moore, it's like you gave us platform shoes,\" she said. \"It's very difficult competing against these other municipalities. They have better grant writers, better budgets. You know, they have comprehensive plans that they've been working on for years, and we're just now getting caught up.\"\nCephas wants to make it clear that these initiatives will not solely benefit Black residents, but will benefit all residents who have been affected by discriminatory policies and live within the Just Communities designated area, which encompasses much of downtown Cambridge and surrounding neighborhoods.\nThe Just Communities Act has faced pushback from Maryland Republican lawmakers, who called the initiative an unproductive government handout and unfair to Maryland taxpayers, according to a statement issued to the Baltimore Sun.\nIn a statement to the Star Democrat Friday morning, Maryland Senate Minority Leader Stephen Hershey (R-Kent, Queen Anne's, Cecil, Caroline) said, \"Does anyone really believe pumping hundreds of millions into handpicked areas will build generational wealth?\"\n\"This is wealth redistribution dressed up in equity language — it's socialism, plain and simple,\" the statement said.\nBut the initiative's proponents contend the Just Communities designations aim to ensure fairness among Maryland residents.\n\"It's the very picture of fairness as I was raised and taught to understand fairness,\" Day said. \"Again, take something from somebody and you return it.\"\nCephas echoed Day's sentiments, pointing to the \"unfair\" practices that have held Cambridge back.\nThe community can check on updates for the Just Communities Designation at choosecambridge.com, where residents can sign up for public alerts via text or email.\nThis report has been updated to include comments from Sen. Stephen Hershey. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "'Still matters today': Community to read famous Frederick Douglass speech on Saturday\n\n July 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 499\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On July 5, 1852, Frederick Douglass asked a burning question in front of hundreds of abolitionists in Rochester, New York: \"What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?\"The Talbot County native, often considered the most important abolitionist and civil rights leader of his time, delivered an address that described why enslaved African Americans weren't afforded the same freedoms and liberties that could allow them to celebrate the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence like the rest of the nation.\nDouglass' famous speech is still popular 173 years later. On Saturday, the Easton-based Frederick Douglass Honor Society is hosting an annual community reading. Local officials, community leaders, residents and children are reading aloud portions of the address on the lawn of the Talbot County Courthouse starting at 10 a.m.\nVickie Wilson, the society's treasurer, says this year's calendar couldn't have worked out any better, with the event falling on the same day Douglass spoke to the Rochester Ladies Anti-Slavery Society.\n\"What's really exciting for us this year is that the first time Douglass read this speech was on July 5, 1852,\" Wilson said. \"And now, it falls again on July 5.\"\nThe Frederick Douglass Honor Society has held the reading annually since 2018, though it was put on pause last year for a separate event. Wilson says this year's return is exciting due to the diversity of people — in age, race, occupation and more — participating in the reading. Fifty-nine people are expected to step up to the podium.\n\"We live in a diverse community,\" Wilson said. \"It's going to show the love that we have for this community as well.\"\nDouglass in his 1852 speech explained the significantly different perspective enslaved people had on the Fourth of July holiday.\n\"What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer; a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim,\" Douglass said.\nHe continued: \"To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are, to Him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy — a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.\"\nWilson says the Talbot County tradition during the week of Independence Day is a moving one. She encourages people, no matter how they celebrate the holiday the rest of the week, to attend on Saturday.\nShe said the speech is a \"lot to unpack,\" but extremely powerful. It still resonates with her today, and she believes it does for many Talbot County residents.\n\"It still matters today,\" Wilson said. \"And I often think it matters more today in the climate that we're in right now. Everything here about this speech is still relevant.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Shame of being poor becomes empathy, motivation\n\n July 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ARLYCE MENZIES | Section: News \n \n 898\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I grew up poor, that is, American poor.I fantasized about food at night–mashed potatoes, buttery dinner rolls, raspberry cheesecake. I would wake up and imagine a breakfast — strawberry waffles with whipped cream, cold orange juice — then, talk myself toward accepting what I knew was there — toast with peanut butter and usually, milk. My dad did not tolerate ungratefulness.\nI couldn't pay school fees like the dreaded $10 workbook fee and was harangued by the dogged collectors as I repeated that I forgot it. I couldn't rent an instrument, so I didn't play one but singing lit my heart on fire. I couldn't join sports, couldn't buy uniforms or pay for trips. My gym teacher in seventh grade said I was great at running and hurdles, and she encouraged me to join the track team. I joined, but immediately sprained my big toe and quit. I think my teacher, the coach, knew I could have overcome this minor injury, but couldn't overcome going without the right shoes, walking two miles home from practices, having no money or rides or, in fact, confidence to run.\nI got the free lunch at school. We had to walk up to the stage in the cafeteria to find our ticket — a white card with our name on it — before getting in line. Not only were we conspicuous, frantically searching for the ticket in front of everyone, but we were also the last to get the food our bagged-lunch friends couldn't recognize.\n\"What is that? Are you going to eat that?!\"\nWhen we had to bring a lunch for field days, my dad would pack something in a bread bag like an only-peanut-butter sandwich and a whole carrot with the white root hairs obscenely pressed against the clear plastic. Variations on this lunch included a boiled egg crayoned with \"B\" on the shell or a plain baked potato.\nPackaged snacks weren't covered by food stamps or WIC — milk stuffs for Women Infants and Children. We had whole milk and bricks of government cheese food. We had unmarked cans and other food bank finds including, once, a sugary cereal we were excited about until we tasted that it had been contaminated by the powdered laundry soap it had sat with in the donation box.\nWe were turned away in shops because what we wanted couldn't be bought with this other-colored money or because they said they didn't have change for food stamps. Thankfully, my mom mostly knew where she could stock up and on what.\nWe rarely went to the doctor. We all have scars that show no one stitched them or set the bones straight — OK, only one broken finger set with a stick and tape. When my sister was really sick, the irritated doctor didn't want to take Medicaid. He only gave her Claritin. It turned out to be mono, and she was in bed for a week, then she got pneumonia. She recovered. Our remedies were to pray, drink water, put a cloth on your head or where you hurt, hot or cold, depending.\nMy mother-in-law says I'm an exception.\nShe says people on welfare are lazy, only busy pumping out babies and watching TV. She thinks it's easy to have no job, let the checks roll in, buy steaks and chocolate with your government winnings. She hasn't sat in the welfare office for three hours only to be yelled at, looked down upon and rejected for the second time because you couldn't get the papers right.\nShe hasn't had a disability or loved a person who is blind from a genetic disease like my dad was. She hasn't had a nervous breakdown, spent months in mental wards after suicide attempts like my mom has. She doesn't know anyone who grew up on or is on welfare, except for me.\nIn some ways, I am an exception. I grew up with both my married parents. My great-grandfathers were a doctor and a lawyer. The lawyer left us each $4,000 for college. There wasn't any question — we had to go to college. My dad went blind slowly. He memorized children's books so he could \"read\" to us without seeing the pages.\nAlthough she didn't finish college, my mom loves poetry and had a full mahogany bookcase. She planted daffodils in the yard; we lived in our own house. My parents got a settlement after being in a dormitory fire. My mom's dad got a lawyer who won them enough to buy a house on an acre of grassy land with crab apple trees that bloomed pink in spring.\nI am not an exception in that I am white. More than 62 percent of welfare recipients are white and about 46 percent are single mothers.

    "content": "Cephas family has 'rich heritage and roots' in Dorchester County\n\n July 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: News \n \n 976\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Cephas family's history is the history of Dorchester County.Ancestors fought in the Revolutionary War, worked in the fields as slaves on plantations and owned the largest Black-owned farm in the county following the Civil War. Today, Cephas family members hold key political positions in a number of Dorchester County towns and beyond.\nFor Brandy James, being part of the Cephas family means pride, resilience and honoring generations of strength, leadership and cultural identity in the Black community.\n\"The struggles of our ancestors were not in vain and have come to fruition,\" she said.\nJames, a Federalsburg council member, is the daughter of Hurlock Mayor Charles Cephas. James's cousins are Cambridge Mayor Lajan Cephas and Cambridge City Council President Sputty Cephas.\nIf one was not told before a city council meeting that Lajan used to change Sputty's diapers, you'd likely never know that they're siblings, but they're a dynamic duo in Cambridge's local government.\n\"I see it as my mission and my purpose to serve,\" Lajan said, but she didn't just mean as mayor. For the Cephases, politics can be a conduit to care for and serve the community, but it is not the main player.\n\"It doesn't have to be political to show that you care or that it's okay to help your neighbor. It's about the human aspect of it all. It's about being a good neighbor and considering your community as an extension of your family. That's how I see it,\" James said.\nThe Cephas Family History\nAround 1817, Moses Cephas and his family were slaves at a property near the Fork Neck area — situated between Cambridge and Vienna — where Charles, the self-proclaimed acting patriarch, said the family had \"deep roots.\"\nThat is until after the Civil War, when Moses and Josiah Cephas inherited a large farm near Vienna, becoming the proprietors of the largest Black-owned farm in Dorchester County. The Cephases sold produce, including corn and tomatoes, on Race Street in Cambridge and leased out part of the farm to white individuals, Charles said.\nLajan said along with farmers, there are watermen and sailors in the Cephas lineage.\nCharles said that during slavery, some Cephas family members were captured by the renowned slave hunter Patty Cannon. Slave hunters like Cannon practiced in the illegal slave trade, also known as the Reverse Underground Railroad, where they found and captured escaped and freed slaves to return them back to slavery.\nDuring this time, family members' names were changed from Cephas with an A to Cephus with a U to facilitate their transport across state lines back to the South.\nPerhaps one of the most fascinating Cephas family members — which difficult to determine considering the incredible cast of characters — is Richard \"Big Dick\" Cephas.\nA fictional version of his life where he fights in the Haitian revolution and falls in love with a young American woman is presented in Kenneth Roberts' best-selling novel \"Lydia Bailey.\" But Charles said after speaking to several historians, he knows the real truth.\n\"He ran away from slavery and he went all the way to Boston, Massachusetts, and he ended up being in the British Army,\" he said. \"He fought against America, he was captured and put in prison there, and they were able to trace it because he was such a disruptor that he caused a riot in the prison.\"\nBeing a disrupter is sometimes a necessary agent of change.\nIn 1962, Charles made history as one of the first Black people to graduate from the newly desegregated Cambridge High School. After serving on the town council for two decades, acting as president for one of those, he became the first Black mayor of the town of Hurlock in 2021 and was re-elected last year.\nIn 2023, James became the first Black lawmaker in Federalsburg's 200-year history. The following year, Lajan became the second Black female mayor of Cambridge and Sputty was re-elected onto the City Council and elected by his fellow council members as council president.\nCephas family values\nFor the Cephases, faith is at the center of all they do.\n\"You know, that's the foundation that we come from, and not only that, we take the last name of Cephas to a deeper meaning, more or less than the meaning that you see in the Bible,\" Lajan said. \"I guess anyone who is a Christian or anyone that's read the Bible, Jesus had the moment where he referred to Peter as a Cephas, and that was essentially the foundation of how Christianity was established.\"\nCharles has 14 children and 49 grandchildren — maybe a few more, maybe a few less. It's easy to lose count he said. At 75 years old, Charles said he's excited to watch the legacy he has helped build continue to prosper and grow.\nFor Lajan and Brandy, it is also important that Cephas is not synonymous with politics.\nBoth have children who pursued careers outside of politics. For both, it is important that their children carry the long-withstanding Cephas values into whatever they do.\n\"They feel the pressure to do what they're supposed to do so we can make God happy. That's their pressure,\" said Lajan about her sons. \"You know, to govern themselves accordingly.\"\nLajan said she wants the people of Dorchester County to know that while the Cephases are deeply rooted, they are a small piece of the larger puzzle and beautiful fabric of all the other names in the county.\nSome of the other names may even be Cephases.\nMany formerly enslaved individuals either had their names changed or changed their names after obtaining freedom. Because of this, Charles said there are many Cephases out there that likely don't even know they are Cephases.\nCharles said the descendants they've been able to trace can be located all over the U.S., including Alaska. Recently, they were able to trace Cephases in Japan. In the next few months, there will be a massive Cephas family reunion with descendants from all over the country and beyond. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Over 150 people came out.Rally goers expressed fear, anger and concern that a pastor has been \"ripped\" from his congregation, three children and wife. Espinal, originally from Honduras, has been in Easton for 24 years.\nJim Bruce, a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum communications committee, attributed the crowd size on the corner of Route 50 and Dover Street to the incredible media attention Espinal's case has received. Bruce said he normally knows a majority of the people who attend these events, but he saw new faces Friday night.\n\"There are some I don't recognize at all. So, I mean, I think the press is what did this,\" Bruce said.\nReligious leaders and concerned citizens came out to show their support, including the Rev. Jessica Stehle of Easton Christ Church, who said she felt called to action to come support Espinal.\n\"It's hurting our hearts, and it's calling us to action,\" she said.\nICE said in a statement to The Star Democrat that Espinal overstayed a six-month visa by 24 years.\nEspinal has no other criminal record and has been attempting to obtain citizenship legally for years, according to his daughter Clarissa Fuentes Diaz.\nEspinal's arrest comes amid a push by the Trump administration to step up immigration enforcement. President Donald Trump has repeatedly stated he is out to get \"the worst of the worst,\" promising a mass deportation that targeted criminals.\nMany in attendance Friday pointed to Espinal's lack of criminal record.\n\"President Trump told the American public 'we're going to go for the worst of the worst,' and clearly they're not doing that,\" Bruce said.\n\"He needs impact, so he's picking people who've been here a long time, who are well known in the community,\" he said.\nU.S. Customs and Immigration data from June 29 shows a recent shift from focusing mainly on those with criminal records to arresting those without a record. Out of 57,861 people detained by ICE, 41,495 had no criminal convictions.\nMembers of the Trump administration have said since the data's release that their priority remains deporting those who have committed crimes.\nThose at the protest Friday raised signs that read \"MELT ICE stop the kidnappings,\" \"'WORST OF THE WORST?' Rev. Daniel = BEST of the BEST,\" and \"YALL KNOW JESUS WAS BROWN RIGHT?\"\nSydney Bradner Jacobs, chair of the Dorchester County Democratic Central Committee, said she and the rest of the committee canceled happy hour to be there.\n\"We decided to come out here and support and stand in solidarity with our friends in Talbot because it's not a happy hour when one of our own is deported without due process,\" Bradner said.\nEspinal was initially taken to Salisbury, transferred to Baltimore and is now in an ICE detention center in Louisiana where he is waiting for his first hearing where his family hopes he will be released on bond.\nA GoFundMe to support the pastor's mounting legal fees was created on Thursday and has already far surpassed its initial goal of $15,000. The new goal is set for $40,000 and the fund currently stands at $26,033 as of 8:30 p.m..\nThese fees, in other circumstances, can often be provided by local nonprofits.\nThe Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center keeps an emergency fund for situations like Espinal's that is typically kept at $10,000. President of the Talbot County Democratic Forum Michele Dappert said the funds have been significantly depleted due to the drastic increase in ICE-related arrests.\n\"We need help,\" Dappert said. \"People should also donate to the MRC (multicultural resource center). If you have legal expertise, they could also use volunteers to serve as lawyers.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Daniel Espinal was a foregone conclusion. To put it simply, he was targeted.ICE has been creating self-serving catches across the nation which both polish its badge and dispirit Hispanic communities. Doubtless, members of Pastor Espinal's church should be sure that ICE will be worshipping with them this Sunday, prayers in Spanish offered inside, whilst outside agents will be checking license plates, awaiting their drivers. There will be no coffee hour.\nThis has happened before in Easton.\nIn 1994, the then-INS raided an apartment complex, hauling off at least a dozen undocumented Hispanics. I represented many of their cases before the Asylum Office in Arlington, Virginia, and in the U.S. Immigration Court in Baltimore. As in those days I pastored a store front chapel in downtown Easton, I made it privately known to our Hispanics to enter by the alley door for the following Sunday's Spanish mass. Mass concluded, our strategy was to have those with green cards or who were citizens to socialize outside the front door. The INS agents, whom we expected, were baffled, even angry, to be greeted by our legals – while other worshippers squeezed into the sacristy, invisible through the chapel's front windows – all of them documented within the immigration system, yet vulnerable to agents eager only to collect vast numbers.\nTo victimize prominent members of a targeted community has been well learned by ICE. When Herman Goering established the Third Reich's Gestapo in 1933, their methods were to first target such prominent Jews as rabbis and cantors, congregation and community leaders, elected civic leaders and teachers, thus dispiriting and creating fear within the remaining Jewish families. Those secret state police, taught to sniff out their fears, sent Jews off to the Alligator Alcatraz's of their time. It's an old, old story. It has happened in every civilization in recorded history.\nTHE RT. REV.

The parishioners currently aren't meeting out of fear the same will happen to them.\n\"You know, the members of the congregation believe, and rightfully so, that if this could happen to somebody with Pastor Fuentes Espinal's stature and position within the community, then nobody's safe,\" said Len Foxwell, a close family friend of Espinal's.\nThe Rt. Rev. Joel Marcus Johnson, a bishop from Easton, said canceling services now is wise.\n\"It's wise on their part, I think because we know that ICE would be showing up,\" Johnson said.\nJohnson knows this because he lived it in 1994 when U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services — the precursor to ICE — showed up to one of his Spanish services at a storefront chapel in Easton.\nJohnson, clergy and the congregation came up with a plan where the undocumented immigrants went out the back door and those with green cards or citizenship went out the front.\n\"It really, really angered INS,\" Johnson said.\nJohnson said arresting high-ranking members of the church is a targeted approach that is not new.\n\"It's one of the tried and true methods for dispiriting or deflating the hearts of these communities,\" he said.\nMatthew Peters, executive director of the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, said he is not aware of any recent ICE arrests in churches on the Mid-Shore, but due to uncertain policy changes, fear is widespread.\nCOMMUNITY RALLIESEspinal was detained by two U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement agents and taken to the Salisbury Field Office. He was quickly transferred to the Baltimore ICE detention center, where he remained for three nights. On Thursday, Espinal was transferred to an ICE detention center in Louisiana, where he will stay until his hearing, which has not been scheduled yet.\nEspinal has been in the U.S. since 2001, has no criminal record and has been attempting to secure citizenship legally for years. He has been described as a pillar of the community. A GoFundMe created by Foxwell has raised over $44,000 to cover attorney's fees and other expenses.\nICE said in a statement to the Star Democrat that Espinal was arrested for overstaying his six-month visa.\n\"Daniel Omar Fuentes Espinal is an illegal alien from Honduras who was arrested by ICE on July 21, in Easton, Maryland,\" the statement said. \"Fuentes entered the United States on a 6-month visa and never left in 24 years. It is a federal crime to overstay the authorized period of time granted under a visitors visa.\"\nCommunity members, religious leaders and politicians have rallied behind Espinal, holding protests in both Easton and Baltimore since his arrest. On Friday, over 150 people showed up to support Espinal with a rally on U.S. Route 50 in Easton.\nAccording to Foxwell, around 300 people showed up to a rally in Baltimore on Monday. He said he was nervous that people wouldn't turn out because they don't know Espinal, but that was not the case.\n\"I didn't know if we would be playing to an empty McKeldin Square, but the place was full,\" Foxwell said.\nThe rally began with a march from the square to the Fallon Courthouse, the site of the temporary ICE detention center where Espinal was held before being transferred to Louisiana.\nAnother rally for Pastor Espinal will be held in Easton Friday, Aug. 1, from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. at the intersection of Dover Street and Route 50. The rally will be hosted by the Talbot County Democratic Forum and the Talbot County Democratic Central Committee. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Lawful immigrants and unlawful immigrants with no criminal record have been arrested by ICE in California in the Dodger stadium parking lot, in Home Depot parking lots, while they work in fields gathering crops.\nLuis Leon is an 82-year-old grandfather who was arrested by ICE at an immigration office in Pennsylvania at an appointment he had scheduled when he was trying to replace his green card because he lost his wallet. Mr Leon was given political asylum in 1987 after escaping Chile and torture by the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.\nA green card holder is a lawful permanent resident of the United States. Mr Leon has no criminal record. Mr Leon was deported to Guatemala. with no notification to his family. He has since been found in a hospital in Guatemala.\nMahmoud Kahlil is a graduate student at Columbia University who was arrested in March 2025 and held in a Louisiana detention center until June.

None of the people described above and many others were afforded these rights.\nIs this who we the United States citizens have become? Do we condone the cruelty exhibited by these acts?\nThere is another way in which we have become something different than who we thought we were. The Gross Domestic Product of the United States is around $28 trillion, about a quarter of all the world's wealth. We used to try to use that wealth to help those who were less fortunate in the world by providing food and aid through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Our president has recently defunded USAID, stopping us from using our enormous wealth to help others.\nHere is just one example. As reported by CNN on July 17:\n\"The US plans to destroy nearly 500 metric tons of taxpayer-funded emergency food, the State Department confirmed. The nutrient-dense biscuits, which have been sitting in a Dubai warehouse for months, were supposed to help feed starving people around the world. The destruction of the critically needed food would not have happened prior to the Trump administration's destruction of the US Agency for International Development, a former USAID official said. Two rations of biscuits a day are enough to stop people from dying, they added. Now that the food is about to expire, it must be destroyed; that will cost American taxpayers another $100,000. \"This is the definition of waste,\" the former official said.\"\nThis makes no sense and is not who we thought we were. How does it serve the president and the Republicans to withhold the money to feed people?? It is not like we cannot afford it. Again, the cruelty seems to be the reason.\nI appeal to my fellow Americans let us try our best to not do these things, let us object strongly to doing these things and hold those who are doing them accountable. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton Town Council speaks out on increased ICE activity\n\n August 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Local News \n \n 727\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Councilmember David Montgomery led the prayer at Monday's Easton Town Council Meeting, during which he asked for God to watch over Pastor Daniel Fuentes Espinal.This was the first of many mentions of Espinal, who has been detained by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement since July 21.\n\"We pray especially for Daniel Fuentes Espinal. Watch over him during his trials, and return him to his family, if that is your will,\" Montgomery said.\nEspinal came to Easton in 2001 on a six-month visa. He has been pastor of Iglesia del Nazareno Jesús Te Ama since 2015.\nEspinal was detained by two ICE agents in Easton and taken to ICE's Salisbury Field Office on July 21, according to his daughter.\nHe was quickly transferred to the Baltimore ICE detention center, where he remained for three nights. That Thursday, Espinal was transferred to an ICE detention center in Louisiana, where he will stay until his hearing, which has not been scheduled yet.\nThe comments at Monday's meeting came amid increased ICE presence in the town.\n\"ICE was here today and made some arrests. I mean, it seems like they're here more often than ever,\" Councilmember the Rev. Elmer Davis said.\nMichele Dappert, president of the Talbot County Democratic Forum, said the forum learned of what she believes could be dozens of immigration arrests early this week through both word-of-mouth and corroborating photos and videos. An exact number could not be provided.\nThe Rev. John Nash from Sts. Peter and Paul said one member of the church's Spanish-speaking congregation was \"abducted\" Tuesday.\n\"She was abducted some time this morning, and she's not permitted to call anyone, so nobody knows where she is,\" Nash said. \"They're going after these poor innocent folks who are just trying to make a living.\"\nEaston Police Capt. Greg Wright confirmed that the department was aware of ICE activity in the town on Monday, though the department was not involved in any arrests and could not provide specific details.\nEaston resident Emily Stone, who spoke to the council Monday, wanted to know if the police department has a formal agreement with ICE and if the Town Council had taken any actions to get Espinal home.\n\"I, in particular, want to learn more about how the arrest of Rev. Espinal is being handled by the Town Council and if you have made any requests to our state representative, Andy Harris, to learn more about his well-being or his location,\" Stone said.\nWright responded, saying the police department has no interaction with ICE nor does it have a formal agreement. They usually are not notified about ICE operations or apprehensions in Easton because ICE is a federal program.\nWhile the town has taken no formal actions on behalf of Espinal, every council member used a portion of their comment period Monday to speak about the effects of the recent ICE arrests on the community.\nCouncilmember Maureen Curry said she is \"distraught\" over the detention of Espinal as the daughter of an immigrant herself.\n\"We are a nation of immigrants, and in my opinion, and it is just my opinion, this administration has turned their backs on the hardworking, honest people like my father that came to this country to make a better life for themselves and their families,\" Curry said. \"Pastor Espinal has been a pillar of our community for nearly 24 years, and his family and his congregation are devastated by his detention.\"\nCouncil President Don Abbatiello ended the meeting by encouraging concerned residents to reach out to Congressman Andy Harris (R-Md.) and Sens. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.).\n\"There is ultimately something wrong with a system where Pastor Espinal and other residents are picked up for what amounts to misdemeanors in civil violations and placed in holding cells far from their loved ones,\" Abbatiello said. \"The way the law is written and enforced right now, this is what happens.\"\nIn a statement to The Star Democrat Tuesday evening, Harris said he is \"aware of the case and believe(s) it's important to fully understand the details before drawing conclusions.\"\n\"We are trying to determine what leeway the Secretary of Homeland Security has in granting exceptions to deportation orders,\" Harris said. \"That said, the Trump administration has been clear: individuals who are in the country illegally should self-deport and follow the proper, legal process to return.\"\nReporter Konner Mets contributed to this article.\nThis report has been updated to include comment from Rep. Andy Harris. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Small town on Eastern Shore grapples with increasing ICE presence\n\n August 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 960\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n MARYDEL — Positioned directly on the Maryland-Delaware state line, Marydel is a quiet town. But last Wednesday, its sidewalks and businesses were unusually empty.\"This morning felt like a ghost town,\" said Karen Bamaca, 18, of Marydel on Aug. 6.\nThat morning, social media posts containing photos, videos and reports of unconfirmed immigration arrests in the town were widely shared. Many of the town's residents said people didn't feel safe going to work or nearby gas stations, and some resorted to communicating exclusively through Facebook and texting.\nAround 50 people, including Bamaca, gathered on the Maryland side of the border that evening as the dust settled to protest against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They marched down Route 311, past local businesses and churches and through a mobile home park, eliciting cheers and claps from the neighborhood largely made up of Hispanic families.\nThe loud but peaceful display was a stark contrast from that morning's silence.\nProtesters, many of whom were young Hispanic residents, said they were motivated to speak out for those they say don't have a voice.\n\"We're just here for those who can't be,\" said Ashley Oliver, 24, of Greensboro.\nIn the days since, the impact of the immigration arrests hasn't evaporated. The town's Hispanic and immigrant communities are afraid, many say, and families and businesses are left to grapple with the effects of the Trump administration's goal to increase ICE arrests.\nNationwide, immigration arrests have surged since President Donald Trump took office in January. Trump campaigned on stepping up immigration enforcement, promising a mass deportation that targeted criminals.\n\"Across the country, arrests of criminal illegal immigrants have soared as President Donald Trump makes good on his promise to rid our communities of these threats to public safety,\" the White House said in a press release on July 22.\nAccording to the press release, ICE arrests in Maryland have jumped 290% since Trump took office. U.S. Customs and Immigration data from June 29 shows a recent shift from focusing mainly on those with criminal records to arresting those without a record. Out of 57,861 people detained by ICE, 41,495 had no criminal convictions.\nAn ICE spokesperson did not respond to questions from The Star Democrat on Tuesday regarding arrest numbers and whether immigration officials have increased enforcement in Caroline County, where Marydel is located.\nMarydel, Maryland, operates a small town government. The town is unincorporated on the Delaware side of the border. Census data from 2020 shows Marydel, Maryland's population as 176. Of that mark, 115, or 65%, were Hispanic or Latino.\nMany of the town's Hispanic residents or immigrants in the area have been hesitant to work, shop or walk the streets like they're used to doing, business owners and residents say.\n\"They're scared. They don't know what's gonna happen,\" said Alfonso Ortiz, owner of a corner store on the Delaware end of town.\nVISIBLE IMPACT\nA handful of businesses serve as the go-to stops in Marydel. On the Maryland side, there are two gas stations with grocery storefronts, a post office and a popular taco truck. In Delaware, there's a Family Dollar, Marydel Ag Supply and a few restaurants.\nIn the days after last Wednesday, Ortiz says business at his grocery store, Tienda Frontera Variety, drastically slowed.\n\"They were scared for a couple days, and they stopped coming,\" he said on Monday. It's rebounded a bit since, but foot traffic hasn't returned to normal, Ortiz said.\nFamilies are grappling with immigration arrests, too. Adrian, 17, who asked to share only his first name, said four of his family members — his dad, brother, uncle and cousin — were all detained last week.\n\"I woke up to my mom banging on my door\" at 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 6, Adrian said. His family is from Guatemala, and his uncle, dad and cousin had clean criminal records, he said.\nAdrian said his dad was on his way to work for a local roofing company before being arrested. Adrian and an uncle retrieved his father's truck, which had been left on the road, as well as several cars for other families.\n\"To take the dad, to take the mom, what happens to the children?\" asked Alex, 35, a neighbor of Adrian's who preferred to only share his first name. Since last week, many in the neighborhood haven't been going to work, he said.\nProtesters last Wednesday said they feel immigrants are crucial to Marydel's community and the entire Eastern Shore.\nIt's \"very important, no matter how small their job is,\" Oliver said.\n'SPEAKING FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T'\nMany of those protesters aimed to give voice to their family members who were scared to speak out. One sign read, \"My parents fought for my future now I will fight for theirs.\" Another person wrote on a poster, \"I'm speaking for those who can't.\"\nSelvin Cordova, 27, of Marydel, helped organize last week's protest. Seeing the fear that developed across the community that day, he was compelled to lead a show of support.\nMany who came to protest were young Hispanic residents like Cordova. He said a new wave of immigrant families is driving increased involvement and activism of the local youth.\n\"Definitely over the last year, our Hispanic community has grown so much more,\" Cordova said, noting that more Hispanic families are moving to the area.\nLast week's protest wasn't just for the families and businesses in Marydel impacted by surging arrests. It was for all of the small towns nestled within Caroline County's rural north corridor, protest leaders said.\nSmall towns on the north end of Caroline County are home to much of the county's Hispanic population. Per 2020 census data, Templeville and Henderson have Hispanic/Latino population rates at 70% and 65%, respectively.\n\"Viva la Henderson, viva la Marydel, viva la Templeville, viva la Greensboro,\" a protester shouted into a megaphone. The crowd cheered and some joined. The chant continued on.\n\"Viva la Guatemala, viva la Maryland, viva la Delaware.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This, even then, very narrow spit of land was entirely too small for the imprisoned population and must have collided with winter cold and intense summer sun.The recent efforts to alter our country's historical failings is, in my opinion, very dangerous. How many times have you heard parents say to their children, \"Remember, we learn from our mistakes.\"\nShould we not teach children about the Trial of Tears, where Native Americans were driven off their land and forced to relocate hundreds of miles from their homes?\nShould we not talk about the fear that drove the U.S. government to relocate Japanese men, women and children into interment camps? The officials who made the decision to move this population thought at the time that these individuals posed a real threat to the general population, particularly on the West Coast of the U.S.A.\nI grew up in the 1950s and 1960s. During my youth the country was trying to deal with Civil Rights issues. Every night on the news we saw demonstrations regarding this issue and heard Congress debate segregation versus integration. A decade later the Vietnam War was underway, and the country was split in many directions that were reflected in homes and on college campuses.\nLike many people my age I had to earn a living, and so I had to focus on the here and now as an employee. The daily tasks did not leave much time for debating politics with friends.\nI have seen in my lifetime people try to scapegoat the realities that both harmed and glorified our past.\nWe are an imperfect nation. Our forefathers created an engaging experiment. They created the greatest democracy ever witnessed on this planet.\nWe now have the opportunity to learn from our previous mistakes. I despise the fact that the Union Army starved and mistreated Southern soldiers, but that is a fact. I think it was a moral miscalculation to force Japanese families into prison campus, but that is a fact. The American Indian was relocated and forced to walk hundreds of miles from their land, but that's a fact. And old men and women can debate whether we should have ever placed ourselves in Vietnam, but we did, and that's a fact.\nThe role of the historian is to gather facts and tell us what took place and to provide the various options governments and individuals had when they made those decisions.\nHide the past, and it will only repeat itself.\nGILBERT MASTER\nPrince Frederick \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Israeli Jews safety depends on Palestinians' safety\n\n September 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SARENA NEYMAN | Section: Columns \n \n 818\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As we enter the 10 days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur — a time meant for reflecting on where we've strayed from compassion — I keep returning to the dehumanization of Palestinians I've witnessed among the observant Jewish community I grew up in.Over the years, I have spoken out against Israel's assault on Gaza and have been accused of spewing \"ignorant, pathetic Al Jazeera-fueled antisemitic rhetoric.\" \"You will not be admired for your performative moral integrity,\" they admonish. My critics are often otherwise compassionate people, yet their support for the Israeli army remains unwavering.\nMy devotion to Israel was once as absolute as theirs. My parents — both Holocaust survivors — loved Israel second only to their children. They sent me to Zionist schools and summer camps; I grew up immersed in Hebrew music and literature. To me, Israel was not just a country; it was our shield against another Holocaust.\nOnly later did I learn about the forced expulsions of Palestinians and how the Israeli army — which I had been taught was the most moral in the world — had armed death squads in Africa and Latin America. My Israeli cousin trained troops for Idi Amin, whose regime slaughtered half a million Ugandans. When I asked my mother how Israel could have done this, she said everyone hated us, so we took our support where we could get it.\nHer words rattled me. How could this survivor of five concentration camps, who rebuilt her life as a beloved pediatrician, embrace a moral exceptionalism that excused Israel for abetting genocide?\nOver time I came to see her response as born of unspeakable trauma. The Nazis had torn her baby sister from her arms. She had been beaten and starved and witnessed death on a daily basis. Centuries of persecution embeds a fierce tribalism: Protect your own at all costs. But as Rabbi Daniel Bogard points out, \"Trauma does not give us moral clarity. It just makes us traumatized.\" And trauma, left unhealed, breeds more trauma.\nHamas's attack on Oct. 7 reawakened Jews' deepest wound — our ancestral fear of extermination. The Israeli government seized on this to justify a campaign of annihilation: deliberately starving and attacking civilians, restricting humanitarian aid, bombing hospitals and schools.\nEven as Israel escalates its Gaza assault, defenders minimize these horrors. Despite Israeli media restrictions and unprecedented journalist deaths, the emerging evidence looks nothing like self-defense. But when dozens of human rights groups call it genocide, the messengers are discredited to deny the message. \"How naive you are,\" comes the refrain. \"Don't you understand these groups hates us?\"\nThe ease with which my own people excuse these atrocities is chilling.\n\"I'm watching something that is so evidently horrific and inhumane,\" Jon Stewart shared on The Daily Show. Yet when he condemns these actions, he is warned that speaking out threatens Israel's survival, even though it is Israel's actions, not Jewish dissent, that endanger the country most.\nAnd he's right. Studies show Israeli violence fuels antisemitism, which then \"justifies\" more militarization, creating an endless, deadly spiral that both brutalizes Palestinians and endangers Jews everywhere. Furthermore, adds Jewish Currents publisher Daniel May, the argument that Jews are \"at risk no matter where they live and no matter what they do or say,\" distracts us from addressing the conditions that actually drive anti-Israel violence.\nAmong my detractors, acknowledging this context is taboo. Mention decades of occupation, and you're accused of excusing the horrific kidnappings and murders of Oct. 7.\nI believe Israel has a right to exist, but survival built on another people's suffering isn't survival — it's moral collapse that sows the seeds of our own undoing. I understand that tribalism served an evolutionary purpose, forging loyalty in times of threat. But when it hardens into a moral blind spot, it justifies cruelty and brands truth-telling as betrayal.\nAs Israel edges toward near-total obliteration of Gaza, we must confront the trauma-fueled myth of victimhood. Backed by billions in U.S. aid, Israel is no longer David. It has become Goliath. But Goliath's strength is also his weakness; brute force creates more enemies than it destroys.\nYet the community in which I grew up still clings to the fantasy that Israel can eradicate Hamas through its military might. In fact, the opposite is true. As journalist Peter Beinart warns, our destinies are intertwined: \"If you want Israeli Jews to be safe, Palestinians also have to be safe. And Palestinians cannot be safe unless they are free.\"\nThis means abandoning the dehumanizing narrative that Palestinians are terrorist monsters who use children as human shields. Because only by cultivating genuine empathy — by recognizing Palestinians as people just like us, who want safety and dignity for their families — can we break this cycle of trauma. The choice before us is stark: Continue down this path of moral blindness that endangers both peoples, or find the courage to imagine a different story — one where Jewish safety doesn't require Palestinian extinction. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He fled north in 1838 and changed his name to Frederick Douglass. His brilliance, eloquence and courage, quickly brought him to the forefront of the abolitionist movement.\nHe was known for his skills as an orator, with many of his speeches remembered to this day.\n\"I would say critically important,\" James Young, the event's publicist, said said about Douglass. \"He's one of, if not the most respected and important figures in the history of the region. I think it's important for anybody to know more about his life and his work but especially for people who come from where he came from.\"\nFrederick Douglass Day kicked off with a parade led by Grand Marshal Childlene Brooks, former president of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society. The parade featured local groups including Building African American Minds, Easton High School NJROTC Color Guard, Polaris Village Academy, and the Easton and Oxford Fire Departments and many more.\nThis year, a big focus for the Frederick Douglass Honor Society was getting the younger generation involved in celebrating Douglass.\nGabriella Thompson, the mistress of ceremony, described as a \"ambitious 14-year-old entering her freshman year of high school,\" and Javion Jones, a 15-year-old minister at Union Baptist Church, were some of the youth featured throughout the day.\n\"I would say there has been some effort to get new people involved. As you know, a lot of people on the committee itself are getting up there,\" Young said. \"So it's a thing that we want to keep going for the foreseeable future, and so at some point you've got to bring in some some fresh blood.\"\nMultiple local leaders attended and participated in Frederick Douglass Day.\nJaelon Moaney, vice chair of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture, recited a famous speech by Douglass. The honor society believes having connections like Moaney are important for the success of the society and the annual event.\n\"Having that connection to African-American history more broadly, as well as current African-American issues, I think is very important,\" Young said. \"That's also something that we try to focus on with the keynote speaker that we bring every year. It's somebody who can bring a perspective of speaking on Douglas but also how he kind of fits into the history of African-American intellectual philosophy.\"\nIn an email following the event, Moaney emphasized his own Eastern Shore roots, similar to those of Douglass.\n\"I, too, am from and decidedly of Talbot,\" Moaney said. \"The Bailey and Moaney families remain connected today. Although two agitators separated by time, my chest began to swell with inexplicable energy while echoing the words delivered on November 25, 1878 from exactly where he stood nearly two centuries prior. As the country commemorates the semiquincentennial and Talbot reaches its 365th anniversary next year, I'm both troubled and moved by the parallels of reality that this experience has revealed.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Columbus Day honors Italian American resilience\n\n October 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: CHRIS CORCHIARINO | Section: Columns \n \n 717\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Every October, the debate over Columbus Day versus Indigenous Peoples' Day resurfaces, framed as a choice between two communities. Yet Italian Americans, like Indigenous people, have endured marginalization and discrimination. These are American stories of resilience that deserve recognition. Turning their struggles into a zero-sum culture war dishonors both cultures.As the son of an Italian immigrant, I support a day for recognizing Indigenous People. I wish those pushing this narrative used the other 364 days to address Indigenous poverty, land rights and generational neglect — not just symbolic gestures. Importantly, we don't need to erase the hard-won recognition that Italian Americans fought for through Columbus Day. How it came to exist is important.\nOn March 14, 1891, New Orleans Police Chief David Hennessy was murdered. As he lay dying, he whispered \"Dagoes\" — a slur for Italians. Anti-Italian hysteria ignited. The mayor ordered police to \"arrest every Italian you come across,\" and families hid as vigilantes roamed the streets.\nWhen nine Italian immigrants were acquitted and three had mistrials, a mob stormed the jail, dragging 11 out—some shot, some hanged, their bodies mutilated as crowds cheered. It remains one of the largest single mass lynchings in U.S. history.\nThe press celebrated it as righteous justice. Theodore Roosevelt called it a \"rather good thing,\" reflecting widespread contempt for Italians as racially inferior. To ease diplomatic tensions with Italy, President Benjamin Harrison declared a one-time Columbus Day in 1892 — an acknowledgment born from violence and tragedy.\nFor Italian Americans Columbus Day isn't primarily about Christopher Columbus. It is about survival, recognition, and pride in the face of discrimination. Italian immigrants had been celebrating it informally since 1866, using the explorer as a symbol of their right to belong in America.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Italian immigrants were among America's lowest-paid workers, toiling in coal mines and laying railroad tracks under brutal conditions. Many fell victim to the padrone system, where labor bosses trapped them in debt, locked them in camps and withheld wages.\nDuring World War II, thousands of Italians were designated \"enemy aliens,\" facing curfews, travel restrictions and property seizures. Some were interned.\nThe Ku Klux Klan actively fought against Columbus Day recognition. They campaigned to strip it as a state holiday in Oregon, burned a cross at a 1924 celebration in Pennsylvania and blocked a Columbus statue installation in Virginia in 1927.\nYet Italian Americans persisted. Through decades of advocacy, Columbus Day became a federal holiday in 1968. Parades celebrated not just an explorer, but Italian Americans who contributed to society — scientists, artists, laborers, soldiers, entrepreneurs. A tradition started by blue-collar immigrants who scraped together money to erect statues and organize celebrations.\nToday, the push to replace Columbus Day often overlooks this history. For Italian Americans, it has always been about their own resilience, not defending Columbus's atrocities. Yet those who object to the name never propose renaming the holiday to preserve Italian American recognition. Instead, they seek to eliminate it entirely — erasing the history of how Italian immigrants were treated and why this day mattered.\nEven in recent history, when Columbus statues are toppled — statues funded by immigrant communities scraping together pennies — crowds cheer, but those cheers are celebrating the erasure of working-class immigrant history.\nThis erasure is troubling because bigotry toward Italian Americans hasn't disappeared. Mafia stereotypes remain acceptable punchlines. Mocking Italian accents is still considered harmless comedy. I grew up seeing this bigotry visited upon my father — but like other Italians, he persevered.\nWe shouldn't force a choice between honoring Italian American struggles and recognizing Indigenous peoples. Both histories deserve celebration.\nIf \"Columbus\" is the obstacle, the productive conversation would be about renaming the October holiday while still honoring Italian American heritage. However, when that is not the topic and the discussion ignores this history, it's difficult to pass it as anything more than anti-Italian bigotry. We shouldn't dismiss the struggles of Italian immigrants who, like my father, built lives in America fueled by the promise of the American Dream. It's a uniquely American story that should be told. Their story — the persecution, resilience and contribution to the American fabric — deserves to be remembered. Pitting groups against each other in an annual culture war is wrong and not in keeping with the promise of America.\nChris Corchiarino is a Maryland attorney and Queen Anne's County resident. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
