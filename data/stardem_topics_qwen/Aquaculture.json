Shockley said they would be talking about the future of the oyster industry.\"With respect to environmental markets, with respect to creating a new, better way forward for the watermen to be able to profit, not only from the products they bring in, but also from the results and the value of those products once they go out in the market,\" he added.Shockley said it was \"fantastic\" to give Lierman a tour. He said he wants Lierman to know how beneficial oysters can be in cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay. He called oysters \"mother nature's natural filtration system.\" \"We've now got some guidelines on how we can use oysters to do that work, to clean that water, based on an economic incentivized platform,\" he said. \"The watermen community can be a major player in making those things happen.\" Before the tour began, Pfeffer said he was excited to show Lierman \"all of the wonderful things that are going on here.\" \"I hope that we can continue (the) great relationship that Dorchester County has with the comptroller's office,\" he said.On her final stop in Easton, Lierman learned more about the Eastern Shore's designated regional navigator for trafficking victims, For All Seasons.\"When I was a state delegate, I set up legislation to create a system of regional navigators for trafficking victims so that they would always have one designated place to go in their area,\" she said.Lierman said she is learning about the work For All Seasons does in behavioral health and rape crisis treatment.After that final stop, Lierman said she was off to to the Supreme Court of Maryland to commemorate a judge.\"It's always great to be on the Shore,\" she said of her visit.Reporter Tom McCall contributed to this article. \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nBrooke Lierman, Comptroller of Maryland, at left, speaks with Kristy Mirando, director of Victim Services and Beth Anne Dorman chief executive officer of For All Seasons.\n \nTOMMCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nComptroller of Maryland Brooke Lierman visits with staff of For All Seasons and other Talbot County officials.

    "content": "Mautz introduces oyster legislation\n\n March 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly | Section: General Assembly \n \n 1221\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — State Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) introduced legislation last month to require the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to develop an updated fishery management plan for oysters and to allow DNR to alter the boundaries of \"certain oyster sanctuaries.\"\"SB 922 repeals onerous requirements which prevent the Department of Natural Resources from updating oyster management strategies for sanctuaries, aside from the large-scale restoration projects that are covered by federal regulations,\" Mautz said.\nIn addition, the legislation would allow watermen to dredge by powerboat in the \"public oyster fishery area in Eastern Bay in Queen Anne's and Talbot counties.\"\n\"If there are areas that are conducive to power dredging, it's shown to be a phenomenal way to grow oysters and to restore the bottom, and it's proven time and time again,\" Mautz said.\nThe bill's co-sponsor is Sen. Jack Bailey (R-St. Mary's, Calvert) of southern Maryland. The bill is cross-filed with House Bill 1231, sponsored by Del. Chris Adams (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico).\nMautz said in a Feb. 17 interview that he and Bailey introduced the legislation \"to give the department the authority to adjust the boundaries on sanctuaries because the last five years of DNR's reporting on the status of sanctuaries is abysmal.\"\n\"Over half of them are dead. Some are doing okay, but most are failing or dead, meaning that oyster bars that used to be flourishing prior to the creation of the sanctuary (have) been covered over with silt and mud,\" Mautz said.\n\"The idea is that they need to be managed. They can't just be set aside,\" Mautz said. \"That's why jokingly some will say oyster sanctuaries are like oyster cemeteries, because those used to be vibrant oyster grounds.\"\nOpposition to the billAt an Education, Energy, and the Environment Committee hearing Feb. 27, Mautz's legislation was met with resistance by conservation leaders and officials from the Department of Natural Resources.\nOpposing the legislation was Dr. Allison Colden, Maryland executive director with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. She said nine areas of the Chesapeake Bay have experienced overfishing of oysters.\n\"If we continue to fish at these rates, we will locally cause those populations to go extinct,\" she said.\nMautz said \"a lot of the work\" the Chesapeake Bay Foundation does is \"fantastic — their science is needed. However, we need management, and we need to grow oysters.\"\nTouting the success of oyster sanctuaries, Colden said, \"For the past two years, with these sanctuaries in place, the oyster fisheries enjoyed the highest harvest on record since the 1980s. Additionally, modeling from the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science indicates that larval transport from these oyster sanctuaries does have the ability to contribute to harvest areas as we approach 2025.\"\nThe \"federal and state investment,\" along \"working with partners,\" in the \"big five\" sanctuaries has been \"in the ballpark of $39 million,\" DNR Assistant Secretary for Aquatic Resources Kristen Fidler said. She called the efforts made in those sanctuaries a \"massive success, and we're still studying all of the ramifications and just how they're impacting beneficially the larger ecosystem in the Bay.\"\nWatermen support the billHowever, Mautz and watermen speaking in favor of the legislation to open oyster harvesting in sanctuaries said working the bottom to clear silt and sediment smothering the oysters contributes to the health of the population.\nJeff Harrison, president of the Talbot Watermen Association and a member of the Oyster Advisory Commission, testified at the hearing.\n\"We basically are looking to have the ability to be able to go into these areas,\" he said. \"We're not talking about going out and catching oysters. We're talking about going in and putting something there.\"\nHarrison suggested that watermen plant and harvest oysters on a four-year rotational basis. Broad Creek was the best tributary in the Bay because watermen did restoration work that cost $1 million \"right alongside Harris Creek — (and it cost) $30 million.\"\n\"We did a much better job than what they did,\" he said. \"So we're saying give us a chance to go into these failing sanctuaries and try to do something.\"\nRobert T. Brown, president of the Maryland Watermen Association, said a group of sanctuaries on the western side of the Bay \"has been ignored,\" forcing commercial oystermen to fish farther up the Bay.\n\"There has been no money set aside to rebuild (the area from the Patuxent River to Holland Point) or do anything with it,\" Brown said. \"It is laying there and it is silty we can't work into it; we can't go in and cultivate it. We want to go into these places and plant spat on shell, wild seed, maybe dredging and bringing the shells up so we can get a natural spat set into it.\"\n\"The seed-on-shell program that once existed was a self-funding program,\" Mautz said. \"It didn't take these millions and millions of dollars coming from taxpayers. That's a big part of the system that we need to take a serious look at and consider in making these decisions moving forward.\"\nJim Mullin with the Maryland Oystermen Association and a member of the Oyster Advisory Commission, testified in favor of the bill.\n\"We look to go into some of these areas, rehabilitate them with financing and our own infrastructure to … get them viable again, because otherwise they're just sitting there. He wants to address \"these areas that are failing and bring them up to standard,\" he said.\nSen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Somerset, Worcester, Wicomico) and a member of the EEE Committee said her expectation since 2019 and working with DNR was that sanctuaries would improve, but \"we have basically dead oysters covered over.\"\n\"This is not the result that we were looking for,\" she said.\nProblem with power dredgingDave Sikorski, executive director of Coastal Conservation Association Maryland, said his organization is \"largely made up of recreational anglers,\" but attended the hearing \"to advise and educate the public on the conservation of marine resources.\"\nCiting his experience and credentials in the areas of sport fisheries and as a member of two oyster policy entities, he said he had a \"very unique experience\" to consider \"what is most important for the public, what is most important for clean water and what is most important for recreational fishing.\"\nSikorski said power dredging removes living oysters, displaces shell and allows for spat set, \"but it's important that we do consider things differently today than in the past.\"\n\"What hasn't changed is our understanding of destruction by power dredges,\" he said.\n\"I absolutely respect the watermen's perspective on that because they see it, but we must make sure we enfold this into the whole oyster management plan,\" he said.\nFidler said the \"onerous requirements\" Mautz wanted repealed was now a \"moot point.\"\n\"We were unable to explore, evaluate and implement changes to sanctuary boundaries unless and until the oyster management plan had been developed and approved by the Oyster Advisory Commission, and then incorporated by reference into our own regulations as the fishery management plan,\" she said.\n\"And so now that we have done that, and the Oyster Advisory Commission introduced an amendment to that plan, which has been adopted and is being finalized now and going through the COMAR process to be incorporated by reference into our regulations that will allow us the ability to explore, evaluate and potentially implement changes to sanctuary boundaries,\" Fidler said.\n\"It's taken a little bit longer than we expected, but we do anticipate that to be all wrapped up here very shortly,\" Fidler said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Watermen harvested 430,000 bushels of Maryland oysters\n\n August 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT | Section: News \n \n 320\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Maryland Department of Natural Resources estimates that over 430,000 bushels of oysters were harvested commercially in Maryland from Oct. 1 to March 31. This was the fifth season in the past 30 years when the harvest surpassed 400,000 bushels.\"Maryland's oyster population has notably improved in recent years,\" said Department of Natural Resources Shellfish Division Director Christopher Judy. \"This season's harvest far exceeded the average yield over the last several decades.\"\nThe preliminary harvest numbers are based on Maryland seafood dealer buy tickets. The estimated dockside value of this year's oyster harvest is $15 million, with an average dockside price per bushel of $35.\nLimited market demand partially disadvantaged the '23-24 oyster season's success, which pushed watermen to keep their boats tied up several days a week. In the past two seasons, when the harvests exceeded 700,000 and 500,000 bushels, oystermen were working and delivering product to the shucking houses virtually every day.\nAnother factor at play was oyster abundance. This season, there were generally fewer oysters in the population available for harvest than in the prior two seasons.\nOyster abundance is strongly affected by spat set, the quantity of newly-attached juvenile oysters growing on existing shells. Strong sets yield a robust population several years later. Low sets yield a lower population.\nThe very strong spat set of 2020 helped produce the recent high harvests of 500,000 and 700,00 bushels, but the lower spat sets of 2021 and 2022 offered a lower abundance of market oysters for the fishery currently.\nMost recently, the 2023 Fall Oyster Survey recorded a high spat set, spread across a broader geographic area than usual for Maryland. \"With the right environmental conditions, the notably widespread spat set from last summer could bode well for future harvests,\" Judy said.\nAll sectors of Maryland's oyster management efforts are experiencing growth. The 2023-24 season saw a record yield of oysters from shellfish aquaculture operations and many oyster sanctuaries are showing promising signs of recovery. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Clayton Company of Cambridge was named Advocate of the Year for his unparalleled work in protecting Maryland's seafood industry and the watermen who depend upon it for their livelihood.\nAs president of the J.M. Clayton Company, established by his great-grandfather in 1890, Brooks has a five-generation commitment to sourcing and advancing Chesapeake Bay seafood.\nAdvocating for supporting policies, Brooks represents the Chesapeake Bay Seafood Industries Association before regulatory and management agencies, the Maryland General Assembly and the U.S. Congress.\nCrab for the luncheon crab cakes was supplied by the J.M Clayton Company.\nThe Oyster Recovery Partnership was recognized as the Nonprofit of the Year. For over 30 years, ORP's mission has been to restore the Bay's native oyster population by building sanctuary reefs, rebuilding public fishery reefs, supporting the aquaculture industry, recycling oyster shells, and public involvement through hands-on volunteering and events, according to executive director Ward Slacum.\nSince it's founding in 1994, ORP has planted more than 11.5 billion oysters on 3,000 acres of reef and recycled more than 300,000 bushels of shell, Slacum said. Presenting the recognition, former Gov. Robert Ehrlich credited nonpartisan oyster restoration advocacy as one of the most successful aspects of his administration.\nSteve Phillips of Phillips Seafood was recognized as Philanthropist of the Year.\nGrowing up working the waters of the Chesapeake Bay with his grandfathers developed Phillips' love for local watermen catching seafood for Maryland restaurants everyday, he said.\nRecognizing \"nothing in the world is better than fresh Maryland crab,\" Phillips worked to introduce Asian crab to provide more opportunities for crab cuisine year round in the wake of high demand.\nAs CEO of Phillips Seafood, Phillips has donated over $70,000 to the Maryland Watermen's Association to protect the heritage and future of commercial watermen in Maryland. Phillips Seafood also provides shells for the ORP's oyster reef rebuilding efforts. According to Jim Purdue of Perdue Farms presenting the award, Phillips represented \"People who care when people aren't looking.\"\nRecognized for his vast knowledge of the oyster industry and dedication to community events, Herman \"Jeff\" Harrison was lauded as Volunteer of the Year.\nCurrently President of the Talbot County Watermen Association, Harrison is a member of the ORP board, has served on the Oyster Advisory Commission and has often been called upon to testify on waterman-related legislative issues.\nHarrison can regularly be found in his element of shucking oysters at countless community fundraising and public education events.\nHarrison credited a love of the Bay as why he does what he does and strives to a time when the Bay was pristine, \"and crabs were $3 a dozen,\" he said.\nHarrison continues his work for a sense of empowerment for himself and others and progress for future generations.\nRecognizing exemplary students pursuing cancer research, this year's Chesapeake Charities Cancer Research Scholarship was awarded to Alexandra Vlk, a fourth-year medical student in the Medical Scientists Training Program at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Earning her PhD in innate immunology in 2023, Vlk is currently interviewing for pathology residency programs with the goal to become a compassionate pathologist and further develop cancer research.\nPresenting the award was Michael Fisher, a retired gastroenterologist, who was offered a new perspective to view research and procedures now as a patient with two stage four cancer diagnoses himself, he said.\nThe scholarship was a unique award that promotes future benefits, not just past accomplishments, he said, and credited Vlk as driven to find oncology answers through an altruistic cause, having lost her own mother to cancer.\n\"There are no words to describe it, it's just incredible,\" Vlk said.\nCelebrating its 20th anniversary, Chesapeake Charities has supported over 140 local funds thrive by providing millions of dollars in investments, according to committee chair Audrey Scott.\nPrimarily relying on sponsorships, Celebration of Charity event marks Chesapeake Charities only yearly fundraiser as to not to compete with nonprofits also fundraising, she said.\nThe annual awards ceremony is a way to provide outstanding recognition, highlight partnerships and showcase that \"we're all in this together,\" Linda Kohler, Chesapeake Charities executive director.\nChesapeake Charities members wore red roses in recognition of the recent passing of Board Treasurer Diana Waterman.\nPre-luncheon oysters were donated by ProShuckers Seafood Catering.\nMore information about Chesapeake Charities can be found at chesapeakecharities.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "With crab season open, Talbot watermen tracking weather and economy\n\n April 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 483\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — As Maryland's blue crab season begins, local watermen have their eyes on the weather — and the economy.Jeff Harrison, president of the Talbot Watermen Association, said last week that he's expecting this year's crabbing outlook to be fair, perhaps slightly better than last year.\nHarrison said some crabbing diehards on the Eastern Shore found success in the first few days after the season officially opened April 1.\n\"When they wake up, they're hungry. That's when you tend to catch most of them, is when they first wake up,\" Harrison said.\nBut recent cold temperatures slowed that early success. Harrison said it's now a \"waiting game\" as temperatures warm up and June nears, the start of what he calls the prime season for crabbing, which runs through September.\nHarrison says the Watermen Association's main concern this year is the economy.\n\"We are in Maryland, where a lot of government workers have been laid off,\" he said. \"Those are the people that buy our crabs more than likely, and so that's kind of the concern that we might have.\"\nHarrison added that similar economic concerns have been prominent in oyster markets on the Eastern Shore since the pandemic, which changed the restaurant businesses landscape.\nLast week, Harrison said crabs began selling for around $150 per bushel off the boat. He says that price will likely increase in May.\nThe 2025 Blue Crab Winter Dredge Survey hasn't been released yet by the Department of Natural Resources, but 2024's survey showed Maryland's crab population at 317 million. It suffered a drastic drop from 594 million in 2019 to 227 million in 2022, before rebounding to 323 million a year later and remaining steady last year.\nHarrison noted decreases in small crabs is a concern. The juvenile crab population, per the DNR, was observed at 86 million in 2021, down 73% in a two-year span. The number rebounded to 138 million in 2024.\n\"They have been seeing not as many. We did have an increase last year,\" Harrison said. \"I think you'll see an increase this year.\"\nSTATE REGULATIONS\nThe crab season in the Chesapeake Bay runs from April 1 to Dec. 15.\nIn April and from October to Dec. 15, catching crabs is allowed in rivers, creek and tributaries a half-hour after sunrise until sunset. In May through September, it's allowed a half-hour before sunrise until sunset.\nIn the Bay itself, in April and from October to Dec. 15, crabbing is permitted a half-hour after sunrise until 5 p.m. In May through September, it's allowed a half-hour before sunrise until 5 p.m.\nThose looking to use trotlines, collapsible traps, net rings, seines or eel pots must acquire a license from the Department of Natural Resources. Unlicensed individuals can use handlines and dip nets, as well as up to two registered crab pots on private property.\nThe state sets bag and size limits for unlicensed and licensed individuals.

    "content": "Eastern Shore resident advocates for sustainable seafood on Capitol Hill\n\n June 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: News \n \n 466\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON, D.C. — Oyster farmer Imani Black has stepped off the boat and onto Capitol Hill with 21 members of the Coalition for Sustainable Aquaculture to urge lawmakers to support sustainable seafood in American open ocean waters.The coalition is familiar with the suits, high heels and high rotunda ceiling on the Hill after consistently supporting science-based, inclusive off-shore aquaculture bills, according to the Coalition for Sustainable Aquaculture's Website.\nBlack founded nonprofit Minorities in Aquaculture in 2020. The organization educates underserved communities about the growing opportunities in aquaculture, its benefits and sustainability and sustainability's lasting impact.\nBlack, an Easton resident, is an Eastern Shore native through and through and works in oyster restoration. \"I just think there's so much power in a little oyster,\" Black said. \"And they do so much for us. In the water and out of the water.\"\nOysters clean the Chesapeake Bay through filter feeding, which helps clarify the water; nutrient cycling, which allows oysters to process nitrogen in a way that removes it from the water; and through habitat creation, where oyster reefs can provide essential habitat for other marine species.\nHer waterman heritage and Chesapeake culture heavily inspired Black's involvement in this type of work. She said she is proud of her Eastern Shore heritage and seeks to honor her family's legacy by representing the region.\n\"I love being on the Eastern Shore so much,\" Black said. \"I mean, I may not like living here sometimes because we don't have a lot of stuff, but I love the essence and I love the culture.\"\nMinorities in Aquaculture's mission focuses on workforce development. Black said that sometimes, the name can be a deterrent, but once people get past the buzz words of diversity, equity and inclusion, they start to understand the importance of this work.\n\"If we are going to have U.S. seafood competitiveness increasing like this administration wants us to, we're going to need skilled labor to be able to do that,\" she said. \"And so it doesn't really matter if you're Black, white, purple or, whatever, we need you and your skills.\"\nBlack and the 21 members of the coalition went to D.C. to advocate for consensus legislation that aims to create federal regulations and guidelines surrounding aquaculture, such as permitting and site regulations, fish health and welfare measures, labor and equity standards, and climate and sustainability standards.\nBlack said the bill has seen a tremendous amount of support, especially in Maryland and Virginia, but there is excitement and growing interest elsewhere too.\n{p class=\"p1\"}\"I think that people are getting more curious and want to strengthen their connection and understanding to agriculture and what's going on and things like that,\" Black said.\nBlack said if anyone is interested in following along with this new initiative or her other work or wants to get involved, they should visit the website mianpo.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Oyster regulations to remain unchanged in upcoming season\n\n July 14, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BROOKE ENSMINGER | Section: Dorchester Star \n \n 455\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Maryland will maintain its current oyster harvest regulations for the 2025-26 season, even as oyster populations increase in many areas, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources announced in a press release last month.These regulations include rules on daily catch limits, the number of weekly harvest days and temporary area closures.\n\"Keeping the harvest limits as they are will contribute to stability and sustainability over time,\" DNR media relations manager Gregg Bortz said. Bortz said the decision to maintain, rather than increase, harvest limits was made to manage the fishery and oyster population conservatively.\nIn making its decision, DNR considered the new benchmark oyster stock assessment, harvest data trends and the fall survey results from 2023 and 2024.\nResults from the stock assessment show oyster populations have increased in most areas over the past five years.\nUnlike in other areas, the assessment shows oyster abundance in the Chester River continues to decline. As a result, the river will be closed to harvest in the upcoming season, except for fishery plantings.\nThe 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement set 2025 as the goal for fully restoring oyster habitats in five Chesapeake Bay tributaries. Maryland is on track to reach that goal by the end of the year, according to Allison Colden, Maryland executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\n\"Now that we know what works and how to do restoration efficiently, we should be able to achieve at least the same level of restoration, if not more, than we have over the past 10 years,\" Colden said.\nAccording to Colden, the results from this year's assessment are promising, but oysters are still at risk from disease and events that could cause mass die-offs. Population levels necessary for long-term sustainability have not been reached in some areas throughout the Bay.\n\"That's why continued investment and rebuilding efforts are so important to keep the population sustainable,\" Colden said.\nHarvest rules are established annually by DNR based on the status of the oyster population. While future regulations cannot be predicted, Colden said she hopes responsible harvesting of oysters remains a priority.\n\"We believe that, even though we're seeing a significant growth in the oyster population, it'll remain critical for DNR to stay the course and maintain its harvest regulations for the foreseeable future,\" Colden said.\nThe commercial oyster season runs from Oct. 1, 2025, through March 31, 2026 for use of patent tongs, hand tongs and divers. For power dredge and sail dredge, the season runs from Nov. 1, 2025, through March 31, 2026.\nCommercial harvesters are permitted to catch oysters Monday through Friday. Daily catch limits vary depending on the equipment used.\nThe recreational season runs from Oct. 1, 2025, through March 31, 2026. Recreational harvesters are limited to one bushel per person per day and may harvest oysters Monday through Saturday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "U.S. labor secretary visits Cambridge oyster hatchery on workforce tour\n\n September 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Dorchester \n \n 663\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE — U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer came to Cambridge to tour Horn Point Oyster Hatchery as her Maryland stop on the Secretary's \"American at Work\" listening tour. She chose the hatchery to preview one of Maryland's \"most important\" industries.Maryland was Chaves-DeRemer's 36th stop on her U.S. tour that focuses on workforce investments.\nFor Manager of the UMCES Horn Point Laboratory Stephanie Alexander, the goals of the visit were to foster dialogue.\n\"She (the secretary) was very engaged in the tour. She grasped what we were doing, and I think she really understood that we were kind of here for the trifecta of the oyster, the commercial fishery, the private aquaculture sector, as well as the restoration sector,\" Alexander said.\nChavez-DeRemer chose the Horn Point Oyster Hatchery in Cambridge because aquaculture is \"an important industry here in the state of Maryland.\" She said the tour made her think not only of the science that goes into the oysters but the future of the industry.\n\"I asked a question in there: had they thought about 3D printing oyster shells? Now, why would I ask that question? I was in Japan for the World Fair just a few months ago, and they were 3D printing coral and reintroducing that back into the ocean and would reintegrate and grow new coral. So it's those kinds of questions that I think about. How can we best fortify the industry?\" Chaves-DeRemer said following the tour.\nShe said her goal is to complete the remaining 14 states by the first week of December in hopes to provide timely, actionable feedback to President Donald Trump within the first year of both of their terms.\nChavez-DeRemer said feedback from the tour will shape workforce programs and federal grant decisions. She said the Labor Department's focus on jobs and training reflects the administration's priorities of accountability, innovation and community strength.\nChaves-DeRemer emphasized the \"Make America Skilled Again\" grants, which are intended to flow to state and local partners and fund targeted workforce needs, including apprenticeships. The hatchery had one apprentice last cycle and aims for two more next year.\nAlexander said she personally funded the apprenticeship in the previous year and that it was nice to hear of other potential funding opportunities.\n\"My ideal apprentice would be somebody who has ties to the oyster industry, who is looking to do things different than what has historically been done. I think that would be amazing to foster connections, not only between the industry and our community, but the environment,\" Alexander said.\nWhen asked about how to stimulate the workforce amid federal budget cuts, Chaves-DeRemer said the department is focused on preventing waste, fraud and abuse, aligning with Trump's budget with economic goals, which were central to his campaign and the early months of his current term.\nShe said this is done through inter-agency collaboration via memorandum of understandings.\nThe federal administration says it is cutting waste by modernizing operations such as using technology like AI, streamlining compliance programs, and upgrading systems to prevent fraud and inefficiency.\n\"Two out of every three new jobs is created by a small business owner,\" Chaves-DeRemer said. \"So right here in Maryland, this industry is important. It's important to the ancillary jobs that it will affect. So the more we grow this economy, the better off and more prosperity we'll have.\"\nAlexander hopes there will be future collaboration with the Department of Labor to build a highly skilled workforce in Maryland, especially in Cambridge.\nChaves-DeRemer said she is committed to personally conveying state-level insights to the president and coordinating across agency leadership for implementation.\n\"You really cannot understand what's happening on the ground and how it affects the local economy, the everyday average worker in America, unless you can talk to them,\" she said. \"So I wouldn't know about this laboratory unless I'm here on site to hear these reports, to understand the lovely woman who gave me the tour. She started off as an intern and 29 years later, here she is, talking about why the oyster industry is so important.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
