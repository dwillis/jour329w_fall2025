Class repository for Exploring News Archives with Artificial Intelligence class

## Initial Setup

Follow the instructions in `setup.md`

## Course Learning Objectives

This course teaches students to work with news archives using modern data analysis tools and large language models (LLMs). Through hands-on assignments with Capital News Service and Star-Democrat archives, students develop practical skills for computational journalism while maintaining critical evaluation of AI-generated outputs.

## Core Competencies

**Data Journalism Foundations**  
Students learn to work with structured journalism data using command-line tools, SQLite databases, and Datasette for exploration. They develop facility with JSON data structures, SQL queries, and techniques for discovering patterns in large news archives. This foundation supports all subsequent work with AI-enhanced analysis.

**Semantic Understanding and Embeddings**  
Moving beyond keyword search, students explore how AI understands conceptual relationships between stories through embeddings. They learn to generate semantic representations of text, perform similarity searches, and visualize relationships in story collections. This introduces fundamental concepts of how LLMs process and relate information.

**Metadata Extraction and Information Architecture**  
A central focus is using LLMs to extract structured information from unstructured news text. Students design metadata schemas, engineer prompts to extract entities (people, places, organizations), and evaluate extraction quality across different models. They learn when automated extraction is reliable and when human verification is essential.

**Prompt Engineering and Model Selection**  
Throughout the course, students develop systematic approaches to working with LLMs. They learn to write effective prompts, provide appropriate examples and context, compare different models' performance, and iterate based on results. This includes understanding different models' strengths and appropriate use cases.

**Beat Book Development**  
The culminating project synthesizes all skills to create practical newsroom tools. Students combine metadata, entity extraction, and topic classification to generate comprehensive beat guides for reporters. This requires experimentation with formats, fact-checking AI outputs against source material, and iterative refinement based on evaluation.

**AI-Assisted Development**  
Students learn to collaborate with AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot to write Python scripts, build web interfaces, and solve technical problems. This includes documenting the development process, debugging through conversation, and understanding the capabilities and limitations of AI pair programming.

**Critical Evaluation and Reflection**  
Every assignment emphasizes reflective practice. Students document their process, compare different approaches, identify accuracy concerns, and propose improvements. They develop skills in evaluating when AI tools are helpful versus when they introduce errors or bias, preparing them to use these technologies responsibly in journalism.
