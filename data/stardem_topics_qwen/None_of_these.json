Far more often, though, the exact sequence will be crucial to success. Against today's six-heart contract, West leads a low diamond. South wins in hand and plays a trump, West producing the singleton king. In which order should declarer cash his black-suit winners?North's two no-trump was the Jacoby Forcing Raise.South's three-spade rebid showed a singleton (or void) in that suit. Two control-bids and Roman Key Card Blackwood followed. (Yes, South was nervous about his bad trumps.)At trick three, South cashes dummy's heart queen, confirming that he has a trump loser. Now South has to discard his three diamond losers on dummy's black-suit winners before East can ruff in and cash the diamond king.This requires East's holding at least three clubs. Therefore, the correct play is to unblock the spade ace and to cash clubs immediately.When East shows up with four, declarer plays that suit off, one diamond being pitched. Now turning to spades, East ruffs the last one, but it is too late - declarer's fourth diamond disappears on that trick. (If clubs are 3-3, South switches to spades, hoping East has at least three of them.)At the table, though, South played off his spade winners first. East contentedly ruffed the third spade and cashed the diamond king.\"We had only four spades and seven clubs, partner,\" bemoaned South. \"How could I expect East to hold only two spades?\" Dummy was slightly sympathetic - but only slightly.© 2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He is 25 years old, and I feel his marriage failed due to his misogynistic comments. Over the past couple of years, he started watching a YouTuber who has been giving him these ideas.If I'm honest, I also feel as if his actions are a result of my poor parenting.I am his mother, and I raised him to become the man he is today. Since moving in, he has been making my two daughters' lives much more difficult, and they will often get into arguments with him because he constantly talks down to them.My daughters tell me that I should kick him out of the house because he shouldn't be here, but I'm scared to do so because his finances are really tight right now due to his divorce and inflation.How do you suggest I navigate this situation? - Wayward Son DEAR WAYWARD SON: You may not be ready to put your son out of your house, but surely you can lay down the law.Establish ground rules for how you expect him to behave while he is there.That includes speaking respectfully to his sisters.Give him examples of how he has been talking to them and how hurtful his words have been. Go a step further and have a serious talk with him about what happened in his marriage, how you believe the YouTuber has negatively influenced him and even how you may have steered him wrong. Tell him he can stay with you for a while if he is willing to treat everyone respectfully.

And you'll have beaten a lot of stress, too, come December.Here are some quick and easy ways to get started now!ASSESS Take a few minutes to recall last holiday season. What do you wish you'd done differently?Started sooner? Fewer gifts? More get-togethers?Whatever it is, determine what you will do differently this year.CRASH SAVE Once each week put $20 - or an amount you find appropriate - into an envelope.Label and seal the envelope.Make a note in your calendar so you don't forget where you put it.GROUP CRAFTING Spend an evening with three or four friends making holiday decorations. Each person brings an idea plus all the materials and supplies needed for that project. By the end of a very fun evening, everyone goes home with three or four new items.FAMILY COOKBOOK One year a friend got the best gift. Her mother is an excellent cook and often cooks without a recipe. Her sister spent hours with Mom in the kitchen and painstakingly recorded the exact ingredients and measurements of the family's favorite dishes. She then developed them into a recipe book and gave it to her sister, my friend, for Christmas. Over the years it has become even more special - not only because her sister made it for her, but also because the recipes are now recorded for both of them to pass on and to always remember their mother.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book Debt-Proof Living. \n \n Caption: EVERYDAY CHEAPSKATE\n \nMARY HUNT \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

On your right, South opens one heart, you pass (I assume!), North responds one notrump (forcing or nonforcing, it doesnâ€™t matter), partner doubles (a takeout double of hearts), and righty rebids two hearts.What would you do?This problem faced four players at Bridge Base Online. You might pass, but that seems a tad cautious.Once you decide to do something, which suit would you prefer to be trumps: hearts or clubs?It seems clear to me that the answer is hearts. You cannot even guarantee an eight-card club fit, and you would have to win nine tricks. If so, surely you can take six or seven tricks in a heart contract for plus 200 or 500. Note the vulnerability.All four BBO players advanced with three clubs.Nine other Wests saw South open two hearts and East double in fourth position.Everyone ran to three clubs (using Lebensohl to warn of a weak hand).Now look at the full deal.How do two hearts and three clubs fareftIf the defenders are careful against two hearts doubled, they can take one spade, two hearts, two diamonds, one club and a diamond ruff for down two, plus 500.However, it isnâ€™t so straightforward. The play might well begin diamond, diamond, diamond ruff, a club to the king and another diamond. Then, though, South discards his spade loser and escapes for down one. East must shift swiftly to a spade, which is not obvious.Still, plus 200 would have been a cold top! \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, if I had to hazard a guess, I would suggest that if one hand is 4-3-3-3 and no suit is wide open, three no-trump is probably the way to go.Look at today's deal. If North is in three no-trump and East leads the spade queen, declarer will lose the first four tricks but will take the last nine when the heart finesse wins.If North is the dealer and plays in four hearts after a transfer sequence, the spade queen lead will be lethal.Finally, let's put South in four hearts. After West leads the diamond queen, how should declarer proceed?.The primary risk (apart from a 5-0 trump split) is finding West with the spade ace, and East getting on lead in trumps.The original South found a cute line. At trick two, he called for the heart two, and when East played the three, he covered with the four.(Here, if East had played the eight or 10, South could have won with the ace, crossed to dummy and led the heart seven, picking up the whole suit without loss.) After winning with the heart nine, West returned the diamond 10. Declarer won in the dummy and led a heart to the ace, discovering the bad break, but he just crossed back to the board with a club, finessed the heart jack, drew the last trump and ran the clubs, discarding a spade.He lost only two spades and one heart. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But he did. And with horrific injuries. One leg was completely severed, the other left hanging by a thread - and he suffered third-degree burns all over his back.What followed were 26 surgeries, a second amputation of the leg that could not be saved, unspeakable depression, fear and uncertainty.In the blink of an eye, Scott's life changed from one with a bright college career ahead to one of unbearable challenges, dashed dreams and poverty.What kind of 18-wheeler has run you off the road of life? Is it unemployment?Divorce? Health issues?Whatever it is that has cut the legs out from under your financial situation, it's time for you to get up out of that recliner!Lost your home? Stop wallowing in self-pity. Pick yourself up and start looking for a landlord.Can't find a job? Maybe it's time to become your own next employer.Whatever it is that is keeping you deep in debt and a victim of a rotten economy, stop giving it power to hold you down!Give up looking in the rearview mirror of your life.

Parsons; Park Lane Church Of God | Page: 22 | Section: News \n \n 862\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In my lifetime, I've only walked or ridden in a dozen or so parades. It started when I joined the Cub Scouts in 1966.Each experience carried a certain level of exuberance. It really didn't matter what the weather conditions were. Honestly. Being asked to or \"signing up\" was all about representing someone, a new promotion, a long-time running organization or some genré.What happens for most parade enthusiasts is an internal motivation that drives the procession along.If you're going to be a great coach, you need to lead and become comfortable with internal motivation. Teams rise to the level of their coach's motivation.And whenever a team includes an entire nation that's under heavy attack - the coach (commander) better be an incredible motivator. Agree?That nation existed. War World II was just beginning. The Great Britain team seemed like it was terribly losing, until one of the most inspiring leaders of the 20th century, coach and Prime Minister Winston Churchill stepped up.Almost single-handed at first, Churchill motivated his entire nation to make huge sacrifices to conquer what seemed like an \"unwinnable\" victory.The nation's coach desperately needed the co-op and sacrificial efforts of Britain's coal industry onboard. Their alliance would be critical to keep the war efforts going.His plan was masterful. Churchill asked the industrial and union leaders to picture the victory parade. \"Look at the proud British sailors who kept the sea lanes open Look at the soldiers who valiantly fought the land war Look at the airmen who heroically won the battle in the skies Now, look at the coal miners of Britain who followed them. Because of their hard work - victories were possible They (miners) will not be in military uniform, but they will have won a place in the victory parade.\" Did you know the ultimate world war is still raging?The war between the forces of Christ (light and comfort) and the forces of Satan (darkness and chaos) is on high alert. The battlefield is every human life Jesus Christ died for. That battle has never been more intense than now. As this final battle approaches climax, I ask: What place will you take in the great victory parade of King Jesus?In 1 Samuel 30:24, King David just won a mighty victory. He has left behind 200 \"totally worn out\" soldiers, with simple orders: \"guard the supplies\" - guard the goods; secure the spoils, and keep watch over the wins! Some of the front-liners didn't think King (coach) David's orders and assignment was fair. To some soldiers, the 200 \"worn out and weary\" should not get fair shares in the spoils of the victory.(30:24) \"The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike.\" What a liberating Biblical principle! Remaining in flight, and tuning in to the master plan - equals an updraft! Sovereign God considers those who fight the battle and those who support the frontliners as equal contributors and shareholders in the victory.W hat a parade rush. Imagine arriving in heaven and God showing a long list of names on your account? Like anybody else, you ask the rewarding Lord: \"But where did all these names come from? I don't even know these people. I've never held conversations.Never prayed with them.Never studied the Bible with all these folks. Never shared communion with them.\" And all-knowing Lord replies: \"You are right again. But they were reached by a ministry that you financially supported through an outreach you prayed for. You took your place and helped win every one of them with your heart and hands!Would you like to meet them now?\" You may feel like your part in the work of the Lord is small, minuscule, hidden away and insignificant. You might have said: \"But all I do is volunteer when I can, just drive when I can, just pray when I can, just give money when I can as the Lord leads, just cook when I can, and just work behind the scenes.\" Hear the Word and heart of our Father, \"There is no such thing as 'I just' in 'My Kingdom'.\" Stop discounting your passion.Stop downplaying your assignments, your rank and your file.Hear the heart of Coach-King-Commander David, \"The share of the man who stayed with the supplies (who worked in an unglamorous, inglorious role) is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike.\" You may feel like your work is insignificant. Get out of your feelings. Get into your faith factor.Jesus never sees anything given in His name as insignificant.Actually, Jesus promises His always appreciating rewards for anyone who offers a cup of cold water in His name! Cease minimizing the value of the work you do for Jesus. Every text, call, prayer, card, letter, testimony, hand-up and outreach is vitally important.Your part in the longest world war ever (greatest battle) is keeping people from dying without their soul prepared to meet their Maker! Like the black-faced coal miners of Great Britain, you may never button up a soldier's uniform.But believe me, there's a place of honor awaiting you. The Bible tells me so. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Here are the three methods that use ordinary household items and a little elbow grease, beginning with the easiest and least invasive.TOOTHPASTEProvided the scratches are smooth and relatively tiny, toothpaste offers a cheap way to fix scratches on glass.But not just any toothpaste.You want non-gel whitening toothpaste that contains baking soda, such as Arm & Hammer Advance White.First, clean and dry the area well. Next, apply just a dot of toothpaste to a clean, damp, lint-free cloth. Using small, circular motions, work the toothpaste into the scratches for about a minute.Using a clean area on the wet cloth, wipe away the toothpaste. Inspect to see if the scratch has disappeared.If so, rinse well, and buff the glass clean. If evidence of the scratch is still visible, repeat as necessary.METAL POLISHThe next way to fix scratches on glass is to rub them out with metal polish.Slightly more abrasive than toothpaste, metal polish is a better method if the scratches are slightly deeper.CAUTIONSIf you have scratches in your eyeglasses and your lenses have UV, anti-reflective or other types of coatings, DO NOT use any of these methods. You will turn small annoying scratches into a total disaster.As for all other situations that have resulted in scratches on glass, always test in an inconspicuous place first so you can anticipate your results.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book Debt-Proof Living.© 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If he had just wanted to stop in four hearts, he would have responded four diamonds, a Texas transfer.South, with four trumps and good controls, jumped to six hearts.The play in a slam is usually less complicated than in a lower contract because you cannot afford to lose the lead more than once.Here, the first order of business is to discard dummy's club loser. Declarer wins trick one with the club ace, plays a spade to dummy's ace (the honor from the shorter side first), returns a spade to his king and cashes the spade queen, discarding dummy's club nine.Now the only remaining problem is in the trump suit. South can afford one loser, but not two. A careless declarer would cash the ace first and go down one here.A more thoughtful player works out how to overcome a 3-0 break. He leads a low heart from hand or, better, plays a diamond to dummy's king and returns a low heart, covering East's card (which might be the king). Or, if East discards, declarer puts up the ace and leads back toward dummy's queen. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bible study apps seek new ways to make scripture accessible to busy believers\n\n August 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Joe George; Wealth Of Geeks | Page: 8A | Section: News \n \n 984\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Makers of the popular Logos Bible Study app want to get back to basics. On July 7, Logos's parent company Faithlife announced plans to do away with its church management services. These included Faithlife Giving, a tool for collecting tithes and donations from congregants, and Faithlife Ministry Tracker, used to schedule volunteers for church functions.In their place, Faithlife will turn attention to its core set of Bible study tools, as found in the Logos Bible Study app and the Logos software suite. In a statement released to Religion News Service, Head of Product Phil Gons said, \"While we're proud of what we've accomplished in the church management space, it's time to return to what we've always done best - continuing to develop a robust slate of Bible study applications and content.\" Although Logos will be receiving most of the attention, Faithlife still offers other products. The company will continue to support Proclaim church presentation software, the Catholic study suite Verbum, and Lexham Press, publisher of books on church history, theology, and Christian living, as well as books for children.FEWER AMERICANS READING THE BIBLEFaithlife's pivot comes when disciples want more efficient ways to study scripture.A 2022 survey by the American Bible Society found that just 39% of Americans read the Bible on their own multiple times per year. That's down from 50% of Americans who reported reading the Bible in 2021.The American Bible Society attributes the decline to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"There can be little doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has seriously disrupted Americans' behaviors, including their relationships with church communities, which are the epicenter of these behaviors for most American Christians,\" declared the group's 2022 State of the Bible address.However, the pandemic is just the latest in an ongoing series of trends that have distracted even the most faithful from regular Scripture reading. The Religious Landscape Study by the Pew Research Center found that only 63% of Evangelical Protestants, 61% of Historically Black Protestants, 30% of Mainline Protestants, and 25% of Catholics read the Bible at least once a week.BIBLE READING AND TECHNOLOGYWhen Logos launched in 1992, its creators hoped to make Scripture more accessible.Founded by former Microsoft employees Kiernon Reiniger and Bob Pritchett and Bob's father Dale Pritchett, Logos brought the Bible to Windows computers. The company launched an iPhone app in 2009 and an Android app in 2012.Since then, Logos has expanded to include not only multiple translations of the Bible but also devotionals and commentaries.Bible study apps include programs for various subsets of Christianity, such as Anglicans, Catholics, Baptists, and Lutherans.Users can access sermons, ministry sources, and other materials for free and for purchase.As useful as these materials certainly are, they may distract from Logos's core goals.According to the Faithlife website, the company is \"committed to increasing biblical literacy and accessibility for every Christian around the world.\" But phones and other portable devices can be a distraction, even for those who use their devices for reading. The many options available to readers draw users away from the text and toward other things. From alerts and texts to definitions and quotations, readers struggle to finish a sentence without getting pulled away.Thus, the Logos Bible Study App may undermine its core goal instead of reinforcing it.For example, a user reading John 3:16 in the English Standard Version Bible available through the app features four individual hyperlinks with cross-references. Highlighting the passage brings up options for comparisons across translations, a passage guide with multiple commentaries, and an exegetical guide that examines the verse in its original Greek. These options come in addition to books, audio guides, reading plans, and courses that users can access through the app.THE CHALLENGE OF BIBLE READING IN THE 21ST CENTURYTraditionally, Bible reading has been a quiet and thoughtful process. Joshua 1:8 commands, \"Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it\" (NIV).Through the years, believers have followed this teaching by committing to memorizing verses or journaling. The faithful have learned to perform daily devotions, which require setting aside distractions and focusing on the Bible itself.But as external pressures take away time and attention, Bible apps have been an attractive option for stressed worshipers.With scripture and reading guides in one app, users can quickly find verses and squeeze in devotional time whenever available.Developers have been quick to offer their own Bible apps. The iPhone app store alone features dozens of options, ranging from kid-friendly apps with simplistic translations to apps devoted to a single version of scripture.The Logos Bible App has stood out from this crowded group by emphasizing a wealth of options. In addition to the free apps, Faithlife sells packages that feature further resources within the latest edition of its software, Logos 10. On the lowest end, Logos 10 Fundamentals includes multiple commentaries and Bible translation for $49.99. On the highest end, the Logos 10 Collector's Edition includes more than 8150 digital books, sermon preparation software, and more, retailing at $10,799.99.DIFFERENT BIBLE APPS TO MEET DIFFERENT NEEDSAs this wide range of price points suggests, the full Logos 10 package isn't for everyone. As user Jeffery Kranz puts it in his review, Logos 10 is \"an industry-grade tool,\" one that makes the most sense for in-depth and scholarly examination, not everyday Bible study for lay people.But by committing itself to its main Logos app and software package, Faithlife has the opportunity to expand the already-impressive reach of its products. If all goes well, these products can help even the busiest believer continue their spiritual journey.This article was produced and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n \n Caption: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/NYC WANDERER KEVIN ENG\n \nA surviving copy of the Gutenberg Bible (which was originally printed in the 1450s) housed at the New York City Public Library. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I am 31 years old and have been able to make something out of myself financially. I worked hard in high school so I could go to college on a full ride. I took advantage of networking opportunities at my university and was able to land a good job after college and move my way up since. Most of my siblings haven't been able to make it out of poverty, and they resent me for my success.All 12 of my siblings and my parents constantly ask me for money, but I can't support all of them. I am doing well, but not well enough to be sending large amounts of cash to 14 people.How do I tell them I'm not able to support them all financially, even though it breaks my heart to watch them struggleft - Gravy Train DEAR GRAVY TRAIN: It's time for strategy. I have a friend who set up a fund for her family. In order to access the money in the family fund, you have to have a goal and a plan. You get to withdraw funds if you are committed to growing your life and making the best out of your circumstances.She set specific criteria that family members must fulfill. Because there were guidelines, the transaction was no longer personal, and everyone had a goal to reach.Consider setting up an account where you put the money you can share. Tell your family you will give them access to it based on certain parameters.

They tend to forget that the value of a game is much greater than an overtrick or two.With that hint, how should South play in three notrump after West leads his fourth-highest club five: four, 10, jack?This deal has a lot of potential finesses. Which should declarer attempt first?Before even thinking about that, South should count up his top tricks, his immediate winners. Here, he has eight: four spades, one diamond and three clubs, thanks to West's lead. (Yes, given that South denied a major in reply to his partner's Stayman inquiry, maybe West should have led the spade seven, second-highest from a weak suit when the top two cards are not touching. Here, that works fine if declarer takes a diamond finesse and East shifts to a heart, preferably the seven.)If South immediately takes a diamond finesse, it loses, and back comes a club (not a heart - defense can be so difficult). Now, say declarer cashes the diamond ace.When West discards, South tries a heart, but with both honors offside, West establishes and cashes two club winners: down one.However, only one more trick is needed, and it is guaranteed if hearts are attacked.South should immediately play a low heart from hand (or cross to the spade king and lead a heart up).Even if West wins with the queen and plays another club, South leads a second heart, establishing his ninth trick while he still has all of the suits under control. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We can get a glass of wine, call in dinner, whatever.However, the deals seem to be adjusted. For example, finesses feel as if they win less than 50% of the time. Probably, though, I remember the bad deals and forget the friendly ones.On July 11, I decided that we would play East-West so that finesses would work!This week, I will show you the first six deals we played, each rotated to make South the declarer.South had a good weak two-bid. I (West) had a clear-cut takeout double.(Two humans unwisely overcalled two no-trump.)North correctly raised to three hearts, bidding to the nine-trick level with nine combined trumps. East understandably passed. Then I cautiously passed - though in theory I was right because three hearts and four of either minor could be defeated.Against three hearts, I led the club ace, and my partner signaled an odd number of clubs. I should have shifted to a low spade, but I selected a low diamond. Partner took two winners there and returned a club. Declarer ruffed, drew trumps and led the spade 10. I put up the ace and played another spade.South, believing I would defend like that only with the ace-queen, played low from the board and went down one. A close call, but only 33.3% for us because several Norths had passed over West's double and sold out to three clubs, which made. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It featured a textbook example for maintaining trump control.How should South play in four hearts after West leads the club king?Yes, I was the only North to rebid two hearts rather than one spade. However, I still like my call despite the poor trumps. It backfires when partner is 4-4 or 4-5 in the majors and not strong enough to bid again.Otherwise, she will rebid two spades, and I will raise. I win when she has five hearts and a weak hand. This way, we find our eight-card fit.Also, if she were to rebid two clubs over one spade, I would have to pass. Two hearts would promise some 16 high-card points. Note also that my wife's jump to four hearts promised at least five trumps. With only four, she would have rebid three notrump or fudged somehow!Finally, yes, she might have rebid three diamonds or four clubs (a splinter bid). I would have signed off with such useless trumps.The danger to four hearts is a bad trump break, which is almost a certainty at BBO!The correct technique is to win the first trick and to duck a round of trumps. You ruff West's club continuation and now cash the heart ace to see the expected 4-1 division. However, you play on diamonds to set up your side suit and cruise home, losing only three trump tricks.Starting with the heart ace and another heart is fatal here. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Salary gender gap needs to be counted, tracked\n\n August 15, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 585\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Everyone knows that men make more money than women do. The wage gap, it's called. What to do about it is the issue.In New Zealand, they're trying something new.Counting. And reporting.According to Minister for Women Jan Tinetti, new legislation will require businesses with more than 250 employees to report their gender pay gaps in order to encourage greater equity in the workplace.Some 900 companies will be subject to the new reporting requirement, which will eventually be extended to as many as 2,700 firms employing more than 100 workers.\"Change is needed,\" she said. \"Requiring companies to publish their gender pay gap will encourage them to address the drivers of those gaps and increase transparency for workers.\" New Zealand, far from perfect, has done better in this regard than we have.According to Bloomberg, New Zealand has reduced the gender pay gap in the public sector to a record-low 7.7%; in that sector, half the senior management jobs are held by women.In the private sector, where some 200 companies voluntarily report, the gap was 9.2% in 2022. Tinetti explained that other nations such as Australia, Canada and the U.K. have gender pay gap reporting in place and that the move to require such reporting in New Zealand \"is part of the government's ongoing commitment to make New Zealand an equitable and desirable place for people to live, work and do business.\" Here in the United States, by contrast, stagnation is the rule. Women earned 20.3% less than men in 2019. By 2022, the gap widened to 22.2%. The regression-adjusted wage gap, which has been stagnant for two decades, actually widened a little bit, from 22.6% to 22.9%, driven by men's higher wages, especially at the top of the wage distribution.Among workers, women are more likely to graduate college than men and are more likely to receive a graduate degree than men - but they are paid less than men at every educational level. And the wage gap increases with educational achievement.Black and Hispanic women are paid the least; for them, the wage gap is biggest, by far.The swift progress of the '80s and '90s in closing the wage gap has slowed to a crawl. Minimum wage sets a floor so the gap is smallest at the bottom, but as wages increase, so does the gap.Economists point to a number of factors including job segregation, the devaluation of \"women's work,\" societal norms and discrimination. Is it really such a mystery?In mid-career, women balance children and family. Help them with that balance and women will soar. Penalize them for it and they will not soar. Treat all women as mothers and you will find that even the women who are not mothers will not soar.This is not rocket science.Women reaching for the top need support and encouragement. As you get to the top, discrimination becomes far more subtle and subjective. It is no longer a matter of an objective test.It turns on the subtleties of who is comfortable with whom, of the inherent biases that lead people to duplicate themselves in choosing the most qualified.That's where keeping track comes in. It's the least we can do. Counting. It forces us to take a second look. Ask a second time.Is this really the best we can do? What's wrong with this pictureft Because, as they have recognized in New Zealand, where the picture is better, there is still something very wrong with the picture of a gender wage gap in place.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Favored by his father, betrayed by his jealous brothers, sold into slavery, falsely accused and gifted by God in a unique way, Joseph's is certainly a complex and complicated life filled with huge challenges and temptations.How could someone in such crazy situations consistently make such good and holy decisions?It is hard to comprehend until you realize the repeated phrase from the Genesis author that unlocks the secret to his life. We read multiple times through the story that \"the Lord was with Joseph.\" How does this young man keep his integrity, his focus, his vision and his purity through all the adversity and challenge?He lived a life that reflected an absolute assurance that God was with him. When given the opportunity to fall to temptation with Potiphar's wife, the Lord was with him.When given the chance to be lost in despair in prison, the Lord was with him.When given the chance to get revenge on his brothers, the Lord was with him.And that knowledge helped him make wise and holy choices that blessed himself and others!How might your life look different if you lived daily in the assured and absolute knowledge that the Lord was with you?How might your choices and decisions change?After all, our Lord's departing words were \"Behold, I am with you always\" (Matthew 28:20). \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "When life gives you tomatoes\n\n August 16, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A11 | Section: News \n \n 465\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Too many tomatoes are never a problem. Perhaps the only challenge is maintaining self-control when passing the colorful piles of peak-season tomatoes at the market.Admittedly, they are hard to resist. Cherries, heirlooms and Early Girls in vibrant shades of the sun and summer challenge restraint. It's easy to be greedy and fill the basket with an array of these beauties without a plan for how to use them. While I am not here to judge or to advise you on any indulgence issues, I do have a recipe to help you use your exuberant surplus.This recipe is a wonderful summer salad with ingredients that scream \"garden-fresh.\" You might be tempted to call it a pasta salad, but as you can see, the emphasis is on the vegetables rather than a carbladen bowl of pasta interspersed with a few green leaves. Dainty orzo steps into the pasta role. Its petite rice shape won't overwhelm the bowl, allowing the tomatoes and greens to shine as they should. Fresh, creamy mozzarella and zippy Parmigiano-Reggiano round out the flavors, with a balsamic drizzle that binds the salad with a sweet and puckery kick.Serve the salad slightly warm or at room temperature.You can cook the orzo in advance and refrigerate until assembling the salad.TOMATO, ARUGULA AND ORZO SALADActive time: 20 minutes Total time: 20 minutes, plus cooling time for the orzo Yield: Serves 4 Dressing:2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 garlic clove, minced 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Salad:1 1/3 cups orzo 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 3 ounces baby arugula, about 4 packed cups 6 ounces fresh mozzarella, cut or torn into bite-size pieces 8 to 10 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved 1/4 cup pitted Kalamata olives, halved 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, plus more for garnish 2 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese Freshly ground black pepper Whisk the vinegar, garlic, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Add the oil and whisk to emulsify.Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the orzo and cook until al dente, about 7 minutes.Drain. Transfer the orzo to a large, shallow serving bowl and stir in the oil and salt.Cool to lukewarm or room temperature. (Alternatively, refrigerate the pasta until use. Let stand at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before assembling the salad.)Spread the arugula over the pasta, then add the mozzarella, tomatoes, olives and basil. Drizzle half of the dressing over the salad and gently mix to combine. Garnish with additional basil, the Parmigiano-Reggiano and a generous grind of black pepper. Drizzle with additional dressing to taste.

From painful past experience, we expect finesses to lose and suits to split badly.However, sometimes poor splits can help, especially if you are in no-trump.In this deal, what do you think of the auction, and how will the play go in three no-trump after West leads the spade three and East puts up the 10? Is four hearts preferableftAfter South overcalled two clubs (not one no-trump), most Norths advanced with three diamonds (because two would have been nonforcing) and, when partner rebid three no-trump, continued with four hearts, which ended the auction.In the given auction, my two-diamond advance was forcing for one round.The declarers in four hearts ran aground on the BBO rocks. Diamond lead ruffed, club return ruffed, spade ace, diamond ruff and club overruff produced down two.At one table, North could pitch his spade on the second club to escape for down one and get 90%. At five tables, East led the spade ace and, instead of shifting to a diamond, continued with the spade queen, hoping partner had the singleton. Now, though, North won with dummy's king, cashed the heart ace and played a club to the ace. It wasn't lethal when East ruffed. Plus 620 was worth 73.3% to North-South. Six Easts went down in four spades doubled.My partner won with the spade king, played a club to my ace and led a heart to her 10, based on the point-count.Now she took 10 tricks, and plus 630 was worth 93.3%. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As I watch the war in Ukraine continue to unfold, I wonder if anyone can stop the madness and why no one seems to do anything about it.But then I remember Frank Gunsallus and how one person can truly make a difference.He's a fellow Easton Rotarian and friend, and all of us can learn a lot from him about courage, integrity, and service to others.Heroes come along rarely, but when Frank Gunsallus and his wife, Iryna, traveled to Ukraine to get her parents out of the country at the beginning of the war, he became one in short order. Instead of running home, the whole family stayed in Warsaw, Poland, to help Ukrainian refugees in Poland and Ukrainians stuck at home and facing the horrors of a merciless and unprovoked war.Frank secured three ambulances to save lives at the front.He made sure a mental health facility was secured in Warsaw to accommodate refugees who had seen and experienced far too much. Working with Rotary Clubs in Poland and Ukraine and with Disaster Aid USA, he delivered tents, water purifications systems, lights, cell phone chargers and much needed food and supplies to where they were needed most.He delivered teddy bears made in our own Rotary district to refugee children, and they worked magic. He guided Rotarians from all over the world to refugee camps so they, too, could help. Like the firefighters and police who ran into buildings-and not away from them-on 9/11, Frank ran into the teeth of the Russian bear to help save his wife's people.Frank is a true hero and sets a very high standard for the rest of us to follow. He's the very definition of Rotary's motto of \"Service above Self.\" So, do you see? It only takes the desire and willingness to make a difference. In millions of ways, large and small, you can be just like Frank Gunsallus.GEORGE A. HATCHER JR.Easton \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Yes, it comes a cropper occasionally - we went down 1400 back in June - but the good boards outweigh the bad.The pleasing result on this board was unusual and dependent on the vulnerability.At six of the 16 tables, North opened two diamonds, and East overcalled two notrump.Then, when South nudged to three diamonds, he bought the contract, going down one or two. When South passed over two notrump, West transferred with three hearts. In three spades, East lost only two hearts and one club.At nine tables, East opened one no-trump, and West transferred into spades. Now East should have jumped to three spades to show fourcard support, a maximum and a doubleton somewhere, but no one did.At our table, I opened one diamond, of course! South overcalled two clubs without the usual six-card suit. He succeeded in stopping us from finding our spade fit, but it was a Pyrrhic victory.I won with the spade ace and returned the spade jack.South ruffed and played the club queen. When I led another spade, South ruffed again, took the heart king and ace, and played a third heart. I erred by not ruffing, so declarer won with his queen and led the club jack to my ace. We took two spade tricks, South peeling diamonds. My partner cashed the heart jack and had a trump trick to come for down two.Plus 200 was worth 83.3%, but if they had been nonvulnerable, plus 100 would have given us only 6.7%! \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But that's exactly what happened this week when he was charged by the Fulton County District Attorney under the Georgia version of the federal law that he used to brandish.It is a terrible fall for a once very proud man.What is so striking about it is that he had to know.Did he really think for one minute that Donald Trump had won the election?RICO punishes the enterprise and all those who are a part of it.Giuliani is charged with going out there and knowingly lying; indeed - this is the important point - he has already admitted to doing so in one of the civil proceedings against him in order to dispense with factual issues and focus on the legal ones. He has admitted that he lied about election workers tampering with ballots. He claimed they did.Not so. He now admits he lied about that.Why?He also lied about Dominion voter fraud and told tales of phony videos along with ballot theft.If Tucker Carlson knew better, didn't Giuliani? If Fox knew, he knew. If they acted with malice, what about him?Was he so desperate to be relevant?To be still the center of attention? Still part of the story?What if that is the real reason?What if it's all just really about ego, first and foremost, being the center of attention, being relevant, being important, being in the room, being at the table, being paid attention to, treated like someone who matters?In response to the indictment, Giuliani posted the following rejoinder on Twitter: \"This indictment is an affront to American Democracy and does permanent, irrevocable harm to our justice system. It's just the next chapter in a book of lies with the purpose of framing President Donald Trump and anyone willing to take on the ruling regime. They lied about Russian collusion, they lied about Joe Biden's foreign bribery scheme, and they lied about Hunter Biden's laptop hard drive proving 30 years of criminal activity. The real criminals here are the people who have brought this case forward both directly and indirectly.\" What planet is he on?Here is a man who was once hailed as a hero of law and order and is now facing time for participating in a wide-ranging criminal enterprise to overturn the democratic election in Georgia and across the nation.Here he is, in this case as a criminal defendant, and all the side talk about Hunter Biden and Ukraine will not cover up for his wrongdoing.Lying about stuffing ballot boxes.He was once on top of the world.He stooped as low as you could go.He was America's hero.No more. \n \n Caption: SUSAN ESTRICH\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nRudy Giuliani speaks with reporters as he departs the federal courthouse, May 19 in Washington. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

These sensitivities are rich. You don't own Christ's image. And you can't use the political process to impose your brand of Christian beliefs on the public and expect others not to see it as fair game for cartoonists.As a born-again Christian, I felt called to run for state Senate in 2018. Matthew 25 was my platform where Jesus says whatever you do for the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, those needing clothes, the sick and those in prison you do for Me.I was at my beautiful church, New St. John's in Wittman, and was called up at the last minute to read the new testament scripture and the lectionary reading happened to include that portion of Matthew 25.That settled the debate in my head about whether to run.Before I moved to the Eastern Shore in 2010, a friend and I had a nursing home ministry where we would visit six nursing homes to conduct worship and prayer services.Since coming here, I had a worship service in the Alzheimer's unit at the Pines for four years. I studied a year of clinical pastoral education and served as an on-call chaplain at the Easton Hospital.Today I visit the women in the Talbot County Detention Center.The shame today, of course, is that one party has been wrapping itself in the cloak of Christianity for the past decade, insisting our pluralistic country is a Christian country and promoting policies that exclude the LGBTQ+ community.They even insisted that restricting gatherings including church attendance during the early days of the pandemic was anti-Christian.Their efforts to impose an abortion ban is organized around certain faith-based communities.Our beautiful country is a pluralistic one.Churches, synagogues and mosques are simply human institutions and churches in particular have shrinking attendance. These Christians should develop a sense of humor and recognize that they can't play in the public square and not expect to be called out for it.HOLLY WRIGHTEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, vulnerable you lose 200 and get a zero.This was the fifth deal I played with my wife in a 16-table game at Bridge Base Online last month.Look only at the North hand. It goes one heart - pass - three hearts (game invitational limit raise) to you. What would you do? Would the prevailing vulnerability affect your answer?At the time, we were nonvulnerable against vulnerable opponents. My wife was the only player to make a takeout double.Every other North passed.When East raised to game, I sacrificed in four spades, also noting the vulnerability. After two passes, East doubled. Note that if they bid five hearts, a spade lead should give us one trick in each side suit.The defenders started well, West leading the diamond jack and East ducking his ace. I played a trump, West winning immediately to lead his second diamond.However, East did not give his partner a ruff. Instead, he shifted to a low club. West took two tricks in the suit and switched to a heart, but again East did not deliver the diamond ruff. So I escaped for down two, minus 300.However, note that down three, minus 500, would still have been a second top because 14 Easts made 620 or 650. If we had been vulnerable, though, down three minus 800, would have been a bottom. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Playing for money, North would have doubled five hearts and collected 300 points.However, worried that most pairs would buy it in four spades, North pushed on to five spades.Clearly, South had to avoid a club loser, and he knew to leave the key suit as late as possible. He ruffed the second heart, drew one round of trumps and played a diamond to the king. East took that trick and played another trump. Declarer won on the board, cashed the diamond jack, crossed to the spade queen and played off the diamond queen and 10, pitching clubs from the dummy.It was time to work out the club position. What had South learned?East was known to have started with three spades and five diamonds. The bidding also strongly suggested that East had four hearts. If so, his hand distribution was 3=4=5=1.Singularity rules. Declarer cashed his club king and ran the club jack, chosen to encourage an unwise cover.Well counted. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He is turning 50 soon and doesn't want to have to raise babies now that he's older. He says that for most people at 50, their children are moving out, not just being born.I really love him and don't want to have to separate, but having children is something I have always dreamed of and seen myself doing. Do you believe that there is a way I will be able to convince him to have children of our own, or should I give in to his demands and just continue nannying? - Time To Give Up DEAR TIME TO GIVE UP: Given that you have gotten engaged to this man, you must believe that he is your soulmate. Sit with this for a moment. Is this man the one for you?Life is filled with compromises, even for the luckiest of us. Can you live with this one? It is unlikely that you can convince your fiance to change his mind about children.Since you love children so much, nannying does sound like a way to be integral to children's lives without bringing them home with you. Perhaps it is an ideal situation, given your circumstances. You have to dig deep on this one to see if you can happily live with the decision not to have children without resenting your husband. Otherwise, the relationship won't work.Harriette Cole is a life stylist and founder of DREAMLEAPERS, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

They can have a powerful influence over behavior and affect how people act in various situations.While attitudes are enduring, they can also change.Today, I want to encourage you once again to pay attention to your attitude.They can have a powerful influence over behavior and affect how we act in various situations.Print out what follows if you can, then stick it in a place where you will see it the first thing every morning (you will find a printable copy at Everyday-Cheapskate.com/attitude/).Re-read it. Apply it to your life for the day.\"Attitude\" The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life.Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do.It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill.It will make or break a company a church a home.The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable.The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that life is 10 percent what happens to me and 90 percent how I react to it.And so it is with you and me. We are in charge of our attitudes. - Charles Swindoll I cannot even imagine where I would be today were it not for friends who have encouraged me, prayed for me, given me an attitude of gratitude and a heart full of joy.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book Debt-Proof Living. © 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Our summer has been unusually hot but is slowly coming to an end. With the return of children to school that seems to change the pace and focus for the families and community. We seem to breathe a sigh of relief and say \"Thank you Lord\" for your mercies. We made it.Along with the widespread heat we have been and are yet faced with things and conditions of our land and nation. Things that have escalated to a degree that we've not seen or experienced before. Beware, none the less we've been told in the word of God that these things must be before the return of the Lord. We are all occupying until He, Jesus returns. We're all living on borrowed time. Each new day is a gift, appreciate it.As individuals and families we yet have plans, hopes and dreams, myself included. We want to be debt free, see our children and grandchildren grow up healthy and be successful, retire to sit on the porch and have healthy conversation and not screen time. I'm reminded of what I used to hear the older, wiser generation say, \"Lord willing and the creek don't rise,\" meaning Lord, if you spare me/us another day this is my desire.I'm sure that everyone in Maui had plans, hopes and dreams, but in a matter of hours it was all reduced to ashes. I say for myself and others in this region, Lord, thank you for your mercies. The earth is groaning and climate change is speaking loud and clear; glaciers are melting filling oceans at concerning levels and giving up the bodies of the dead who've been there for years. Our ocean temperatures have exceeded 100 degrees.We will always have the homeless and poor with us, but now with the change and shift in the economy we have a new cluster of the upper, upper class that are affected. The cost of a pickup truck is the price of a single family tiny home. Which do you live in, in the USA?So many are one paycheck from homelessness, and we are all one breath away from death.Are you ready to meet Jesus? God is telling us something. In His mercy He has delayed His coming, but the signs are saying, \"I'm coming quickly.\" When we recall these events to mind we can all say, it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed. We fail ourselves and the Lord, but His compassions fail not, they are new every morning.Great is the Lord's faithfulness. We must truly repent and seek the Lord. Truly accept Him and allow Him to be our portion and strength. He has the plan, the blueprint/nail prints. Look up and wait for His salvation, His return, for it draws nigh. Come to Jesus before His mercies run out. I pray we'll all be ready for His return.Scripture Reference: Lamentations 3:19-25 \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He wished to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery.A year later, his ashes are still sitting in a box in his widow's closet, her trying to jump through all the hoops and red tape to get the burial scheduled since his death.A fellow Navy veteran, and former friend and neighbor of my father-in-law, passed away after he did, and was interned in Arlington three weeks later. He may have ranked a little higher in the Navy, but what about the unknown soldier?I know this is only important to a few people, his widow, and the immediate family, but sadly another example of why it is difficult to be a proud American anymore.Even in death, this decorated Navy veteran is getting the runaround from our beloved country that he fought to protect.He is in a queue, and the service is scheduled to happen in February or March.

So let's gather into a huddle, wrap our arms around one another and take a collective deep breath.Dear Cheapskate: My comment is in response to \"Where to Keep Money for Mom?\" and Bonita in South Dakota, who was looking for input on how to invest $10,000 for her 62-year-old mother who has no savings, no life insurance and lives on disability.I would recommend they go to any funeral home and work with the person there who handles prepaid funerals.Essentially, you are purchasing an insurance policy to cover the funeral costs.We did this for my dad before he moved into a longterm care facility, which was going to drain his remaining assets to $0. A prepaid funeral policy is excluded from the asset base, is protected once the assets are gone and a person goes on medical assistance.With all the other drama that comes with aging parents, it is nice for my sister and me to know that the end is covered and won't create another drain/strain on everything. - Molly Dear Molly: Thanks for this wise advice. In fact, many elder law attorneys advise prepayment as a way to invest in assets that will not be countable by Medicaid or SSI.However, I want my readers to know that there are pitfalls on the road to prepaid end-of-life arrangements, which they need to know about in order to avoid falling into them.

Use the extra darkness to discuss the bidding and play of this deal with your partner. What do you think of the auction, and how should South play in four hearts after the first trick goes club jack, four, three, queen?The auction was almost \"After you,\" \"No, after you.\" West should have bid two or three spades on the second round, despite an apparently worthless diamond king.North ought not to have bid three hearts without a fourth trump. Finally, South bid four hearts because it is fun making a game when the opponents could have passed you out in a partscore.West was really regretting his three-spade bid.At one table, South, after winning the first trick with the club queen, drew trumps. However, now he was stuck in the dummy.The only way home was to lead a low diamond and play East for royal-doubleton.When declarer crossed to the club ace and took a diamond finesse, East won and cashed two spades and the club king.South should take a diamond finesse at trick two. It loses, and East, say, returns a club. Declarer wins with his ace and takes a second diamond finesse - whew, it wins. Then South can draw trumps and claim an overtrick.If East plays his two top spades when in with the diamond queen, declarer ruffs, cashes the two remaining top trumps, crosses to the club ace, removes East's third heart and takes a second diamond finesse. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Credit has complicated our lives\n\n August 28, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mary Hunt | Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 316\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Today's batch of reader questions reminds me how complicated our lives have become since the introduction of consumer credit.Some days I long for simpler times so long ago when cash was king and there was no such thing as a billion-dollar consumer credit industry attempting to control our lives.Dear Mary: A couple months ago, I left my wallet on the bus. I immediately called the bus company and was told the driver had turned it in. When I got it back, I found everything in its place, including my cash. I didn't think any more of it. Now my credit-card statement is two weeks late. Should I be concerned?- Brian Dear Brian: Yes, you should be very concerned.With identity theft so prevalent, you should see this as an emergency. First, call your credit card company to learn why your statement is late. While you're on the phone, report the incident. Request a new card, and report your current one as stolen.Verify that your mailing address has not changed.Your next calls should be to the fraud departments of each of the three major credit bureaus: Experian (888-397-3742), Equifax (800-525-6285) and TransUnion (800 680-7289). Tell them to flag your file with a fraud alert.At that point, all creditors will have to get your permission before opening any new accounts in your name. Additionally, request copies of your credit report. Review these carefully to make sure there are no new accounts in your name that you did not authorize.If you have not already set up online access to your bank and credit card accounts, I suggest you do that right away. Now you can monitor your account every day. Even though I'm fairly confident that nothing is amiss (the mail is often delayed), you are wise to stay on top of things, if for no other reason than to make sure your credit card payment will not be late.

    "content": "Homemade cleaning solutions save money\n\n August 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mary Hunt | Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 268\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I pretty much hate to buy things I know I can make for less money and in a fraction of the time it takes to find them in a store.Take cleaning products, for example.Knowing I can make specific cleaners for pennies that cost dollars in a store just makes me happy. It's a no-brainer.Here are my top handy recipes to help you get started saving all that money you've been spending on cleaners:EYEGLASSES CLEANING SOLUTIONFill a spray bottle of any size 3/4 full with 70 percent isopropyl rubbing alcohol (91 or 99 percent are fine to use but more costly and not necessary).Add 2 small drops of mild dishwashing liquid (Blue Dawn is ideal), and fill the rest of the bottle with distilled water (see note).Add the spray top, and gently shake the bottle by rolling it between your hands or on a countertop, so as to not create a lot of bubbles. To use: Spray both sides of your lenses, and gently rub them clean with a clean microfiber cloth.WINDSHIELD WASHER FLUIDPour 3 cups rubbing alcohol, 1 tablespoon Blue Dawn and 10 cups distilled water into a 1-gallon plastic jug. Shake thoroughly to mix. Pour into your car windshield washer reservoir in place of commercial windshield washer fluid. Always shake prior to adding to the reservoir.The alcohol speeds the drying time and prevents the windows from freezing or cracking in the winter.Mary Hunt invites you to visit her at Everyday-Cheapskate.com, where this column is archived complete with links and resources for all recommended products and services.

However, occasionally one produces an interesting declarer-play or defense problem.In today's deal, South is in three no-trump. How should he plan the play after West leads the spade 10? What would have happened if West had instead led the heart seven or heart jack or club six? How would four spades have fared?West's two-no-trump intervention showed at least 5-5 in hearts and clubs, the unbid suits. After that, North-South struggled into three no-trump.A careless declarer won with the spade jack and played four rounds of diamonds. An accurate heart shift by East left South unable to cash his third spade winner.When West discards at trick two, South should unblock the spade ace and duck a diamond, giving East his winner early (usually the right play). Now declarer can win the heart shift with his ace, cash the spade king and run the rest of the diamonds.He retains communication between his two hands.Note that the heart seven opening lead results in down two. The heart jack blocks the suit and allows South to escape for down one. The club six leads to down one if declarer guesses the clubs correctly at trick one.Finally, the toughest question: Four spades can be made unless West leads a trump! ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Did you think of a giraffe, though? I didn't.At the bridge table, paying careful attention to valuable spot cards can make the difference between success and failure.In today's deal, how should South play in four spades after West leads the club queen?West might have considered sacrificing in five diamonds, but the vulnerability was unfavorable.South saw four potential losers: one heart, two diamonds and one club. He had only nine top tricks: seven spades and two clubs.He had to eliminate that club loser, and the only way to do that was to establish a heart trick and discard a club from hand.However, that required being careful with communications.The defenders were already halfway to collecting a club winner.Declarer played spotlessly!He won the first trick in his hand and led the heart 10. West correctly ducked, letting his partner take the trick. East shifted to a diamond, West collecting two tricks there before returning the club 10.South won on the board, ruffed a heart with a spade honor, overtook the spade five with dummy's nine, trumped another heart with a high trump, led the spade eight to dummy's 10 and ruffed a third heart high, bringing down West's ace. Finally, declarer played his spade deuce to dummy's three and pitched his remaining club on the heart queen.It was a purrfect line of play.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

South bid what he hoped he could make.South saw that if either the heart finesse was working or East had the club ace, he was in no danger. So he assumed both cards were in the West hand, which is what the bidding strongly suggested.Declarer, not wanting East to gain the lead twice, ducked the first trick.When West continued with the diamond jack, South won with his ace, played a trump to dummy's king, ruffed the remaining diamond and drew East's second trump.Now South found a brilliant play that would not occur to many - he led the club three from his hand!East took the trick and shifted to the heart 10, but declarer played his low heart and won with dummy's king.Then he happily gave West the trick with his club ace because he was endplayed.If West returned a heart, it would be away from his queen into South's ace-jack.If West instead led a minorsuit card, it would concede a ruff-and-sluff. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Was he unlucky or wrong?North judged his hand to be a tad too good for a 15-17 no-trump. Edgar Kaplan's 4Cs method agrees, rating the hand at 17.7. South did not like responding one notrump with no semblance of a second spade stopper, but bidding two diamonds looked even worse.West led the spade five: four, nine, six. East continued with the spade king and spade queen, West discarding the club two at trick three.East was clearly sending a suit-preference signal to advertise the heart king.West's discard surely was from an initial five-or sixcard suit. It would be too dangerous to pitch from four. If so, West was heavily favored to hold the club queen. Even though he was finessing into the hand with three spade winners, South backed his judgment, running the club jack. The thin line snapped -- down two.Yes, declarer was unlucky, but he was also wrong! The club finesse could wait.Perhaps East had the queenjack doubleton of diamonds.A diamond to the king and another diamond to the 10 is preferable. Here, West takes the trick and shifts to a heart.South wins with dummy's ace, cashes the club ace, just in case East has a singleton queen, and suddenly he has 10 tricks: one spade, one heart, four diamonds and four clubs.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Schuller, who was a televangelist, said, \"High achievers spot rich opportunities swiftly, make big decisions quickly and move into action immediately. Follow these principles and you can make your dreams come true.\" That also applies to bridge experts. How should South play to try to make four spades? West leads the diamond jack, and East overtakes with his queen.North was tempted to rebid two spades, but with 4-3-3-3 he settled for one no-trump.South bid what he hoped he could make.South has nine top tricks: seven spades and two minorsuit aces. Maybe East will have the heart ace - but as you are seeing this deal in a column, you know it cannot be that easy. Similarly, West is not going to have the club king. Can declarer get home if both of those honors are offsideftYes, if he notes the invaluable clubs. South wins trick one because if he ducks, East will shift to the heart queen, and the defenders will take the first four tricks.Declarer overtakes his club 10 with dummy's ace and continues with the club queen (or nine). Here, East will cover with the king.So South ruffs high, draws trumps ending on the board and plays the club nine.When East covers, declarer ruffs, plays a spade to the eight and cashes the club eight.Note that if East does not cover one of the clubs from the board, South discards his remaining diamond.Finally, if West has both the club king and jack, declarer is still all right. He will lose only two clubs and one heart. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

We read in Chapter 3, verse 21-23, \"But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope: the steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, His mercies never come to an end.They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness!\" We often find ourselves lamenting the state of the world today.Injustices against minorities, human trafficking, mass shootings and other heartbreaking occurrences seem to dominate the headlines of the news. Even so, amid all our trials, troubles and tribulations, we are reminded that the sun peeks out from the clouds, and a single candlelight can chase the night away.In John 8:12, Jesus tells us that He is \"the light of the world\", and those who follow Him \"will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.\" With God's word, and with Jesus as the light of the world that we follow, we have the hope that the \"steadfast love of the Lord never ceases. His mercies never come to an end.\" In the end, it will be all right. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

In this deal, for example, which card allows South to guarantee his sixspade contract after West leads the heart 10?Following South's fourspade opening, North used Roman Key Card Blackwood to learn that his partner had the top three spades. Thinking they had 12 winners (South's eight spades and his own four tops), North put his partner into six spades. However, South had only seven spades and needed to find a 12th trick somewhere.His first thought was to try each minor-suit finesse, but then he wondered if he could get home even if East had both of those kings.Suddenly declarer noticed the power of dummy's diamond nine. He took the first trick on the board and drew trumps. Then he played a low diamond and covered West's card with dummy's nine. East won with his jack, but what could he do now?Whether he returned a heart, a diamond or a club, it was into a tenace on the board and furnished South with his 12th trick.Notice that it does not help West to put up the diamond 10. Declarer can cover with the queen. Yes, East takes the trick with his king, but a diamond away from the jack runs around to the dummy's ace-nine.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's a four-letter word and certainly not ideal under any circumstances.Being debt-free is always better than being in debt. But not all debt is created equal. Generally, debt comes in two flavors: secured and unsecured.Secured debts are collateralized.That means the borrower pledges something of value to the lender that acts like a security deposit.If the borrower defaults, the lender gets ownership of that valuable asset. A home mortgage is probably the best example of reasonably safe, secured debt.In a mortgage, the property becomes the collateral.Unsecured debts, on the other hand, are wild and crazy because there is no security. Even worse, invariably, this kind of debt comes with double-digit interest rates. All it takes is the borrower's signature and the deed is done. This kind of debt is not safe, in fact it is toxic.Unsecured debt can ruin a life. Credit card debt is the best example of toxic debt. It looks so harmless.It offers so much convenience and flexibility. And nothing could be further from the truth. Unsecured consumer debt is like a steel trap armed with attractive bait to lure you in. Then, once you're in, it slams shut.I've been in the debt trap.It's a horrible place to be. It took me 13 years to gnaw my way out of a six-figure load of unsecured, toxic debt. My husband (a man of both of both long-suffering and integrity) and I didn't file for bankruptcy.We repaid every dime including interest, penalties and fees.I didn't get into the debt trap against my will. I did it to myself, naively and stupidly.I nibbled at that delicious bait. I chose to ignore the signs warning that I was heading for trouble if I didn't change my ways. I paid a terrible price for acting so foolishly.

The declarers who are good at that are used to saying to partner, \"Don't tell me - the suit is splitting badly yet again.\" How should South have planned the play in three notrump on today's deal? West, after overcalling in spades, led the diamond king: two, 10The bidding was pushy.North's two-spade cue bid showed at least gameinvitational values with club support. South was not happy rebidding two no-trump, but he knew his partner did not have four hearts (no negative double over one spade), and five clubs was a long way away. North raised because he had a fifth club and a vulnerable game bonus was very tempting.South saw six top tricks: three hearts, one diamond and two clubs. If clubs were 2-1, there were nine easy winners. So, declarer assumed they were 3-0. Who had the tripleton? Surely it was East because West already seemed to be marked with at least nine pointedsuit cards. However, before immediately playing a club to dummy's king, he silently said to himself, \"Wait, wait.\" He could acquire more data by first cashing his heart winners.Well, well - West had only one heart. If he had been void in clubs, he would have had something like 6=1=6=0 distribution and surely would have bid three or four diamonds over two no-trump.South cashed his club ace and claimed when East discarded.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I don't want to jeopardize my current job, but I also don't want to miss out on a potential opportunity because of a lack of references.What do you suggest I do? How can I approach this situation delicately without putting my current job in jeopardy? - Need a Reference DEAR NEED A REFERENCE: Is there anyone else where you work that you could ask for a reference?You don't always need the big boss to vouch for your abilities, as long as you find someone credible.Think about who else might help you and keep it confidential.If you really do need your boss and you think the potential opportunities are worth the risk, sit down and talk to him. Explain that while you like your job, you are looking to test the waters and see what else is out there.Be prepared to explain why.If you have any issues with your current job, be prepared to address them, albeit delicately.If you are looking to make more money, say as much. If you want to leverage your education and experience further, say that. Be prepared to share a timeline for when you might leave if the right opportunity presents itself.Showing your boss respect in the form of advance notice goes a long way and may just land you a better reference than you imagined.Be careful not to spend working hours on your job search, and continue to do an excellent job where you are.You never know.

I often rely on this option, especially when we have last-minute guests. It's impressive to quickly produce a high-quality, delicious pizza; it's my little secret.READY TO ROLLThe takeout pizza store in my neighborhood sells ready-to-roll pizza dough.I can buy a large ball of dough for $3.50, which makes a 16-inch pizza.Not all pizza stores sell their dough (the national chains in my area look at me as if I have three eyes when I inquire), but independent shops are typically more than happy for the business - any business.In fact, one store near me even lists this on their menu board.READY TO GOMy local supermarket sells ready-to-bake pizza dough in the deli section for $3.49 (enough to make one 12-inch pizza).Now is the time to start planning how to replace a regular meal more economically.You're smart, so I am confident you will come up with ideas and strategies I haven't considered.YOUR TURNThese are only a few ideas for combining quick-service foods with home cooking to create semi-homemade meals.What are your favorite tricks and tips?

I'm a huge fan of the fresh produce at 99 Cents Only stores. And milk, as compared to the price at my supermarket, is a bargain at the Walgreens across the street. But who knew we could decorate our homes from places like Dollar General? Our reader discovered that, and I think her tactic is simply brilliant.ALTERNATIVE DECORMy husband and I recently repainted our living room for a fresh, new look and then realized our curtains no longer worked with the new color. We couldn't find anything that we both liked. To our surprise, we found fabric shower curtains at Dollar General that worked perfectly - only $10 each.Because of how wide our window is, we needed four of them, but for only $40 we have a totally new look in our living room and we love it.- Trish STRETCH THE GASOLINEDriving fast reduces your fuel efficiency and increases expenses. While aerodynamic drag is less significant in the city, it significantly diminishes fuel efficiency at speeds exceeding 55 mph.Increasing your speed to 65 results in a 36% surge in the drag. For individuals engaged in frequent highway commuting, reaching your destination a few minutes earlier might lead to an additional expenditure of $510 annually. Sticking to a speed nearer to 55 mph and making use of your cruise control has the potential to yield favorable returns. - GregZIP IT!Always remember to zip up jeans and other garments that have metal zippers before laundering them. Those little metal teeth are like miniature chainsaws, tearing up and ruining other expensive clothing in the washer and dryer. - Francesca Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Sometimes, though, there still won't be an obvious candidate. Then it is often best to think big, shut your eyes and bid what you hope you can make.On today's deal, which was played in Australia and was reported by Tim Bourke, South didn't know what to do after East opened with a weak two spades. South made a takeout double, then mentally shrugged his shoulders and jumped to six diamonds. He knew he could be either too high or too low, but he saw no way to find out.West led the spade seven: nine, 10, queen. Declarer's immediate reaction was to cash the spade ace, discarding a heart from the dummy, and to ruff his heart three and one low spade on the board. However, he recalled the bidding. Since East had six spades, West had started with only two. Surely West would hold two diamonds higher than the five, which would allow him to ruff in front of the dummy.Then South spotted a better line. At trick two, he ruffed the spade four on the board.Declarer returned to hand with a heart to the ace and led the spade five. What could West do?If he ruffed with the diamond seven, declarer would throw a heart from the dummy.Eventually South would ruff his heart three in peace. If West discarded on the spade five, declarer would ruff in the dummy, draw trumps and claim, conceding a heart trick at the end.The key point, which applies in most contracts, is that winners can wait, but losers cannot. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You have discovered they are liars. But I have this complaint against you.You don't love me or each other as you did at first!\" (Revelation 2:2-4; NLT) The Ephesian Church was trying so hard to get things just right in their church. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, they were commended for doing such. But they became so caught up with the world of rules and doing things correctly that it caused them to lose their passion for God and for other people.They believed all the right things, but it caused them to become spiritual traffic cops.They had become judgmental and quick to point fingers.They were so busy correcting people and making sure that no sinful practices entered their church that they forgot that they were also supposed to be loving people.Too often, church becomes a place where people go to prove to everyone that they are obeying all the rules and doing all the right things. Anyone who does not pass our morality checkpoints, too often are not welcomed there.And the place begins to get cold and lifeless.We begin to lose our passion for seeing lost people come into a relationship with Jesus Christ. Lost people begin to become a nuisance to us.We even begin to question the spirituality of each another.Our churches must adhere to sound theology and doctrine. But we must also never forget that which should motivate us to be holy: we are to love God and love others. This is our first love. Let's not lose that. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

One thing is certain - the appetites remain just as normal - starving. Today we will revisit some tried and true recipes and some new ones. Since Fall signals lots of outdoor and indoor activities, food preparation needs to be simple but filling. Fall or autumn - whichever you call it arrives Sept. 23. Fall has always been my favorite season. Not too hot and not too cool - just perfect for fall house cleaning and preparing for the upcoming holidays.Fall fruits and vegetables seem to taste so delicious or is that because local crops are coming to an end.My local produce stand had a few late green peppers, and I grabbed several to make a family favorite - stuffed pepper soup. The crock pot is perfect for making this soup. Place 1-pound uncooked hamburger in first followed by one large can of tomato soup, undiluted, one medium size can of beef broth, one medium size can of diced tomatoes, one large diced onion, one large green pepper - cleaned and diced, and two tablespoons brown sugar. Place the lid on and cook on low for 6 to 7 hours. The last hour of cooking, add one bag of Boil-in-a-Bag of rice and continue to cook another hour. Not only does it taste good, but the aroma is tantalizing.Serve with breadsticks or an assortment of crackers.These next few recipes were popular with sports parents so I will run them again.AIR FRYER FRENCH FRIES1 pound russet potatoes, salt and pepper to taste, cooking oil.Wash 1 pound of russet potatoes and cut into wedges, Season with salt and pepper, Spray basket lightly with cooking oil. Place wedges in the air fryer basket making sure not to crowd them so air can circulate.Spray tops of potato wedges lightly with cooking spray, Cook at 400 degrees F for 7 minutes and then flip over and cook for 7 minutes more.AIR FRYER CHICKEN NUGGETS1 boneless skinless chicken breast, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon black pepper, 1/2 cup unsalted butter melted, 1/2 cup breadcrumbs, 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan optional.Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees for 4 minutes. Trim any fat from chicken breast, Slice into 1/2-inch-thick slices, then each slice into 2 to 3 nuggets.Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Place melted butter in a small bowl and breadcrumbs (with Parmesan, if using) in another small bowl. Dip each piece of chicken in butter, then breadcrumbs. Place in a single layer in the air fryer basket.Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may need to bake in two batches or more. Set the timer to 8 minutes. When done, check if the internal temperature of chicken nuggets is at least 165 degrees F. Remove nuggets from the basket with tongs and set onto a plate to cool.AIR FRYER CINNAMON SUGAR DOUGHNUTSCooking spray, 1/2 c. milk, 1/4 c. plus 1 tsp. granulated sugar, divided, 1 (0.25-oz.) packet or 2 1/4 tsp. active-dry yeast, 2 c. all-purpose flour, 1/2 tsp. kosher salt, 4 tbsp. butter, melted, 1 large egg, 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract. For CINNAM ON SUGAR. 1/2 c. granulated sugar, 2 tbsp. ground cinnamon, 2 tbsp. melted butter. Grease a large bowl with cooking spray. In a small, microwave-safe bowl or glass measuring cup, add milk. Microwave until lukewarm, 40 seconds. Add a teaspoon of sugar and stir to dissolve, then sprinkle over yeast and let sit until frothy, about 8 minutes. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour and salt. In a large bowl, whisk together remaining ¼ cup sugar, butter, egg, and vanilla.Pour in yeast mixture, mix to combine, then add in dry ingredients, stirring with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms.SLOW COOKER CHICKEN PARMESAN SLIDERS1 1/2 - 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, Salt and pepper, 1 jar (24-ounce) or 3 cups all-natural marinara sauce, 2 teaspoons fresh pre-minced garlic, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning crushed in hand, 12 slider wheat buns or rolls, 3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, 6 slices of Provolone cheese, cut into fourths.Lightly season all sides of chicken with salt and pepper. Add the chicken breasts, marinara sauce, garlic, and Italian seasoning to a slow cooker. Cook on LOW for 2 1/2 - 3 hours. Chicken is done when it shreds easily and is white all the way through (or registers 165°F internally). Shred with two forks.Preheat the broiler. Open up the buns and place them on a sheet pan, insides facing up. Broil for 1-2 minutes, until toasted. Watch closely so they don't burn! To build a sandwich place some hot shredded chicken on a bun, sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese, top with two little pieces of Provolone or Mozzarella cheese, and pop the top of the bun in place.Frozen chicken burritos are a nearly perfect freezer meal. They freeze and thaw well and can go straight from freezer to microwave or oven. \n \n Caption: METR O CREAT IVE SERVICES\n \nAir Fryer chicken nuggets are a favorite. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bridge - After bidding up, do you pay up or play up?\n\n September 14, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Phillip Alder | Page: 15 | Section: News \n \n 278\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It is a well-known saying in bridge that if you bid the spots off the cards, you had better know how to play the spots off as well.In today's deal, North's four clubs was a splinter bid. It showed slam interest, spade support and a singleton (or void) in clubs. It was a debatable choice, a splinter with a singleton ace rarely being right, and North had such bad trumps. With nothing wasted in clubs, South wasn't willing to stop short of six.Actually, it isn't the world's worst slam, because of the secondary diamond fit, but South's declarer-play wasn't up to the task.After winning the first trick with dummy's club ace, declarer played a trump.When East's king appeared, South smiled. He won with his ace and cashed the queen, but East discarded a club.Still alive, South ruffed a club in the dummy, played a diamond to his queen and ruffed his last club. Now if he could have just found West with four diamonds, South could have discarded the heart jack and queen before West ruffed in. However, when East followed to the second diamond, South took his best chance, attempting the heart finesse. It lost, and West scored two major-suit tricks.There was a simple way to get home - if South had thought of it. When East played the spade king, South should have ducked. Suppose East switched to a heart. South could have won with the ace, ruffed his two low clubs in the dummy, drawn trumps and run the diamonds. His 12 tricks would have been three spades, one heart, five diamonds, one club and those two club ruffs.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

South played the spade two: nine, king, three.Declarer called for dummy's spade four. When East discarded a low diamond, South put in the seven. West won with the jack, cashed the spade ace and led his last spade. Now South had 10 tricks: two spades, one heart, five diamonds and two clubs.How many times did the pendulum swing?First, any minor-suit opening lead from West would have put his side in control.Second, looking at those strong diamonds in the dummy, East should win trick one with the heart ace and return the heart 10. Now South must play the trump suit to avoid losing three tricks there.After taking the second trick with dummy's spade king, South should abandon trumps. By playing three rounds of diamonds and discarding the heart nine, declarer keeps the contract under control. He will lose only three trump tricks.After winning with the spade jack at trick three, West missed a difficult chance to defeat the contract. If he had guessed what had happened at trick one, he would have led the heart queen, pinning South's nine. Declarer is forced to ruff the third round of hearts and cannot recover.He runs out of trumps.So, the pendulum swung four times.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

South rebid three no-trump because he saw nine tricks. Maybe North should have passed, but because he had a ruffing value in diamonds, he went with the known major-suit fit.South won with his heart ace, cashed the spade ace and played a low spade to dummy's nine. Now he led a diamond to his jack.However, West won with the queen and returned his last trump. In dummy with the jack, South played a diamond to his king, but West won with the ace and cashed a diamond and a heart to defeat the contract.\"Did you see how unlucky I was, partner? West had three trumps and both top diamond honors.\" North canceled his partner's dinner invitation. He also refrained from pointing out that if South leads a diamond from his hand at trick two, he guarantees a diamond ruff in the dummy - the shorter trump hand - for his 10th trick. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Of course, the internet has made everything so much easier.Imagine how much better prepared today's senior citizens would have been if they could have enjoyed such easy access to data when they were teenagers.Today's deal is a rarity. It was declared by two robots and one human. All three went down. Against six spades, West leads the heart king.Declarer ruffs and cashes the spade ace, but East discards a heart. How should South continue?Looking at the North-South hands, you would like to be in seven spades, needing only trumps 2-1. However, how do you find out that North has three trumps and that perfect club holding?In the given auction, three clubs was a double negative, showing some 0-3 points.Both robots drew trumps before playing three rounds of diamonds. East happily took two diamond tricks: down one.The human, after East discarded at trick two, played three rounds of diamonds.East, though, won and led his last diamond, which West ruffed with the spade jack: down one.South should cash the club ace and king at tricks three and four. Then he leads a low spade from hand, voluntarily sacrificing a trick. South can draw trumps ending on the board and discard his diamond losers on the club queen and jack.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Copycats began selling tees without contravening the patent, which had been written too imprecisely.In bridge, if you stroke the cards as recommended by the textbooks, normally you will hit down the middle, but sometimes you will slice or hook badly. East made a good shot on today's deal, but South got his ball into the cup first.Against three no-trump, West led the spade six: three, queen, four. With two spades left, it would be normal for East to return his higher card. But East realized that if he led the 10 and South had the singleton jack left, South would get two spade tricks.So East returned the spade five.The declarer, Jose Le Dentu, who was one of France's top player-writers, could have blocked the spade suit by winning trick two with dummy's ace over West's king. However, not knowing who held the 10, he ducked.After winning the third trick with dummy's spade ace, Le Dentu led a club, winning with his ace when East played low. Back to dummy with a heart, Le Dentu led another club through East. If East had played the queen, declarer would have ducked. When East played low, South won with the king and led a third club. Le Dentu had established nine tricks without letting West gain the lead to cash his two spade winners.South's play avoided the bunkers. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, the truth is, the devil has seemed to be pretty successful at pickpocketing us.The evidence to that, when we need it, we don't seem to have, and it seems like we are always praying for it, but the good news is that we can turn the tide and see things change for God's glory.It is through God's wonderful gift of prayer, that we can find God's truth to be our belt, His righteousness to be our breastplate, and His gospel of peace to be our shoes, our faith to be our shield, our salvation to be our helmet, and God's Word to be our sword.It is through prayer in Christ's name that we can storm the gates of hell, snatch others from the flame, tear down strongholds, and see our brothers and sisters in Christ strengthened in their journeys.We can see souls saved, bodies healed, minds restored and lives transformed.The barren womb can bring forth a child, and the end of a thing can be better than the beginning there of. Faith can replace fear, and sorrow can be conquered by joy.

Some of those vegetables include acorn squash, brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, jalapeno peppers, mushrooms, sweet potatoes, turnips and green peppers to name a few. Fall is a busy time on the farm - preparing to harvest the crops and to harvest the late garden vegetables.School has started but the garden work was still a part of our daily chores. With schoolwork and homework most was done on the weekends. My brothers and I loved fall sports and were anxious to get the \"outside stuff\" over with - waiting for the first frost.Happy fall, y'all.Let's begin our fall cooking with ROASTED BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUPThis soup is the best I have ever tasted, This recipe is super creamy but yet uses no cream and is full of butternut flavor. Leftovers are just as tasty as the day you made it. This recipe yields about 6 cups or 4 soup bowls full.Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.Cut one large butternut squash in half vertically and remove the seeds.Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and place squash on the paper with cut side facing up. Sprinkle about ½ teaspoon olive oil on the inside of each squash half rubbing the oil to coat the inside. Sprinkle each half lightly with salt and pepper.Turn the two squash halves now face down and cook until completely tender and cooked through - about 40 to 50 minutes.Meanwhile in a large soup pot place 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat and heat until shimmering. In a blender on the soup mode place 1 large shallot, 1 teaspoon salt, and blend well then pour into the soup pot and cook until the shallots are tender and starting to turn golden, about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.Add 4 minced garlic cloves and continue stirring and cooking for another minute.Using a large spoon, scoop the buttermilk squash flesh into the blender, discarding the skin, and add one teaspoon maple syrup, ½ teaspoon nutmeg and a dash of black pepper. Blend for several minutes, remove from the blender, and stir into a soup pot over medium heat. Add remaining ingredients - 3 to 4 cups vegetable broth, and 1 to 2 tablespoons butter. Rapidly boil until soup is heated through, stirring to ensure the smooth creamy consistency (add more broth if too thick). Serve.Another great fall vegetable. available right now. is broccoli. A family favorite at my house is BROCCOLI CHEESE CASSEROLE which is a year-round recipe for many occasions. Rinse and steam one large bunch of broccoli until slightly tender. Grease a 11 x 7 casserole dish and arrange broccoli in the dish. Sprinkle 2 cups chopped sharp cheddar cheese on top and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. in a bowl combine 2 lightly beaten eggs with 1 can cream of mushroom soup, ½ cup mayo and ½ cup chopped onions - mix well and spread over cheese. Combine 4 tablespoons softened butter with 1½ cups herbed seasoned stuffing mix and place on top of broccoli mixture in a casserole. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.HARVEST BOWL1. c. wild rice blend, 2. c. chicken broth, 2 tbsp. unsalted butter, 1. tsp. kosher salt divided, 1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and cut in half, 2 small, sweet potatoes, cut into. inch cubes, 2 tbsp. olive oil, 1 tsp. ground black pepper, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. cayenne, 1 rotisserie chicken about 2 pounds, 2 c. fresh baby kale, 1 Honeycrisp apple cored and cubed,. c. crumbled goat cheese,. c. roasted, salted almonds, coarsely chopped.FOR THE BALSAMIC VINAIGRETTE3 tbsp. balsamic vinegar, 2 tsp. honey, 2 tsp. Dijon mustard, 1 garlic clove, grated,¼ tsp. kosher salt, ¼ tsp. ground black pepper, 1/3 c. olive oil. For the bowls: Preheat the oven to 450°F. Place the rice blend in a fine mesh sieve. Rinse the rice under water, using your hand to move the rice around for about 1 minute. Place the rice in a medium saucepan with the broth, butter, and ½ teaspoon of salt. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the rice is tender, 45 minutes.Remove the pot from the heat and keep the rice covered for another 15 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork.Meanwhile, line a large baking sheet with foil. Add the Brussels sprouts and sweet potato.Drizzle the vegetables with the olive oil, tossing to coat. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and cayenne, tossing to coat. Roast until the vegetables are tender and browned, about 25 minutes, stirring halfway through. For the balsamic vinaigrette: In a mason jar, add the balsamic vinegar, honey, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper. Place the lid on the jar and shake vigorously until the ingredients are well combined, about 15 seconds.Add the olive oil and shake the closed jar again until the dressing is well emulsified. Store in the refrigerator and shake well before using. Remove the skin and bones from the chicken. Shred or cut the meat into cubes, as desired.To serve: Divide the baby kale among four bowls. Spoon on the wild rice and divide the Brussels sprouts, sweet potato, chicken, apple, goat cheese, and almonds.Drizzle with the balsamic vinaigrette. \n \n Caption: METRO CREATIVE SERVICES\n \nRoasted Butternut Squash Soup, \"the best I have ever tasted.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I love this stuff so much, I must admit to being slightly compulsive - gathering, testing and assessing techniques. Here are a few of my new favorites: BERRIESAre you familiar with that sick feeling that comes when you notice that the berries you bought yesterday are already showing signs of mold and turning brown? Here's the remedy: As soon as you bring them into the kitchen, prepare a mixture of one part vinegar (white or apple cider) and 10 parts water. Give the berries a bath in the mixture.Swirl them around a bit and then gently drain, rinse and place in the refrigerator.Don't worry. The solution is so weak, you will not taste the vinegar. This treatment should give your strawberries an additional two weeks of useful life and raspberries a week or more. Vinegar retards the growth of bacteria that causes berries to spoil so quickly.POTATOESTo keep potatoes from growing big ugly sprouts before you have time to use them up, store them with a couple of apples. For some reason, that really works to halt the sprouting.ALUMINUM FOILLet me just say that I'm a believer! It drives me crazy that I do not know why this works, but it certainly does: Wrap celery, broccoli and lettuce in a single layer of aluminum foil before storing in the refrigerator. Celery will stay crisp and fresh for up to a month stored this way. It's simply amazing.MUSHROOMSStore mushrooms in a paper bag. Now the air can circulate and the mushrooms will remain dry and lovely for weeks.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" \n \n Caption: MARY HUNT \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Letters To The Editor\n\n September 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 1163\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Tentative existenceOne of the great theologians of our time and certainly one of my favorite online speakers and writers: Robert E. Barron, otherwise known as Bishop Barron. He is the founder of Word on Fire Ministries and Bishop of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester (MN).In a recent message he spoke on \"death\" and our need to think about it more.However, we tend to look at life daily as if it would never end. If we meditated on the finality of our life, we might value it better and look to find the Lord in each moment.I was reminded of this today when two men in our over 50 community were found dead. One died in his sleep and the other hadn't been seen outside of his home for some time.When they broke down his door, they found he had been dead for a few days. He died alone. Just the opposite but the result was the same when a friend of mine, Jerry died four days ago or so. We served in the same churches many years ago, but only in recent years reconnected through Facebook. He had seen my prayer requests asking to pray for me as I dealt with cancer. He assured me he would be faithful to join my \"prayer warriors\" in my fight for life.It seems it wasn't long after that he messaged me to tell me he needed the same.Cancer has a way of turning your thoughts to the reality of your mortality. This is especially true if for 12 years, each year your doctors are telling you, \"You only have a year or maybe two to live.\"It is not a bad thing as Bishop Barron would encourage to think about your life considering its tentative existence. Values change, behaviors are examined, relationships are prioritized and time maximized.Cancer should not be the only motivator; death comes in many ways and by many means.When we first moved into our community my immediate neighbor told me that this was the place where retired people move in to live and then they die. Now he is gone too. No matter where you live thinking about death helps you to prioritize life and make you ready for the one to come.FATHER ROB CARL EastonTeaching GunnarMy son was born in 1980. I used to take him to the Columbia Mall.Routinely, before we left, we visited the pet store and selected a little furry dog to play with in the pen. Then we would head over to the Hobby Store.One day, I was dusting my son's room. I stumbled across a little diary and sat down to read it. Suddenly, my skin began to slightly boil. In the diary he wrote: \"Dear Diary, I feel so bad. Mom took me to the Hobby Store. I saw clay and I took it.\"My mother would have used the wooden spoon on me and condemned me to the basement for a few months to teach me a lesson not to steal. I thought of a more creative way.I phoned the Hobby Store and spoke to the manager. I informed him that my son took some clay. I then asked him if he would be so kind as to place a message on my answering machine stating that he witnessed my son take the clay. The man hesitated and said that it was not necessary.I begged to differ.I would typically pick my son up from school, return home and push my answering machine button.This particular day was the same. We walked inside, and he witnessed me push the button. Then we both heard it loud and clear: \"Gunnar Lindberg, this is the manager of the Hobby Store. I saw you take a piece of clay, and you better bring it back!\" I thought my son was going to pee on the floor.I looked at him and asked, \"Did you steal clay from that store? Where is it?\" (He cried, he stumbled.)\"We are going back to the Columbia Mall right now with the clay.\"The drive to the mall was not a pleasant one for my son. Once there, I saw the manager and said, \"My son has something for you.\" The manager held out his hand and said, \"You should not take anything that is not yours.\" Then I asked, \"Do you have a broom?\" The manager replied, \"Yes.\"Then I said, \"My son is going to sweep your floors for you. I will pick him up in three hours right before you close.\"Today, brooms still make my son a bit nervous and . little pieces of clay.CATHY LINDBERG JAROSZ EastonPlay the song rightRemember that cartoon that upset many recently, when Jesus was depicted as a Democrat? MD and Billy K's rebuttals to J Gondeck's \"heads in the sand \" letter (by the way, the same edition with J Gondeck's letter showed a photo and editorial about the Proud Boys deserving what they get and then the next full page featuring Hillary back in the Whitehouse the irony!) reminds me of this.It makes me think, what would Jesus do? How do we make the reTrumplicans and Democrats get along? Like being in a band or playing on a team (go O's!), as fellow Americans, we have to get along.Know the play, get the facts, play by the rules, follow the law, be humble. To win, to play the song right.Well love thy neighbor, the next day's Star Democrat-edition's focus on Dorchester County quoted Theresa Stafford saying poverty is a \"lead driver\" for many issues in Cambridge (arguing about a curfew) and I'll say everywhere else too, poverty is the problem.Some compassion from the rich maybe although they would call it handouts.Maybe more philanthropy from athletes (go O's!) I don't know. What would Jesus do?He would gather those 25 kids and feed them and shelter them and love them.JAN HALLBAUER East New MarketWilling to reap rewardsPaul Peters' Sept. 15 follow-up to John Gondeck's provacative piece of the day before on Hunter Biden's and his father's peccadilloes assumes but doesn't specifically state that Joe made possible his son's ability to self-entangle that resulted in lucrative gains for the lad and who knows what else.How were those possible?Surely no Star reader, nor anyone elsewhere in this land, thinks there's a chance that a foreign nation wouldn't latch onto the fact that catering to Hunter will be all that's necessary to kissit-up with Joe, whatever Dad's political capacity be then or will be in future. And it didn't take long for these actions to have the desired effect, did it?For Joe to tell us that he's not connected with his son's affairs, doesn't talk to him about them (not even at home or sitting side-by-side on long international flights on official U.S government aircraft) proves that Joe's a colossal liar; further that he's desperate enough to expose himself to the characterization.The duo is so willing to reap the rewards from breaking the law that they ignore the effect of the \"appearance of evil\" that honest people try to avoid.OLIVER BERLINER Easton \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Now and then I get lazy, and then I get an immediate jolt that reminds me why I do this.My FoodsSaver gets a workout every day. Depending on the type of food, I use FoodSaver containers and canisters, plastic bags and canning jars to seal food items (this requires the jar sealer accessory).BLENDER I am more convinced than ever that healthy eating is one of the most cost-effective things we can do to reduce health care costs. That's why I thought we needed a powerful juicer to make healthy smoothies every morning. So I purchased a highly rated juicer - and used it exactly two times before it became a dust collector and space occupier.Cleaning the thing was so difficult and time-consuming it became more of a problem than a solution. Whoops.Another problem? Juicers don't make smoothies. Powerful professional-grade blenders do.So, six years ago, I donated the juicer to a friend who could use it and replaced it with a Blendtec Total Classic Original Blender.DEHYDRATOR No one was more surprised than me by what a terrific money saver a dehydrator can be. Of course, you have to actually use it. But when you do, you'll be quite amazed.The cost of dehydrating your own food is a fraction of the cost of commercially dehydrated foods, and with no additives or preservatives.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\"COPYR IGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If trying for that overtrick may cost a game or slam bonus, it is a poor investment. (Yes, once in a blue moon, it is justified in a matchpointed duplicate.)In today's deal, for example, how should South play in six spades after West leads the diamond nine?North's four-club response was a splinter bid showing the high-card values for a raise to four spades with a singleton (or void) in clubs.After three control-bids, South jumped to the slam.Declarer won with dummy's diamond king, drew trumps ending in the dummy and took the heart finesse. West won with the king and exited safely with a diamond. After winning with dummy's ace, declarer led a second heart. East's discard was a painful jolt. However South wriggled now, he couldn't avoid the loss of another heart trick: down one.Declarer should do some housekeeping before touching hearts. After drawing trumps, he should eliminate the minors. He cashes the diamond ace, ruffs the diamond jack, cashes the club ace and ruffs the club five. Now is the time to take the heart finesse.If West wins with his king and returns a low heart, dummy's nine takes the trick. If he wins and returns a minor, the ruff-and-sluff is all that South needs. If instead West ducks his king, declarer crosses to dummy with a trump and leads another heart, but when East discards, South plays the heart four from his hand, endplaying West.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In contrast, if you are trying to establish your suit, you might duck an early trick to keep communication with your partner - but not always.Defending against three notrump, West led the spade ace. With the queen in the dummy, attitude was known.So East dropped the two, showing an odd number of spades. Since from the bidding this had to be three, West continued with a low spade, giving declarer the trick he was bound to win and keeping communication with his partner. However, South made West pay.Declarer cashed dummy's diamond ace and played a diamond to his king. West's heart discard was a blow, but not lethal. South played off his three club winners before leading a diamond to dummy's queen. West discarded a second heart.Deciding West hadn't started with 5=3=1=4 shape and the heart king, which would now be bare, declarer exited with dummy's spade queen.West won with the king and cashed two more spade tricks, but then he had to lead away from the heart king, giving South his eighth and ninth tricks.If only West had played three rounds of spades at the beginning, the contract would have been defeated.Holding the heart king as an entry, this defense was leakproof.The vessel that leaks from the top, as pointed out by late journalist James Reston, is the government. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The average age of a passenger vehicle on the road has just hit a record 12.5 years. And no wonder now that the average monthly car payment for new vehicles hit $725 in the first quarter of denly, for many, taking on that kind of new debt feels a lot worse than driving a new car feels good.Most cars and trucks are built to last far longer than we can imagine. And when all is said and done, the difference between a clunker and a cream puff is mainly the difference between how the owner has cared for it.Research by major car manufacturers reveals that neglect of routine service and maintenance is the No. 1 reason for major car repairs. Routine maintenance doesn't cost; it saves money, aggravation, frustration and lives. Pay attention. Anticipate maintenance so you don't have to pay for repairs.When you need a major repair, if at all possible, get three estimates before you proceed. Don't only judge by the lowest price but judge by competence, ability, experience, equipment, and after-service care.When you find a good mechanic you trust, stick with him or her even if the prices are a bit higher. All things being equal, you'll save time, money and aggravation in the long run. Plus, your mechanic will get to know your car more intimately.It's true. A clean car - inside and out - lasts longer because you are routinely washing away gunk, grime and contaminants that cause corrosion. A sparkling clean car makes you feel better.Follow these suggestions and you can look forward to doubling your car's useful life.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But I dare not do a big global delete to empty it out because I would miss all your super fun, amazingly helpful and otherwise downright fun tips and tricks. Today, I'm sharing.I enjoy baking, but don't like measuring sticky ingredients like shortening or peanut butter. Now I spray the measuring cup with a nonstick cooking spray and the sticky ingredient slides right out. I no longer have to spend time scraping the measuring cup or spoon. - Joyce R. When traveling, pack an unused dryer sheet, especially if you're traveling to a dry, desert-like area. A few swipes with the dryer sheet will eliminate static from garments and equipment. - S.M.M.I save the small bottles of shampoo lotion and other toiletry items from hotels.When I have a big batch of them, I drop them off at any VFW location or women's shelter. They can always use them. - Cathy T. If you want to make smooth, clear iced tea that isn't bitter, just add a pinch of baking soda to the water while brewing. I use an iced tea maker, so I add the baking soda with the ice. It turns out fabulous without affecting the taste in any way. I prefer sweet tea, but this will work with unsweetened tea, too. - Sheryl R. I have a great way to get rid of those pesky ants that dare to come into my home.I go out to my herb garden, pick a few sprigs of mint and drop them on the floor in areas where the ants congregate.By morning the ants are gone.

Sorry for the inconvenience.\" In bridge, too, there may be signposts. The hard part is first realizing the signpost is there and then reading it correctly to find the right play.After South opened with an artificial and forcing two clubs, North gave the negative response. The rest of the auction was natural.Declarer won West's spade queen lead with his king and led the heart king: nine, three, four. South continued with the heart queen: two, five, seven. Annoying! If only an opponent had won with the ace, the contract would have been easy.Next, South cashed three diamond tricks, overtaking his queen with dummy's king on the second round.West discarded the club five on the third round.To an innocent bystander, it appeared that South would now try the club finesse for his ninth trick. However, South paused to work out the distribution. From his echo in hearts, it seemed that West had started with a doubleton. (He was very unlikely to echo when holding three low hearts.) If so, West would have length in clubs - and be ripe for an endplay. South played a spade to his ace and exited with the spade nine.West took three spade tricks but then had to lead away from the club king into South's ace-queen tenace.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Any ideas?If you watch bridge players, most properly place their cards onto the table without noticeable mannerisms. However, when something unwelcome has happened, a few play their cards with excessive emphasis. Also, there are those who like to spin the cards onto the table. In today's deal, a spinner was sitting West.Although his point-count was low, South jumped straight to game because he had only five losers (two hearts and three diamonds--you never count more than three losers in a single suit).West spun out the spade queen: three, two (discouraging), ace. Now South led the diamond three.It was clear to West that declarer was trying to engineer a diamond ruff or two in the dummy. If so, it would probably be beneficial for the defenders to lead trumps. Still, perhaps East didn't have a heart holding that could be safely led away from. So, in an excellent effort to guarantee winning trick two, West spun the diamond jack onto the table. (If West plays a lower diamond, the contract makes.) After winning the trick, West switched to his singleton trump.Whichever way South turned now, he was doomed to defeat. Actually, he finessed in hearts, so East won with the king and returned another trump.Then, when East regained the lead with the diamond queen, he led a third trump.South finished with only his nine top tricks.The Earth will stop spinning in millions of years, after the sun has exploded. However, one wag suggested it would stop spinning \"usually about five hours after one has stopped drinking.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I don't know about you, but I need a do-over, and I'm so glad that God specializes in do-overs.God is not moved by the imperfections of this world. He is not moved by the trials and tribulations of this world. He is moved by our faith because God is a God that never changes.He truly is the same yesterday, today, and forever more, which means if God did it before, God will do it again.If God healed you before, God will heal you again. If God delivered you before, God will deliver again. If God restored before, God will restore again.If God shut the mouth of the lion in the den, if He shut the mouth of the devil before, He will most certainly do it again on our behalf.If God showed favor on your life before, you better believe that God will do that thing again. If God covered you and protected you before, God will do it again. God specializes in do-overs.So, family, be encouraged as you read and ponder these thoughts today. If you are at wits end. If you are waning in faith, spiritual strength and hope I want you to remember what God has already done. If God has moved in your life before, trust and believe He will do it again.Maybe you don't believe it but be challenged today while you ponder. If you trust God. If you will lay your burdens down, the God who changes not, will do it again in your life.Paul said, \"Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable - if anything is excellent or praiseworthy - think about such things.\" (Philippians 4:8 NIV).So again, be encouraged.Say the words God will do it again because the God we serve can and will make a way out of now way. God is not a man that He shall lie, nor is the Son of Man that he should repent.Watch and wait. For they who wait on the Lord shall be renewed. Ponder and be blessed. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

For example, I have seen many road signs claiming \"Slow Children Playing.\" Presumably the quick children are at home studying. Also open to misinterpretation was this sign in Northern Ireland: \"If you find the service in this cafe unsatisfactory, you should see Mr. Wilson the manager.\" The correct play in today's deal should be crystal clear to an expert.After a straightforward auction to four hearts, West leads the club king. How should South plan the play?Declarer has nine top tricks: six hearts, two diamonds and one club. If East has the spade ace, everything will be smooth sailing, but is that likely? West made a two-level vulnerable overcall.Surely he has the spade ace.The next thought is to play three rounds of diamonds, hoping both that they break 3-3 and that West has to win the third round. That is a faint hope against defenders with any acumen.The only way to benefit from a 3-3 diamond break is not to lose a diamond trick. South achieved this by calmly playing low from the dummy at trick one.South won the second trick with dummy's club ace, discarding a low diamond from his hand. He then cashed two top trumps in hand. Declarer continued with the diamond ace, a diamond to the king and a diamond ruff. When they split 3-3, South played a heart to dummy's jack and discarded a spade loser on the 13th diamond.After congratulating South on his play, West commented, \"Sorry, partner. Next time I'll lead fourth-highest from my longest and strongest.\" ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Rather than thinking there is no solution for that stain, shrunken item or another laundry disaster, consider the ways you can recover and renew situations gone bad.SHRUNKENDon't be too quick to toss out that favorite sweater that just got shrunk in the hot wash or went through the dryer accidentally set to hot. Chances are good you can unshrink it if you move quickly: In a large container, make a solution with 1 gallon lukewarm water and 2 tablespoons baby shampoo. Soak the shrunken garment in the solution for about 10 minutes until totally saturated.Now, the important part: Don't rinse. Simply blot out all the excess water with a dry towel and gently lay it flat on a fresh towel. Reshape slowly and carefully as you stretch it back to its original size. Dry away from direct sunlight or heat.This technique will work provided the fibers have not become permanently damaged, or \"felted.\"SUPER STAINSYou've washed and dried that item dozens of times and still the ugly grease or other annoying stain hangs on. Before you toss it out, try one more thing, Lestoil.It's been around like forever, but so few people know about it. Lestoil, an all-purpose, heavy-duty oil and grease remover, has been manufactured right here in the USA for decades.Lestoil can be used fullstrength on stains, especially really difficult stains - the kind of stains you just give up on like ink, toner, grease, oil, scuff marks, blood, lipstick, nail polish, paint, grass stains, coffee stains, crayon and marker stains on every surface you can imagine. Even the sticky stuff left behind by stickers and labels.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\"COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Using 14th Amendment to bar Trump won't work\n\n September 29, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 7 | Section: Opinions \n \n 798\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON - Mae West (1893-1980), a salty actress, once played a character who said that when facing a choice between two evils, she opted for the one she hadn't tried before.A 2024 presidential choice between today's incumbent and his immediate predecessor would preclude West's cheerful strategy: Both have been tried, and together have produced a whopping bipartisan majority eager to see the last of them.This partly explains the spreading flirtation with the idea that the 14th Amendment bars Donald Trump from seeking the presidency.Many advocates of this idea are academics eager to infect presidential politics with the cancel culture of their campuses: Do not refute your adversaries, ban them. Less nakedly partisan people might think that using the 14th Amendment to remove Trump would thereby prompt President Biden to totter off into the sunset. But recourse to the amendment would be lawlessness masquerading as legality.And there already is a surfeit of illegality.The 14th Amendment, passed by Congress 14 months after Appomattox and ratified by the states 25 months later, is among the nation's most majestic accomplishments. Properly understood (by Randy E. Barnett and Evan D. Bernick in \"The Original Meaning of the 14th Amendment: Its Letter and Spirit\") and properly construed by courts (which it has never fully been), its Section 1 envelops the rights (\"privileges or immunities\") of civil equality in national citizenship with \"due process\" and \"equal protection\" guarantees.But people who would wield the amendment to extinguish Trump's electoral career are trying to solve a political problem by cleverness, citing the amendment's Section 3. It says that no person may \"hold any office, civil or military, under the United States\" who, having taken an oath as \"an officer of the United States\" to \"support the Constitution,\" has subsequently \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\"Leave aside (as a court will be unable to do) the fraught questions about what causal connections there were between Trump's rhetoric before and on Jan. 6, 2021, and the actions then of his acolytes: They, after all, had agency. And never mind how to calibrate \"aid or comfort.\" Just concentrate on \"insurrection.\"The Confederacy - the attempted secessions of 11 states; rebel cannon firing on federal installations; armies on the march against U.S. forces - was unambiguously an insurrection. A riotous rabble - whatever its motivations and delusional aspirations - on a January afternoon? Rather less so. They were criminal and disgusting, but closer to vandals than to the Army of Northern Virginia.Arguments about the continuing force and sweep of Section 3 are interesting; unleavened by prudence, they are dangerous. There could be no surer way to further embitter and calcify Trump's supporters than to stretch constitutional language to eliminate an electoral choice. And, in the process, to preempt judicial determinations about the nature and legal status of Trump's Jan. 6 behavior.People can find other outlets for their justifiable concerns about legalities. For example:Peter Navarro, former Trump adviser, has been properly convicted of contempt of Congress for defying a congressional subpoena. If unpunished, such behavior could largely nullify Congress's powers of investigation and oversight. Progressives pleased by this were, however, not noticeably offended when (the Wall Street Journal remembers) Barack Obama's Justice Department refused to prosecute Lois Lerner, who used her IRS position to impede conservative advocacy organizations, and for her noncooperation was held in contempt by the Republican-controlled House.Today, progressives' silence conveys complacency about Julie Su's imminent illegality. She is wielding power as Biden's labor secretary, even though the Democratic-controlled Senate has not confirmed her (at least 51 senators seem opposed). The Vacancies Act limits to 210 days the time someone can serve unconfirmed in an advice-and-consent position in a federal department. Su's legality expires Oct. 7. Her supporters say a Labor Department succession statute stipulates no time limit on her ability to serve as acting secretary, so she can continue. But this would be an unconstitutional abridgment of the Senate's power to advise and consent.People advocating a 14th Amendment solution to the problem of Trump are spreading the acids of cynicism and suspicion that are corroding trust in institutions. And some states' election officials - watch Colorado - are apt to seize this occasion for grandstanding, trying to keep Trump's name off their ballots. This will thicken his armor of martyrdom.Besides, this nation was founded on a good idea: the pursuit of happiness. In 2024, for many Americans, happiness will come from casting a vote against Trump.Reach George Will at georgewill@washpost.com. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a rally protesting the electoral college certification of Joe Biden as President in Washington, Jan. 6, 2021.

Truman said, \"I have found the best way to give advice to your children is to find out what they want and then advise them to do it.\"This deal isn't child's play. South and West must pay close attention to the spot cards. If everyone plays perfectly, what is the result in six spades doubled after West leads a top heart?South ruffed the opening lead low and cashed the spade ace. He wasn't surprised when East discarded the club ace. Now South led the spade seven and finessed dummy's nine. Next came a successful diamond finesse. South cashed the spade king, led his last spade to dummy's queen and finessed again in diamonds. He cashed the diamond ace, then announced he would run the rest of the diamonds before conceding a club at trick 13. Six spades doubled and made, but how many errors were committed?The answer is two. West's error was easier to avoid. When declarer led the spade seven at trick three, West should have put in the jack. He knew declarer was left with the K-10-7 of spades. So, by inserting the jack, he could reduce the dummy's entries to one. South would be unable to bring in the diamond suit without loss and would go down.However, declarer could avoid this fate. Just in case West had all four spades, South should have ruffed the opening lead with the spade 10. Then, after cashing the spade ace, he would retain the K-7-3 of spades. West would be unable to stop two dummy entries.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It can help keep your flowers looking fresh, purify water in emergencies and even lend a hand when you're cleaning up after a disaster.DETER MOSQUITOESWhile bleach may not be the first thing that comes to mind when dealing with mosquitoes, it can effectively deter them from reproducing in stagnant water. Add a small amount of bleach to a birdbath to eliminate mosquito larvae and safe-guard the water's quality. Just 1 tablespoon of bleach can protect up to 50 gallons of water, so use it sparingly. Avoid introducing bleach into natural water bodies and ponds to protect their delicate ecosystems.CUTTING BOARDMaintain a germ-free cut-ting board by rinsing it with a bleach-water mixture (1 teaspoon per gallon) and let-ting it air dry.DEODORIZERTo banish odors and germs from your trash bin, give it a rinse with a bleach-water combination.TOY SANITATION Children's toys can harbor germs. Combat this by soaking toys in a solution of 1 tablespoon of liquid bleach per gallon of water, followed by thorough rinsing.SNEAKER REVIVALBring the whiteness back to your white sneakers with a gentle scrub using a light bleach-water solution.PATIO FURNITURE Revitalize outdoor furniture by scrubbing it with a bleach-water mix (1/3 cup of bleach to 1 gallon of water).

I'm in three no-trump, and you're in the recycling bin if you don't win at least nine tricks.\"However, if they can only see their companions in your hand, it won't help much. True, maybe they will watch more closely than your partner and be able to remind him when a card is high.If talking to the cards appeals to you, get a copy of the entertaining book \"Right Through the Pack\" by Robert Darvas and Norman de Villiers Hart. It contains 52 tales, each told by a different card. The play in today's deal is narrated by East's spade jack.Against South's contract of three no-trump, West leads the heart five: eight, queen, king. Do you see how the spade jack might play a pivotal role?South did well not to bid three spades over two notrump, as the spade game would surely fail.With the heart suit wide open, South couldn't afford to lose the lead. He also knew it was better to risk one diamond finesse than two spade finesses. As you can see, East does have the diamond king. So South played a spade to dummy's ace and took the winning diamond finesse for nine easy tricks, right? Not quite! East, guessing this was the position, smoothly dropped the spade king under dummy's ace! Suddenly the situation had changed. Taking the spade king at face value, South played a club to his ace and ran the spade nine. However, East produced the jack and returned his last heart: down two.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Regulating the exact temperatures of both the oven and the meat are the secret.No. 2: Tie it, salt it. Tie the roast with white cotton string so it's compact and evenly shaped, and salt it well. Not a light sprinkling - at least 1 tablespoon.Don't be stingy. Rub it in well.No. 3: Wrap it up. Use plastic wrap to wrap it up tightly. Refrigerate for 24 hours.No. 4: Free it up. Remove the plastic wrap and place the roast in a roasting pan, uncovered.No. 5: Insert meat thermometer.Insert the thermometer so that the tip is about halfway through (in the middle).No. 6: Preheat oven to 250 F. Place the oven thermometer in the middle of the oven. You are going to rely on it, not the one that is built into the oven. This is critical.Once the temperature reaches 250 F on the oven thermometer, adjust the oven temperature dial to coincide so it doesn't heat up any hotter than 250 F.No. 7: Set roast in the oven. Leave the roast in the oven until its internal temperature is exactly 130 F.You will know because you left that meat thermometer inserted. Once it hits 130 F, remove the roast from the oven. Remove the meat thermometer.No. 8: Quickly wrap in foil. Once the roast is completely wrapped in foil, allow the meat to rest for exactly 20 minutes.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" COPYR IGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "When God lost patience with man, he sent a flood\n\n October 4, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Denzil Cheek | Page: 18 | Section: News \n \n 392\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Why did God send the flood, and why is it important to know about the days ofNoah?We need to know about it because it shows us the grace of God in the past and for the future. God created the human race and as time continued man's wickedness became great on the earth.There was a rapid spiritual decline after the first sin. Man's every imagination and his thoughts were evil, and the earth was filled with violence. They had no time for God until it was too late. It repented the Lord that he had made man and He said that He would destroy all of mankind from the face of the earth, but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord, and it was that grace that saved Noah and his family.God gave Noah the plans for building the ark, and when it was completed and loaded the Bible says that God shut the door. No one else could enter and everyone outside was lost. There was an end to God's patience.In Matthew 24:37-39 Jesus speaking says, \"But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the day before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the Ark, and knew not until the flood came and took them all away, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.\"Look around, at all the immorality, hate, evil and violence of our day, how can we not believe that the words ofJesus are true for us today, and that He will return. God's grace, mercy and love saved Noah and his family, and that is the only hope for us who are living today. If we die, or ifJesus returns, as He promised, God will shut the door again.We must confess our sins today and stop our sinful living and look to Jesus Christ, for He is our only Hope. There is coming a time in this world when there will be an end to God's patience again, with humanity, and that is why we need to know Jesus Christ as our personal savior today. This is why we need to know the truth today about why God set the flood. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

You should retain some flexibility in your thinking, though. Maybe you saw someone having an off day. Perhaps he had had a tough time in the office or at home. In today's deal, North's two diamonds was a cue-bid raise, showing a maximum pass with three-card support. (He would have advanced with two no-trump holding four or more spades.)With a rounded-suit lead, the defenders could have taken the first four tricks, but, following his partner's thin opening bid in diamonds, West understandably led that suit.South won East's diamond queen with his king and immediately drew two rounds of trumps. He could no longer make the contract. The simplest line is to cash the spade ace at trick two, play a diamond to dummy's ace, return to hand with a trump (\"Whew -- they're 2-2\") and discard one of dummy's club losers on the diamond jack. The later club ruff in the dummy will be South's 10 th trick.Was South a beginner? Far from it. He was playing in the final of the 1992 World Team Olympiad.Colette recommended: \"You will do foolish things, but do them with enthusiasm.\" However, this declarer wasn't too enthusiastic about his mistake. His only consolation was that his error cost less than it might have. His teammates, sitting East-West at the other table, had climbed to the Everestine heights of five diamonds. South had been happy to double, and the contract went down five, costing 1,100.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I wish I would have done that though. I would love to go back and read my thoughts from my college years, those early years of my marriage.For sure I'd look up the day I learned I was pregnant with our first son.I know I was excited. But how did we celebrate? Who did we tell first? Those are things I don't recall. I'd never thought of Everyday-Cheapskate.com as a personal journal, until recently when I found the following in the archive.I've had it. I'm out of words, clever phrases.I'm even running low on answers.For more than 15 years I've written a syndicated daily. There are 260 weekdays in a year, minimum 500 words a day. That's roughly 1,950,000 words.Over more than 30 years I've cranked out 356 issues of the various monthly now daily newsletters. That looks like north of 5,000,000 words.I have 26 published books averaging 50,000 words each. That's good for another 1,300,000 words.I'm going to post a sign on my forehead that reads: \"Services have been temporarily disrupted. We regret any inconvenience this may cause.We are hopeful that services will be restored soon.\" Maybe that will clear my cache, defrag my hard drive and get me back on the road.In the meantime, I'm going to take a nap.Well, I did take a nap, and a good, long one at that. And when I awoke, I was greeted by several responses. Some were long and pleading, others short and punchy. Basically, it all boiled down to this: \"Please, don't stop!\" followed by many warm messages of encouragement.My whole outlook changed. I was renewed and refreshed. And confident that maybe there are still a few more words left in me to be written.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" COPYR IGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

To a pugilist, it is a means to an end: the end of his opponent's resistance. (Why does anyone inflict physical pain on another, human or animal?) An Englishman might think of the humorous Punch magazine, long deceased. One of its former editors, Malcolm Muggeridge, defended his tenure by writing: \"Good taste and humor are a contradiction in terms.\" However, to a bridge player, \"punch\" is forcing declarer to ruff and lose trump control -- as in today's deal.After a straightforward auction, West has to choose a lead. Some would misguidedly select the singleton heart. They would argue that partner might have the ace (unlikely on this auction) or that partner might have the club jack as an entry and either the dummy or declarer might hold only a singleton club. However, if the latter is the position, there are only three defensive tricks: the spade ace, the club jack and one heart ruff.Much more sensible is to lead a top club and to continue leading club winners. After ruffing the third round, South plays a spade. Suppose West ducks this trick, to check South's spade length, and wins the next round with his ace. He forces declarer a second time with another club. This leaves the dummy and South with one spade each while West retains two. Whatever South does now, West must score a second trump trick -- and his fourth in all -- to defeat the contract.I suppose, if I weren't above that level of humor, I'd add that West had clubbed South to death.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

My neighbor, a gentleman in his 50s, saw me smoking a cigarette the other day and decided to take it upon himself to lecture me on the dangers of smoking.Although I appreciated his concern, his lecture was unwelcome. I intend to quit smoking at some point, but I don't need my neighbor to intervene. I fear that the next time I bump into him, he will give me another lecture. What can I do to make him understand that his unsolicited advice is not helping? I'm a grown adult, and I don't need lectures. - Good IntentionsDEAR GOOD INTENTIONS: As you know, your neighbor expressed his concerns out of genuine care for you. Remember that when you speak to him. It is your right to do whatever you want with your life and your body. Provided that the cigarette smoke is not contaminating your neighbors' air, you should be able to smoke in peace.That said, it is likely that this man will either say something or scowl at you the next time he sees a cigarette in your hand. Can you say something?Yes, but be careful. You can thank him for his concern, but put up a guardrail. Tell him you know what you are doing. When you decide to quit, you will. Politely ask him to refrain from giving you advice on this topic in the future.Harriette Cole is a lifestylist andfounder of Dream Leapers, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

At the edge of the Sinai desert, with sand and stones stretching as far as the eye can see, there is a sign announcing \"Free Parking.\" In today's deal, I would point out that the six-spade contract appears to depend on the heart finesse, but that is too obvious. Ideally, one would like to make the contract even if that finesse is losing. However, you knew that already. How did the declarer play after West had led the club queen?North's sequence, a transfer bid of two hearts followed by a jump to four diamonds, showed a slam-try with at least six spades and at most one diamond (a splinter bid).South bid what he thought he could make.Declarer won the opening lead with dummy's club ace, cashed the spade ace, played a club to his king and ruffed a club high in the dummy.After a spade to South's king had removed the opponents' trumps, declarer ruffed his last club.I know you've seen the key play coming for some time, but just in case, now declarer called for dummy's diamond and finessed his jack.West won with the queen but was endplayed. He had to concede three side-suit tricks: either two hearts and one diamond on a heart return into declarer's A-Q tenace; or one heart and two diamonds on a diamond return into declarer's A-10 tenace.The transfer bid did its job. If North declares in six spades, East will surely lead the heart jack, which kills the contract.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If you are or have ever been plagued by credit card debt, I can nearly guarantee that revolving expenses related to Christmas have contributed greatly to that miserable situation.Face it: When it comes to Christmas preparations, the longer you wait, the more you'll spend. The opposite is also true: The sooner you get started, the less you'll spend.Don't wait. Do something now.START SAVINGI get that not all of us are into Christmas shopping any other time than December. It just doesn't feel right. What you can do now is get diligent with creating a healthy cash stash so you have the money to do that come December.Stash $50 a week starting now.BOOK TRAVELWe're learning that the ongoing Boeing 737 Max grounding is going to affect holiday travel, and not in a good way. Southwest Airlines opened its booking calendar for flights in December much earlier than usual. And by the looks things, lots of flights are already sold out. Now's the time to book any holiday travel you have in mind.Southwest allows the cost of a canceled flight to be applied toward future travel and doesn't charge a fee to change flights. The airline is currently waiving fare differences for customers who need to change a trip because of the extended schedule disruption.FAMILY PHOTOWhether it's for your family Christmas card or a framed gift for friends and family, now's a great time to take that photo. You'll have plenty of time to shop around for the best price on high-quality prints. Check out Costco, Snap fish and Vistaprint for great prices.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One of the most reliable is that if one side is playing on a suit, it is wrong for the other side to play on it too.Today's deal is a straightforward example.West leads his fourthhighest heart against three no-trump. This gives declarer seven top tricks: two spades, one heart, three diamonds and one club. Assuming no 4-0 diamond split, two more tricks are readily available in diamonds. Or are they? Look at the spots. If the diamonds break 3-1, declarer will have to win the fourth round in his hand. With no dummy entry, the fifth diamond trick shrivels and dies like an earthworm on a hot pavement.However, South spotted a possibility. After winning the first trick with dummy's heart nine, he cashed the diamond queen and ace.West's club discard was a blow, but now declarer led the heart king.You see the idea behind this play. South knew West had started with at most five hearts, because West had led the five and declarer could see the three and four. South hoped that West would cash at least one more heart trick, on which the declarer would discard the blocking diamond seven or nine.However, West knew that if South thought it was right for North-South to play on hearts, it had to be wrong for East-West to do so too. West won with the heart ace and immediately switched to a spade.This condemned the contract. When declarer lost a trick in another suit, the defenders cashed their hearts. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pumpkin is good year-round, not just the fall\n\n October 11, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 4A | Section: News \n \n 1077\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Signs of fall are everywhere. and the great pumpkin seems to be leading the way in decorating, drink flavors and recipes. Today I have some new and old pumpkin recipes for you to try. And yes, my pumpkins are displayed outside accompanied by several fall mums and a fall flag on the pole.Now let's get in the kitchen. The recipe will decide if I use canned pumpkin or a fresh cleaned and chopped pumpkin. I usually use canned pumpkin and keep different size cans in the food pantry for year round baking.Pumpkins are not a seasonal food as in the past. Remember \"back in the day\" when pumpkin was a Halloween and Thanksgiving food item and mincemeat, and cranberries were all seasonal foods?Most people still do traditional food items for certain holidays, but most of the world now eats what they want when they want.The name pumpkin comes from the Greek word \"pepo\". meaning \"large melon.\"Pumpkins are a fruit (they contain seeds), but when it comes to cooking, they are often referred to as vegetables. The largest pumpkin ever grown was recorded in 2021 and weighed in at 2,72.9 pounds, over 1.5 billion pounds of pumpkin are produced every year. Give this family favorite a try.PUMPKIN PANCAKESWhisk 1/4 cup pumpkin puree with 1 egg until smooth. Add in 1 cup milk, 1 cup flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice and a pinch of nutmeg. Whisk all ingredients together until real smooth. Using a large spoon drop batter onto a hot greased griddle or fry pan and cook on both sides until done. serve hot with butter and syrup.BROWN SUGAR PUMPKIN SPICE PUMPKIN SEEDS2 cups raw pumpkin seeds (from 1 large pumpkin), 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, pinch of kosher salt. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F.Place the pumpkin seeds in a colander and rinse away all the pulp and stringy stuff.Spread the seeds out on a rimmed baking sheet and roast until dried out, 30 to 45 minutes.Toss the pumpkin seeds with the sugar, butter, pumpkin pie spice and salt in a medium bowl until evenly coated. Return the seeds to the baking sheet, spread them out and roast until dry, about 35 minutes. Let cool, then break up into pieces before serving.BARBECUE PUMPKIN SEEDS1 pumpkin, Olive oil for tossing, Kosher salt, Brown sugar, Chipotle chile powder, ground cumin. Preheat the oven to 300¢ª F.Using a spoon, scrape the pulp and seeds out of your pumpkin into a bowl. Separate the seeds from the stringy pump, rinse the seeds in a colander under cold water, then shake dry. Don't blot with paper towels; the seeds will stick. Spread the seeds in a single layer on an oiled baking sheet and roast for 30 minutes to dry them out. Toss the seeds with olive oil, salt, brown sugar, chile powder and cumin. Return to the oven and bake until crisp and golden, about 20 more minutes.BAKED PUMPKIN DOUGHNUTS2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, one 15-ounce can pumpkin puree, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/3 cup vegetable oil, 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 3 large eggs.TOPPING: 3/4 cup sugar, 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, 3 tablespoons unsalted butter melted. For the doughnuts: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Whisk the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder and salt together in a medium bowl. Beat the pumpkin puree, sugar, vegetable oil, butter, vanilla and eggs and together in another large bowl until smooth. Add the flour mixture to the pumpkin mixture and beat until just combined. Fill three 6-cup nonstick doughnut pans with the batter so that each mold is almost full. Smooth the tops with a moistened finger.Bake the doughnuts until a wooden pick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Invert the doughnuts onto a cooling rack. For the topping: Stir the sugar and cinnamon together in a shallow bowl. Working one at a time, brush the doughnuts all over with butter, then dip them in the cinnamon sugar to coat. Serve warm or at room temperature.PUMPKIN PIE PARFAITS13 gingersnaps, chocolate wafers or graham crackers, 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted, 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, 1/2 cup canned pure pumpkin, 2 1/2 teaspoons bourbon, pinch of freshly grated nutmeg, 1/2 cup white chocolate chips, 2 cups cold heavy cream.Put seven cookies in a resealable plastic bag and crush into crumbs with a heavy pan. Brush the bottoms and about 1 inch up the sides of six parfait glasses with the butter. Add a spoonful of crumbs to each and roll them around the insides of the glasses; pour out the excess crumbs and reserve for topping. Refrigerate the prepared glasses.Put 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar, the pumpkin, 1 1/2 teaspoons bourbon and the nutmeg in a food processor. Pulse until smooth, about 1 minute. Put the white chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave at 50% power until melted, about 1 minute, stirring halfway. Add to the pumpkin mixture and process until combined.Transfer to a large bowl. Beat 1/12 cups cream in a bowl with a mixer until soft peaks form; fold into the pumpkin mixture until smooth. Divide among the prepared glasses and refrigerate until ready to serve.Beat the remaining 1/2 cup cream with a mixer until foamy. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar and 1 teaspoon bourbon and beat until soft peaks form. Top the parfaits with the whipped cream, reserved cookie crumbs and the remaining six cookies.This next recipe is one of my daughter in law Shannon, and has become one our families favorites, plus it is healthy.PUMPKIN SPICE PROTEIN MUFFINS WITH BUTTERSCOTCH CHIPS1 cup old fashioned rolled oats, 1 cup pumpkin puree, 1 cup Greek yogurt, 2 large eggs, 1/2 packed cup vanilla flavored protein powder, 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, pinch of sea salt, 1/2 cup butterscotch chips. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Add the oats to a blender or food processor and process until a flour forms (15-20 seconds). Add the pumpkin, Greek yogurt, eggs, protein powder, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt and blend again until well combined.Stir in the butterscotch chips. Pour into 12 greased muffin liners. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. 25 minutes will be a little moist while 30 minutes won't be as moist.

The exact dilution ratio will depend on the severity of the smoke film and soot, but a common starting point is 1 part Lestoil to 4 parts water.Adjust as needed.Before using Lestoil on the entire affected area, it's a good practice to test the solution in a small, inconspicuous spot to ensure it doesn't damage or discolor the surface. Wait a few minutes to observe any adverse reactions.Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for Lestoil, and again, please exercise caution when using it on delicate or painted surfaces.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"DebtProof Living.\"COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Outside Shop Abbey in Cumbria, northern England, was a sign reading, \"Admission free. Special terms for parties.\" In bridge, one deal can provide variety. The opening lead may be pivotal. For example, in today's deal, how would you plan the play in six spades if West has led either a club or a trump?Two no-trump was the Jacoby Forcing Raise. South's three-no-trump rebid showed 15-17 points but denied a singleton or void.North control-bid the club ace. South used Blackwood twice, learning that two kings were missing.After a club lead, declarer is in trouble. He must draw trumps, cash the heart king and take a heart finesse. If it loses, the contract dies.However, if the finesse wins, South cashes dummy's heart ace. If the suit breaks 3-3, declarer's club loser disappears on the 13th heart, and he tries the diamond finesse for an overtrick. If the hearts are 4-2, the diamond finesse must win.On a trump lead, though, South has some flexibility.After drawing trumps, it is right to take an immediate diamond finesse. If it loses, declarer must bring in four heart tricks, playing West for queen-third. But if, as in the given layout, the diamond finesse wins, South needs only three heart tricks for his contract. It is time for a safety play. Declarer cashes dummy's heart ace, plays a heart to his king and leads a heart back toward dummy's jack. This maximizes the chance of three heart tricks.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wodehouse wrote, \"Judges, as a class, display, in the matter of arranging alimony, that reckless generosity which is found only in men who are giving away someone else's cash.\" Well, on today's deal, you be the judge. South was the husband, North his wife - and, yes, they are still married.After an auction in which neither side knew who could make what, South ended in four spades doubled. West led a heart to his partner's king. East switched to the club six. Declarer won with his ace, unblocked the diamond king, ruffed a heart in the dummy and discarded a club on dummy's diamond ace. He then cashed the club king and ruffed the club four in hand. However, disaster struck when West overruffed.A moment later, when East got in with the spade ace, another club lead promoted West's spade queen as the setting trick.\"How unlucky can I be?\" asked South. \"Why should East have five clubs and only one spadeft\" \"You misplayed,\" replied North. \"There is no hurry to discard your club loser. After winning trick two with the club ace, ruff a heart in the dummy, play a diamond to your king and ruff your last heart. Then lead dummy's third trump.\" South judged his wife was right. With her line, everything is as much under control as it can be. If East plays low on the trump, South puts up the king, East being marked with the ace from the auction. Here, though, East wins with the ace and returns a club to dummy's king. South discards his remaining club on the diamond ace and loses only one more trump trick. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Attached to a high-tension electricity pylon in Massachusetts was a board stating: \"To climb this structure means instant death. Anyone found doing so will be prosecuted.\" In bridge you can commit suicide but remain alive and unprosecuted - except perhaps by your partner. It is your contract that dies.South is in three no-trump.West leads the heart five: two, queen, king. How should South continue?When in no-trump, declarer must count his top tricks first. Here he has seven: two spades, three diamonds, one club and one heart (given the lead). He needs two more tricks, which can obviously come from the clubs. However, taking the club finesse at trick two electrocutes South. East wins with the king and returns his remaining heart - down one.Better is to lead the club queen to tempt a cover, but then to win with dummy's ace. Maybe East has the singleton club king. Also, if the club finesse is working, you don't need to take it because West cannot hurt you.However, here, whichever line you choose, the contract dies. Let's go back to trick one. Assuming West's heart five is his fourth highest, when East plays the queen, you can place the ace with West. So, the only risk to your contract is the given layout. As you are never getting more than one heart trick, just play low from your hand at trick one. Give East the trick with his queen. The defenders' communications are cut, and your contract is safe. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In nearly 32 years, I cannot recall a single time I've heard from a bride or groom who wished they'd spent more money on their wedding. The best wedding mail comes from brides who are so happy with their frugal choices they want to share their ideas with others.Our first guest list included everyone we knew.As the list grew (and grew), we realized that would be a really bad idea. Without intending to do so, we got very close to inviting people who would then feel obligated to attend a wedding for people they didn't really know that well. We decided to whittle that list, seeing our wedding as a more intimate event rather than a big everyone-we-know blowout.From where we started, we cut the list by 75%. That was the best decision ever.Our wedding was manageable, affordable and exactly what we wanted - an intimate celebration of joy. - Debbie When I worked in a bridal shop in Florida, we bought all our jewelry, gloves, veils and most headpieces wholesale from Accessory Wholesale in New Orleans. The company's website is open to the public (awnol.com/). For my own wedding, I bought all my bridesmaid's jewelry sets, bracelets, headpieces, gloves and jewelry - all for about $100, including shipping.That site rocks. And I swear this is the same stuff we bought, displayed in our lighted cases on black velvet, and sold for five to eight times the wholesale price.Because this is a wholesale company, there is a minimum order requirement of $75. - Kelly Don't be afraid of asking to borrow. If you know of someone who recently had a wedding, inquire about borrowing some of their stuff.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But this is a first - a horrible weed infestation called Creeping Charlie has taken over the lawn.I have tried weed killers, but nothing I've tried has worked to kill the entire weed down to the roots. I look at my neighbor's lawn and see it growing there, too. Do you have a recommendation that would take care of Creeping Charlie without killing the grass?Thanks. - Beth Dear Beth: Oh, my, I am laughing quietly as I read your letter. When I was a newlywed, my neighbor and I actually shared Creeping Charlie cuttings and grew them in pots to adorn our apartments. We thought we were prolific \"gardeners\" because our plants grew, well like weeds!Hand-pulling Creeping Charlie, making sure to get every smidgen of that rhizome (root) is one way to stop a very early invasion. And there is a lot of room for error there, which means using this as a punishment for misbehaved kids might not be such a great idea.The only herbicide I can confidently recommend to win this war is T-Zone Turf Herbicide (1.2 ounces per gallon of water). You can find this on Amazon, perhaps at your local home improvement center, or local garden store. T-Zone Turf Herbicide is a broadleaf herbicide, which means that when applied carefully and according to label instructions and warnings, it will kill Mr. Creepy but leave your lawn intact.You will need a good sprayer that matches the size of your project. A backpack-type power sprayer would likely be a good investment for you and your neighbor to share.I wish you well with waging war against this creepy lawn invader.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\"COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Comediennes make quips about husbands. We can relate to them because they are so close to the truth.Zsa Zsa Gabor lent her own style when she said, \"I'm a marvelous housekeeper.Every time I leave a man, I keep his house.\" In bridge, you have to be careful to keep your tricks.If you have a winner in one hand, you must have an entry to that hand - or be able to force an opponent to lead the suit for you.Today's auction was tricky.What should North do over West's three-spade opening? Pass is cowardly.Three no-trump is brilliant or foolhardy, depending on the result. Four clubs is one-dimensional. Double is the most flexible action, but dangerous.Over the double, South might pass for penalties, but that is risky with such poor spades. (He can get 800 for down three.) He could try three no-trump, but that suffers from the same drawback. Four hearts is the normal bid.West starts with three rounds of spades, declarer ruffing the last high in the dummy. East discards three diamonds. South draws trumps, reducing the deal to no-trump. Now it looks superficially attractive to continue with the club ace and another club. However, against the bad break, the contract dies. East wins two club tricks to go with the two spade tricks already in the defenders' bag.The correct play is a low club to dummy's jack. (If West has the singleton king, tough!) The ace must be kept as the entry to the spade jack. Declarer's 10 tricks are one spade, four hearts, two diamonds, two clubs and one spade ruff in the dummy. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I first cut off the used edges to make new edges, then I decided to cut the sponges into thirds when they're new. Much more efficient.-SueIf you are taking salad for lunch, pour the amount of dressing you will need into the bottom corner of a small plastic bag. Put a twist tie above the dressing and cut off the rest of the bag. When you are ready to eat, just snip off the corner and squeeze the dressing into your salad. - KristineMy toddler eats only a small portion of a box of macaroni and cheese. Leftover mac and cheese is never a hit, and the individual packs are too pricy. Instead, I buy the boxes when they are on sale, open every box and store the cheese powder and noodles in separate jars. Now, I can prepare individual servings as needed. I use ½ cup of dry noodles and 1 heaping tablespoon each of cheese powder, butter and milk.-MichelTo get rid of mineral rings in the toilet, put some warm water in the toilet bowl and add one or two denture tablets. Check its progress in 30 minutes. The toilet should be sparkling clean. - AmyI save water by washing my car using the dew in the early morning. The condensation on my car plus the suds on my sponge do the trick. Only after the scrub-down do I turn on the hose for a quick rinse.-HelenMary Hunt is thefounder ofEverydayCheapskate.com, afrugal living blog, and the author of the book Debt-ProofLiving. \"COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She does amazing work on my hair, and I have no interest in finding a new stylist anytime soon.However, every time I am around her, I cannot help but notice her bad body odor. It has become so bad that I find myself holding my breath at certain points during the session. She had to be on set with me for a photoshoot recently, and I know the other people in the room could smell her.I don't want to hurt her feelings or embarrass her, but at the same time, I cannot ignore this any longer.What should I do? - Sensitive to Smells DEAR SENSITIVE TO SMELLS: While it will feel awkward in the moment, telling your friend about her body odor is actually a gift to her.There's no way that you are the first person who has noticed her odor. If she is unable to check it, she may at best lose clients and at worst lose her job.When you do hair, you stand in close proximity to others all day long. Personal hygiene is paramount, especially in roles that bring people into each other's intimate space.Speak to your stylist privately.Tell her what you have noticed and why it is important.Suggest that she figure out what her issue is - it could be medical or basic hygiene. Admit that as much as you like working with her, the odor may require you to find a new stylist.Harriette Cole is a lifestylist and founder of Dreamleapers, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

As an integral part of life? Or like Jean Cocteau, who said, \"We must believe in luck.For how else can we explain the success of those we don't like?\" In today's deal, if you play well, you will win 10 tricks.If you don't, you won't!Against your contract of four hearts, West leads the club four: queen, eight, five.How would you continue?North's bid of three hearts was questionable. With such a good club suit, he should have raised to three no-trump. If he had, South probably would have gone down!In four hearts, declarer won the first trick and naively assumed that West had led from the 4-3 doubleton. At trick two, South finessed the heart queen. Then he cashed the ace, luckily dropping East's king. Declarer drew West's last trump and led his remaining club. When West discarded a spade, South let out an audible groan. There was no way to recover and win 10 tricks.At another table, South started the same way: club queen, heart to the queen, heart ace. However, now he led his remaining club. West wasn't fooled. South could have drawn the last trump, so it couldn't be right to ruff.West discarded a spade; once more, down one.As West had surely led a singleton, the right play at trick two was a low spade from the dummy, planning to insert the nine. Declarer must organize a spade ruff in the dummy as his 10th trick. (If East plays an honor, South wins with his ace and continues with the spade 10, hoping that West must win the trick.) Later, when the heart king tumbles in two rounds, declarer receives a coconut - not a cigar today! ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You lead from an ace-king holding. Instantly it is clear that you can take a second trick in the suit. However, if you do, you will establish dummy's queen as a winner for the declarer. Do you take the second trick before the rodents get at it, or do you wait, hoping the trick doesn't evaporate?Although one example proves little, usually the right play is the one that worked on this deal from a team match.Defending against four spades, both Wests led the heart ace. For the losing team, West cashed his second heart winner, hoping his partner had started with a singleton. At trick three, he switched to a low diamond, when a club would have been much more successful. The declarer won with dummy's ace and, in case East had all three trumps, led the heart queen. East ruffed, and South overruffed. Declarer drew two rounds of trumps ending on the board and discarded one club loser on the heart jack: plus 620.At the other table, West switched to a low diamond at trick two. (I wonder if he considered leading the king.) The declarer misguessed. He won with dummy's ace and played for West to have the club ace: minus 100.In general, don't establish tricks for the opponents. Try to establish your own. first.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATEDISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATIONFOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I can't think of a better way to do that than with fresh, homemade pumpkin puree - the star of the show in so many fall recipes.HOMEMADE PUMPKIN PUREE RECIPEIngredients:2 whole small pumpkins Directions:With a sharp knife, cut off the tops of the pumpkins, right below the stem, and throw that top part into the garbage.Next, cut the pumpkins in half. Scrape the seeds and stringy insides using a big spoon or even an ice cream scoop. Place the seeds in a bowl to roast later (yum!), and toss the pulp and strings into the garbage. Repeat until all the pumpkin halves are cleaned out.Cut each of the halves into a couple of wedges.Lay a piece of parchment paper on a large sheet pan (cookie sheet). Spread out the pumpkin wedges on the pan, skin up or skin down - it doesn't matter. Place the pan in the oven and set to 350 F. Roast for about 45 minutes, or until the pumpkin pieces are fork-tender (very soft). Remove from the oven.Allow the pumpkin pieces to cool sufficiently so that you can handle them safely. Pull or scrape the skin from the pumpkin meat using a knife. Toss the skins into the garbage.Place a few chunks of roasted, skinned pumpkin into a food processor. Pulse small batches of pumpkin until totally smooth. (Add a tablespoon of water if it seems too dry to get it smooth. Too watery? Strain it through a fine mesh strainer to get rid of some of it.) As you complete a batch, pour it into a bowl, then continue until all the pumpkin has been pureed.A blender will work, too, but you may need to add a bit ofwater to produce a smooth puree. No food processor or blender? No worries. You can mash it up with a potato masher, or force it through a potato ricer or even a food mill.Mary Hunt is thefounder ofEverydayCheapskate.com, afrugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living. \"COPYRIGHT 2023CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "42nd Ewing dinner auction funds Chesterwye mission\n\n October 23, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Doug Bishop; dbishop@chespub.com | Page: 4 | Section: News \n \n 510\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Earlier this month, the 42nd annual Thomas J. Ewing Dinner Auction was held to benefit Chester-wye, the longtime center to provide care for adults with developmental disabilities. The event was again hosted at the Kent Island Volunteer Fire Department.Event Co-Chair Wheeler Baker welcomed those who attended the Oct. 14 event, thanking the many dedicated attendees and sponsors of the event. Auction donations will go to support critically needed renovation of two of the Chester-wye houses, the Ewing and Nash Houses, noted Baker, \"The project will include wheelchair accessible living spaces, new kitchens, wheelchair friendly baths, all customized for individuals with developmental disabilities.\"Baker also thanked the KIVFD for graciously hosting the event for so many years. Music for the event was provided by the Guthrie Matthews Method Band.The printed program provided a brief history of Chesterwye - originated through the efforts of Bobby Ann and Stuart Nash, who had a little boy, \"Chip\", with Down syndrome. With laser focus, Bobby Ann pushed the county to provide a place where young and older adults with disabilities could be cared for and learn to live life as fully as possible. Chesterwye was the result.Following the meal of steak and crab cakes, catered by Chesapeake Celebrations, county commissioner Jim Moran spoke briefly. \"For over 57 years the Chesterwye has provided homes and support for individuals with developmental disabilities,\" he said, noting, \"Chesterwye was the first organizations in Maryland to provide personalized housing, 'forever homes', as alternative to institutions of the day.\" Moran also recognized the late Thomas J. Ewing as one of the founders, donating land where the Ewing house now stands.Kay Ewing Maloney, owner of the former famed \"Holly's Restaurant\" in Grasonville, was the guest speaker. Her late father, Thomas J. Ewing, for whom the dinner-auction is named, founded the restaurant in the early 1950s. It became a landmark for both locals and travelers to the Eastern Shore until is was eventually sold a few years ago.Recounting some of Chesterwye's history, Maloney emphasized, \"Remember, we're here to raise money for Chester-wye, which is a great organization! All of the funds raised go directly back to Chesterwye, for it's upkeep and mission.\"Any one of us could have been born with such disabilities, shared Baker, \"But by the grace of God, there go I,\" reminder enough, he said, to help those who need help.A highlight of the fundraiser - a live auction - was conducted by Jeff Heisey, of Atlantic Auctioneers, Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Beach condo vacations were among those items, as well as baskets of cheer, and a semi-automatic shotgun that sold for $2,700. But the top item sold was a bobble head replica of Snoop Dogg, that went for $5,000. The total from the items sold was $21,300. \n \n Caption: PHOTO BY DOUG BISHOP\n \nCenterpiece of the 42nd Annual Thomas J.Ewing Dinner Auction, the legendary Walnut Cake, originally made by the late Mrs. Florence Howard, beginning in 1979.\n \nPHOTO BY DOUG BISHOP\n \nFrom the left; Chestetrwye 42nd Thomas J.

Some days, it's bulging; other days, not so much. But every day, your messages of support, love and occasionally a great tip charge my batteries and confirm how much we need one another. Enjoy the following tips from your fellow readers.I make my own frozen coffee drinks, better than the ones that cost so much money. It all starts with frozen coffee cubes, which I make from the flavored coffee of my choice and freeze in ice cube trays. That's the secret. Most recipes call for adding things to cold coffee and then blending with ice. But the ice can water it down. Starting with frozen coffee means there's no need for ice to make it cold. My favorite recipe is frozen coffee cubes, hazelnut or caramel syrup, chocolate milk or powder, light cream or milk, and a little sugar (I like mine sweet). Blend until smooth. Yummy. I keep a zip-type bag full of coffee cubes in my freezer. - LoriSince it's not recommended to put your home address in your GPS, because in the event your car is stolen, you've just offered them your house as well, I've set my \"home\" address as my local police station. I figure if a thief is dumb enough to think they can steal a car, they'll be dumb enough to pull into the police station. If my car is ever stolen, I'll tell the police to monitor their parking lot. While I don't know if it would actually work, I'd have the story of stories if it did. And, by the way, I do know the way home from the police station. - TimFor those buying their wine in a box, when you think it's empty, take the \"bladder\" out, and you will find at least one more glass of wine inside. - MargaretMary Hunt is thefounder ofEverydayCheapskate.com, afrugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living. \"COPYRIGHT 2023CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You must pass a fairly easy test of your driving, chipping and putting.Should we do the same in bridge, setting players leaving beginners' classes a few simple bidding, declarerplay and defense problems?If so, do you think today's deal would be slightly too difficult for the test, or just right? West leads the club queen against your four-heart contract. How would you plan the play?There are three passes and South opens one heart. Should West pass, double or bid two clubs?Most inexperienced players bid two clubs. However, I think that is the third-best choice. With such soft values opposite a partner who couldn't even open in third position, there is a good case for passing. Especially in a pair event, though, you should strive to contest the partscore. Note that a takeout double gives you three chances to find a fit, whereas two clubs will probably lock you into that suit.Playing in four hearts, South must not win trick one with dummy's club king and lead a trump. With this layout, the contract can then be defeated, South losing one spade, two hearts and one diamond. It is right to win in hand with the club ace and immediately lead the diamond jack. If West wins with the ace and continues clubs, you discard two spade losers on dummy's diamond royals, play a trump to the ace and another trump.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Experience is recognizing that you have made the same mistake for a second time.Of course, ideally we compress education and experience into one, never making the same mistake twice. However, in the real world, it happens; and it is especially frustrating when it occurs at the bridge table.North's two-no-trump response showed at least a limit raise in spades with four or more trumps. (North would have cue-bid three hearts with only three-card spade support.) South, despite being worried about his heart holding, took a shot at the vulnerable game.West started with three rounds of hearts, East echoing to show his doubleton.South, who had seen the high-low also, was in a dilemma. Should he ruff with dummy's spade 10, hoping West had the jack? Or should he ruff with the queen, hoping the spade jack would drop in one or two rounds? Of course, if South had a trump loser, maybe East would have the club queen, so that South's diamond loser could be discarded on dummy's club ace. Which way should South have gone?As the experienced among you will know, declarer shouldn't ruff high or low. He should discard one of dummy's low diamonds. Then, as long as the trumps aren't 4-0, the contract is under control.Suppose West switches to a diamond. Declarer wins with dummy's ace and draws trumps. Then he ruffs his diamond loser in the dummy, when there is no risk of an overruff.As Mark Twain said, \"The principle of give and take is the principle of diplomacy - give one and take 10.\"©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Did I get scammed?- EarlDearEarl: I don't know if I'd call it getting scammed, but you've definitely experienced the old bait and switch.They drew you in with promises of a low-interest rate, got you to apply, and when they decided you didn't qualify for the better deal, they made the switch.These days, only people with good to excellent credit scores - typically above 740 - will get those low advertised rates. If you have a lower score, your application will be rejected, or you'll be offered a card with a higher interest rate.EXTENDED WARRANTIES FAVOR RETAILERSDear Mary: My son works for a large home improvement store. He said that because planned obsolescence is even worse than 20 years ago, buying extended warranties on products is now important. I have always disagreed, thinking they are a rip-off, preying on customer fears.My son purchased two warranties within the last five years on two major brand appliances and had to use both. Do you think he's right? Should we consider buying extended warranties? - LynnDear Lynn: It's a matter of dollars and sense, no pun intended.I cannot say that an extended warranty is a bad deal in every situation. But we have to deal with the law of averages.Never forget this: Sales commissions on extended warranties are quite handsome. Why do you think that is? It's because extended warranties are a huge profit maker for retailers. They give salespeople a big incentive (commission) to sell them.Got a question? You can send it to: DearMary@everydaycheapskate.com. Then keep your eyes open.

I found a small apartment that's in a great location and have been really good at budgeting.Despite his complaints, I decided to try and keep a positive attitude and continue to tour him around the city. I don't want our relationship to be strained, and I want him to see that I'm doing well here.How can I address my dad's negativity and help him see the positive side of my new life in San Franciscoft - Crack a Smile DEAR CRACK A SMILE: Choose the positive.Thank your Dad for coming to visit you and spending time together. Tell him how much you appreciate his effort. Then move on to recapping what you like about your life as you are establishing independence as a young adult.You can leave it at that, or, if you feel so inclined, you can remind him that you are budgeting well in an expensive city. You are enjoying the beauty that the city has to offer, meeting new people and building your life.Your father does not have to love your city, your home or anything else about your life. Just know that his complaints probably are based on his love for you and his knee-jerk reaction to protect you. He may only see that he would find it hard to live there.

Today's deal reminds me of this. It is one of my favorite teaching deals because inexperienced players have trouble believing that \"length before strength\" is valid. They would much prefer to bid an A-K-Q suit than a 6-5-4-3-2 suit.After a predictable first round to the auction, many Souths would pass, refusing to bid a suit as weak as 5-4-3-2. This South, though, knew that any four-card suit is biddable.West applied some pressure with a preemptive raise to three hearts, but he should have bid four hearts with a known 10-card fit. Vulnerability is for children! However, North had sufficient distribution to justify his three-spade bid. Now South showed true courage, raising himself to game. Note that four spades is the only game contract with any chance of success.South won the heart lead (luckily not the club 10!) with his ace and immediately played a trump. East won and led a top heart, forcing the dummy to ruff. However, declarer happily played another round of spades.When they broke 3-2, the contract was under control.Declarer played on diamonds until an opponent ruffed in, losing only three trump tricks.True, it is easier on the nerves to have longer and stronger trumps than these. Still, if you enjoy a three-card majority and the opponents' trumps are dividing 3-2, which they will more than two-thirds of the time, the contract will usually be playable. The many dwarfs will overpower the few giants. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It seems like everything comes so easily to her, and it's hard for me not to compare our paths.Recently, my friend received a $10,000 scholarship for a study abroad program in Japan and landed an internship at one of the top investment banking firms in the United States. She applied to only one internship and only one scholarship, and things fell into place effortlessly. It's as if a fairy comes in every night while she's sleeping and throws magic pixie dust at her to make everything work out. Meanwhile, I feel like I have to fight tooth and nail just to make half as much progress. Every day is a continuous struggle to accomplish the goals that I have. I try hard to be positive, but obstacles pop up constantly. How can I deal with these feelings of envy and move forward with a more upbeat outlook on life? - Jealous DEAR JEALOUS: It is understandable that you would be envious of your friend for what appears to be an easy life. As you also know, it is toxic to dwell on what other people have. No good will come out of that longing. Instead, you must focus on yourself. Do your best to view your life as your perfect challenge. You are gaining resilience as you live through each experience.Claim your small victories.To keep on track, create a vision board. Look through magazines and newspapers for images that reflect the things you want for your life. Cut them out. Brainstorm words and ideas that represent your dreams.Write them down. Next, on a large piece of cardboard or paper, place the images and words together. Make a simple art piece out of this collection of ideas to create your vision board. When thoughts creep in about your friend's success - or anyone else's - wish them well and pivot back to planning your own life. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is called experience.Take, for example, today's deal, which I spotted in a magazine. According to the author, many declarers at a tournament missed the best play. Unfortunately, so did the author!In the modern tournament game, North could rebid a forcing two spades. However, if your two-over-one response may be made with only 10 or 11 points, you must jump to three spades on the second round to force to game.If the defenders begin with one heart and two club tricks (in any order), followed by a third club from East, South has a nasty guess. Why, though, should West lead a club (or the heart king)?Many Wests led a trump, which ran to South's seven.Apparently, the unsuccessful declarers immediately played off four rounds of diamonds, discarding three hearts and ruffing the last in the dummy. They cashed the spade ace and led a heart off the dummy. However, East won with the ace, gave his partner a diamond overruff and collected two club tricks to defeat the contract.The writer recommends ruffing the diamond six at trick two. Then he cashes dummy's last top trump and leads a heart. However, if East has the nerve to play low, West can win with the king and switch to clubs.The third round of clubs promotes West's spade jack as the fourth defensive trick.Attacking clubs immediately works, but an expert would almost subconsciously lead the heart queen from hand at trick two, opening communications. Given the initial spade lead, now no defense can cause problems. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You're about to learn that when it comes to selling a house, you can judge a book by its cover. Some call it curb appeal. I call it the little things that get potential buyers through the front door, and that's what matters most.If you have a limited budget - and these days, who doesn't? - here are home improvements to help you sell your house for the highest price.Refresh the landscape. Spread new mulch in flower beds and around the base of trees. Lay down new sod; swap out failing bushes with fresh ones. Introduce color, either in the flower beds or with potted flowers. Even a small touch can make such a big difference.Spruce up the entrance. Invest in a new front door or give the current one a fresh coat of paint. Make sure the porch is immaculately clean. If your house number and mailbox appear worn, consider replacing them.Swap your light fixtures and plumbing fixtures. If yours are no longer in style, change them out. Let your local home improvement store be your guide for what is most popular now. Updating old ceiling lights and bathroom faucets can give your home a modern look without breaking the bank.Clarify space to clear up confusion. Make sure to fix any areas that might leave potential buyers puzzled. If you have an unusual alcove, consider adding a desk or a dresser to show how the space can be utilized most effectively. Many homes have quirks or issues that can be fixed visually, so don't leave potential buyers wondering.It goes without saying, but let me say it anyway: You won't get a second chance to make a first impression!Mary Hunt is the founder ofEverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living. \" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If you think someone is following you, make four right turns, which will in essence have you driving in a circle.If that suspicious car makes the same turns, immediately drive to the nearest police station, busy store, or service station to seek help. - TomDECALS, STICKERSRemove a decal or any type of sticker by first softening the adhesive with a hair dryer. Use a medium heat setting for a few seconds until the adhesive softens and the sticker starts to peel. Continue with the heat until the entire sticker peels off easily. - BarbCLUTCH FIRSTOn standard or manual-shift cars, get into the habit of always pushing in the clutch before starting the engine, regardless of whether the car is in gear. Besides being an obvious safety practice, holding the clutch in while starting the engine lets it turn over just a bit more easily, lessening the power required from the battery and starter motor. - BradIVORYTo clean anything ivory, like piano keys or carved objects, wipe with a solution of 1 tablespoon hydrogen peroxide and 1 cup water. No need to rinse. - SherylONE BITE AT A TIMESet aside 15 minutes each day to clean one area of your house.

Most players get it wrong. Without peeking at the East-West hands, how would you play the club suit for at most one loser in notrump?North's sequence showed four hearts, at least five clubs and game-going values or more. He announced the \"or more\" when leaping to six no-trump on round three.South starts with 10 top tricks: two spades, four hearts, two diamonds and two clubs. Clearly, he can afford one club loser but not two. All plays work if the missing clubs are divided 3-2. So you must maximize your chances against a 4-1 break.It looks normal to play the club king and another club, winning when East has the singleton nine, jack or queen.However, there is a better play. You should win the diamond lead with dummy's ace and immediately call for the club 10! If East plays the two or three, you play low. If East plays the nine or an honor, you win with the king and return a club, planning to cover West's card.This line works whenever East has the singleton nine, jack or queen, and when West has the singleton nine.The opening sentence was penned by Terence, a second-century B.C.Roman comic poet who wrote in remarkably pure Latin.

Today's is, of course, one of them. It is another of those deals on which many players would go down because they wouldn't carry out sufficient analysis.After a Stayman auction in which North upgraded his hand because of the singleton, West led the spade jack. Declarer, deciding, reasonably enough, that West wouldn't lead away from the king-jack into a no-trump opening, played low from the dummy. Up popped the king from East.Delightedly, South won with the ace and led a trump.However, West shot in with the ace and returned the spade 10. Declarer covered with dummy's queen, but East ruffed, of course. Back came a trump, and South couldn't avoid the loss of two more spade tricks for down one.When East plays the spade king at trick one, it must be a singleton. If South stops to consider his alternatives, he will realize that ducking his ace is a good play. Then, when West wins with the heart ace and leads another spade, declarer plays low from the dummy. If East ruffs, he is trumping a loser.The spade ace and queen remain to take tricks in a moment. If East doesn't ruff, South wins with the ace and ruffs his two diamond losers in the dummy. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

As part of Habitat for Humanity International's Tithe Program, Habitat Choptank tithes to Habitat affiliates in Haiti, El Salvador and Guatemala.\"Our commitment to tithing is based on Habitat Choptank's Christian values,\" says JoAnn Hansen, CEO of Habitat Choptank. \"We have a strong belief that when we operate in faith and steward the resources that we've been entrusted with well, God will take care of the rest.\" Habitat for Humanity International presented Habitat Choptank with the Sam Mompongo Award in recognition of their $1 million tithe goal.In June, representatives from Habitat Guatemala visited Habitat Choptank in gratitude for their tithe partnership and to discuss how Habitat Choptank's tithe has helped families in Guatemala.Habitat Choptank's tithe this past year helped Habitat Guatemala build six more new homes and distribute 40 more healthy home kits, which provide access to water, sanitation and hygiene.\"Donations to Habitat Choptank make far-reaching and lasting impacts,\" the organization said in a press release. \"Your gift to Habitat Choptank helps families achieve their dreams of homeownership in Talbot and Dorchester Counties and worldwide.\" Visit habitatchoptank.org/donate to make a donation or for other ways to give. \n \n Caption: HABITAT CHOPTANK\n \nStaff members from Habitat Choptank, Pickering Creek, and the Multicultural Center gather for a group photo in front of a Habitat house under construction. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Now that I am older, I have a desire to find my father's side of the family.I am concerned that this may cause some issues or bring up past hurt for my mother.My mother never spoke much about my father's side of the family, which always left a void in my heart. I think it is important to tell my mom what I am doing, but I don't want this to cause any problems between us. Can you please help me with this situation? - Finding Myself DEAR FINDING MYSELF: You have every right to learn about your father's family. Your mother may be uncomfortable about the idea at first, but it is OK to let her know your intentions.Thank your mother for all that she has done to care for you for your whole life. Point out how hard it may have been at times, especially since your father passed away so early in your life.Tell her that you are curious about him and his family, and you want her help in learning about them and finding them.Listen to her thoughts on the subject. Find out if she knows how to reach any of his people. Probe to learn their names and any other clues about them.Do your research to put the pieces together. Also, ask her why she didn't maintain a relationship with them. There may be good reasons why she has kept her distance. Learn what you can, and proceed with caution.Harriette Cole is a lifestylist and founder of DREAMLEAPERS, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

    "content": "When do you play second hand high? - Bridge\n\n November 6, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Phillip Alder | Page: 5 | Section: News \n \n 266\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In her poem \"Sanctuary,\" Dorothy Parker wrote, \"My land is bare of chattering folk;/the clouds are low along the ridges,/and sweet's the air with curly smoke/from all my burning bridges.\"At the card table, we try not to burn our bridges with partner. One of the best known ways of keeping them intact is \"second hand low.\" Why rush up when your partner is last to play to the trick?This week, let's look at the times when your problem is deciding between second hand high and low.First, second hand low. A textbook example is in this deal. How should the play go in six spades after West leads the heart king?If North were a member of the Real Bridge Players Don't Need Blackwood Club, he would jump straight to six spades. Here, he uses Roman Key Card Blackwood to learn that his partner has either two aces or one ace and the spade king.Declarer wins the first trick with dummy's heart ace, cashes the three diamond winners, discarding his remaining heart, ruffs the heart four in his hand and leads a club toward dummy's king-jack.West must play second hand low -- and do it with no hesitation. He should know that his side needs two club tricks to defeat the contract. He must not give declarer the contract on a platter with caviar, lobster and toast points.Then, if declarer calls for dummy's king, West will say: \"Sorry, partner. Next time I will lead a low club, which will surely cause South to misguess.\"©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They must not make things easy for him.The heart suit in this deal is one example. How should South plan the play in six spades? West leads the diamond 10.After South opened one spade, North understandably launched into Blackwood, signing off in six spades when he learned that one ace was missing. He expected South to claim immediately, but the mirror distribution meant that play had to proceed.South, who can afford to lose only one heart trick, wins trick one in the dummy, draws trumps, cashes all of the minor-suit winners ending in his hand and leads a heart. If West wins with the ace, it is all over. So, let's assume West plays low. Now South calls for dummy's heart queen. (This is a better play than immediately finessing dummy's 10.) If East takes the trick, he is endplayed, forced either to return a heart into dummy's K-10 or to concede a ruffand-sluff. So, let's assume East also plays low.Declarer returns to his hand with a trump and leads another heart. Again, if West wins with the ace, South claims. When West plays low, though, declarer has a guess. He might or might not get it right, but at least the defender with the ace - whether it is East or West - did his best.Finally, note that both West and East must play low so smoothly that the kibitzers think the deck is missing the heart ace. Any hesitation gives the game away. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The continuation of wars and the rumors of wars, the rising cost of food and commodities used to create the products we hold essential to our way of living, the political gridlock that stems from our elected officials choosing to place party over principles, and the violence that has become too prevalent in our towns and cities.All of these things and more can conspire to disturb our peace of mind and break the tranquility of our lives.But there is something I have found that is able to keep us from falling into the pit of despair even amid the challenges of a world seemingly gone mad - something so powerful that it causes the light of hope to perpetually shine through the increasing darkness of fallen humanity.That something is faith.It is faith in the will of Almighty God to take care of His own. It is this faith that causes me to trust the sacred promise that \"many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord brings them out of them all.\"With faith, my friends, we who believe are able to see beyond the tests and trials of the day no matter how harsh or severe they may become to a reality that supersedes this world of shadows.That faithful reality is what inspired the Apostle Paul to proclaim in Romans 8:18 \"for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us.\" To paraphrase a quote from Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., with the power of faith, we are able to chisel the \"mountains of despair into precious stones of hope.\" In these troubling days, it seems like we all take losses of some sort, but the one thing we cannot afford to lose is our faith in the Almighty to care for us.And no matter what uncertainties tomorrow may bring our way, let us continue to move forward trusting in the Lord. \"For we walk by faith, not by sight\" (2 Cor. 5:7). \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is a trump contract. Dummy has a sidesuit singleton, and in that suit you have the ace without the king or queen. You know what will happen. Declarer will get into the dummy and call for that singleton. Do you win with your ace, or do you play low smoothly?North, despite having six losers (one spade, two hearts, two diamonds and one club), blasted into Blackwood and then leapt to six spades. A four-club splinter bid would have been a wiser choice - if North-South were using that toy, of course. (Four clubs would have shown fourcard or longer spade support, at least game values and a singleton or void in the bid suit.)A diamond lead would have defeated the contract by two tricks, but West understandably selected the heart queen. Declarer won with dummy's king and called for the club seven.East was immediately on the spot. What should he have done?If the ace is the setting trick, he (almost always) should grab the trick. But far more often than not, second hand should play low, not win with the ace. This deal is a tough example. Although South has no guess in the suit, if East wins with his ace, the contract makes. Declarer gets two club winners, on which he discards dummy's two low diamonds. He takes five spades, two hearts, one diamond, two clubs and two diamond ruffs in the dummy.Luckily for the defense, East had been there before: He played low smoothly. That cost one club trick, but two diamond tricks come back in return. The declarer had no chance. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Everyone loves side dishes and looks forward to piling them on their plates!The first dish that comes to my memory is when I go back to the country Thanksgiving dinner my mom would prepare. Mom always had her menu planned ahead of time, and the morning before Thanksgiving, she would get a basket and sharp knife and walk to the field on the farm where the fresh collard greens were growing.Mom loved cooking big dinners for family members, who came from afar to share the bounty of food that was mostly homegrown.She would cut the greens and mash them down in the basket until it was full.Returning to the house, we would chop the stems off, place them in a tub, pour cold water over them and sprinkle with some coarse salt. to bring any bugs to the top.After at least three to four times, we changed the water and shook the greens to ensure they were pest-free.In the house already on the stove was her largest pot, filled 1/4 of the way with boiling water and with either a ham hock or fat meat cooking for flavor.In came the clean greens that were gently dropped into the hot water. The lid was placed on loosely, and the rolling boil continued until the greens were tender. with us checking to see if more water was needed every so often.We'd sprinkle some table salt or coarse salt on top, and, during the last few minutes of cooking, sprinkle a very light amount of baking soda (yellow box) over top greens that will cause greens to steam up and fall back down.Recently, my daughter in law, Shannon, visited a local farm in Pittsville called Ard Brac Acres.While there, she picked up some bags of collard greens already cleaned as well as some ham hocks.Shannon put a \"modern\" touch on this dish, and let me tell you, they were amazing!Look up Ard Brac Acres on social media, as we will definitely be visiting them again soon for more country style dishes. Also, today, Nov. 8, is Shannon's birthday, so I'd like to wish her a very happy birthday!SHANNON's HAM HOCKS AND TURNIP GREENSUse a bag of collard greens purchased from the store. or two bags according to your crock pot size. Place one large or medium ham hock in a crock pot. season with 2 tablespoons minced garlic, 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, and 2 tablespoons sugar. Fill the crock pot to the top with chopped greens and pour a 32-ounce container of chicken broth or broth of your choice over greens. sprinkle top with salt and pepper to taste.Cover pot with lid and cook for 7 to 10 hours. Shannon (my daughter-in-law) cooked this and shared it with me. it is delicious and so much easier to make. try it and you will agree.GREEN BEANS WITH BACONThis is tasty, quick and easy. In a large skillet, cook four diced bacon strips with 1/2 cup chopped onion until the bacon is crisp. Meanwhile place 8 cups of fresh green beans, trimmed, in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until crisp-tender.Drain well and add the bacon mixture. Sprinkle top with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Serve immediately.This recipe is not the one grandmother or mom made, but it is great too.Give it a try.SWEET POTATON' MARSHMALLOWFor a Small casserole dish size. Mix together well with an electric mixer: 1 can sweet potatoes, 1 egg, 3/4 cup sugar, 1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla, 1/3 cup evaporated milk and 1/3 stick of margarine.Mix well and bake in a 350 degree oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with one bag of large marshmallows and return to the oven just until the marshmallows turn golden brown. Remove from the oven and let set for a while before serving.CORNBREAD DRESSING WITH OYSTERS2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the dish, 1 diced yellow onion, 3 diced stalks celery, 5 minced cloves garlic, 8 cups crumbled cornbread, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 3 1/2 cups chicken stock, 6 large eggs, 1/2 cup chopped Italian parsley, 1 bunch fresh tarragon with leaves stripped and chopped, 2 cups shucked oysters with their juice. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9-by 13-inch baking dish.In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.When the butter is foamy, add the onion and celery, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir the garlic and cook until aromatic, about 1 minute.Stir in the crumbled cornbread and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, then remove from the heat. In a large bowl, beat the eggs until smooth. Whisk in the chicken stock, parsley and tarragon. Stir in the cornbread mixture and the oysters. Pour the dressing mixture into the prepared baking dish and bake until the dressing is set and golden brown, about 1 hour. (Alternatively, cover and refrigerate overnight before baking; see note.)Let rest for 5 minutes.GREEN BEAN CASSEROLEHeat oven to 350 degrees.In a large bowl, stir together 2 cans of green beans with 1 can of golden mushroom soup, half a can of water, and 1 cup grated cheddar cheese.Lightly mix and transfer to a 2 quart casserole dish. Sprinkle top with one can of fried onions. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 15 minutes until bubbly.ASPARAGUS CASSEROLEGoes great with baked ham. In a buttered casserole dish place a layer of asparagus and then a layer of crumbled cheese nips crackers.Wet with cream of mushroom soup mixed with water according to directions on the can. Finish the casserole with a few more crushed cheese nips. Bake in a 350 degree oven until asparagus is tender.OLD FASHIONED BREAD DRESSINGIn a skillet, cook 1 1/2 cups finely chopped onion in 1/3 cup butter with 1 1/2 cups chopped celery until tender.Add this mixture to 8 cups of dry small bread cubes which have been placed in a large pan. Sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 1/8 teaspoon black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon sage, and combine well. Add 1/4 cup water and 1 beaten egg. Toss together with a fork.

However, there are three critical positions when second hand must play high, like it or not!With that enormous hint, it shouldn't be hard to work out in this deal how the defense can defeat three no-trump after West leads the heart queen.When someone opens two no-trump, his hand will usually contain seven controls, an ace being two controls and a king one.Here, South had eight controls, with which he might have upgraded and opened two clubs. However, he had no five-card suit or good intermediates (nines and 10s). He sensibly started with two no-trump.South had seven top tricks: one spade, two hearts, three diamonds and one club. So, even if diamonds were 3-3, declarer needed to make something of dummy's club suit.South won the first trick with his heart king and immediately led a club.West's big moment had arrived: He had to play second hand high, putting his king onto the table.Note that if West had played his low club, declarer would have called for dummy's nine. Whether East won with his queen or ducked, South would have gotten four club tricks and 10 in all.However, when West played his club king, declarer was caught between a rock and a hard place. If he had ducked in the dummy, another heart would have established West's suit. Instead, when South won with dummy's ace and played another club, East ducked, holding declarer to a pair of club tricks. With the diamonds 4-2, not 3-3, the contract had to fail. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Of course I am afraid. What sane man is not?\" Today's deal illustrates a time when a player sitting second hand must not be afraid to play high.South is in three no-trump, and West leads the spade queen. What happens after that?Opposite a 15-17 notrump, when responder has 10 points, no interest in the majors and no singleton or void, he should just blast straight into three no-trump.(When your minimum combined count is 25, bid game. When your maximum combined count is 25, settle for one no-trump unless you also have a five-card suit.)South has seven top tricks: two spades, three hearts and two clubs. He must establish two diamond tricks to get home.When declarer has two stoppers in the suit led and two high cards to dislodge, normally he should duck the first trick. (He could win the first trick here as long as he ducks the second round of spades.) After taking dummy's spade ace at trick two, South calls for a diamond.East knows that his partner's suit is one lead from being established. When this is the situation, he should do his utmost to win the next defensive trick. Here, East must play his diamond king. Then, when he holds the trick, he can lead his last spade. West's suit is established, and West has the diamond ace as his entry card. The defenders take two diamonds and three spades.Note that if East does not play his diamond king, West's ace will be gone before his spade suit is ready to run. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'It's about the JOURNEY' - Retired Marine Capt. Mike Oldham takes on the Pacific Crest Trail\n\n November 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Connie Connolly; cconnolly@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1451\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CENTREVILLE - Mike Oldham loves hiking.It's a hobby he picked up as a young Marine in California, but the formidable Pacific Crest Trail beckoned him once he retired. After months of planning and preparing, he launched his odyssey last year.When an injury sidetracked him, he left the trail, but resumed his trek a year later.On Sept. 3, he completed his over 2,550-mile hike with an emotional coda he recorded on YouTube, a platform he used to record many of the highs and lows of his journey, along with his philosophical musings.Mike Oldham, 60, of Centreville, credits his 26-year career as a U.S.Marine for helping him prepare and especially, to apply an all-important lesson: Carry plenty of water.He's not sure if his ability to plan and prepare is innate or was formed as part of his Marine experience and persona, but it was probably a combination of both.Oldham recalled his service in the Marine Corps, his childhood that propelled his love of the trail, the arduous training, the toll the hike took on his body and the sublime moments that took his breath away.A LOVE OF HIKING IS BORNOldham grew up in Roseville, Michigan, spending time on his grandparents' farm and tramping their 15 acres of woods.\"I just love being out in the woods. I loved hiking,\" he said. \"My brother likes hunting and I tried to hunt, but I didn't like it as much as just walking around the woods. I thought it was great.\" In high school, Oldham \"concentrated on football and girls, and I got a 100% scholarship to the United States Marine Corps\" in 1981, he said.That decision landed him in a first tour of duty that was \"very fortunate.\" As a Sikorsky CH-53 Helicopter mechanic and crew chief, he was stationed with newly elected President Ronald Reagan's helicopter squadron Marine One.\"We would fly into the White House and pick them up or take them to Andrews Air Force Base,\" Oldham said. \"And then when he was overseas, we would break down our helicopters and put them in a C-5, go overseas and put them together and pick them up at whatever airport.\" Oldham has since visited the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, and viewed a photograph of himself with Reagan that's hanging on the wall in Air Force One.He remembers the late president as a person \"as genuine as you could imagine. He was truly the guy that you saw on TV,\" he said.He eventually went to warrant officer school, served a series of assignments and retired with the rank of captain after 26 years.\"I got a great job at General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, and I worked in support of the MQ-1 Predator and the MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles,\" he said. During the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, they were the UAVs \"dropping bombs and killing bad guys.\" He retired from General Atomics on March 29, 2022, and two days later he started hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.\"I was ready for a break from aerospace and everything,\" Oldham said. \"You go through life 100 miles an hour, and this was the way to get away from everything and just enjoy God's country.\"FOREST BATHING\"Forest bathing,\" a form of ecotherapy, is something Oldham has come to appreciate and advocate.Whether \"in the desert, the mountains or forests, it helps you psychologically, and there is nothing better than being away from everything - no cell phones, no cars, no roads, no email, nothing. Just you and the trail,\" he said.The PCT is one of three long distance hiking trails in the U.S. \"They don't have these trails in other countries,\" Oldham said. \"We're very fortunate to have these national parks and these trails.\" As he \"started romancing and fantasizing\" about hiking one of these trails, he took a \"deep dive into the history of (long distance hiking) and researching and watching other people's videos about it\" for about five years.The PCT captured his imagination.Near his home and work, Oldham had hiked in the mountains near San Diego. A year before he launched out on the PCT, he began hiking seven or eight miles after work, carrying 25 pounds of water. On weekends, he'd hike twice as far.Still, the PCT is arduous on the best of days. In fact, long-distance hikers must apply for one or more permits.There are also campfire, campsite and \"weather window\" restrictions.Besides all-essential water, Oldham equipped himself with a small Garmin inReach GPS satellite communicator for unlimited texting and emergency notification. An app called Far Out \"works in airplane mode and shows you exactly where you are and where the trail is,\" he said, and he never got lost. For treacherous walking on snow and ice, he strapped microspikes on his boots. He wore out a pair of hiking boots about every 400 miles.\"You get to eat as horrible as you want, because you're losing weight,\" Oldham said. \"You're literally at a 1,000-calorie deficit a day, and you're still eating like crazy. I lost 25 pounds, and I did not have 25 pounds to lose. When I got back, I was so weak in the upper body.Now, legs-wise, you're climbing 4,000 to 5,000 feet a day with a 30-pound pack, and you are crushing it, but your upper body is taking a toll.\" Still, rather than push himself beyond his physical limits, he did what he jokingly called the \"Oregon resort challenge,\" seeking out RV resorts that had food, beer and places to recharge battery packs. If the weather forecast called for several days of heavy rain, Oldham would opt to stay at a nearby hostel or hotel.Oldham's trail name became \"Marine Mike\" after a hiker finally caught up with him after five days, bearing the hat Oldham had lost. His brother David had given him the hat that identified Oldham as a Marine. \"I've been chasing you for five days,\" the hiker gasped. \"How can an old man hike so fast?\" Oldham embarked from the southern terminus in Campo, California, on the Mexico border March 31, 2022, and made it to Lake Tahoe. Although he had experienced some hard falls and broken packs all along the trek, on June 16, he landed in the emergency room with foot and knee injuries he sustained on the trail at 1,100 miles.\"Welcome to the PCT,\" he quipped.SIDELINED, BUT BACK ON THE TRAILHe spent the rest of the year in physical therapy, and ventured back into the gym.Oldham got back on the trail June 15, 2023, at mile 1,236 in Quincy, California, a year minus a day from his exit in 2022.According to the Pacific Crest Trail Association, California comprises the lion's share of miles at 1,692. The PCT in Oregon is 455 miles long and Washington is 506 miles.The vistas on the trail were worth the effort, Oldham said. \"The Sierra Mountains were just amazing,\" he said.He climbed Mount Whitney - at 14,505 feet, the highest mountain in the contiguous U.S. and the Sierra Nevada.\"You definitely feel the low oxygen, (but) the views are just amazing. You think you're in a National Geographic film all day long.Also the state of Washington is just gorgeous. I mean, gorgeous.\" From freezing temperatures to scorching heat or gale-force winds, from heavy snowfall to treacherous snow to fallen trees, sheer slopes, rocks, desert and rivers - and even a stubborn bull blocking the trail - Oldham encountered the gamut of terrain, weather and obstacles.But \"trail angels\" and \"trail magic\" - surprising grace notes along the way - were \"a blessing to have,\" he said.\"Trail angels just truly love supporting hikers.\" \"You're out there hiking, and then you come across somebody who is cooking burgers for you or has fruit and and sodas\" or a cold drink hikers crave, he said. They even came across a cooler containing beer in the middle of the woods marked with the sign \"trail magic.\" The day Oldham reached the terminus on Sept. 3, he was filled with emotion. \"I didn't see it coming either.\" \"That was a goal that I had had for several years, and you're out there pumping 20-plus miles a day all to reach this goal,\" Oldham said.\"But it wasn't about the destination because the destination was a bunch of wood stuck in the ground. It was about the journey. You know, our life is about the journey.It's not about the destination.\" While Oldham remains an always faithful Marine, he carries with him the indelible memory of his odyssey that pushed him to his limits in the Great Outdoors.To see videos of his trek, visit Mike Oldham's YouTube channel at youtube.com/@mikeoldham4023. \n \n Caption: COURTESY MIKE OLDHAM\n \nMike Oldham on Mount Whitney, the highest summit in the continental United States.\n \nCOURTESY MIKE OLDHAM\n \nIn 1983, President Ronald Reagan shakes hands with young Marine Mike Oldham at Camp David. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Detecting problems with old plumbing and pipes\n\n November 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mid Shore Board Of Realtors | Page: 11 | Section: News \n \n 686\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - From providing a hot shower at the end of a long day to taking the wastewater out of our home without a smell, the indoor plumbing system is an unsung hero of our everyday lives.We rarely stop to think about the complexities involved in providing a clean glass full of water from our sinks until we step in a puddle on the floor.The indoor plumbing systems in our homes have been constructed throughout the past 150 years of many different materials, and some of those materials have lasted better than others.Daniel Morris, a certified master inspector with Blackwater Home Inspectors, is a preferred partner with Mid-Shore Board of Realtors and will relay some of the materials that throughout the years have shown to be deficient and how to identify them.When referencing residential plumbing, we generally are talking about our supply piping and drain piping. Let's talk about two materials found in the Mid-Shore area that have common issues, polybutylene piping and galvanized steel.Polybutylene piping was introduced in the late 1970s and used through the mid-1990s. Gray in appearance when installed in a home, the lettering \"PB-2110\" is often printed on the pipe.It was a flexible, cheap and easy to install material. The piping was installed in millions of homes throughout the U.S. because of those qualities.However, polybutylene piping has shown that it is more prone to leaks and deterioration of the pipe material itself. Several class action lawsuits against the manufacturers have taken place, and at this point, the pipe is considered obsolete and in need of replacement.Mobile homes and manufactured homes were often plumbed with this piping material, and it is still common to find these materials today. If you live in a home built in the 80s or 90s, take a second to look under your sink to see if you see any exposed gray piping.Galvanized steel was a product introduced in the 1940s. It consisted of a steel pipe that was dipped in a zinc coating to prevent corrosion.However, over time, with water running through the pipe, the zinc coating on the interior of the piping can wash away. This leads to the piping corroding on the inside and slowly closing the pipe in.Oftentimes, rust particles are introduced into the water running through the pipe, contaminating the water. It often will restrict the flow of water and result in a loss of water pressure.This piping can be identified by a dull, grayish/silver appearance.When the pipe is scratched it will be shiny, as opposed to lead, which will be dull in color.To best test the performance of this pipe, it is recommended you run multiple water fixtures for two minutes and watch for noticeable dips in water pressure. This piping material is past its lifespan at this point, and replacement of the material is recommended.All water pipes can leak, not just the two that are described above.Plumbing leaks are not just a minor inconvenience but can often lead to structural damage to a home if the leak is not caught quickly.There are several pieces of technology now that can help detect these leaks before they become an issue.There are small water alarms that can be placed in areas to detect any leaks and whole house leak detection meters that are installed on your water main and can shut off the water to the home if a leak is detected.Even some water heaters are coming installed with leak detectors.If you have questions about your plumbing system, a plumbing contractor or even a local home inspector can often be of assistance.Morris can be reached at 443-528-1633.

You might think that experts never fall from grace in this respect, but you would be wrong.Today's deal comes from a match between two different countries. How should South play in six hearts after West leads the diamond five?At the other table, North-South stopped in four hearts, making five. This pair was more adventurous. Three diamonds was a transfer bid, East doubling to show good diamonds. Throwing caution to the winds, North rebid a quantitative four notrump.(If he had wanted to ask for aces or key cards immediately, he would have used a Texas transfer at the four-level.) South, despite having minimum count and two diamond losers, took a shot at the slam.The declarer won the first trick with his diamond ace and drew trumps in three rounds. Then he paused to assess the situation - too late.He should have noted that he had only 11 winners: three spades, five hearts, one diamond and two clubs. It was necessary to capture a third club winner.The right line is to draw only two rounds of trumps, keeping an honor in the South hand. Then declarer plays off his three top spades, discarding one of dummy's clubs. A club to the ace, a club to the king and a club ruff follow. South, thankful to see the 3-3 split, plays a trump to his jack (or king) and cashes the club nine, discarding one of dummy's diamond losers. He concedes just one diamond trick. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You pay a small fortune to get it and keep it.Then, if you have the blatant audacity to actually file a claim, the company either increases your premiums or cancels you altogether.OK, that may be a bit extreme, but you get my point.While the world of insurance can at times be so confusing as to be maddening, going without basic automobile coverage is simply not an option. The financial risk is just too great. But there are some things you can do to make sure you don't stand out to the company as an intolerable risk.You should file an auto insurance claim if: There are injuries, even minor ones. It's crucial to report the incident to your insurer to ensure your coverage applies, preventing unexpected bills and safeguarding you from potential lawsuits by injured drivers.Another driver is involved.Contact your insurance company whenever you're in a crash with another driver, especially when fault isn't clear. Reporting the incident to your insurer helps make sure the blame is assigned fairly and shields you from excessive liability.There is damage to vehicles or property. Insurance is there to help you with costs when things get damaged, so you don't have to pay a big lump sum. That's why you pay monthly premiums.You shouldn't file an auto insurance claim if: You are the only person involved. If the incident is your fault and does not involve injuries, not telling your insurance company will help protect your premium.There is only a small amount of damage. Even if you have collision coverage in your car insurance, you might decide not to file a claim if your car has only minor damage.Mary invites you to visit her at EverydayCheapskate.com, where this column is archived complete with links and resources for all recommended products and services.Mary invites questions and comments at https://www.everydaycheapskate.com/contact/, \"Ask Mary.\" CO PYR IGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Scripture tells us in Malachi 3:6, \"For I am the LORD, I do not change\" Without God as our source of stability because He does not change, we will find many difficulties in handling the changes that come in our lives. He is the steadfast rock that gives us a sure foundation to be able to walk through all of the changes in this life.As we approach the Thanksgiving holiday, take time to reflect on the various seasons of your life, and I believe you will see a constant source of strength that has enabled stability through the seasons and changes of life.Take time to give thanks for His grace and mercy and all of the blessings He gives through each season.I hope each of you have a blessed Thanksgiving holiday and an amazing Christmas season! \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If it wins, an extra trick is in the bag.However, you should always consider what will happen if the finesse loses. Would it be better not to finesse?In today's deal, North might have passed over two notrump, but he decided that that contract was unlikely to make exactly. Either the hearts would be useful and nine tricks won, or they wouldn't and he would be conceding an extra undertrick by bidding game.West led the club king: four, five, two. (Yes, leading the seven would have worked much better, but with two apparent entries, leading the honor looked preferable.)West continued with the club nine: eight, jack, 10.East switched to the spade two. How should South have continued from thereftThe first declarer finessed the spade queen, but West, feeling relieved, won with the king and played another club. When South led a heart, West grabbed his ace and cashed the clubs for down three.The second declarer rose with the spade ace at trick three and led a heart to dummy's nine. When that won, South played a diamond to his queen and led his second heart. With the favorable lie, nine tricks were there for the taking.The first declarer claimed how lucky the other declarer had been to find both heart honors onside tripleton.However, if East holds the heart queen, the contract is probably doomed. For one thing, West is likely to hold the spade king and heart ace for his vulnerable two-level overcall. Also, if West has the heart queen, the spade finesse can wait. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I recently accepted a job that proved to be overwhelming to me.I thought I would be good at it, but I had to stretch a lot, and it just seemed like I was not doing anything right. I ended up quitting after one week. I felt like such a failure.My boss didn't say that I was doing a bad job, but she kept pointing out things that I needed to work on. I just couldn't take it. Now I am unemployed and feel like even more of a loser. How can I regain my confidence when my perfectionism is probably what landed me here in the first place?-Crippling PerfectionismDEAR CRIPPLING PERFECTIONISM:Give yourself credit for recognizing that you may be too much of a perfectionist. In our culture, being a high achiever - being the best■is lauded.Know that you are not alone in your desire to do everything right and likely better than others. Know, too, that this is unhealthy and can lead to situations like you described where you feel compelled to walk away rather than face whatever situation is before you.According to VeryWell-Mind.com, signs of perfectionism include: all-or-nothing thinking, being highly critical, having unrealistic standards, focusing only on unmet goals, fear of failure, procrastination, defensiveness and low self-esteem.You can work to combat those feelings by establishing daily affirmations that speak to your talents and goodness. Give yourself a break. Showing up and doing your best are good. And good is just fine.You may want to see a therapist to help you navigate the current crisis and help you develop strategies for managing your expectations and outcomes.Harriette Cole is a lifestylist andfounder ofDREAM-LEAPERS, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

He makes a simple response unless holding noticeably more than that. However, after North cue-bid to show a very strong hand with spade support, South was happy to control-bid his top heart card. North needed no more encouragement.Maybe West should have led a diamond, which would have killed the contract. However, he led his singleton, optimistically hoping his partner had the heart ace.After East allowed dummy's heart 10 to win the first trick, declarer cashed the spade king (hoping West had a singleton honor) and followed with a trump to his ace, getting the bad news.South continued with a heart to dummy's ace, ran the heart jack, played a heart to his nine and cashed dummy's top clubs, eliminating the rounded suits. With his preparations complete, declarer cast adrift with a trump. East won with the queen and had to lead a diamond away from his king into dummy's ace-queen tenace.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In a few mo me nts, in walks lthe grfccio Bs mistress of the parsonage, and in her hand is another apple fritter.\"Here's an apple fritter for you this morning. I think you'll enjoy it today.\" She smiled at me, turned around, and returned to the kitc hen.It's not that I can't handle an apple fritter because I can. It's the fact that someone is bringing these apple fritters to me who does not like apple fritters. Something is happening behind the scenes, and I'm anxious to find o ut.The next day, the same thing happened. Now I'm getting to be suspicious. What in the world am I missing here?Not wanting to sabotage my good luck the last four days, I kept silent and enjoyed the fritter. Whatever is behind this, I may never know, but I w ill enjoy it for whatever it is worth.I couldn't help thinking of a Bible verse, \"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not\" (Galatians 6:9).Sometimes, the best thing to do is NOTHING and let God have it.Dr. James L.

Sheba is a resilient girl who has spent her entire life living outside, so she's eager to experience the comforts of indoor life. She's hoping to find a family who will give her a warm bed, plenty of toys, and lots of love. Although Sheba can be a little shy at first, she is a very friendly dog who loves cuddles and pets once she gets to know you. Her charming smile is just irresistible, and it's hard not to fall in love with her gentle disposition. She is also very playful and loves to chase after toys, making her a great companion for anyone who wants an active and affectionate pet. Because Sheba hasn't had much experience with new environments, it can take her some time to adjust. But with patience and loving support, she will soon blossom into a confident and happy dog who will bring joy to any home. She would do best in a quiet and loving household that will give her the attention and care she deserves. If you are interested in adopting Sheba and giving her the warm home that she deserves call 410-822-0107 or email info@talbothumane.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Giving thanks by giving back, all year long - Salvation Army prepares for upcoming holiday season\n\n November 22, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Debra Messick; Special To The Star Democrat | Page: 8 | Section: News \n \n 1179\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CAMBRIDGE - \"It takes this whole community for us to be able to do what we do, and they've been so generous, but the need is growing as the economy changes; the need is greater than I think I've ever seen it in all my years serving in the Salvation Army,\" Captain Wendy Parsons said.The familiar sights of red kettles and ringing bells have returned, again ushering in the season of giving. But for the Salvation Army and it's legion of community \"angels,\" there's no beginning or end to the mission of lending a hand.As Parsons said, \"we're always, always busy here.\" There's the perpetual call to provide safe haven and meals for homeless residents at the Robert and Grace Bair Overnight Shelter, located behind the church and offices building at 200 Washington Street in Cambridge.It's a call often answered by individuals, businesses and organizations who selflessly step up, filling in the open dates on the shelter's meal calendar.\"We have several donors who make regular, standing commitments, on, say, the second Tuesday of the month, or the 18th of every month, or whatever fits their calendar, to make sure that those folks have a meal,\" Parsons explained.But in addition to the individual efforts, she's also grateful for the generous ongoing steady donations from local businesses Wawa, Starbucks and Chick-fil-A.\"Anything left over from that, when the food is available, we can offer as graband-go bags. And that's not just for the homeless. That's also for those who are at risk.There are people from around here who work, but money just doesn't go as far as it used to, so 'either I pack a lunch for my kid or pack a lunch for me.' They send their young one off to school with a lunch, but then go off with nothing.Those folks can come by here and have lunch,\" Parsons said.Next door, at the William and Carolyn Tyler Day Services Center, essential services, including showers, clean laundry and the graband-go food bags, offer a respite to many mightily trying, but struggling, to get by day to day.\"There are some people that aren't experiencing homelessness but don't have enough money to do laundry, to pay a dollar a load at the laundromat plus detergent.That's the other thing that people have been very generous about, donating detergent so we can continue to wash clothes for people; it also helps us keep our shelter bedding clean and allows our shelter residents to wash their clothes,\" Parsons said.\"Partners in Giving just made a very generous donation to support Matt Ministries, our street feeding campaign, enabling us to provide 400 meals, mostly to kids every Thursday. We take our food truck, our Emergency Disaster Canteen, which we use to support our first responders, out on large calls with snacks, coffee and water,\" she said.The Salvation Army also maintains and stocks a food pantry, though it's not currently affiliated with the Maryland Food Bank.On the group's Facebook page, shout outs and thank you's are regularly posted, honoring each group donating food, bottled water, cash and other vital needs.Recent \"angels\" publicly recognized include AARP Chapter 1278, which brought in bags of food; Bishop Weldon Johnson and New Life Christian Ministries and Church, who inspired his congregation, which includes Cambridge Police Department Captain Antoine Patton, to collect 1,000 cans of food; Palm Beach Willies, which shared boxes of russet potatoes; and the Cambridge Police Department's Chief Justin Todd and Captain Patton, who personally delivered truckloads of food.The Mushroom Company's employees voted to award over $1,000 raised from their first Family Fun Day raffle to the Salvation Army.Socks are the most requested item at homeless shelters. One hundred pairs of Bombay socks also arrived at the Tyler Day Services Center, delivered by Dwayne White, chairman of the Social Action Committee from Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Second District.\"We have food that comes in through a variety of ways, but we also have people that go out and raise funds or have canned food drives. We're currently well stocked with vegetables, but right now we especially need frozen or canned proteins. Just one of those one pound rolls of hamburger, that's spaghetti for a whole family. Canned tuna and chicken also work,\" Parsons said.The pantry is also currently running very low on nonperishable breakfast items, like cereal, oatmeal or grits.Shelf-stable milk is another ongoing need. Either the donated items or the cash to purchase them are welcome.\"We don't have a boundary here on food,\" Parsons said.\"If you're hungry, you need to come in. I've had somebody come in to get food for their own family and the older lady that lives in the apartment or townhouse next door doesn't have anything, so they share some of the food that we'd given them, it's essentially now feeding two households.\"We don't want kids to go to school hungry, and that's why we partner with Mid-Shore Meals Til Monday, providing them free space in our Thrift store warehouse.We make sure kids can get a meal on Thursday, and they're making sure they have food over the weekend,\" she said.Beyond supplying the basic critical crisis needs of food and shelter, Residential Programs Manager Shane Walker makes sure that people have access to information and other helpful resources to get mentally and physically healthy, like Avenues Recovery or Fassett Magee Medical Center.\"He has contacts, not just here, but in communities across the Shore,\" Parsons said. \"So does our social worker, Mary Justice, who travels to the other counties once a week, working with other agencies to find solutions for people with specific problems including eviction prevention and utility assistance.\"We're not in competition to see who can do better; we come together to bring that person out of crisis into stability.\" The Red Kettle campaign, which supports the mission all year long, started Nov. 9 and continues through Dec.23, with both paid and volunteer bell ringers positions still needing to be filled. Individuals, or groups interested in \"adopting\" a kettle for a day while working in shifts, can find locations closest to them and sign up at registering.com.The other major holiday season initiative, the Angel Tree program, received 400 applicants this year. So far, though, 100 of those are still awaiting adoption. To help ensure these youngsters have a bright Christmas, people can check the QR code or direct link posted on the Salvation Army Cambridge MD Facebook page, or stop by 200 Washington Street and request an angel.The Salvation Army is also urgently seeking donated warehouse space to facilitate the Angel Tree distribution from Dec. 1 through approximately 16, in a location in or close to Cambridge.For more information, call 410-228-2442, or visit southernusa. salvationarmy.org. \n \n Caption: WENDY PARSONS\n \nThrough a donation from Partners in Giving to Matt Ministries, the Salvation Army's street feeding campaign, 400 meals, are provided mostly to kids every Thursday. \"The kids now know, when they see the red and white truck coming, that the hot dog lady is here. That's 1600 meals a month supported, thanks to Partners in Giving's generosity,\" says Caption Wendy Parsons.\n \nDEBRA MESSICK \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When we are enjoying our Thanksgiving feast, we do not worry too much about the calories being consumed.Sometimes, when playing in a bridge contract, you have to be economical with your cards. In today's deal, the declarer had to be particularly careful with his handling of the trump suit.Despite having only 5 highcard points, North's hand, with four trumps and a doubleton, was well worth a single raise.After winning the first trick with the heart ace, South saw that he had two logical lines of play. He could cash the spade ace, hoping to drop a singleton king, or he could play for East to hold the club king. The former chance being only 26% (a third of the 78% probability of a 2-1 trump split), the declarer opted for the 50-50 finesse.So, at trick two, South led the spade jack from his hand. (This had a secondary advantage: West, afraid his partner held the singleton trump ace, might have ducked his king.) No luck this time, though. West won with the king, cashed his two heart tricks and switched to a diamond.South won with his ace and led the spade seven to dummy's queen. After the club finesse had worked, South played the club three to his ace. Now came the spade three to dummy's five.The club jack was covered and ruffed. Finally, South led his carefully preserved spade four to dummy's six and cashed the club 10, discarding his diamond loser.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Lately, I've been embarrassed by her increasingly rude behavior toward service workers. We recently went to a restaurant, and she was unbelievably disrespectful. She ordered her food, and when it came, she kept asking where her smoothie was. They said it should be on the way, but it wasn't because she never actually ordered it. She kept badgering the staff about it and eventually got the free smoothie she was angling for. Also, she went up to the line cook who made her burger and said that there wasn't enough sauce on it. I didn't hear the full exchange, but by the way he recoiled from her when he handed back her food, I could tell it wasn't a good one. I've tried addressing it subtly, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.How do I approach this situation without damaging the friendship, yet communicate how her behavior is affecting me? - Rude Friend DEAR RUDE FRIEND: Who says you have to be subtle? Your friend has proven that subtlety doesn't work for her. She needs you to be direct and illustrative.Tell her you need to talk to her about something that is bothering you. When you are together, describe how she has behaved with you out in public recently and how you feel about it.Make her understand what you observed about how her behavior impacted the service workers around her and how inappropriate you believe her actions and words were. Let her know she has been behaving in a rude and dismissive manner, and you need her to stop. If she is mad at you for a while, so be it.Friends have to stand up for what's right - even if the cost is temporary disconnection.Harriette Cole is a lifestylist and founder of DREAMLEAPERS, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

I hope the following encouraging tips from your fellow readers on how to be a frugal rockstar will inspire all of us to pay attention and embrace ways we can immediately begin to see more money left in our wallets.Over the past six months, I've been on a tear to declutter and get organized. It has made a huge impact on my spending.Basically, I've stopped spending money on stuff I have already but just didn't know where to find it. The key is knowing what you have and finding it when needed. If you can't find your stuff easily, you might buy something you already have or, even worse, believe you got rid of it, buy a replacement, and then find the original shortly after. - Millie, New Jersey We have a new weekly menu item at our house - Everything But the Kitchen Sink Soup. Basically, this is just throwing a bunch of whateveris-in-the-fridge to make a soup in order to get rid of stuff that's about to go bad or otherwise needs to be used up. You can put so much stuff into soups, and you can freeze leftover soup, too. Really helps to prevent food waste. If you need instructions on how to do this, look up Cotter-Crunch.com. When you get there, use the search function to find that \"recipe.\" - Erica, California I started using grocery delivery during the pandemic. Even taking into consideration the monthly/annual delivery fee, I've stuck with it because it significantly reduces my impulse buys, which continues to save us money. And we have all but eliminated spending on junk food. - Molly, Pennsylvania \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Find ways to cut all prices by up to half\n\n November 28, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mary Hunt | Page: 6 | Section: News \n \n 337\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It's a benchmark, a goal, a mindset - a kind of game I play with myself. Whatever the price tag - real or perceived - I challenge myself to find a way to get it down to \"half the price.\" Here's an example.Harold and I make a business trip to California about every month, to take care of a business we have there and to stay connected with friends and family. We've done this so often, by now, I know about how much those plane tickets will be. And every month I take the challenge to cut the cost in half.Sometimes I make it; other times, I must concede to something far less than half the price. But now and then I hit it just right, and it feels like I won the jackpot.Not long ago, by agreeing to take a later flight, applying a special discount code, not checking any bags and not being picky about our seats, we flew for less than $100 each, round trip. These days, that's nearly unheard of.Then there are the times that I get the price of something down to nothing by deciding not to buy at all - doing without or deciding to wait. It amazes me just how often, if I'm just willing to wait a day or two, that \"urgent need\" kind of fades away.Living your life for half the price is not easy. It takes skill and determination to go against the tide and buck a system that says it's OK to spend all we have now, plus what we hope we'll get in the future. It takes the strength of character to protest against the message that it's OK to have what you want now and pay for it later.Here's the principle, the thing I hope you will take away from this: It's the money you don't spend that gives you the freedom to live the life you love.Think about it, embrace it, live it. I promise it can change your life.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ideally, North-South would reach three no-trump, but that is easier said than done - unless you employ a modern gadget.On the first round, South makes a jump cue bid of three hearts. This shows eight or nine guaranteed tricks, usually with a long, solid minor, and asks North to bid three no-trump with a heart stopper. However, without this string to your bow, suppose you wind up in five diamonds.After winning trick one with the spade ace, you draw trumps. Then you lead a low heart from hand. When West puts in the eight, which card should you play from the dummy?Given that West has at least five hearts and opening-bid values, it looks best, at first glance, to put up the queen, playing West for the heart ace and king, but think back to the opening lead. If you were West, holding the spade K-Q and heart A-K, which card would you select? Right, the heart king (or ace).Therefore, because West didn't lead a heart, surely East has a singleton heart honor. Duck in the dummy and East's king or ace will fall on low cards. A moment later, you will lead toward the heart queen again and make your contract. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dishes almost clean themselves!\" they said.I scoffed. And then millions of social media comments, reviews and videos have proven me wrong.I'm noticing a trending topic in my email inbox. Dawn Powerwash is amazing, and I love it, but it's too expensive! I go through the stuff like it's water! I really need a copycat recipe so I can make it myself. Come on, Mary, you can do it! And with that, I went right to work.After a good deal of testing, sniffing, researching, questioning and snooping, here it is - a copycat recipe for Dawn Platinum Powerwash Dish Spray together with several variations that could easily make your version even better.You'll need Blue Dawn Platinum Dishwashing Liquid, 70% isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol, distilled water, any 16 oz. or larger spray bottle and a measuring spoon.Pour 1 3/4 cups distilled water into the clean, empty spray bottle. Add 4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) Dawn Platinum Dishwashing Liquid.Add 1 1/2 tablespoons 70% isopropyl alcohol.Apply spray top. Shake gently to combine ingredients.Allow to sit for a few hours to allow everything to meld.One last thing: You may get dizzy once you start looking at Dawn products and options. There's Ultra, Platinum, 3X, 4X, 5X, Advanced, Professional, and that's only a start because there are many colors now, and plenty of scents to go with them. Don't worry.This is not an exact science.There's not much you could do to go wrong.However, I need to point out a somewhat similar P & G Dawn product that does not fit into this copycat recipe. Dawn Ultra Platinum Foam is something completely different.It looks like a short version of Powerwash, but it is not.We'll figure it out another time. \n \n Caption: MARY HUNT \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

If so, you must do something to reduce the number. Today's deal features one such play technique.Against four spades, West led the club ace. When East signaled with the 10, West continued with the club king and a third club. East exited with the spade three: two, eight, king. How should South have continued?South's three-spade rebid was invitational. North, with the two top trump honors, had an automatic raise to game.With all of the side suits safe, declarer's only concern was the trump suit. If that was breaking 3-2, he would have no trouble, but what if East had started with four spades including the jack?(If West had jack-fourth, the contract was beyond resuscitation.) The only chance would be a trump coup. To reduce his trump length to the same as East's, South made the farsighted play of immediately cashing dummy's heart ace and ruffing a heart in his hand.After declarer had played a trump to dummy's ace, getting the bad news, he ruffed another heart in his hand. Then South cashed his three diamond tricks, ending in the dummy. Luckily, East had to follow suit throughout.South was left with the Q-10 in spades, and East had the J-5. When South called for a heart, East's apparent trump trick disappeared in a textbook trump coup.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Homes that heat with electricity are at risk because many utilities run on natural gas, and the price of it has gone up, too.Thankfully, there are steps we can take to reduce high heating bills.Experts say it is not unreasonable that you could reduce your bill by as much as 30% if you: Adjust the thermostat. You really should keep the thermostat at 68 degrees during the day and 60 degrees at night. Does it feel too cold? Wear extra sweaters, and don't forget to regulate the humidity. Keeping the relative humidity between 30% and 50% can make 68 feel more like 74 F.Install weatherstripping.Weatherstripping is very inexpensive and available at any home improvement centers.It is self-adhesive, so it sticks to just about anything.Use it on drafty doors and windows and any place where a crack allows warm air to escape. Weatherstripping does not last indefinitely and should be replaced every year or two. If you are diligent in making sure every possible opening is weather-stripped, you can expect to recoup 15% of your heating bill.Water heater. If you don't already have one, spend $20 and get an insulation blanket for your electric water heater. You will save twice that amount each year in lower heating costs. That's how much heat escapes from an unwrapped heater.Insulate. If one heater blanket on your water heater can make that kind of a difference, imagine if you put a blanket on your whole house! That's just about what insulation is. Even if your home is insulated, get an inspection to determine if it is adequate. If the house was built before 1980 and not upgraded since, you can be sure you do not have enough insulation. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Karen Murphy Jensen Award for Pro Bono Service and Mentorship was presented to Donna McElroy of the Law Office of Donna B. McElroy in Berlin, Maryland.The award was created to honor a member of the legal community who demonstrates a commitment to pro bono service in addition to mentoring those who are new to the profession or seeking to increase their skills in service to the community.\"Because of these attorneys standing in their corners, the people we serve can stand a little taller, breathe easier, and get better outcomes in their case,\" Girard said.\"Legal representation shouldn't be reserved only for those who can afford it,\" she said. \"The feedback we receive from our partners and the people we serve says it all. A local circuit court judge wrote, 'We on the bench are so grateful for your volunteers.' One client said, 'Because of my financial situation, I never felt that anyone would give my case attention, but my attorney through Shore Legal Access gave 100%.'\" Shore Legal Access relies on its network of volunteers to represent people with limited means in their court cases, with preparing documents, and by providing legal counseling and advice.In 2022, Shore Legal Access volunteers provided 8,350 hours of free legal help, resulting in access to legal representation valued at more than $2 million in financial benefits for Eastern Shore residents.\"The people of the Eastern Shore are extremely fortunate to have the volunteer work of these dedicated attorneys,\" Girard said. \"And we are always looking for more attorneys to become volunteers with us and who share our passion for providing access to legal representation in civil matters for everyone, regardless of anyone's ability to pay.\"Shore Legal Access was founded as Mid-Shore Pro Bono in 2005 by a small group of dedicated and compassionate local judges and attorneys, who recognized the overwhelming need for basic civil legal services in the five Mid-Shore counties.It became the first regional pro bono organization in Maryland to connect private attorneys with people unable to afford representation for their civil legal issues.Since then, Shore Legal Access has been dedicated to making representation affordable and accessible to Eastern Shore residents facing civil legal challenges in the areas of family law, life planning, consumer debt relief, housing and criminal record expungement, including cannabis-related records.Each year, Shore Legal Access connects more than 3,000 individuals with legal help they might otherwise not have received, ensuring that justice truly is for all. \n \n Caption: Shore Legal Access of Easton and Salisbury recently presented its Volunteer Attorney of the Year awards as part of the annual National Celebration of Pro Bono.

However, maybe you agree with Eugene Ionesco: \"We haven't the time to take our time.\"At the bridge table, though, we should take our time.When the dummy appears, all three active players should pause to plan the campaign.Sometimes we must judge the right time to win a particular trick.Today's deal was declared by Roger Trezel, a Frenchman who died in 1986. How did he time the play in five spades after West had led the diamond king? West's bidding isn't recommended. First, why preempt when you might be able to make three no-trump? A two-diamond overcall is normal. Second, having jumped to four diamonds, West shouldn't have bid five.If he was willing to go to five diamonds, he should have bid it on the first round.Despite West's sacrifice, Trezel wasn't willing to assume that East had the club ace. To try to establish the heart suit without risking East's gaining the lead, Trezel ducked the opening lead.When West continued with a diamond to dummy's ace, declarer discarded a low heart. South drew trumps, cashed the heart ace, played a heart to dummy's king and ruffed a heart. Back to dummy with a trump, Trezel discarded two club losers on dummy's heart winners.Nicely done.At another table, South won the first trick with dummy's diamond ace. However, after drawing trumps ending in the dummy, he called for the diamond two. When East failed to put in the 10, South discarded a low heart and recovered from his earlier error. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Why do you want to know? Get them to open up and share what's on their mind.People are generally so fixated on themselves that these answers are probably all about them. It could be that they are fascinated by how you live the life you do.They could be curious about how you are able to manage your expenses based on their perception of your income compared to theirs. They may be envious that you can afford things they cannot.Ask so that you can learn.Even so, you do not have to answer.

One weapon in this armoury of attack is the five card weak two-bid. It isn't my style, but it does have its moments, like in today's deal.North expected a six-card suit opposite.Against four hearts doubled, West led the diamond ace: five, three, four. He continued with three rounds of hearts to stop a diamond ruff in the dummy.To make the contract, South had to establish a spade for a diamond discard, and he had to find the club queen. He played a spade to dummy's king, cashed the ace and ruffed a spade in hand.Declarer judged that West had three diamond honours because East hadn't played a higher diamond at trick one. Along with the heart ace-king and spade queen, that made at least 17 points.Clearly East, not West, had the club queen. However, South had to be careful.He led the club seven to dummy's king. Next came the club jack. East didn't cover, so the jack won the trick. Now followed a spade ruff, the club ace, a club to dummy's 10 and the fifth spade for a diamond discard.Well played!If East had covered the club jack, declarer would have won with his ace and played the club nine to dummy's 10. Then, after a spade ruff, the carefully preserved club two would have been led to dummy's four to allow the discard on the spade 10.Finally, note that the opening lead of the heart eight will defeat the contract - but would anyone find that?©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some declarers, when they need a misdefense to make their contract, will play very quickly. This isn't kosher, but it often works.However, when defending, don't be hurried. Say that you want to take some time to think things through.Rather than rely on speed, it is preferable for the declarer to play his cards deceptively so that the defender doesn't see the trap in time.Playing in four hearts, the ingenuous declarer wins the first trick with dummy's club ace, draws trumps and plays a diamond to the king. Against some opponents, this will work. West will lead a second club, allowing South to ruff and discard one of dummy's spade losers on the diamond queen. However, against more sophisticated defenders, it won't succeed.First, East will play his two trumps in the order 5 then 2, trying to show a top honor in spades. Second, West will see that the club queen can wait. He will recognize the possibility of a discard and switch to the spade four at trick five.As South knows East has the club king and is marked with a top spade (West didn't lead the spade ace or king), West must hold the diamond ace.A more deceptive approach is to lead dummy's diamond at trick two and put in the nine. If West falls for the trap, later South can ruff out West's diamond ace and get his discard.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings - Good Will To Men\n\n December 6, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Doug Morley; Pastor, Greater Impact | Page: 20 | Section: News \n \n 339\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In 1864, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow heard the church bells ring on Christmas day and, as a result, wrote the following poem: \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day, Their old familiar carols play, And wild and sweet the words repeat, Of peace on earth, good will to men.I thought how, as the day had come, The belfries of all Christendom, Had rolled along the unbroken song, Of peace on earth, good will to men.And in despair I bowed my head: 'There is no peace on earth,' I said, 'For hate is strong and mocks the song, Of peace on earth, good will to men.'\" Longfellow's poem reflects the struggle between the promise of God's peace and the turmoil of this fallen and broken world. Wars in Ukraine and Israel, political divisions, racial unrest, economic uncertainty all seek to steal our peace and cause us to question God's \"good will\" for humanity.Besides lamenting a country at war, Longfellow was grieving the loss of his wife and the news that his oldest son had been severely wounded in battle. From all outward appearances, Longfellow's world was falling apart. But as the church bells continued to chime, something divine took hold of his heart and changed his disposition from despair to hope: \"Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: 'God is not dead, nor doth he sleep; The wrong shall fail, the right prevail, With peace on earth, good will to men.'\" This is the hope of Christmas.This is the reason God came in the flesh and made His dwelling among us. This is the promise of Jesus' birth to a fallen and broken world.When we put our hope in Jesus and experience His mercy and grace for our own brokenness and sin, we not only experience the promise of God's peace on earth, but the ability to extend His good will to those around us.So, as we enter this Christmas season, tune your ears once again to the angels' song of \"peace on earth, good will to men.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

East won the first trick with the ace, cashed the club king (the accepted way of showing a doubleton) and exited with a diamond.With a guaranteed spade loser, declarer had to find the trump queen to make his contract. Assuming West had five clubs to East's two, there were 11 empty spaces in East's hand for the heart queen, but only eight in West's hand. However, those odds of 11-to-8 weren't good enough for South. He wanted to find out more about the distribution before committing himself.Judging that West would have led a singleton diamond if he had one, declarer overtook the diamond king with dummy's ace and discarded his club queen on dummy's diamond queen.Now came the spade queen from the dummy. East won with the ace and returned a diamond.Immediately South ruffed with the heart ace, cashed the spade king (discarding dummy's club loser) and ran the heart eight. When it won, he repeated the heart finesse, drew the last trump and claimed.Why was South so confident about the hearts? Because East had passed as dealer and already shown up with 11 points: the club ace-king and the spade ace. He couldn't hold a queen as well. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

South counted seven top tricks and anticipated getting two more from diamonds. He also knew an avoidance play when he saw one.South led a diamond to dummy's king, returned to hand with a spade and led a second diamond. If West had played the queen, South was planning to duck in the dummy, keeping East off the lead. However, when West played the 10, declarer put up dummy's ace and led a third round. South was pleased to see West win this trick, but he was less pleased when West promptly switched to the club nine (the high card denying interest in the suit) in answer to his partner's encouraging club seven discard on the previous trick.East won with the ace and returned a heart: down one.South's path required finding the diamonds 3-2, West's holding the club ace and West's having to win his side's diamond trick. However, there was a much better route available.Assuming West's heart three was an honest card, the suit had to be splitting 4-3. If so, South just needed to find West with the club jack. At trick two, South should have finessed dummy's club 10.His nine tricks would have been four spades, one heart, two diamonds and two clubs. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He switches to the diamond nine, two, 10 How should South continue?\nGiven North's opening bid, West must have led a singleton club ace. South must win trick two, to stop the lethal club ruff. However, even with a singleton, West's lead is unattractive. So declarer can place king-third of spades with West: some measure of trump control.\nIf this is the position and he attacks trumps now, West is bound to score a club ruff, East having a diamond entry.\nHave you seen the key play?\nSouth must hope that West has the heart jack. At trick three, he leads the heart ace, squashing dummy's king.\nThen he cashes the heart queen, discarding one of dummy's diamonds, and continues with the heart 10.\nAssuming West covers with the jack, declarer discards dummy's last diamond.\nWhen South regains the lead, he plays the spade ace and another spade. East never wins a trick, so West never gets his ruff.\nHowever, if West has the courage to play low smoothly on the heart 10, he might deflect declarer to defeat.\nThinking East has the heart jack, South might decide his only chance is to ruff and play the spade ace and another spade, hoping the trumps are 2-2.\nIf an opponent wants you to play a particular card, don't. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

How should South plan the play in five clubs, given that the trumps are breaking 2-1, not 3-0? West leads the heart king.\nTrue, three no-trump would have been a much easier contract. Maybe North should have rebid three spades over three clubs, but raising with primary support is rarely wrong.\nDeclarer could have banked everything on the diamond finesse, or he could have hoped for some luck in spades. However, South knew it was best to call on his opponents to play the spade suit for him. He won the first trick with his heart ace, played a diamond to dummy's ace and ruffed a diamond high in hand. He crossed to dummy twice with trumps and ruffed the last two diamonds, thus eliminating the minors. He then exited with his last heart.\nWhichever opponent wins the trick won't enjoy the experience. If he switches to a spade, declarer is assured of only one loser there.\nAnd if he returns a red suit, declarer ruffs in the dummy and discards his spade four.\nEither way, South loses only two major-suit tricks.\nGetting an opponent to help you is a design devoutly to be desired. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Wes Moore's office, the appointments were made in partnership with tribal leaders and councils.\nThe news release states that Bradshaw has \"lifelong ties to a range of cultural institutions and initiatives committed to supporting and promoting indigenous history.\"\nBorn in Cambridge, Bradshaw has spent his career in the agriculture, seafood and timber industries. He served on the Dorchester County Council, representing District 5, from 2014 through 2018. He served on the Maryland Heritage Areas Authority Board from 2016 to 2018.\nChief Donna Wolf Mother Abbott, of the Nause-Waiwash Band of Indians, said that she, along with other members of the Nause-Waiwash, are excited to have Bradshaw representing them.\n\"He knows what our needs are and what our concerns are,\" Abbott said. \"So we're happy to have him in that position.\"\nWhen Bradshaw got the news of the appointment, Abbott was the first person he told.\n\"I'm a historian and I learned a lot of indigenous history from her predecessor,\" Bradshaw said.\nIn his new role, Bradshaw, along with eight other appointees, will be tasked with helping to obtain state and federal recognition for the state's indigenous tribes and communities, collecting data on the contributions of the Marylands's indigenous communities and promoting awareness of those contributions.\nBradshaw said that he looks forward to working with those in education \"to teach them our history.\" He said he also looks forward to bringing attention to the needs of the tribal community.\n\"He will probably be working with different committees on hopefully getting the curriculum for the public schools system changed to include more of our history,\" Abbott said.\nBradshaw said he is excited to work with the other commissioners.\n\"I think we can accomplish some good things,\" he said.\n\"We've got a diverse representation of the tribal communities across the state.\" \n \n Caption: HEART OF CHESAPEAKE CO UNTRY HERITAGE AREA\n\n Heritage Board Vice Chair Tom Bradshaw (left) and Pat Neild, president emeritus of the South Dorchester Folk Museum, after the Museum's award from the Chesapeake Country Heritage Area was announced in 2022.

Paul Getty (who else?) said, \"If you can actually count your money, then you are not really a rich man.\"In rubber bridge for high stakes, if you can count the deal correctly, you will probably end up a rich (wo) man. South in today's deal tried--successfully--to find 10 tricks and so made his contract, despite the 4-1 trump break.\nPlaying in four hearts, South ducked the first spade trick, won the second and cashed his two top trumps, finding out that East had two certain heart tricks. How should South have continued? South might have rebid three no-trump, a contract he probably would have made, but that's another story.\nHaving won three of the first four tricks, South was faced with four major-suit losers. However, he spotted that he might be able to win 10 tricks before he lost four.\nAt trick five, declarer cashed his club ace. Then he played a club to dummy's king and ruffed a club in his hand, East discarding a diamond.\nNext came three rounds of diamonds, ending in the dummy. Luckily, East had to follow suit throughout.\nWith nine tricks in, declarer called for dummy's last club.\nSouth couldn't be stopped from making a trick from his two remaining hearts. His 10 tricks were one spade, four hearts, three diamonds and two clubs.\nWhat happened to the fourth defensive winner? Trick 13 could have been taken by either West's top spade or East's master trump. Two winners had been concertinaed--or telescoped, if you prefer--into one. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

What is it?The declarer enjoys a considerable advantage during the card-play. To try to balance the books (as my librarian phrases it), a defender makes the opening lead. Sometimes this is critical -- as in today's deal.\nNote that if the declarer plays first in four spades, he can draw trumps immediately, aided by the 2-2 split. Then he cashes his two top hearts and ruffs a heart in the dummy, bringing down West's queen. South graciously concedes three tricks.\nHowever, West made the opening lead tell. He selected the diamond two, which East won with the queen. As West had supported diamonds, East wasn't tempted to try to cash the diamond ace. Even if West had made an eccentric raise on three low diamonds, he would have led his highest diamond, not the two.\nEast switched to the club ace and continued with the club 10. After winning with the king, West saw what was needed to defeat the contract. He led another club, and East didn't let her partner down. She ruffed with the spade queen.\nSouth overruffed with the spade king, but now West had to win a trump trick. The uppercut had been decisively delivered.\nVoltaire said that marriage is the only adventure open to the cowardly. This East and West are not married, but apparently, after the deal was over, West said, \"Well defended, partner. I wish my wife played bridge as well as you do. She would have ruffed with the spade two.\"\nNo, I wasn't West.

The booth reads \"Guess Your Age - 25 cents.\" Inside, Lucy is sitting in another booth, with a big grin across her face. Her booth claims, \"Keep it a secret - $25.\" The segue from that to today's deal is obscure, even for me. Such is a bridge column occasionally.After a limit raise by North, South was in four spades.\nWest led the club jack.\nAfter winning in hand with his king and drawing two rounds of trumps ending in the dummy, South played a diamond to his queen and West's king. Back came another club. Confidently, declarer won with dummy's ace and played a diamond to his jack. However, West won with the ace and returned a club. Now South had to play the hearts for only one loser, but the defenders made no mistake, defeating the contract.\nWas South unlucky, or did he misplay?\nCertainly he was unlucky, but he also misplayed. After the club king and two rounds of trumps, South should cash dummy's club ace and ruff the last club in his hand. He returns to dummy with a trump and plays a diamond to his queen. After winning with the king, what can West return? If a club, it concedes a ruff-and-sluff. If a heart, South has only one loser in the suit. And if West continues diamonds, he establishes a trick for South.\nWhatever West does, the contract is made.\nHow did West guess to lead the club jack rather than a top diamond? Well, in real life he didn't, but after a diamond lead everyone made four spades. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Change the vulnerability to East-West. Give an auction, assuming South is the dealer and East-West retain a respectful silence.\nFor the remaining questions, assume neither side is vulnerable.\n3a. Look only at the North hand. South opens one spade. What would be your bidding plan? 3b. South opens one heart, you respond one spade (would you?), and South rebids one no-trump, showing 12-14 points. What would be your auction plan?\n4. Look only at the East hand. The auction starts one heart on your right.\nWould you intervene with one spadeft Assuming you pass, South responds three hearts (game-invitational limit raise), and North ends the auction with four hearts.\nWhat would you lead?\n5. Look only at the South hand. North opens one no-trump, 15-17 points. a.\nWhat would you respond? b. Would your answer differ between a pair event and a team match?\n6. Look only at the West hand. East opens one heart, and South overcalls two diamonds.

    "content": "Bridge - Deception by deduction\n\n December 26, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Phillip Alder | Page: A7 | Section: News \n \n 254\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n John Ruskin, who was an English art critic, discussed painters when he wrote, \"The essence of lying is in deception, not in words.\" In bridge, sometimes you lie in words when you make, for example, a psychic bid.During the play, sometimes you lie by false carding. In today's deal, a defender fooled declarer by dropping an unnecessarily high card. However, it helped that he had calculated his \"generosity\" couldn't cost a trick.\nIn four hearts, declarer won the first trick with his club ace and cashed the heart ace, \"dropping\" West's queen.\nWorried that East had four trumps, South immediately ran the diamond 10. East kept up the good defense, ducking his king. Suddenly fooled, South repeated the diamond finesse, but East won with the king and gave his partner a diamond ruff.\nWest cashed the club queen, and the heart jack was the fourth defensive trick.\nCool - but how did West know he could afford to play the heart queen? Well, if South had started with A-Jx-x of hearts, he would have played a heart to dummy's king and taken the trump finesse. So, when South started with the heart ace, East was marked with the jack. Dropping the queen was safe. Also, it couldn't mislead East, because South was marked with four hearts from the auction. (If South had opened one no-trump with five hearts, he would have drawn two rounds of trumps before taking the diamond finesse.)\nHowever, remember, when trying a deceptive defense, be careful not to deceive your partner more than declarer. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bridge - Lead declarer into the valley of death\n\n December 27, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Phillip Alder | Page: 9 | Section: News \n \n 232\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Thomas Gray, an 18thcentury English poet, wrote, \"The paths of glory lead but to the grave.\" Rather depressing, but in bridge, when you are on opening lead, you are planning how to dig a grave for the contract.On lead against three notrump, it is normal to start with the fourth-highest from your longest and strongest.\nHowever, today's deal highlights one time when a different approach will yield better dividends.\nAfter South opened with a strong no-trump and West overcalled two hearts, North bid three diamonds.\nIs this forcing, invitational or a sign-off? A very good question! Do you and your partner agree? Unless you use the Lebensohl convention (which, following an overcall, employs an artificial two no-trump to increase the possibilities), you cannot do more than select one interpretation. I would vote for game invitational. With a game-force, you either jump to three no-trump or cuebid the intervenor's suit and hope it all works out.\nAt the table, West led his fourth-highest heart.\nDeclarer called for dummy's jack and, when it held the trick, played on clubs. The defense was dead.\nHolding three aces, West should lead the heart ace. If the dummy has, say, three hearts, West will continue with a low heart, playing for declarer to hold kingdoubleton.\nHere, though, West leads the queen at trick two, pinning dummy's jack and hoping declarer doesn't have the 10. As you can see, this defense kills the contract. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

If it wins, an extra trick is in the bag.However, you should always consider what will happen if the finesse loses. Would it be better not to finesse?\nIn today's deal, North might have passed over two no trump, but he decided that that contract was unlikely to make exactly. Either the hearts would be useful and nine tricks won, or they wouldn't and he would be conceding an extra under trick by bidding game.\nWest led the club king: four, five, two. (Yes, leading the seven would have worked much better, but with two apparent entries, leading the honor looked preferable.)\nWest continued with the club nine: eight, jack, 10.\nEast switched to the spade two. How should South have continued from thereft\nThe first declarer finessed his spade queen, but West, feeling relieved, won with the king and played another club. When South led a heart, West grabbed his ace and cashed the clubs for down three.\nThe second declarer rose with the spade ace at trick three and led a heart to dummy's nine. When that won, South played a diamond to his queen and led his second heart. With the favorable lie, nine tricks were there for the taking.\nThe first declarer claimed how lucky the other declarer had been to find both heart honors onside tripleton.\nHowever, if East holds the heart queen, the contract is probably doomed. For one thing, West is likely to hold the spade king and heart ace for his vulnerable two-level overcall. Also, if West has the heart queen, the spade finesse can wait. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Bridge - The play allows you to save the day\n\n January 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Phillip Alder | Page: 7 | Section: News \n \n 272\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n There are two types of holiday: Those in which you rest, lying on a sun-drenched beach getting a tan; and those in which you are up and about, visiting places and seeing things. You return home from the former bored but refreshed. From the latter, you are enlightened but exhausted. You feel as if you need a holiday to recover from your holiday.In bridge, there are declarers who play as if they have their heads buried in the sand, and those who are all eyes open and aware of the possibilities.\nTheir differing approaches are highlighted in today's deal.\nNorth's raise to three notrump was correct, especially as East's opening bid had marked where the opposing cards lay.\nThe head-in-the-sand South won the first trick with the heart ace and immediately took the diamond finesse.\nHowever, East won with the king and cleared the heart suit. Declarer, with only eight tricks (two spades, two hearts and four diamonds), had to attack clubs. But East won immediately with the ace and cashed three heart tricks to defeat the contract.\nThe eyes-open declarer, who realized that East rated to have the club ace and diamond king for his opening bid, saw the right line. He crossed to dummy's spade king at trick two. Then he led a low club toward his king. East had to duck his ace, else declarer would have nine tricks via two spades, two hearts, one diamond and four clubs. After winning with the club king, South took the diamond finesse, setting up nine tricks: two spades, two hearts, four diamonds and one club.\n©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Koenig paid a surprise visit to St. Elizabeth of Hungary Roman Catholic Church the first Sunday of Advent, Dec. 3.It was the bishop's first visit to the church in Denton, which is part of the Caroline County parish that includes St. Benedict Church in Ridgely.\nKoenig is bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Wilmington, comprising Delaware and Maryland's Eastern Shore.\nKoenig preached the homily and celebrated Holy Communion with the Rev. Christopher Coffiey and Deacon Bill Nickum of Denton. He reminded the congregation who filled the sanctuary that Advent is a time of \"longing for a savior.\"\nHe shared the story of Saint John Paul II, who visited his native Poland shortly after he was elected pope in 1979.\nAs Pope John Paul II \"offered Mass in Warsaw, there were 300,000 people who attended that Mass, and there were millions who were watching on TV in Poland, as well as the other Eastern European countries,\" Koenig said.\n\"He spoke about the faith of the Polish people and their desire for freedom,\" Koenig said. As the pope preached, a threeword chant arose from the crowd, first quietly, then increasingly louder.\nThe chant \"wasn't 'Communists, go home,' it was, 'We want God, we want God,\" Koenig said. \"They knew that they needed a savior.\"\n\"They knew that that Savior was the one who was going to free them from the tyranny of Communist atheism, that the Savior had come to set us free,\" he said.\n\"As we begin the season of Advent, may we open our hearts up by first acknowledging and growing in the awareness of our need for a Savior, a Savior who wants us as much as we want him.\"\nThe Rev. Christopher Coffiey, pastor of St. Benedict-St. Elizabeth parish thanked the bishop for visiting, recalling that he had mentioned to Koenig a few months earlier that he had not yet visited St.\nElizabeth's, and Koenig answered, \"Well, one day I might shock you, and I might come.\"\n\"So I think the bishop really fulfilled the Gospel today, which says, 'Ye not know the day nor the hour,'\" Coffiey quipped as the congregation laughed. \n \n Caption: The Most Reverent William Koenig, bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Wilmington, center, visits St. Elizabeth of Hungary Roman Catholic Church the first Sunday of Advent Dec. 3.\n\n Flanking him are Deacon Bill Nickum, left, and the Rev.

I particularly like deals in which the \"normal\" play isn't right, for whatever reason.However, I also enjoy deals like today's, because most players would go down in five diamonds. Still, if you think of the right play, immediately you will know that it is correct.\nBe warned, though, that the theme isn't quite in Herman Melville's class.\nIn \"Moby Dick,\" he wrote, \"Give me a condor's quill! Give me Vesuvius' crater for an inkstand! To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.\"\nSouth might (should?) have bid four spades over four diamonds, reaching an easy contract to make as the cards lie. However, in love with his eight-card suit, South went for five diamonds. After West led the club king, how should South have planned the play?\nThe declarer ruffed the lead, drew trumps and cashed dummy's top spades. This was reasonable play, because if West had the spade queen, the contract was always safe.\nHowever, when South led a third spade, East produced the queen and switched to the heart queen, defeating the contract. Where did South go wrong?\nAs so often happens, the error occurred at trick one.\nSouth should discard a spade. Let's suppose West continues with another club. South ruffs, draws the trumps, cashes dummy's top spades and ruffs a spade in hand. Declarer returns to dummy with a trump and discards his two hearts on dummy's brace of spade winners. Instead of down one, declarer harvests an overtrick. Then West will wonder if he should have found the lethal low club lead. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

But if you did think of it, you knew immediately that it was right. Today's deal is similar, except that it is even harder to find the best play.Don't peek at the East-West cards. You (South) reach four hearts after West has overcalled in diamonds. He starts the defense by cashing the two top trumps, East following both times, and switching to the spade nine.\nWhat now?\nNorth, with three hearts and a side-suit singleton, was fully justified in driving to game.\nSouth won the third trick with dummy's spade ace, ruffed a spade in hand, cashed the diamond ace, ruffed a diamond in the dummy and ruffed another spade in hand. When the suit didn't break 3-3, South fell back on the club finesse. However, it lost, and a diamond to West's king spelled down one.\nDid you spot the best play?\nAfter the first spade ruff in hand, South should lead the diamond queen from his hand!\nWhen West wins with the king, as he surely will, he may have no good return.\nAnother spade, if West has one, will probably establish dummy's suit. A diamond is into South's A-10 tenace.\nA club is thrown from the dummy, and South's club loser is ruffed in the dummy.\nFinally, a club switch by West gives South two chances. He plays low from the dummy, winning three club tricks whenever West has either the 10 or the queen.\nAs John F. Kennedy said, \"You can't depend on your judgment when your imagination is out of focus.\" ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Some thoughts on those New Year's resolutions\n\n January 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 607\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n An enduring annual tradition for me (and I assume for many others) at the start of a new calendar year is making New Year's resolutions.Another annual enduring tradition for me (and I assume for many others) is that sometime during the new year, often sooner rather than later, any hopes of accomplishing New Year's resolutions are abandoned.\nWhen that that happens to me, I tell myself, \"Well… maybe next year.\" I do that without acknowledging the same outcome will certainly reoccur without doing something new and different.\nThis year, my top New Year's resolution is to use new and different approaches to convert more resolutions into accomplishments.\nThe approaches in order of importance and execution are:\nEmbrace a sense of urgency.\nDevelop SMART goals.\nDevelop and execute tactics to achieve SMART goals.\nDocument all SMART goals and tactics in writing.\nReview goal progress regularly.\nRegarding embracing a sense of urgency, Professor John Kotter has written, \"The single most crucial factor in achieving permanent and meaningful change is a continuous sense of urgency. A true sense of urgency occurs when people acknowledge action on critical issues is needed now, not eventually, not when it fits easily into a schedule. Now means making real progress every single day. Urgent behavior is not driven by a belief that all is well or that everything is a mess but, instead, that the world contains great opportunities and great hazards.\"\nRegarding SMART goals, they are to be specific, measurable, audacious, realistic and time sensitive. On the matter of audacious goals, Peter F. Drucker has written \"There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.\"\nIn other words, go big on your goals or go home.\nRegarding developing and executing tactics to achieve SMART goals, tactics are the necessary next steps in priority order to achieve each SMART goal. Professor Gail Matthews has written that the following questions need to be considered:\nWhat exact actions do I need to do to achieve my goals and in what order?\nWhat resources do I need?\nWho can help me achieve my goals?\nWhat at potential problems should I anticipate?\nHow can I address them?\nRegarding goal progress tracking, Professor Matthews has also written that \"76 percent of those who wrote down their goals, took actions on them and reviewed weekly progress reports achieved their goals. This result is 33 percent higher than those participants with unwritten goals.\"\nRegarding written records components, the following components are essential:\ngoal categories, e.g., health, family, personal growth, professional growth, and career. Other essential critical written components in addition to a list of SMART goals are tactics, due dates, current status reports and notes.\nFor best results, custom design your New Year's resolution game plan. The exact number of goal categories, SMART goals, tactics and projected due dates are for you to decide based on where you are and where you want to be on your life journey. All can be kept privately or be shared confidentially with a trusted and supportive coach.\nSome concluding thoughts on success with New Year's resolutions:\nWe live in a VUCA world, a world characterized by high levels of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. Despite planning, commitment and hard work, some New Year's resolutions may still not be achieved in one year. That is not a reason to abandon them. SMART goals can and always be rolled forward into a following year.\nHappy New Year and all the best on success with your resolutions for 2024 and in the years ahead.\nDavid Reel is a consultant who provides counsel and services on strategy, advocacy and media on public affairs issues.

    "date": "2024-01-07",
    "author": "TIMOTHY HOLDINESS",
    "content": "Finding a political identity in a red state\n\n January 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TIMOTHY HOLDINESS | Section: Columns \n \n 526\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Born into a Republican family in Louisiana, a state increasingly painted in shades of red, I grew up amid conservative dialogues with honest values. My childhood was steeped in Republican ideologies, shaping my early political outlook. However, as I matured, my views began to diverge from my family's, leading me on a journey through America's polarized political landscape.My first significant political shift occurred during my college years. Drawn to Bernie Sanders' progressive policies and candid demeanor, I found myself aligning more with the Democratic Party. Sanders' message of social justice and economic equality resonated with me, contrasting sharply with the conservative values I was raised on. This shift was not just ideological but deeply personal, reflecting a desire for a more equitable society.\nHowever, disillusionment soon set in. As the Democratic Party nominated a candidate I couldn't wholeheartedly support in the 2016 election, I switched my registration to the Green Party and voted for Jill Stein in protest. This decision, born out of frustration with the party's direction, was my way of asserting a political identity independent of the mainstream options.\nYet, this stance was short-lived. Recognizing the practical limitations of third-party voting in our binary political system, I returned to the Democratic fold. But this reunion was not a homecoming; it was a strategic choice, a compromise of sorts.\nToday, I stand as an independent, disenchanted with the binary party system that seems more focused on partisan rivalry than on addressing the real issues facing our nation. As a Louisianian, this stance is particularly challenging. Louisiana's political landscape has become overwhelmingly Republican, often leaving little room for alternative viewpoints. This environment has sharpened my understanding of political diversity and the importance of open, respectful discourse.\nLiving in Louisiana has offered unique insights into the Republican psyche. It has helped me understand the concerns and motivations the GOP, even as I disagree with some of their policies, I can't help but agree with others. This understanding is crucial in a state like ours, where political discussions can quickly become divisive, it's important to be able to see from all points of view and vote for action over ideas.\nThe journey from a Republican upbringing to a Democratic supporter, then to a protest voter, and finally to an independent, mirrors a broader disillusionment with party politics in America. It reflects a yearning for a political system that transcends binary choices and embraces a more nuanced, inclusive approach to governance, as many other nations on Earth.\nAs a nation, we face a critical question: How do we foster a political environment where diverse viewpoints are not just tolerated but valued? My journey suggests the answer lies in embracing our political diversity, engaging in open dialogue and prioritizing issues over party allegiance.\nMy political evolution is not just a personal narrative; it's a reflection of a growing segment of Americans disenchanted with the two-party system. As a Louisianian, I've witnessed firsthand the limitations of this system. Perhaps it's time for our state, and our country, to embrace a new political paradigm — one that truly represents the diverse voices of its people.\nTimothy Holdiness is a community Rreporter for The Daily News in Washington Parish, Louisiana. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Many use this time to make New Years resolutions — promises to do better. Start going to the gym. Start eating right. Start going to church more often. These are all good things.\nBut too often these resolutions are short-lived.\nI believe that in order to continue pursuing our resolutions and goals, there are three significant things in 2024 that we must also be challenged to quit. It is time to quit making excuses, quit procrastinating and quit complaining.\nMost likely you can look back and find many occasions last year where you found yourself making excuses by saying, \"I cannot do this because I am too old, too young, too tall, too overwhelmed, too poor, too busy, not smart enough, not prepared enough.\"\n\"So, I'll put it off until tomorrow. I'll do it later. I'll start when I have more time or energy or money.\"\nThis then leads to complaining. We complain because we aren't where we want to be or because we don't have what we want or because life hasn't given us what we feel we deserve. We complain because we are too old, too young, too tall, too overwhelmed, too poor, too busy, not smart enough, not prepared enough. And it becomes an endless cycle: make excuses, procrastinate, complain.\nWhat if this year we were to quit making excuses, quit procrastinating and quit complaining about our situation and instead took action with God's help to continue pursuing the significant changes in our lives.\nI believe that 2024 could be our best year so far. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'This is our mandate': What's driving Evangelical Christians steadfast support for Israel and the war against Hamas in Gaza\n\n January 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Newspapers | Section: World \n \n 1939\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Shawn York said he felt \"a commission\" to support Israel and to \"do something\" after Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks that sparked the war in Gaza.York is lead pastor at Highpoint Church in Gulf Breeze, Florida. The 1,100-member Evangelical church is located near Pensacola.\nYork partnered with local Jewish rabbis and hosted \"A Night to Honor Israel\" event in December to show solidarity after the Hamas attacks that killed more than 1,200 people Oct. 7 and to condemn antisemitism.\nThe Evangelical pastor said the event came together after meeting with a local rabbi whose synagogue had been vandalized after the Oct. 7 attacks sparked Israel Defense Force airstrikes and a later ground invasion of Gaza aimed at dismantling Hamas.\n\"We had a cup of coffee and hit it off,\" said York, adding that the pro-Israel event was aimed at bringing the local religious community together. \"It was a very grassroots effort.\"\nAcross the U.S, Evangelical Christians have emerged as some of the strongest supporters of Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's war against Hamas and other Islamic militants.\nSome conservative Christians point to biblical instructions to support Israel and the Jewish people. Others also see events in the Holy Land as part of 'End Times' prophecies that result in establishment of a third Jewish temple in Jerusalem (where the Al-Asqa Mosque sits) and eventually the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.\nSix hundred people attended the Florida event in-person and another 1,400 have watched it online. York said it is in important to get supportive messages out about Israel pointing to a rise in antisemitism and vocal criticisms of the war and supportive U.S. policies on social media as well as from progressives and pro-Palestinian activists on college campuses.\n\"Israel's fight is a cyber war just as much as a ground war,\" the Florida pastor.\n'AMEN FOR THAT'\nYork said he and his wife had previously visited Israel and toured the Gaza border. He was at a conference hosted by Christians United for Israel in Texas in the midst of the Holy Land war.\nChristians United is a pro-Israel group formed by prominent pastor and television evangelist John Hagee. The group was one of the organizers of the March for Israel rally in November on the Washington Mall and has helped local churches put on their own events.\nThe San Antonio-based group did not respond to requests for an interview about their efforts.\nThe group's 2022 nonprofit tax form said its mission is to \"increase the knowledge of Christian Zionists in order to help them become more effective in defending Israel to the public and in Washington.\"\nThe \"Christian Zionist' group's goal is to train Evangelicals, including pastors, to become advocates for Israel and to lobby every member of Congress by dividing them into \"hundreds of 'teams'.\"\n\"CUFI Action Fund will instruct approximately 5,000 attendees at a Washington D.C. meeting on what it takes to effectively influence Congress,\" the tax filing reads.\nThe pro-Israel group also said in the filing that it would \"select over 300 attendees who possessed exceptional communication skills and have wide circles of influence in their communities to be Action Fund leaders.\"\nA number of churches have partnered with Christians United to host events supporting Israel since the war started.\nThat includes the Grand Island Baptist Church, which hosted a \"Stand with Israel\" event in December and had another update on the Middle East situation on Sunday, Jan. 14.\nGrand Island Baptist Pastor Freddy Young told his congregation that CUFI has 13 million members and is an important advocate for pro-Israel policies in the U.S.\n\"CUFI is the largest grassroots organization supporting Israel to be found anywhere in the world. Amen for that,\" Young said during the Dec. 4 event.\n\"When people in Washington D.C. do crazy things, we blow their computers ups. We can send them several thousand messages in almost the snap of a finger.\"\nHagee and CUFI are organizing an annual summit for pastors and other Christians supporters of Israel in Washington in late July.\n\"The people of Israel are fighting to protect their loved ones and their ancient homelands. We must stand by Israel,\" Hagee said in a social media post voicing biblical support for Israel, its right of self-defense and its battle with Hamas. \"Together, we can show the Jewish people that they are not alone.\"\nSome other Christian cable networks and television evangelists have also been supportive of Israel after the Oct. 7 attacks.\nJoni Lamb, co-founder and executive producer of the Daystar Television Network, told viewers that the Texas-based Christian cable channel had raised more than $6 million since the October attacks to support Israel including sending protective gear, mobile bomb shelters and provisions to communities impacted by the war.\nThe dynamic places Evangelicals not only among the strongest backers of Netanyahu but aligns one of former president Donald Trump's most solid constituencies with U.S. President Joe Biden who has vowed steadfast support for Israel and also calls himself a Zionist, advocating for Jewish homeland and nation-state in the Middle East.\nNetanyahu has invoked biblical passages during the war including a reference to Amalek and Amalekites — an Old Testament foe of the Israelites. Israeli officials say they have killed approximately 8,500 Hamas and other Islamic militants fighter in Gaza in addition to the 1,000 fighters killed during the Oct. 7 attacks inside Israel that also included more than 240 hostages being taken into the Palestinian territory.\n'WE CANNOT LET THIS SLIP AWAY'\nOther Evangelical Christians say their cause is two-fold — to support Israel's war against Hamas and to combat a rise in antisemitism that has manifested since the bombings and ground invasion.\nAntisemitic incidents are up 360% since the Hamas attacks and ensuing war compared to a year ago, according to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\"The American Jewish community is facing a threat level that's now unprecedented in modern history,\" said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO. \"It's shocking that we've recorded more antisemitic acts in three months than we usually would in an entire year.\"\nADL reports 3,238 incidents between Oct. 7 and Jan. 7, including anti-Israel, anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish rhetoric at pro-Palestinian and anti-war rallies on U.S. college campuses, That compares to 712 antisemitic incidents a year ago.\nThe rise in antisemitism — along with supporting Israel after the Hamas terror attacks — are calls to action for many American Evangelicals..\n\"We cannot let this slip away and not be noticed by the world or understood,\" said Tiz Huch, who is part of a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Christian ministry with her husband Larry Huch.\n\"And this is our mandate — is to tell the world. The battle (between) light and darkness is real. And we all have to step up and do our part and be a voice for goodness and for God in the world today,\" said Tiz Huch during a broadcast and social media post Thursday, Jan. 11.\nThe Oklahoma-based ministry also sees End Times prophecies in the intersections of faiths in the Middle East.\n\"We will stand with Israel, repair the breach between Jews and Christians and fulfill biblical prophecy. This is how we prepare the world for the coming of the Messiah,\" Huch Ministries says on its website in a statement on support for Israel.\n'A USELESS SLAUGHTER'\nBut not all Christians are as steadfastly supportive of the Holy Land war and all its human costs.\nThere have been more than 24,000 deaths in Gaza since the war's start, according to Palestinian health authorities. Another 8,000 people are missing beneath the rubble. Most are presumed dead. More than 1.5 million people have been displaced and many of Gaza's homes and buildings have been destroyed since the war started in October.\nSave the Children International says approximately 10,000 children have died in Gaza since the war started. \"Gaza is becoming a graveyard for children,\" said United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres earlier this month.\nApproximately two dozen Christians have died in Gaza during the war. That includes those killed at St. Porphyrius Church in October and two women killed at the Holy Family Church campus in December.\nThe former was built in the 5th Century and the latter is the only Catholic parish in Gaza where there are only an estimated 1,000 Christians in an overwhelming Muslim area of 2.3 million people.\nThe Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem — which oversees Roman Catholic parishes in the Holy Land and Cyprus — blamed Israel Defense Forces for the killing of a woman and her adult daughter and the shelling of a convent building at the church compound. The IDF says it is not to blame for the church shootings or damage to the Catholic property.\nAn Israeli spokesperson said in a statement that it takes military actions against Hamas in civilian areas \"with the utmost seriousness — especially churches — considering that Christian communities are a minority group in the Middle East.\"\n\"The IDF only targets terrorists and terror infrastructure and does not target civilians, no matter their religion. The IDF takes vast measures to avoid harm to uninvolved civilians, while fighting against a terrorist organization which does everything to put civilians at risk — including by using civilians and holy sites as human shields for its terror activities,' the Israeli statement continued.\nPope Francis, the World Council of Churches and the heads of Anglican and Episcopal churches have called for ceasefires in the war.\n\"Civilian victims are not collateral damage. They are men and women with names and surnames who lose their lives. They are children who are orphaned and deprived of their future,\" Pope Francis said Jan. 10.\nCatholic officials previously condemned the shooting deaths and injuries at the Holy Family parish. The pope also called the war and its heavy humanitarian toll in Gaza a \"useless slaughter that offends the dignity of every person on earth.\"\n'THE DOWNTRODDEN AND THE OPPRESSED'\nHoly Land Christians — which include Armenian, Greek and other Orthodox denominations as well as Roman Catholics, Anglicans and Evangelical Lutherans — have criticized American Evangelicals and others supporting the war citing its humanitarian costs.\nIn an open letter to American and other Western Christians, a coalition of Holy Land Christians questioned support for the war and called for a focus on Jesus' message of peace and mercy.\n\"We reject all theologies and interpretations that legitimize the wars of the powerful. We strongly urge western Christians to come alongside us in this. We also remind ourselves and fellow Christians that God is the God of the downtrodden and the oppressed,\" the letter reads.\nThere are also an estimated 50,000 Christians living in Jerusalem and the West Bank (which has a population of 3 million) and 158,000 living in Israel (which has a population of 9.7 million)\nChristmas celebrations — including Bethlehem where Jesus was born — were subdued and decorations taken down because of the war in Gaza and conflicts in the West Bank and Lebanon where the IDF is exchanging fire with Hezbollah.\nIn the U.S., the Episcopal Church has called for the U.S. to tell Israel to stop the attacks in Gaza.\nJustin Amash, a former Michigan congressman and Palestinian-American Christian, points in a Substack article earlier this month that Gaza has been home to one of the longest standing Christian communities. Mary, Jesus and Joseph passed through the area in their biblical journeys to and from Egypt.\n\"A lot of people were surprised to learn there are Christians living in Gaza, but this community has existed since the earliest days of Christianity. Followers of Christ have long called Gaza home,\" said Amash who lost family members in the Orthodox church bombing.\n\"The people known today as Palestinian Christians are the descendants of Canaanites, Phoenicians, and Israelites who resided in the region that comprises present-day Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank. Palestinian Christians can trace much of their ancestry back to Jews and Samaritans who lived in the Levant thousands of years ago and became early Christians,\" Amash writes. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The ballot process has begun, and it is mid-January.\nFunny how elections everywhere seemed to pretty much go off without much controversy for many decades. I'm sure someone will come up with a small incident and make it sound like something major but as usual, the hysterical comments will surely arrive.\nI just received in the mail, taxpayer paid, forms to apply for voter mail-in ballots for this years elections. You can opt to get mail-in ballots for future elections as well. Believe it or not you can also print these online yourself. Yes, print your own. What could possibly go wrong? Nothing, according to the Democrats and socialists who have pushed this agenda for years.\nOur government, our military, our schools and our banks have been hacked by people who have bad intentions or just the plain everyday criminals. But why worry about our votes? Sure voting may be difficult for a very small group of citizens and that has been and will always be the case.\nDoes anybody think that computer fraud is not an even greater risk to our democracy? Who started this ridiculous \"risk to our democracy\" campaign anyway? How cliche. It seems like only a select few believe that this new era of voting technology will go smoothly because that is what supports that group's agenda. Watch what accusations and problems are sure to happen during this election cycle.\nOur presidential elections are in the fall as usual and just about the time that our annual fall harvests conclude. Funny that it's about the same time the election ballot harvesting will begin. Maybe I'm the only one who thinks our election balloting process has gone down a dark road. I doubt that I'm alone.

    "content": "Moral sanity arises from both sides of war\n\n January 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ROBERT C. KOEHLER | Section: Columns \n \n 887\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n \"I am begging the world: stop all the wars, stop killing people, stop killing babies. War is not the answer ... War is not how you fix things. This country, Israel, is going through horror. And I know the mothers in Gaza are going through horror ...\"I can only kneel in awe.\nYes, there is sanity in the world — moral sanity — even, and especially, now, as revenge rages in Israel, fed by American armaments. There are courageous voices calling not simply for \"peace,\" essentially understood by much of the world as nothing more than a ceasefire, but for, oh my God, compassion, healing, love.\nThe \"enemy\" is as human as we are. And waging war against the enemy guarantees nothing but ... endless war.\nThe words above are those of Michal Haley, whose beloved son was murdered by Hamas, crying out in a Facebook video: \"In my name, I want no vengeance.\"\nPerhaps what matters most here is that she is not alone. Many courageous people across the planet are speaking out against the current war — the current genocide — from their wounded souls, demanding that the human race transcend its commitment to violence, dominance and revenge, which do nothing but perpetuate the carnage. War equals suicide.\nIt's also seductive and lucrative and built into the planet's geopolitical infrastructure. It's so simple: good vs. evil. It makes a great narrative, which much of the media surrenders to. Transcending the mindset of war requires facing life at a far deeper level of complexity, beginning, perhaps, with the understanding that all of humanity and all of life are connected. Most people know this, but the dark psychology of dehumanization — \"othering,\" creating an enemy to blame for our troubles — retains a prominent place in the collective mind.\nTranscending this may be the biggest challenge we face. What's crucial to understand is that this challenge is underway. South Africa's charge before the International Court of Justice that Israel is committing genocide against Palestine is one example of this.\nAs Craig Mokhiber and Phyllis Bennis write: (The case) \"has opened a crack in a 75-year-old wall of impunity through which a light of hope has begun to shine. If global protests can seize the moment to turn that crack into a wider portal towards justice, we may just see the beginnings of real accountability for perpetrators, redress for victims, and attention to the long-neglected root causes of violence: settler-colonialism, occupation, inequality, and apartheid.\"\nBut South Africa's challenge is only part of the global outrage against Israel's war on Palestine — and the challenge amounts to more than simply a ceasefire. It is also a cry for transcendence. For instance:\n\"We condemn the recent attacks on Israeli and Palestinian civilians and mourn such harrowing loss of life. In our grief, we are horrified to see the fight against antisemitism weaponized as a pretext for war crimes with stated genocidal intent.\"\nThis is from an open letter to the world, signed by several thousand Jewish writers, artists and activists, declaring that condemnation of the slaughter of Palestinians is the opposite of antisemitism. The letter continues:\n\"We find this rhetorical tactic antithetical to Jewish values, which teach us to repair the world, question authority, and champion the oppressed over the oppressor. It is precisely because of the painful history of antisemitism and lessons of Jewish texts that we advocate for the dignity and sovereignty of the Palestinian people. We refuse the false choice between Jewish safety and Palestinian freedom; between Jewish identity and ending the oppression of Palestinians. In fact, we believe the rights of Jews and Palestinians go hand-in-hand. The safety of each people depends on the other's.\"\nOh my God, this is what matters: the cessation of the stripping of religion from its deepest values and turning it into a game of dominance. My religion's better than yours. We are at a stage of our existence where we must begin disarming our hatred and fear and facing the future with — you might say — empowered compassion. We must begin living our deepest values, not simply \"defending\" them. This is moral sanity.\nAnd the voices the people who are saying this with the most courageous clarity are the ones who have been wounded by, or who have lost loved ones to, the moral insanity that continues to cut swaths across our world.\nHere's another such voice, one of many quoted by Orly Noy in +972 Magazine. The words are those of Maoz Inon, whose parents were killed in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack: \"My parents were people of peace ... Revenge is not going to bring my parents back to life. It is not going to bring back other Israelis and Palestinians killed either. It is going to do the opposite ... We must break the cycle.\"\nYes, yes, yes.\nPlease, please, please.\nIt is time to break the cycle. I address the words to Joe Biden, along with everyone else. It's not sufficient to tell Israel to \"be careful\" when it uses our bombs, to try to avoid killing (too many) children.\nIt's time to break the cycle. That means living our values, not defying them. That means ceasing to wage war.\nRobert Koehler is a Chicago award-winning journalist and editor. He is the author of \"Courage Grows Strong at the Wound,\" and his newly released album of recorded poetry and art work, \"Soul Fragments.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Breakfast anytime\n\n January 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1499\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n One of my favorite meals any time of the day is breakfast.There are no limitations as to what foods are considered breakfast foods and no specified time of the day this meal is to be held.\nEvery person I surveyed stated time did not matter, and many welcomed the change, stating they enjoyed eating breakfast for dinner.\nGrowing up on the farm, there were no deviations to the meal schedule. Breakfast every morning consisted of breakfast foods: cereal, oatmeal, eggs with breakfast meat — bacon, scrapple, sausage — pancakes with breakfast meat, and fresh baked biscuits or toast smeared with homemade butter and jelly.\nThis was not just at our house. This was a country breakfast.\nWith the hen house close by, you could go out and get a freshly laid egg or pick one from the brown egg basket filled with eggs from a day or two before.\nMany \"town\" cooks would come out to the farm to buy the eggs for the big weekend breakfast and baking needs.\nI rarely ever went into the hen house unless it was my turn to pick up the eggs. Everyone knew when it was my turn as I took a broom with me and swatted at the hens to get them off the nest, and they tried to peck at me. The fight was on!\nNeedless to say, I always got less eggs than my brothers.\nEnjoy today's recipes, but most of all, enjoy a weekday suppertime breakfast relaxing without having to cook an elaborate meal.\nEGG AND POTATO CASSEROLE\n1 tbsp olive oil, 1 small onion (finely chopped), 1 green bell pepper (diced), 2 medium russet potatoes (diced into small ½ inch cubes), ¾ tsp salt (divided into ½ tsp and ¼ tsp), ¾ tsp ground black pepper (divided into ½ tsp and ¼ tsp), 5 large eggs, ½ cup cheddar cheese (shredded) and your favorite brand of hot sauce if you like a little kick. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Sauté the onions for 1 minute. Add the green peppers, potatoes, ½ tsp salt and ½ tsp black pepper and continue to sauté for another 4 minutes until onions are soft and tender. Transfer to a lightly greased 9x9-inch casserole pan and spread out evenly. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs and remaining salt and pepper. Pour the egg mixture evenly into the casserole pan. Sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top (optional). Bake in a 350-degree oven for 35-40 minutes, or until eggs are cooked firmly. Dab some of your favorite hot sauce on there and enjoy.\nHOMEMADE SOUTHERN BISCUITS\n2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour (plus 1/4 cup more for dusting), 2 tsps baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter (frozen), 1 cup buttermilk. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 450 degrees. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a medium bowl; set aside. Place a box grater over a small piece of parchment paper. Grate the frozen butter on the large holes of a box grater. When you get down to a small nub of butter, chop that nub into 5 to 6 small pieces. Use the piece of parchment paper to transfer the butter to the dry ingredients. Use your fingers to sift the butter into the flour and break up any clumps of grated butter. Pour in the buttermilk and beat it in with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.\nTransfer the dough to a lightly floured cutting board. Pat the dough into a 1-inch-thick, rough rectangle. Sprinkle the dough with a little more flour, if needed. Fold the dough in half from top to bottom, then pat it back down into its original shape. Repeat with the folding and patting, alternating folding from each side, the bottom, and the top until you have completed a total of 8 folds. At the end, the dough should be a little springy to the touch. Pat the dough into a 1-inch thickness. Use a 3-inch round cutter to cut the dough into 6 biscuits. If you don't get 6 the first time around, refold and pat down the excess dough and cut more as needed. Discard the scraps of leftover dough. Arrange the biscuits in a 10-inch cast iron skillet so that the biscuits touch each other, but not the sides of the pan. Put the skillet in the oven and increase the oven temperature to 500 degrees. Bake until the biscuits are golden-brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove the skillet from the oven and immediately remove the biscuits from the pan to a clean tea towel. And since you have freshly made biscuits…\nSAUSAGE AND GRAVY WITH BISCUITS\n1/4 pound bulk pork sausage, 2 tbsps butter, 2 to 3 tbsps all-purpose flour, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1-1/4 to 1-1/3 cups whole milk, warm biscuits. In a small skillet, cook sausage over medium heat until no longer pink, 3-5 minutes, breaking it into crumbles; drain. Add butter and heat until melted. Add the flour, salt and pepper; cook and stir until blended. Gradually add the milk, stirring constantly. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Serve with biscuits.\nCORNMEAL PANCAKES\n1-1/3 cups all-purpose flour, 2/3 cup cornmeal, 2 tbsps sugar, 4 tsps baking powder, 1 tsp salt, 2 large eggs, 1-1/3 cups 2% milk, 1/4 cup canola oil. Combine the first five ingredients. In another bowl, whisk eggs, milk and oil; stir into dry ingredients just until moistened. Pour batter by 1/4 cupful's onto a lightly greased hot griddle. Turn when bubbles on top begin to pop; cook until the second side is golden brown. Serve with your favorite maple syrup.\nHONEY WHEAT TOAST\n2 pieces of your favorite wheat bread, 2 tbsps of honey, 2 tbsps of butter. Lightly toast bread then smear the butter on bread. After butter has been spread on bread, drizzle the honey over bread. Serve as a good breakfast or after dinner treat.\nCURED SMOKED BACON\n3lb skinless boneless pork belly, 3 tbsps salt, 1/3 cup white sugar, 2 tbsps pepper, 2 tsps paprika,1 tsp pink curing salt (you can buy online), apple or cherry wood chunks/chips. Start by curing the belly: In a small bowl, combine the pepper, sugar, paprika, salt and curing salt. Place belly on a foil-lined tray and pat dry with paper towels. Using half of the cure mix, sprinkle evenly over the surface of the belly, and rub in gently. Turn over and repeat on the other side with the remaining mix. Place the entire belly and curing mix into a large zip top bag and place in the refrigerator for seven days. Each day the belly should be flipped onto the other side, and the contents (which will transform to a liquid) should be massaged around. After seven days, remove from the bag and rinse under water. Pat dry with paper towels, and place back in the fridge uncovered (on a rack over a pan to catch any drips) for 24 hours. Smoke the now cured belly using the apple or cherry wood for three hours at 200 degrees, or until internal temperature reaches 150 degrees. Store bacon in an airtight plastic bag or container in the refrigerator for up to a week, cutting and cooking as required.\nHOMEMADE GRITS AND CHEESE BISCUITS\n1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup quick grits, 4 tsps baking powder, 1/4 tsps salt, 1/2 cup margarine or butter, 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup of milk. Heat oven to 425 degrees. Combine dry ingredients; cut in margarine until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in cheese; add milk, mixing just until dry ingredients are moistened. Shape dough to form a ball; knead gently on lightly floured surface 3 to 4 times. Roll out dough to form an 8-inch square. Cut dough into four 2-inch-wide strips, cut each strip crosswise into 4 pieces. Place biscuits about 1 inch apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes or until golden brown.\nThis next and last recipe is one that you can add anything too. In fact, the more the better in most cases. Here is the basic egg omelet. When you have it down pat, add in all the extras like bacon, onions, peppers, ham — just go crazy and throw it in.\nBASIC EGG OMELET\n2 eggs, 1 tsp heavy cream, 1/2 tbsp butter. Whisk together the eggs and heavy cream in a small bowl. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Melt the butter on the pan. Pour in the egg mixture and cook the eggs for 1 to 2 minutes—or until the eggs are halfway cooked. Using a spatula, fold the omelet in half. Cook for another 30 seconds, then slide the omelet to a plate. When making this dish with fillings here is a good rule of thumb : When the egg mixture is cooked around the edges (about 1 minute), add your fillings. Serve immediately. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The best reason is that it is your chance to decide on what future world you want to inhabit. Do you want a world of personal freedoms and rights or do you want the state and ultimately the president to be able to cancel these freedoms and rights?The freedom to vote without standing in line for hours. In Maryland we have the option of requesting a mail-in ballot for all future federal and state elections. If this is your preference, check your incoming mail or go to vote.md.gov/MDvotes24 and fill out the ballot request form soon. If you are not registered to vote in Talbot County contact talbot.elections@maryland.gov to register. Other Maryland counties each have a Board of Elections registering voters. With a valid Maryland driving license or state ID your signature on one of these documents along with a Social Security number can become your official on-line voter registration. This form is found at the MVA.The freedom for women to decide over their own health care and reproductive care. Ohio's voters just amended their state constitution to add the right to reproductive freedom with protections for health and safety of patients and providers. Kansas voters preceded Ohio with a similar change in their constitution. State legislatures in Maryland and New York are planning to codify the right to abortion by putting the issue before the voters in the November 2024 election. Nine other states, including Florida, are in the process of collecting enough signatures to put this issue on the ballot in 2024.The freedom to legally marry whomever you choose or to be whatever gender you choose to be. Right now, these are legal rights, but they can be changed, just as the Supreme Court overrode their nearly 50-year old decision in Roe v. Wade that guaranteed the right to an abortion, and left abortion rights to each state to decide.The right to live in a democracy with a constitution and laws that must be followed by all including the president and the Department of Justice. Threatening federal or state officials performing their jobs prevents a democracy from functioning and should be a federal crime.The right to bear arms but only with obligatory background checks and training, resulting in a license similar to a driver's license. All states should pass a red flag law to keep arms away from mentally disturbed people. And most importantly, all states (or the federal government) must renew the assault weapons ban. Those weapons were made to use in wars, not on our streets and in our schools. Bullets from assault weapons can damage a body to the point where the body is unrecognizable. Especially a child's body. Firearms have been the leading cause of death of children and young adults in the United States since 2020. There is no reason to accept this carnage.\nWhich federal and state candidates are you planning to vote for who would protect these freedoms and rights? It is up to you to inform yourself about the candidates. You can find out most of what you need to know on-line.\nThe forms for your option to vote by mail have already been sent out. It could not be easier than that to vote.\nLena Gill lives in Easton and is a member of the Talbot County Democratic Forum \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But I do feel the need to respond when a writer gets published with no good reasoning. Such is the case with Mr. Adrian's letter \"Gone down a dark road,\" in Sunday's 14 January edition.\nHis letter is filled with false statements. For example, he claims that Democrats control elections to push some kind of agenda. There is no evidence for that. Quite the contrary. Mr. Adrian somehow completely missed the well-known information that Republicans are involved in managing elections. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of examples.\nEven the head Republican, Donald Trump, knew that when he called the Republicans who control elections asking them to alter votes in 2020. As another example, Mr. Adrian seems to claim that harvesting crops in the fall leads to harvesting ballots. I don't think there is any evidence for that.\nBut what really gets me is the use of questions for arguments. This illogical method of argument is a tool of conspiracy theorists and despots for thousands of years. \"When did you stop beating your spouse?\" is the classic retort to that entire form of reasoning.\nMr. Adrian received a document about mail-in ballots and points out he could print it. \"What could possibly go wrong?\" he writes as if that question is a legitimate argument against the entire process. Without evidence, the question makes no sense, any more than me asking Mr. Adrian when he stopped beating people. Mr. Adrian should read about how the Arizona Republican Party spent millions of tax dollars on a month's-long audit of ballots that only showed Mr. Biden's votes were undercounted. Georgia audited their elections three times by hand counting ballots and found no fraud. These are just two facts out of hundreds of examples that belie the assumption underlying Mr. Adrian's question.\nMr. Adrian poses many other questions that assume evidence where none exists. And he ends his letter with the question, \"Which political party controls the Board of Elections anyway?\" as if that is a reason for everyone to doubt elections. It is not.\nAll available evidence is that elections in Maryland are fair and honest. People should appreciate that and take the time to vote.\nMICHAEL DAVIS\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Society is broken ... not the Constitution\n\n January 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BRIAN GRIFFITHS | Section: Columns \n \n 735\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Every so often, the left starts to complain about the Constitution. Kinda like this recent piece in The Atlantic by Larry Schwartztol and Justin Florence:The American experiment with constitutional democracy is in grave peril. If Donald Trump becomes president again, fighting to preserve U.S. constitutional democracy through his second term will require the courage, commitment, and creativity of a broad prodemocracy coalition.\nBut the problem is not merely Trump. The U.S. Constitution itself contributes to the country's crisis. As David Frum observed in a recent issue of The Atlantic, \"If Trump is elected, it very likely won't be with a majority of the popular vote\" but rather because our system for selecting the president \"has privileged a strategically located minority, led by a lawbreaking president, over the democratic majority.\" America must fight the immediate threat, but it must also go beyond that and stop this problem at its core: addressing once and for all the aspects of the Constitution that enable an authoritarian leader to remain within striking distance of the presidency.\nI, of course, don't disagree with the premise that Trump threatens the American Order and American governance. Trump has openly stated his disdain for our Constitutional system and his wish to rule by decree while surrounded by sycophantic narcissists who will not give a rip about being restrained by Congress, by the Courts, or by the Rule of Law.\nBut that's not the Constitution's fault.\nThe arguments by Schwartztol and Florence center around two basic premises, both of which have been left-wing complaints for years:\nThe original Constitution was written when democracy meant something radically different than it does today. Over time, Americans have amended the Constitution to make it more democratic, but shortcomings remain. The most significant, in our view, are the hardwired constitutional structures that are inimical to any modern understanding of democracy: the Electoral College, which could put Trump in office without majority support for a second time, and the equal allocation of two seats in the Senate to each state (an arrangement that gives a Wyoming voter 70 times more senatorial clout than a Californian). Reforming those structures would get the country much closer to the one-person, one-vote democratic ideal.\nThose two \"hardwired constitutional structures that are inimical to any modern understanding of democracy\" are what make us so unique and are a symbol of American exceptionalism.\nThe thing that the left continues to try and ignore or flat out just doesn't understand is the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution:\nThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\nThe premise of the Republic is federalism. It is not democracy.\nEver notice that the unitary states like the U.K., France and Italy always have the most instability with their parliamentary systems?\nThere's a simple reason for that. In these countries, states and localities have practically no power that is not bequeathed to them by the states. Whereas in federal systems like ours, the 50 states retain the power to do things on their own.\nThat's the real reason the left hates the Electoral College so much and hates that each state has an equal number of senators. They hate the fact that not all decisions are made in Washington. They hate the concept of federalism itself.\nThey close their piece with this warning:\nIn the midst of an ongoing democratic crisis — where a leading presidential candidate speaks openly of acting as a \"dictator\" and exacting retribution against his political opponents — investing in long-term reform can seem like a fantasy. Failing to do so, however, carries its own risks. Without attending to the architecture of American democracy, the inherent weaknesses at its foundation may, in time, cause it to come tumbling down.\nBut Trump isn't the problem here. Neither is the Constitution. It's us, as a society. That America has become so polarized has led us to this. That Republicans became so fed up with losing that they would embrace anybody they thought they could win. That Republicans convinced themselves that their side was so feckless that they would embrace a left-wing, gun-grabbing, pro-abortion Hillary Clinton donor statist like Trump \"because he fights\".\nWorries about Constitutional governance should not be focused on fixing a document that works. They should be focused on fixing a society that is broken.\nBrian Griffiths is a lifelong Marylander and publisher of TheDuckpin.com.

    "content": "Warm pudding on a cold, wintry day\n\n January 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1324\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Remember those days when you came home from work or school and Mom had a fresh baked homemade pudding waiting.This would be our dessert after supper that night. Oh my did it ever smell good — some of those \"memory smells\" that I write about quite often.\nMom was a very conservative cook. Feeding a family in the '40s, '50s and '60s required her to be. When others asked her \"how in the world do you feed such a large family,\" her reply would be \"waste not — want not\".\nWhenever mom had leftover bread, such as her homemade biscuit rolls or sandwich bread, she would save it until she had enough to make our favorite bread pudding.\nEveryone loves bread pudding, and I still make it the old-fashioned way. Try some of today's puddings for your next dessert or sweet tooth craving.\nMOM'S OLD FASHIONED BREAD PUDDING\nHeat 2 cups milk to scalding — bubbles from around the edge of the saucepan. Pour this hot milk over 4 cups of crumbled bread or cubed bread. When cooled, add 1/4 cup melted butter, 2 slightly beaten eggs, 1/2 cup raisins (optional), 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 tsp salt and 1 tsp cinnamon or nutmeg. Mix well and pour into a buttered 1 1/2-quart casserole dish. Bake at 350 degrees for 40 to 45 minutes. Serve warm.\nEASTERN SHORE BREAD PUDDING\nThis is the recipe my sister adapted from mom's recipe. They are both delicious. In a large bowl, crumble 8 slices of day-old bread. Add 1 can of evaporated milk, 1 1/2 cups whole milk, 3 beaten eggs, 2 teaspoons vanilla, 1 cup coconut, and 3/4 stick of melted butter or margarine. Mix well and pour in a baking dish rubbed with margarine or butter. Bake at 375 degrees for 45 minutes.\nMOM'S RICE PUDDING\nMom made the \"old fashioned\" rice pudding, which required using the old-fashioned long grain rice. Wash 3/4 cup plus 1 tbsp rice in cold water to remove starch and drain well. In a large heavy saucepan, scald 7 cups of milk, lower the heat and then add the drained rice, ¾ cups sugar and 1/4 tsp salt. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 30 to 35 minutes, stirring often with a wooden spoon to prevent rice from sticking. When rice is tender, remove from heat. In a mixing bowl, beat 5 eggs until frothy. Add 1 cup heavy cream and continue to beat while slowly adding some of the hot rice mixture, about 2 cups. Add this mixture to the remaining rice mixture and cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes or until mixture coats spoon. If you desire raisins, then add 2/3 cup at this time. Remove from heat and stir in 2 tsps vanilla. Pour mixture into a large shallow dish and sprinkle cinnamon on top. Bake in a preheated 350-degree oven for 20 minutes.\nSLOW COOKER RICE PUDDING\nOn low heat in the slow cooker, place 1 cup old-fashioned rice, 3/4 cup sugar, one tbsp vanilla, 1 tbsp salt and 8 cups milk. Cook for 6 to 8 hours, stirring occasionally. When you remove the lid from the pot to stir do not let the moisture gathered on the lid drip into the slow cooker. I cooked this rice on high for 5 to 6 hours, and it was fine. Add raisins, if desired, during the last hour of cooking. If you want to try this recipe, make a small batch the first time using 1/2 cup rice, 4 cups milk, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 tbsp vanilla and 1/2 tbsp salt. Sprinkle cinnamon on top when serving.\nBANANA PUDDING\n1 cup granulated sugar, ½ cup all-purpose flour, ¼ tsp kosher salt, 3½ cups whole milk divided, 8 egg yolks, 1 tbsp unsalted butter, 1½ tsps vanilla extract, 11-ounce box vanilla wafers, 6 medium bananas (sliced ½-inch thick). I don't recommend using super ripe bananas in this recipe, as they will break down too much when the pudding is in the oven. FOR THE MERINGUE: 8 egg whites, 1 tsp cream of tartar, 1⅓ cups granulated sugar. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, and salt. Whisk in ½ cup of the milk and the egg yolks. In a large saucepan, place the remaining 3 cups of milk. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently. Whisk 1 cup of the hot milk into the egg mixture. Whisk the egg mixture into the remaining hot milk in the saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 3 minutes more. Remove from heat. Add the butter and vanilla, stirring until the butter is melted. Set aside to cool slightly while you prepare the remaining ingredients. Arrange vanilla wafers in the bottom of a 9×13-inch baking dish and top with the banana slices. Pour the pudding through a fine-mesh sieve over the bananas and spread into an even layer. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar with a mixer on high speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. Spoon the meringue over the pudding, spreading it right up to the edges of the pan. Bake until the meringue is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Garnish with vanilla wafers, if desired. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.\nCOFFEE PUDDING\n2 cups whole milk, ½ cup strong black coffee, ½ cup cream, 1 large egg (room temperature), 2 egg yolks (room temperature), ½ cup dark brown sugar, 4 tbsps cornstarch, 2 tbsps butter, 1 tsp instant coffee granules, ½ tsp salt. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine milk, coffee, and cream. Slowly bring to a simmer. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar and cornstarch until blended. Ladle some of the hot milk mixture over the eggs and whisk immediately. While continuing to whisk, pour in the rest of the hot milk into the eggs. This method is called tempering and it prevents you from scrambling your eggs. Return the custard mixture back into your saucepan and place back over medium/low heat.\nWhisk the custard constantly for roughly 6-8 minutes, or until it has thickened. Do not let this mixture boil or it can curdle. Once thickened, remove from the heat and whisk in the butter, instant coffee and salt. Taste and if needed add a little more instant coffee for an even stronger flavor. The last step is to pass the custard through a sieve to yield you a silky smooth pudding and remove any lumps. Serve the pudding cold with whipped cream and shaved chocolate on top. Store the pudding in the fridge for up to 4 days.\nPISTACHIO PUDDING\n1 1/2 cups of whole milk and 1/2 cup pistachios dry roasted and unsalted (for pistachio milk), 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 2 tbsps cornstarch, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 2 egg yolks, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/4 cup chopped pistachios (unsalted). Shell pistachios and add them to milk in a jar with a lid. Close and put in the refrigerator. Keep it there for about 24 hours, then strain pistachios from milk. In a medium sauce pot, over medium heat, heat up milk, heavy cream and vanilla extract to 160 degrees. Stir well. Combine sugar, salt, and cornstarch in a medium mixing bowl, stir until all incorporated and set aside. In a large metal mixing bowl, whisk egg yolks. Very slowly, while constantly stirring, pour ½ cup of milk mixture into the eggs. Pour in another ½ cup of milk mixture, very slowly, keep whisking.\nSlowly, whisk in dry ingredients. Pour mixture from the mixing bowl back into the sauce pot, stirring constantly. Cook over medium heat, slow-stirring constantly, until mixture is thick. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Mix in chopped pistachios, if using. Transfer into a container with an air-tight lid and refrigerate until completely cold. (You can also use a bowl and plastic wrap.) \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Hot chili on a cold day\n\n January 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1304\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A steaming pot of homemade chili is good on any day, but on a cold wintry day, it seems to taste so much better.Walking in the kitchen and smelling the aroma of a homemade soup of any kind just puts a smile on the family's face — especially the cook — as a one pot meal is much less work and clean up.\nChili seems to be a number one Super Bowl favorite, so as the stores are stocked today, closer to Feb. 11 they will be sold out. Get your recipes out, purchase your supplies early and be ready.\nFirst off I wanted to re-share an older cornbread recipe. When it comes to chili, I like a dryer cornbread that helps to soak up the chili flavor.\nCOUNTRY DRY CORN BREAD\n1 tbsp bacon drippings or cooking grease, 2 cups cornmeal or 1 1/2 cups cornmeal and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp sugar (optional), 1 large egg, 1 1/4 cups buttermilk, 6 tbsps unsalted butter (melted). Put the bacon drippings or grease in a 9 or 10-inch well seasoned cast iron skillet and put the skillet into the oven. Then preheat the oven to 400 degrees with the skillet inside. If you don't have an iron skillet, you can use an uncovered Dutch oven, or a metal cake pan. Whisk together all the dry ingredients (cornmeal, baking soda, salt, sugar if using) in a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the egg and buttermilk until combined, then mix that into the bowl of dry ingredients. Stir in the melted butter. When the oven is hot, take out the skillet (carefully). Add the cornbread batter and make sure it is evenly distributed in the skillet. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the edges are beginning to brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean. Let the bread rest for 10 to 30 minutes in the skillet before cutting it into wedges and serving.\nVENISON CHILI\nPlace one pound of boneless cubed venison steak and one pound pork sausage in a large skillet and cook, breaking with a wooden spoon as necessary, over medium heat until no longer pink. Drain grease and mix in 1 chopped onion, 2 minced cloves of garlic and c beans, drained, and cook for about 3 minutes. Drain and mix in one 6 ounce can tomato paste and season with hot pepper sauce, salt and black pepper to taste. Pour in one 15 ounce can cannellini beans, drained, and one 10 ounce can diced tomatoes with chilies. Pour all of this into a slow cooker, adding the venison-sausage mixture in with the tomato-bean mixture. Cook 8 to 10 hours on low or 5 hours on high. Serve with shredded Cheddar cheese.\nWENDY'S CHILI\nIn a large skillet brown 2 pounds of fresh ground beef. Drain off fat and put the beef in a 6 quart pot with 1 quart of tomato juice, one 15 ounce can of tomato puree, one 15 ounce can of drained red kidney beans, one 15 ounce can drained pinto beans, one large chopped onion, 1/2 cup diced celery, 1/4 cup diced green pepper, 1/4 cup chili powder, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 1/2 tsps garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. Cover and simmer for one hour, stirring often.\nINSTANT POT VEGGIE CHILI\n1 tbsp olive oil, 1 medium white or yellow onion (diced), 1 medium red bell pepper (diced), 4 cloves garlic (minced), 3–4 cups vegetable stock, 1 (15-oz) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, 1 (15-oz) can beans of your choice (rinsed and drained), 1 cup uncooked green or brown lentils (picked over and rinsed), 1 tbsp chili powder, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tsp ground cumin, salt and freshly-cracked black pepper. Some extras that go great with this are diced avocado, chopped fresh cilantro, diced green or red onions, shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, and/or crumbled corn tortilla chips.\nPress the \"Sauté\" button on the Instant Pot. Add oil, followed by the onion and red pepper. Sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion has softened. Add garlic and sauté for 1 more minute, stirring occasionally. Press the \"Cancel\" button. Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl of the Instant Pot. Place the lid on and set to \"Sealing.\" Using the \"Manual\" button, cook the chili on high pressure for 12 minutes, followed by a quick release. Taste and season with salt and pepper (or any other additional seasonings) as needed. Serve immediately, piled high with all of your favorite toppings. Or transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.\nIf you prefer to use a slow cooker, add all ingredients to the bowl of a slow cooker and stir briefly to combine. Cover and cook on high for 3-4 hours or on low for 6-8 hours, until the lentils are tender. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve immediately, piled high with all of your favorite toppings. Or transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.\nOLD FASHIONED CHILI\n2 pounds 85% lean ground beef, 1 tbsp canola oil, 2 sweet onions (diced), 4 cloves garlic (sliced), 1 red pepper (diced), 1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes, 2 15-ounce cans dark red kidney beans (drained), 2 15-ounce cans pinto beans (drained), 2 tbsps dark chili powder, 1 tbsp cumin, 1 tsp ground chipotle pepper, ½ cup chicken stock, 2 tbsps smoked paprika, 1 11-ounce can tomato juice such as V8, salt and freshly ground black pepper, shredded cheese, sour cream, green onions. My son John likes to dice Red Onions up for his chili, so that is an option as well. In a large soup pot over medium-high heat, add the canola oil and ground beef. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Sear for about 10 minutes. Add the onion, garlic and red pepper, and sauté about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, beans, chili powder, cumin, chipotle powder, paprika, chicken stock and tomato juice; simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve with shredded cheese, sour cream, green onion, tortilla chips or crackers.\nTEXAS STYLE CHILI\n1–2 tbsps avocado or vegetable oil, 2 1/2 to 3 pounds beef chuck roast (fat trimmed, cut into 3-inch cubes), 2 1/2 tsps salt (1 tsp per pound of meat, more to taste), 1 yellow onion (finely diced), 5 cloves garlic (minced), 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp cumin, 1/4 cup chili powder, 2 4.5-ounce cans green chiles, 1 14-ounce can crushed fire roasted tomatoes. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Toss the cut beef chunks with salt. Add the beef to the pot and let it cook, undisturbed, for a few minutes on each side until it gets nice and browned. You may need to do these batches depending on the size of your pan. Remove beef chunks and transfer to the slow cooker.\nAdd onions and garlic (and a bit more oil if needed); sauté until golden and softened. This process should lift a lot of browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the brown sugar and spices; sauté for 3-5 minutes until nice and fragrant. Add green chiles and crushed tomatoes; simmer for 3-5 minutes until bubbly and delicious. Pour tomato mixture into the slow cooker over the beef chunks; gently nudge them around so they are surrounded in the sauce. Cook on high for 4-ish hours or low for 8 hours. Shred the beef into big tender chunks (you should be able to do this directly in the slow cooker) and season with more salt to taste. Serve with sour cream, cheddar, green onions and cornbread. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

But how do we receive them?\nWe wait.\nWe are often like children at Christmas, who see quite clearly the many presents wrapped under the tree yet chafe at the insistence of their parents they \"wait\" before opening.\nJesus did not leave us without direction in this manner. He has shown us the way through the Holy Scriptures, the Word of God. If we would simply read and believe no possible doubt could remain.\nI was 45 years old before I became a daily reader of God's word, and in so doing my character flaw of impatience (one of many) slowly — ever so slowly, I must say — faded away.\nThe more I read the more I was able to wait for the Lord. I was given a sense of peace that all will be well. Oh if I'd only been a student of the Bible sooner, I could have saved myself much heartache and missteps.\nAccording to the Bible, all who desire the grace of God are to wait for it through the means He has already ordained: daily Bible reading and prayer and weekly fellowship with other believers.\nIt's not complicated, but it's also not easy if you've spent a lifetime leading yourself.\nC.S. Lewis said, \"Oftentimes in order to go forward we must go back and begin again.\"\nNow is the day and time, as this New Year is upon us to begin again and wait for the Lord to lead and bless.

    "content": "Chesapeake Bay Boat Show returns for 3rd year\n\n January 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Demetrius Dillard ddillard@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 538\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TIMONIUM — Because of its proximity to the Chesapeake Bay, eastern Baltimore County is home to some of Maryland's most passionate boating enthusiasts.Thousands of boaters, boat dealers, marina owners and others assembled in northern Baltimore County for the third annual Chesapeake Bay Boat Show from Jan. 19 to 21.\nDespite less-than-desirable weather conditions and a Baltimore Ravens home playoff game that ran concurrently with the weekend's festivities, the boat show was still a massive success.\nThe highly anticipated boat show was facilitated by the Marine Trades Association of Baltimore County, a local organization advocating for the safety of local waterways. The organization, based in Essex, also works closely with government, community and business leaders to make considerable progress in marine-related areas — from waterfront living to recreational boating.\n\"I think everything went excellent,\" said Brian Schneider, president of association.\n\"We've had an extremely good response … hats off to all my guys that have donated their time to us. It's really incredible to see all of this come together.\"\nThe three-day event, held at the Maryland State Fairgrounds in Timonium, featured more than 30 Maryland boat dealers showcasing new boats and marine equipment, including sport fishing boats, performance boats, ski boats, cruisers, cabin cruisers and more.\nGuests and participants traveled from as far as Virginia and Delaware for the boat show, which featured children's activities, live musical performances, more than exhibitors, fishing and boating seminars, food and beverages, a fishing simulator, fishing tackle pier.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Boat Show drew attendance from a number of Essex-based organizations, including Maryland Waterways, Back River Restoration Committee, Baltimore Boating Center, Friends of Hart-Miller Island and the Coastal Conservation Association-Maryland.\nBringing together nonprofits, a vibrant community of boaters, boat dealers and organizations \"is huge for our industry,\" Weaver emphasized.\n\"This is our third year, and it's our largest year to put this together,\" he said.\nSam Weaver, co-founder of Maryland Waterways Foundation, worked alongside colleague Karen Wynn and others at the organization's exhibit at the boat show to highlight and promote environmentally sustainable practices to improve the condition of the state's waterways and the Chesapeake Bay.\n\"It was a great experience … the space was sold out, and other than the weather it was a great time for all,\" Weaver said. \"We just hope that, somehow or another, we impressed people enough to join us in cleanups and take care of [the environment].\"\nMaryland Waterways' participation in the boat show was also an opportunity to recruit for internships, Weaver added.\nSchneider has presided over the MTABC for a decade and also serves as the president of the Chesapeake Bay Boat Show. Prior to the pandemic, MTABC participated in a yearly boat show in downtown Baltimore that was costly with less space.\nBeginning the boat show in 2022 was one of the most worthwhile decisions the organization made, Schneider said, considering the affordability, free parking and the abundant space that the Fairgrounds venue provided for attendees and participants.\n\"There's only a couple of boat shows in the state, and this is the premier show in the state of Maryland,\" Schneider said, highlighting the Chesapeake Bay Boat Show's uniqueness and pivotal role in contributing to the regional economy.\n\"I hope [visitors] felt it was well-worthwhile to attend … and I hope they're looking forward to coming back next year.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hot chili on a cold day\n\n January 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1304\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A steaming pot of homemade chili is good on any day, but on a cold wintry day, it seems to taste so much better.Walking in the kitchen and smelling the aroma of a homemade soup of any kind just puts a smile on the family's face — especially the cook — as a one pot meal is much less work and clean up.\nChili seems to be a number one Super Bowl favorite, so as the stores are stocked today, closer to Feb. 11 they will be sold out. Get your recipes out, purchase your supplies early and be ready.\nFirst off I wanted to re-share an older cornbread recipe. When it comes to chili, I like a dryer cornbread that helps to soak up the chili flavor.\nCOUNTRY DRY CORN BREAD\n1 tbsp bacon drippings or cooking grease, 2 cups cornmeal or 1 1/2 cups cornmeal and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp sugar (optional), 1 large egg, 1 1/4 cups buttermilk, 6 tbsps unsalted butter (melted). Put the bacon drippings or grease in a 9 or 10-inch well seasoned cast iron skillet and put the skillet into the oven. Then preheat the oven to 400 degrees with the skillet inside. If you don't have an iron skillet, you can use an uncovered Dutch oven, or a metal cake pan. Whisk together all the dry ingredients (cornmeal, baking soda, salt, sugar if using) in a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the egg and buttermilk until combined, then mix that into the bowl of dry ingredients. Stir in the melted butter. When the oven is hot, take out the skillet (carefully). Add the cornbread batter and make sure it is evenly distributed in the skillet. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the edges are beginning to brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean. Let the bread rest for 10 to 30 minutes in the skillet before cutting it into wedges and serving.\nVENISON CHILI\nPlace one pound of boneless cubed venison steak and one pound pork sausage in a large skillet and cook, breaking with a wooden spoon as necessary, over medium heat until no longer pink. Drain grease and mix in 1 chopped onion, 2 minced cloves of garlic and c beans, drained, and cook for about 3 minutes. Drain and mix in one 6 ounce can tomato paste and season with hot pepper sauce, salt and black pepper to taste. Pour in one 15 ounce can cannellini beans, drained, and one 10 ounce can diced tomatoes with chilies. Pour all of this into a slow cooker, adding the venison-sausage mixture in with the tomato-bean mixture. Cook 8 to 10 hours on low or 5 hours on high. Serve with shredded Cheddar cheese.\nWENDY'S CHILI\nIn a large skillet brown 2 pounds of fresh ground beef. Drain off fat and put the beef in a 6 quart pot with 1 quart of tomato juice, one 15 ounce can of tomato puree, one 15 ounce can of drained red kidney beans, one 15 ounce can drained pinto beans, one large chopped onion, 1/2 cup diced celery, 1/4 cup diced green pepper, 1/4 cup chili powder, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 1/2 tsps garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. Cover and simmer for one hour, stirring often.\nINSTANT POT VEGGIE CHILI\n1 tbsp olive oil, 1 medium white or yellow onion (diced), 1 medium red bell pepper (diced), 4 cloves garlic (minced), 3–4 cups vegetable stock, 1 (15-oz) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, 1 (15-oz) can beans of your choice (rinsed and drained), 1 cup uncooked green or brown lentils (picked over and rinsed), 1 tbsp chili powder, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tsp ground cumin, salt and freshly-cracked black pepper. Some extras that go great with this are diced avocado, chopped fresh cilantro, diced green or red onions, shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, and/or crumbled corn tortilla chips.\nPress the \"Sauté\" button on the Instant Pot. Add oil, followed by the onion and red pepper. Sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion has softened. Add garlic and sauté for 1 more minute, stirring occasionally. Press the \"Cancel\" button. Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl of the Instant Pot. Place the lid on and set to \"Sealing.\" Using the \"Manual\" button, cook the chili on high pressure for 12 minutes, followed by a quick release. Taste and season with salt and pepper (or any other additional seasonings) as needed. Serve immediately, piled high with all of your favorite toppings. Or transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.\nIf you prefer to use a slow cooker, add all ingredients to the bowl of a slow cooker and stir briefly to combine. Cover and cook on high for 3-4 hours or on low for 6-8 hours, until the lentils are tender. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve immediately, piled high with all of your favorite toppings. Or transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.\nOLD FASHIONED CHILI\n2 pounds 85% lean ground beef, 1 tbsp canola oil, 2 sweet onions (diced), 4 cloves garlic (sliced), 1 red pepper (diced), 1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes, 2 15-ounce cans dark red kidney beans (drained), 2 15-ounce cans pinto beans (drained), 2 tbsps dark chili powder, 1 tbsp cumin, 1 tsp ground chipotle pepper, ½ cup chicken stock, 2 tbsps smoked paprika, 1 11-ounce can tomato juice such as V8, salt and freshly ground black pepper, shredded cheese, sour cream, green onions. My son John likes to dice Red Onions up for his chili, so that is an option as well. In a large soup pot over medium-high heat, add the canola oil and ground beef. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Sear for about 10 minutes. Add the onion, garlic and red pepper, and sauté about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, beans, chili powder, cumin, chipotle powder, paprika, chicken stock and tomato juice; simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve with shredded cheese, sour cream, green onion, tortilla chips or crackers.\nTEXAS STYLE CHILI\n1–2 tbsps avocado or vegetable oil, 2 1/2 to 3 pounds beef chuck roast (fat trimmed, cut into 3-inch cubes), 2 1/2 tsps salt (1 tsp per pound of meat, more to taste), 1 yellow onion (finely diced), 5 cloves garlic (minced), 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp cumin, 1/4 cup chili powder, 2 4.5-ounce cans green chiles, 1 14-ounce can crushed fire roasted tomatoes. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Toss the cut beef chunks with salt. Add the beef to the pot and let it cook, undisturbed, for a few minutes on each side until it gets nice and browned. You may need to do these batches depending on the size of your pan. Remove beef chunks and transfer to the slow cooker.\nAdd onions and garlic (and a bit more oil if needed); sauté until golden and softened. This process should lift a lot of browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the brown sugar and spices; sauté for 3-5 minutes until nice and fragrant. Add green chiles and crushed tomatoes; simmer for 3-5 minutes until bubbly and delicious. Pour tomato mixture into the slow cooker over the beef chunks; gently nudge them around so they are surrounded in the sauce. Cook on high for 4-ish hours or low for 8 hours. Shred the beef into big tender chunks (you should be able to do this directly in the slow cooker) and season with more salt to taste. Serve with sour cream, cheddar, green onions and cornbread. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

She was born in 1913 in Attalla, Alabama, (northeast of Birmingham, along I-59) to her parents, where she lived until she was seven-years-old. Her family then moved to Washington D.C., during the early 1920s, long before the Great Depression.She graduated from the then Wilson Teachers College in Washington, D.C., in 1933. Shortly after, married the late William Franklins, who she recalls meeting in Hyattsviille, a then rural suburb of the nation's capitol. They were married on April 9, 1938. Mr. Franklins was employed with the U.S. government's foreign service, and they were almost immediately assigned to move to Germany shortly after the wedding. The Franklins lived in Germany before World War II began.\nMary recalls, \"I've travelled the world. Seen lots of places.\"\nWilliam and Mary's final residence together before his passing many years ago was at the beautiful Wharf House in Centreville, not far from Doc's Restaurant today. They were both active members of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Centreville.\nShe is now receiving active aging care in Chestertown, under the supervision of her main caregiver Beverly Emore, who started attending to Mary in 1990, along with longtime friend Linda Carroll, who has also looked after Mary's needs for more than 30-years. Both Emore and Carroll, along with all other people close to Mary, address her daily as \"Mom-mom\".\nThough hearing is difficult, Mary can still read without glasses, and loves to read, which has been a live-long passion. She plays bridge, Scrabble, and is an avid crossword puzzle player. If you want to ask her questions, best to write your questions on paper, since she can read the questions, and verbally answer them. She also still loves to talk, and has lots to say.\nShe admires flowers, children, pets, chocolate and good people. Her favorite dish of food is \"a good crab cake!\" She's still a registered and active voter in all elections.\nCarroll said, \"I haven't been able to confirm it, but Mary may be the eldest person ever to reside on the Eastern Shore. If not, she's got to be right up there as one of the eldest people ever!\"\nAsked, \"What do you attribute to your longevity of life?\" Mary replied, \"I have no idea!\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Celebrating 95 years, Vietnam vet reflects on war, rescue efforts\n\n February 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: WILL BONTRAGER wbontrager@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 1254\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — Samuel Tiller, celebrated his 95th birthday on Nov. 25. Although he's safe at home, he sometimes stares up at the ceiling, tears in his eyes, reliving those times in the rice field. That's due to the fact he was in a firefight in the Vietnam War, where he rescued soldiers under him.After a hellish conflict, he considers himself lucky.\nThe Army gave him the purple heart and the bronze star for his bravery — luck not mentioned.\nOn his certificate it read: \"Sergeant Tiller distinguished himself by heroic actions during the Operation on 12-14, April 1964, in the Republic of Vietnam.\"\nAs much as the military is known for detail, that statement doesn't paint the picture of Sgt. 1st Class Tiller.\nIn his career he did everything from transporting officers, to drill sergeant to training the Vietnamese army. Starting in Maryland, he went from Germany, to Korea, and ultimately to Vietnam.\nAnd he doesn't have any regrets.\nFrom an early age living in Big Woods, near Worton, Tiller wanted to be a soldier. He got that chance, enlisting during a time when the military was segregated. While in the Army he suffered prejudice, but also received advice from grizzled World War II veterans.\nThey told him to advance in rank as a Black man, he had to go to the Korean War front.\nTiller remembered the heaving ocean waves as he and others climbed a rope ladder to get onboard the ship to Korea. He was fortunate being there in the waning years of the conflict.\n\"I didn't receive a scratch on me,\" Tiller said.\nIt was not unproductive. He went from a \"nothing to an E-5.\"\nA sergeant, finally, after serving for ten years.\nTiller's time in Korea allowed him to pay for his first car when he returned to Chestertown where Mary, his future wife lived.\nLike many, the military life called him back.\nBy Fountain Park, a recruiter talked to Tiller and his friends. Tiller noted that of all his friends, he was the only one who reenlisted.\nHe was whisked off to Fort Bragg — to warfare training, along with 75 officers and NCO's preparing for deployment.\nDuring that time, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Tiller recalled a sergeant, who was involved in the band, raising his hand and telling the class about it.\nSoon after, Tiller was sent to another war.\nVietnam.\nTo his wife's great concern.\nShe'd write him everyday until he was home safe.\nWhen Tiller touched ground he immediately sensed danger.\nHis role was to assist the company commander as they trained the Vietnamese army to fight the Vietcong. He moved with the Vietnamese in convoys, mingling with them, while they loaded up their chickens, rabbits, pots, pans and everything they owned.\nClose calls while in-country remain fresh on Tiller's mind.\nThe first time he sat down to eat after a convoy, somebody tossed a grenade in the window. Tiller hit the ground and squeezed his eyes shut, awaiting the explosion. It didn't happen. The pin was not pulled properly.\nA place they frequented often was blown up at the entrance he was about to choose. A bomb rigged beside a bicycle.\nTiller had close-calls and saw his share of tragedy.\nHe witnessed a translator die, reflecting on how young and intelligent the boy was.\nTiller was lonely too, in temperatures exceeding 107 degrees.\nIt was just him and the company commander and the translators.\nOne balmy Sunday that loneliness was shattered by a call.\nA battalion of hardcore Vietcong attacked a village in Tam Phu. He boarded a helicopter along with other companies — 16 Huey choppers and four Piasecki H-21's, called \"banana choppers.\"\nTiller said his helicopter was doorless and two fifty-caliber gunners thundered fire down on the Vietcong below when they approached the landing zone; an open field. Unable to hear a sound except gunfire and propellers, Tiller and the company commander evacuated, retreating for the tail of the chopper.\nVietcong were in the woodline to the left, firing on Tiller's men.\nA Vietnamese captain stood up in the middle of the conflict and was shot dead.\nHugging the ground, they deployed a \"fire and maneuver,\" action. Some soldiers engaged the enemy allowing others to retreat to the woodline.\nScrambling for it, they jumped into a ditch, pinning them down. Someone threw smoke to show their location to air support, but the dry brush caught fire. Immediately, they were caught between a spreading fire and the enemy shooting at them.\nWith bullets bearing down on him, Tiller pulled one of the wounded Vietnamese from the part of the ditch that was closer to the fire. They were in a hopeless situation, but thankfully the smoke did its job.\nA tactical fighter squadron dropped a napalm bomb on the enemy allowing Tiller's company to retreat to the woodline.\nTiller looked up and said, \"If it wasn't for that plane I wouldn't be here today.\"\nBut the Vietcong were a continual presence.\nEvery time a plane dropped a flare that night, mortars would fire off.\nThe next morning, they tried to get down a river for pickup and Vietcong pushed them back to the woodline.\nDuring that conflict, three of Tiller's guys were wounded.\nRisking his life, he told the company commander to lay down fire and cover him.\n\"I brought those guys back by myself, one at a time,\" Tiller remarked.\nThe assault continued throughout that day.\nMonday evening, a helicopter made an attempt to rescue six wounded. The enemy lurked in the woods. The helicopter had to retreat because they opened up fire again.\nFor almost three days, the threat of danger and death was imminent.\nWhen Tiller slept, it was with one eye open.\nHe was uncertain he'd make it out.\n\"I can't tell you how scared I was.\"\nOn Tuesday morning, the violence was drowned out by calm.\nWithin that silence, a chopper brought the Vietnamese Colonel and an American Major.\nThis time the enemy didn't fire back.\nU.S. forces delivered water to the war-weary and parched soldiers.\nThen they marched single-file beside the river towards the special forces camp to get picked up. Tiller was behind 15 men, but he alone set off a land mine. It knocked him down and broke two toes, with the shrapnel from the explosion striking the commander.\nTiller, who carried so many others, was carried himself, then placed on a small boat and then helicopter-bound for Saigon.\nFour-Star Gen. Wes Mooreland had visited wounded soldiers in the hospital every Sunday. On one of those times, he asked Tiller how he was. Tiller said he's alright physically but his morale was down. He hadn't received any letters from Mary since he was there.\nOrders were given.\nIf Tiller had any mail in Vietnam, Mooreland would make sure he got it.\nThat Monday after coming back from the chow hall, there were a pile of her letters on Tiller's bed.\nIt was the boost Tiller needed.\nTiller recovered and reported to headquarters, received a scolding typical of military life and was soon on the way to the Philippines. He received a hero's steak dinner, and then took a double-decker plane from California back to Philadelphia.\nWar was over.\nPhysically.\nTiller still sees Vietnam.\n\"It stays with you,\" he said.\nTiller retired from the Army in 1967. He became an employee in the Air Force working roads and grounds. A steady job, away from danger, where he could be alone with his thoughts.\nHe had a good career there. In New Jersey, where he lived, he was known for his impeccably kept yard and as, \"Big Sam the Fish Fry Man,\" cooking fish on weekends.\nOn his 95th birthday, he celebrated with his family in Chestertown with a big cookout.\nTough-as-nails, a sharp wit, and a natural storyteller, Sfc. Tiller shakes his head, \"War is hell. I know. I been through two of them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Use Leap Day's extra time to change your life for good\n\n February 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Robin Donovan Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1126\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Once every four years, we get a bonus day on February 29. Don't make the mistake of letting Leap Day pass you by. Learn how to use this rare extra time as a springboard to personal change, turning a single day's action into lifelong habits.The Leap Day mindset: Embracing the extra day\nIf you struggle with making time for yourself, set aside this day for self-growth activities. An extra 24 hours can make all the difference with the right mindset. By viewing Leap Day as a chance for a mini-reboot, you're setting the foundation for transformational change.\nTaking opportunities to make changes builds new neural pathways, which helps protect cognitive function. Reflect on your goals, struggles and needs through purposeful activities like journaling, meditation or booking a session with a therapist. With how busy life gets, it can be a rare opportunity to get the time to sit with yourself and check in on how you're doing. That's all the reason to leverage Leap Day as a launchpad for personal development.\n\"If you don't take out time to focus on your own enrichment, sit with yourself and begin to tune into your inner voice, this can get harder and harder to do over time, \" says Julia L. Pressman, LCSW.\nSmall leaps, big gains: Micro-changes with macro impact\nThe idea of change can be daunting, but it doesn't always have to be drastic. Start implementing small, manageable changes on Leap Day, like eating a healthy breakfast or taking a 15-minute walk after lunch.\nDon't underestimate the power of micro-changes, as they can lead to significant, positive shifts in your life. By taking that brisk walk on Leap Day, you may find that it's something you enjoy and can easily incorporate into your routine. That one small change will slowly become a habit that promotes a healthier lifestyle.\n\"Over time, micro-changes increase our perception of what choices are available to us,\" Pressman says. \"When we try to do things differently than we typically do them, we learn more about ourselves and what works for us.\"\nLeap of faith: Trying something new\nHave you ever saved a new recipe or fitness class, promising yourself that you'll get to it one day? As a wild card in the calendar year, there is no better day than Leap Day to step out of your comfort zone and finally try that thing you've been putting off.\nWho knows, trying out that honey cake recipe might end up with you falling in love with baking and creating a side hustle. That's what happened to former U.S. national volleyball player, Tui Tuileta during the pandemic. Tuileta used his free time to bake cookies and post his creations on social media. It quickly picked up and led him to fulfill orders locally, baking 400 cookies weekly from his parents' oven. Attempting new things spices up your routine and can lead to unexpected opportunities — you never know if you don't try.\nThe joy of the moment: Celebrating the day\nThe rare occasion of having 366 days in the year calls for a celebration. Make this a special day by hosting a Leap Day-themed party. That way, you'll make special memories to last until the next Leap Year.\nAs part of the celebration, indulge in festive foods. Make it a potluck so your friends and families can share foods they love, filling your dinner table with a variety of options like party favorite samosas — a flaky Indian pastry with potato filling.\nConnecting the dots: Building relationships\nLeap Day offers 24 extra hours to spend with your loved ones. Take the time to write heartfelt letters expressing your appreciation for people in your life or plan a family cooking activity. Tanghulu, a traditional Chinese candied fruit street food, is an easy, delicious and fun snack to make with kids.\nIt's important to prioritize relationships as they are critical to personal development. They are a source of support during difficult times and help improve self-esteem and general well-being. Plus, a little appreciation goes a long way. Expressing gratitude releases oxytocin, the love hormone that strengthens the bond between two people.\nPaying it forward: Kindness and community\nExtend the spirit of Leap Day into the community by performing acts of kindness. Volunteer at a local food bank or spend the day decluttering your closet to donate items you've outgrown. Volunteering helps out the community and benefits your mental health by encouraging you to meet new people, increasing your social skills and boosting your self-confidence. Research, including a study by Western Connecticut State University, has shown that the more people volunteer, the happier they are.\nA day for creativity: Unleashing your inner artist\nEngaging in artistic pursuits comes with several therapeutic benefits that you may be unaware of. According to PhD psychologist Dr. Brenner, tapping into your creativity can reduce stress and anxiety and even boost your immune system. Dr. Brenner also explains that once you're in a creative flow, the brain releases large amounts of happy chemicals like dopamine, endorphins and serotonin.\nWhether it's painting, writing or knitting, dedicate some time on Leap Day for these artistic pursuits you usually don't have time for. There's no pressure to create a masterpiece, just get started and let your creativity flow for your mental well-being.\nLeap Day resolutions: Setting goals with a twist\nYou may have already set New Year's resolutions, but Leap Day resolutions are different. Given the rarity of a Leap year, it's an opportunity to create goals that are a bit more farfetched than your typical New Year's resolutions. Want to conquer your fears and go skydiving? Or, for a less extreme idea, why not challenge yourself to perform random acts of kindness every day? Setting these out-of-the-box goals will help you get out of a mundane routine and fully experience the joys of life.\nIt's one thing to set goals and another to execute them. Decide on a timeline for when you want to achieve each resolution and set actionable steps to make it happen. The best motivator is setting meaningful goals that will bring self-fulfillment.\nThe culmination: Making Leap Day last\nEnd Leap Day on a high note by reflecting on how you spent this rare bonus day with intention and purpose. It's a unique opportunity to make a significant change in your routine or simply enjoy an extra day of life's pleasures, indulging in hobbies or activities you normally don't have time for. Keep the positive momentum going and use Leap Day as a springboard to leap forward into the year with renewed energy and purpose.\nRobin Donovan is the author of more than 40 cookbooks, including the bestselling Campfire Cuisine, Ramen Obsession, and Ramen for Beginners.

    "content": "Taylor Swift: A powder keg about to explode\n\n February 11, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: STEVEN V. ROBERTS | Section: Columns \n \n 769\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A recent cartoon in The New Yorker depicts a gloomy pair of campaign workers surrounded by posters urging people to vote. One laments, \"I worry that democracy's only hope is Taylor Swift.\"Funny, yes. But also potentially prophetic. While in most election years celebrity endorsements make a minimal impact, this year could be different.\nThe contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump is likely to be very close, with a handful of votes in a handful of states deciding the outcome. And Biden is an unusually unpopular incumbent who stirs little enthusiasm even among his core supporters.\nHe needs a spark — a source of excitement — especially among younger voters who helped elect him in 2020 but are drifting into indifference. Few of them will vote for Trump. The real threat to Biden is that they will back third parties or simply stay home.\n\"The youth vote, as we all know, is going to be crucial in this election,\" notes Erin Heys, policy director for the University of California, Berkeley's Institute for Young Americans. If Swift \"does make an endorsement, she has the potential to sway a lot of young voters. She and other cultural influencers can do a lot to signal to young people, 'Hey, your vote does matter'. ... (A Swift endorsement) could really change the game for those people who, in the current moment, feel disillusioned with the whole political and economic system.\"\nBiden World might well be channeling this lyric from Swift's song \"August\": \"To live for the hope of it all.\"\nHere's why: Time magazine named her Person of the Year for 2023. Her Eras Tour grossed over $1 billion last year, making it the most profitable musical tour ever. Last week, she won a Grammy for album of the year for the fourth time. A Morning Consult poll found that 53% of Americans are fans of Swift's music, with 16% calling themselves \"Swifties,\" or especially ardent followers.\nAnd there's mounting evidence of her political clout. Last fall, when she urged her Instagram followers to register to vote, vote.org saw a surge of 35,000 registrants. In a Newsweek poll, 18% said they were more likely to back a candidate supported by Swift, but that rose to 3 out of 10 among younger voters.\nHer possible impact is bolstered by the changing nature of political campaigning, which increasingly takes place online. The website Exploding Topics calculates that she has a total of 534 million followers on all social media sites combined — the fourth-highest total of anyone in the world — with 280 million of them on Instagram alone.\n\"Celebrity power in elections has grown because celebrity power itself has grown,\" communications consultant James Haggerty said to Newsweek. \"Media and social media are now the central organizing framework of many Americans' lives. And in a world awash in messages, it's the celebrity voices that really resonate.\"\nEarly in her career, Swift shied away from politics, fearful that she would alienate some possible Swifties. But in 2020, she backed Biden, and a statement she made to V Magazine illuminates her priorities: \"The change we need most is to elect a president who recognizes that people of color deserve to feel safe and represented, that women deserve the right to choose what happens to their bodies and that the LGBTQIA+ community deserves to be acknowledged and included.\"\nSince then, the Dobbs decision that canceled a national right to abortion could only intensify her interest in the upcoming election. Republicans are already anticipating her participation, with some unhinged operatives trying to undermine her credibility by implying she's part of a nefarious conspiracy — along with her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, a tight end with the Kansas City Chiefs — to throw the election to Biden and the Super Bowl to the Chiefs.\nReince Priebus, who ran the Republican National Committee under Trump, derided the conspiracy theories as \"a powder keg of stupidity,\" and added, with some degree of wonder, \"You're talking about two of the most popular things in America right now. Taylor Swift and the NFL.\"\nIf Swift does back Biden, she's almost certain to enrage Trump, who has a long history of attacking powerful women who challenge his ego. His insults — from \"Crooked\" Hillary Clinton and \"Crazy\" Nancy Pelosi to \"Birdbrain\" Nikki Haley — show clearly the man cannot help himself.\nTaylor Swift is richer, younger and more popular than Donald Trump. Think about what he would call her, and how the Swifties would react. That particular \"powder keg of stupidity\" could blow up in his face. And reelect Joe Biden.\nSteven Roberts teaches politics and journalism at George Washington University.

We need the blessings of our gracious God and the bounties of His people. These blessings and bounties include health, strong families, economic and citizenship opportunities, political freedom and participation, justice and more.\nThese blessings of our Creator and the bounties of His people, who are made of \"one blood\" which flows not only in people of a particular identity, heritage or background, but to all of God's creation.

He wants to start a local chapter of Veterans for Peace on the Eastern Shore.Veterans for Peace is an international group made up of veterans and allies who want to abolish war and serve the cause of peace. It was founded in 1985 and is based in St. Louis. The group relies on the philosophy of nonviolence.\n\"I am not anti military. We just want to make people realize what the military does,\" Butler said.\nHe said there is a cost on veterans' mental health and a cost to taxpayers associated with war. Veterans for Peace claims on their website that the total cost of the war on terror is over $9 trillion and growing.\nButler saw a need to create a local chapter.\n\"About a year and half ago I decided to see what I could do to start a chapter here on the Eastern Shore. They have a chapter in Baltimore. I just want to get it started and see how it develops,\" he said.\nIn an office supplied by the Easton Family YMCA at Peachblossom, Butler had many pamphlets and books about Veterans for Peace.\n\"Working for peace is important. It seems like one war after another after another,\" he said.\nThe YMCA has supplied a meeting space for the organization's first months, but Wendy Palmer, the YMCA's executive director, thinks the group will eventually outgrow the office space.\n\"Community is what keeps us going. (Butler's) purpose is to bring people together for peace. It is also a community of people who have some shared experiences,\" she said.\nButler said his faith has played a major role in shaping his beliefs on war.\n\"If I was put in the situation to kill another human being, could I do that? Loving our enemies is very difficult. It wasn't until I became a part of the Easton Church of the Bretheran, which is a peace church, that I learned the teachings of Jesus, that things fell into place for me. Is killing our enemies always the answer?\"\nButler got out of the Vietnam war in 1970. Two friends of his were wounded in the war. One did not come home at all and the other suffered from depression and drug addiction.\nButler said that he hopes creating the local chapter will help to do something about the cost of war.\nHe has scheduled to have Veterans for Peace's first meeting at the Easton Family YMCA at Peachblossom on Feb. 28 at 2 p.m.\nHe needs five people to start a chapter. The dues are $50 a year. Ellen Barfield, the national vice president of Veterans for Peace, will be at the first meeting to offer support.\nThis report has been updated to reflect the change in the Veterans for Peace meeting time. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Responsible Fathers Initiative empowers, strengthens men\n\n February 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Local News \n \n 1210\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — In late 2021, Ja'Shaun Wilson had a son on the way.At the time, Wilson, now 31, was incarcerated at the Talbot County Detention Center.\nAlready thinking ahead, he recalled wanting to try to figure out how to adapt to being a first-time father before he was released.\nThat's when he decided to participate in Inside Out Dad, a Responsible Fathers Initiative group held inside the jail.\n\"... I never really had any strong role models,\" he said. \"So I just figured, what could it hurt by taking the class?\"\nTo Wilson's surprise, the group's curriculum did more than just talk about fatherhood — it prompted him to reflect on himself more deeply and gave him the tools he needed to move forward when he reentered the community, ready to meet his son and be the role model he didn't have himself.\nRESPONSIBLE FATHERSFounded by Corey Pack in 2019, the Responsible Fathers Initiative is a local nonprofit committed to helping enlighten men to the impact fathers have on a family and better prepare them for the duties and responsibilities of fatherhood.\nThe curriculum it uses was developed by the National Fatherhood Initiative, a broader nonprofit that offers evidence-based fatherhood programs, resources, training and more in an effort to increase fathers' involvement.\nInspiration for the local initiative began when Pack was asked to help out with an existing fathers' group in the detention center in 2019.\nPack is no stranger to fatherhood programming. In the mid-2000s, he headed a group in Cambridge for several years before turning his attention to local government, serving on the Talbot County Council for 15 years.\nBut still, a \"burning desire\" to get back into it lingered, he said, and his second chance came at just the right time.\n\"I think God knew my heart. He knew this was something I really wanted to get back into doing,\" he said.\nThe data behind a father's impact on a family was a motivator for Pack.\nPack said children born in a household without a responsible father are more likely to live in poverty, suffer from abuse or neglect, drop out of school, become involved with drugs and alcohol, and be involved with the criminal justice system.\n\"...The numbers are telling us (that) when we boil it all down, between race and region and religion and culture, it comes back to the family,\" he said. \"When the family unit starts to crumble apart, then you see these other ills pop up in our society.\"\nPack started facilitating in-person groups for men in the detention center in 2019 and initiated a women's group, too, though the pandemic's arrival in 2020 hampered some progress.\nWith the help of Talbot County's IT department and the Department of Social Services, Pack pivoted into running all-virtual classes for men and women at the detention center throughout the year — a feat no other county in the state was able to do, he said.\nSince then, the initiative has grown. Now, it includes three in-person groups inside the detention center, two for men and one for women, along with two community-based men's groups and two teen dads' groups, both of which are held in Easton and Cambridge.\nThough the curriculums provided by the national initiative help with the lessons learned in groups, the Responsible Fathers Initiative leans on community partners to flesh out its offerings even more.\nThe Neighborhood Service Center in Easton, Delmarva Community Services, YMCA of the Chesapeake, the Talbot County Department of Social Services, the St. Michaels Community Center and Washington College, among others, are just some of those key partnerships.\n\"It would not work, cannot work, without the partnerships, without that synergy,\" Pack said. \"The sum is greater than its parts.\"\nHELP ON OUTSIDEThose partnerships with other community organizations and county agencies play a significant role in helping the Responsible Fathers Initiative's mission.\nThe fatherhood piece of the initiative aligned well with the Neighborhood Service Center's existing 2Gen program, which provides resources to support the whole family in an effort to increase self-sufficiency and break generational poverty cycles, said Dawn Phillips, who serves as the program's case manager and the center's Responsible Fathers Initiative coordinator.\nThe initiative's community group for fathers operates at the center's location on Port Street in Easton and provides meals and wraparound services to participants, including help with housing, transportation, food and financial literacy.\nTo Phillips, the initiative has been a \"major contribution\" in working to beat generational poverty cycles.\n\"The role of the father in the household is huge,\" she said.\nRegardless of whether fathers are living with their families, the center being able to help men with better communication, improve self-esteem and support education and employment efforts can empower participants and break the cycle.\nTo Wilson, those supports were invaluable — he received help with enrolling his son in day care and obtaining a voucher for it, he said.\nLISTENING, LEARNING, GROWINGWith multiple meetings running weekly both inside and outside of the detention center, the opportunities for group participants to grow in knowledge of themselves and the commitments and responsibilities associated with fatherhood are ample.\nThe curriculums in the detention center and in the community are similar, with focuses placed on self-awareness, self-care, fathering skills, parenting skills and relationship skills.\nTo Pack, the group serves as a supportive, judgment-free zone — a safe space where time is given to listen and be heard.\n\"... When they can come together in a group and they feel that they have some comfort there, they're being respected, they're not being judged, they're not being told that they're a deadbeat father or that they're worthless or they're not this or that, but allowed to be heard — I think that gives them the empowerment to come back,\" he said.\nWhile in the detention center, Wilson always looked forward to going to the group, he said.\nHe recalled being prompted with \"I am\" statements, which are commonly used to provide affirmations and challenge negative self-perceived thoughts.\n\"I had the basis of 'I am Black,' 'I am a man,' but it made me dig deep for the next go around,\" he said. \"I had stronger responses because it really made me think about how I view myself or wanted to view myself.\"\nBeing in the group with other men who openly shared their failures and strengths in being a father, along with how it affected them before and during their incarceration, provided a variety of viewpoints for Wilson to consider.\nHolding himself accountable, learning the ins and outs of communication, body language and tone through the initiative's curriculum proved to be some of the key lessons Wilson still remembers today. Those lessons were especially beneficial with navigating co-parenting and having respect for each other, he said.\nThat work continued when he joined the men's group held in the community, too.\nAnd although his son is just shy of 2 years old, Wilson knows he wants to be a role model — one who wants to make sure his son knows that it's OK to cry.\n\"... A lot of that is stigmatized, and I want him to know it's OK to show your emotions basically, because that's what a lot of us are taught not to do,\" he said. \"I just want to let him know that it's OK to have emotions and to show them, and the proper ways to deal with them — that's the type of stuff I'd like to instill in him.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Even though I have walked in faith and had hope and believed in the Lord's goodness, after a while and in moments of pain and weakness, temptation sets in. Not the temptation to kill, steal or destroy. Nor the temptation toward self-pity, or pride and certainly not lust (if that were possible). But a more deadly than most and that is acedia. It is listed as one of the seven deadly sins.I write a monthly column for a magazine/newsletter, and for my \"New Year's\" edition, I talked about time. And I put emphasis on wasting time with acedia. My editor's \"spell check\" didn't know this word and changed it to \"too much academia.\" I was appalled at first, but the more I thought about it the funnier it became. So that when he offered to do a retraction, I told him not to worry about it.\nAcedia is a Latin word that is often referred to as slothfulness. Acedia is not used too much today as even sloth is not. \"Lazy\" has replaced both. But every time a classic term is reduced to modern vernacular, something is lost. Suddenly the deadly sin of acedia seems quite harmless as lazy.\n\"He never does his homework he is just lazy; he never picks up after himself he is so lazy and so on.\" So how harmful can being lazy be as a sin?\nSin cuts us off from the source of grace, God through our Lord Jesus Christ.\nIt is spiritual death (Rom.5:12; 6:23). Acedia means laziness and more, a lot more. It means not caring anymore. \"Oh well, I stopped trying to do anything about that because I just don't care anymore.\"\nAnyone with a deadly debilitating handicap or disease knows how easy it would be to stop caring and just \"give up\". But without the hope or something to look forward to is to cast off restraint (Prov. 29:18), to stop trying to make a difference. \"A man apprehends the practice of virtue is to beset with difficulties and chafes under the restraints imposed by the service of God. The idea of right living inspires not joy but disgust, because of its laboriousness.\"\nAcedia is then about giving up. Giving up on politics, people and life. Isn't that how we got to where we are now? We no longer try. We don't vote, go to church, get involved with our communities. And now just sit back and watch TV with disgust. \"How, we think, did we ever get in this mess?\"\nOne word acedia, a deadly sin.\nTHE REV. DR.

GEDMAN St. Luke’s Methodist Church, Denton | Section: Columns \n \n 272\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Matthew 5:13 recounts Jesus' words, \"You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under peoples' feet.\"In the ancient world, salt had many functions. Of course, we know salt was widely used as a food preservative. It did not simply sit on the table waiting to cheer up a dull meal. It was also used as a \"rub\" of sorts for newborns (check out Ezekiel 16:4).\nStrictly speaking, salt cannot lose its saltiness because it (sodium chloride) is a stable compound. So, what is Jesus alluding to with this illustration?\nOne possibility is that the Lord is referring to the preservative function of salt — Christians are to live and act in the world to prevent its moral degeneration. But it has more than the negative function of stopping the world's deterioration.\nBy speaking and living the gospel, believers will improve the societies in which they live. That is, we sprinkle the salt of the gospel onto the world.\nChristians will turn the world aright when they submit to Christ. They should have no small ambitions; the whole earth will change through their salty influence. What was true for the first disciples is also true for us. We can serve Christ by applying the salt of anointed witness and service to the needs in our own locales.\nPray that we continue to salt our community with the salt of Christ's shed blood, that others may experience the true depth of God's life-preserving, regenerative power and not just the flavor of salt. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some of their parents were strict about only celebrating every four years and others made every year special.\nBut regardless of their celebratory traditions, for those who are born on Feb. 29, birthday milestones always look a little different than normal.\n\"My mother said when I turned 4, of course, they had a big celebration. At 4 you kind of have a sense of what it means. It is a special day. By the time I was five, my birthday year, there was no (Feb.) 29. It was rather traumatic for me,\" said Frank Narr of Cambridge.\nOnly getting birthdays in four-year terms has shifted his view on life slightly, he said.\n\"As I got older as a leap year celebrant, I tend to chronicle my life in four-year segments — 4, 8, 12, 16 and so on. As I look back, each segment is unique, and I can point to at least one significant event in my life,\" Narr said.\nHis parents tried to make up for the deficit of birthdays.\n\"My mom made a big deal on leap years. I always wanted a pair of Chuck Taylor Converse sneakers. For my 12th birthday, I can remember that. It was big deal. I went from Sears sneakers to the Chuck Taylor Converse sneakers. When I got to 16 now you are in High School. How do you celebrate your birthday, especially in the off years? As I have gotten older and think about the off years and I say to myself between 11:59 on Feb. 28 and midnight — my day is that minute,\" Narr said.\nHe said he is 15 leap years old this year.\n\"When I turned 13 all my daughters were older than me. That was the joke,\" Narr said.\n\"When I got older and got my first car in Maryland, I chose to get personalized license plates. I put 'Feb 29' on them. I worked in D.C., and I would drive around the beltway. I got honks left and right. I had fun. It attracted a lot of attention on the day,\" said Narr.\nBeing a leap day celebrant has put him in an existential mind frame.\n\"You get to a point where you realize there are less of them than more of them. I try to really treasure the time and the moments because you realize it is another four years until you have one. I am just different, and I chalk that up to being a leap year guy,\" he said.\nAs the Earth makes its rotation around the Sun, it takes 1/4 of a day longer to make the journey than the 365 day calendar lasts. So, a whole day, leap day, is added to the calendar nearly every four years.\nPeople born on the leap day are pretty rare. Only about 5 million people worldwide have a Feb. 29 birthday, about 0.06% of the world's population.\nAmazingly, one of Narr's neighbors also had a leap day birthday.\n\"We move in to our new home, and our next door neighbor — the woman — was born on leap day as well.\"\n\"That truly is the first time I have ever met someone who was a leap year baby. She was 5, 6, 7 leap years older than me. I would make a point of going to see her, and we would just bask in the day. You kind of had that little twinkle in your eye. We get each other and we have lived this life of uniqueness,\" Narr said.\nAnother Leap Day celebrant is Will Freda, who teaches at The Gunston School.\n\"Yes, my parents were rather adamant about my birthday being only once every four years. Growing up, we would only celebrate on the actual day, not in the years in between. At first, it was difficult for me to understand why other kids got to celebrate every year, and ultimately the experience impacted me in two ways,\" Freda said.\n\"One: birthdays, as you might imagine, started to mean absolutely nothing to me. I distinctly remember that on my 12th (third) birthday, I had a bad day. From then on, I no longer believed that birthdays could really mean much, since four years of karma had not amounted to anything. Now, even though I have a real birthday, I do not do anything to celebrate,\" Freda said.\n\"Two: once birthdays stopped meaning something to me, other special days lost importance as well. As someone with a birthday once every four years, holidays like Christmas and New Year's Eve seem to happen rather frequently. Something like, 'Oh, it's Christmas again,'\" Freda said.\nBut finding a silver lining, Freda said that his Leap Day birthday has helped him see the value of living in the moment.\n\"All of this might sound negative initially, but I think this experience has inspired a sort of mindfulness. I will admit that I no longer look forward to anything, but the benefit of that is that my focus can remain more squarely in the moment. In a sense, if none of the days are special, then every day is,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Our teacher had relatives there, and friends, who put us up whenever we visited.\nI had worked hard the previous summer to earn enough money to help pay for the trip, and I couldn't have been more excited about getting to go. Up to that point, mine had been a fairly parochial childhood — all my friends were white, we all spoke with a slight Southern accent, our parents were all preparing to vote for Richard Nixon in the next election and we all supported our country's war in Vietnam (this was the year of the Tet offensive).\nLooking forward to the trip, I was fascinated by the idea of \"foreignness,\" that the countries I would visit would — each in its own way — be different from anything I had ever encountered before. In this, I was not disappointed.\nThe first time we bicycled into Augsburg, at the end of a long hot ride, our Latin teacher's aunt met us at her door with ice-cold pitchers of a pink liquid that I assumed was lemonade. But I was wrong — she had, she told us, prepared the drink fresh for us from rhubarb she'd harvested that morning from her garden. I will never forget how refreshing and exotic that \"rhubarbade\" tasted on my tongue.\nOne of the other families we visited in Augsburg had a son our age and a daughter a year or two younger. Our teacher had told us beforehand that the father had served as a waist gunner in the Luftwaffe during World War II. Needless to say, this made us all curious about him. We were of the generation whose fathers, almost without exception, had also fought in that war, against the Axis.\nIf I was expecting jackboots and a house run with ironclad National Socialist discipline, I was in for a surprise. The house was like many middle-class residences I knew back home in Kentucky, and the family that lived there couldn't have been more relaxed and welcoming.\nIndeed, the daughter turned out to be a stunning blonde whom, over the course of that summer, I courted as best I could.\nWe had a number of interesting experiences on that trip.\n1968 was Europe's summer of rebellion. We were in Paris when the Bastille Eve riots broke out and Charles de Gaulle's gendarmerie attacked anything on the Left Bank that looked like a student. A member of our group ended up in a French emergency room.\nIn Franco's Spain and the Junta's Greece we saw what life was like under a repressive military dictatorship. And in Morocco we were approached by little boys trying to sell us \"some really good stuff.\"\nBut most unsettling for a kid who'd grown up in a family that flew the American flag every Fourth of July was the young Europeans I met that summer on trains and in youth hostels who questioned me about America's involvement in Vietnam.\nUp until that point in my life it had always been my country right or wrong (though the idea that America could ever actually be wrong would never have crossed my mind). But now, suddenly, I was meeting a new class of peers who not only didn't think America incapable of error, they believed she was in fact currently embarked upon one of the gravest mistakes any country could ever make.\nThe night before we returned home, I can remember lying in my bunk in a youth hostel worrying over what I had experienced that summer.\nI thought I was in love with a girl whose father — a nice man I knew and liked — had fought for Adolf Hitler. For the first time in my life I had personally experienced the fact that good nations, full of good people, could not only get it wrong, they could get it disastrously wrong. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, I was no longer so certain my own country couldn't screw up too.\nThat night of doubt took place over half a century ago and, in a sense, it is with me still.\nI was outraged by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but I am still haunted by a photograph taken on one of the battle's first days of a dead Russian soldier lying face-up in the street, his body covered with a light blanket of snow. That young man had no idea what he was getting into when his commander ordered him to march south, and now his life was over before it had truly begun.\nHow do you reconcile the sympathy you feel for such an innocent with the horror of what he had been sent to Ukraine to do?\nAll of which is my long way of explaining why I checked out Burkhard Bilger's new book, \"Fatherland,\" and lost myself in all that its author encountered as he researched the life of his grandfather — his mother's sweet and loving \"Papa\" — the elementary school teacher adored by his students, the district administrator sent by the Third Reich to oversee the occupied Alsatian town of Bartenheim, the man who did everything in his power to save the people under his jurisdiction from labor camps and worse, the man who was a card-carrying member of the Nazi party, the man suspected of murder, the man who, after the German surrender, was tried for war crimes and escaped the gallows by a hair's breadth.\nIf you too sometimes find yourself occupying neither the right nor the left but an uneasy middle ground, if the answers to life's questions appear neither black nor white but gray, if you wonder if there is any way to resolve such quandaries, to reconcile the irreconcilable, then I heartily recommend Bilger's book.\nIt won't answer all your questions, but it may give you cause to hold fast to them as the world swirls around you with belligerent assurances that this way of thinking, or that way of thinking, is right, and anyone who thinks otherwise is irredeemably wicked.\nYou can find \"Fatherland\" in the Talbot County Free Library's biography section under BIO GÖNNER. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Celebrate National Oreo Cookie Day",
    "date": "2024-03-06",

    "content": "Celebrate National Oreo Cookie Day\n\n March 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1100\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n National Oreo Cookie Day is today, March 6, and what a great cookie the Oreo is.In 1898, several baking companies merged to form the National Biscuit Company, also called Nabisco. This was the beginning of the corporation that would create the Oreo cookie.\nIn 1912, Nabisco had an idea for a new cookie, though it wasn't exactly its own — two chocolate disks with a creme filling in between had been done already by the Sunshine Biscuits company in 1908, which called the cookie Hydrox.\nSo how did we get to \"Oreo?\"\nSome speculate that the name is a combination of taking the \"re\" from \"cream\" and sandwiching it, just like the cookie, between the two o's in \"chocolate\" — making \"o-re-o.\" Though the true naming process may never be revealed, that has not affected Oreo sales.\nThe first Oreo appeared in a grocery store on March 6, 1912 in Hoboken, New Jersey. It was called an \"Oreo Biscuit.\"\nAs of 2023, it was estimated that 480 billion Oreo cookies have been sold since 1912.\nEverybody has their favorite brand of cookie, and my family has always loved Oreo anything. Eating at our favorite Italian restaurant in Ocean City recently, everyone asked \"are we going to Dumser's for a Oreo cookie milkshake?\" My son John, who is usually the chauffeur, replied \"Yes indeed.\"\nSitting there in West Ocean City took me back in time. Of course, this Dumser's location is way busier now than it was in 1964, but nevertheless, the Oreo cookie milkshakes were just as good as they were 60 years ago.\nSome changes to Oreo cookies in recent years that are very popular, especially during the various holidays, include different creams in the centers. Halloween features peanut butter; Christmas centers include mint and various other flavors.\nIn honor of National Oreo cookie day, let's explore this amazing cookie and all that can be created with it.\nOREO COOKIES AND CREAM COOKIES\n2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 tsps cornstarch,1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 4 ounces full-fat brick cream cheese (softened to room temperature), 3/4 cup unsalted butter (softened to room temperature), 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 cup packed light or dark brown sugar, 1 large egg at room temperature, 2 tsps pure vanilla extract, 1 cup white chocolate chips, 1 1/4 cups roughly chopped Oreos (10 whole Oreos).\nWhisk the flour, cornstarch, baking soda and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside. In a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium-high speed until completely smooth and creamy. Add the butter and beat until combined, scraping down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. Add granulated sugar and brown sugar and beat on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low speed until combined. With the mixer running on low speed, beat in the white chocolate chips. Add the Oreos and beat on low speed or gently fold in with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon (dough is heavy) until combined. Cover and chill the dough for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator (and up to 4 days). If chilling for longer than a few hours, allow to sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite hard.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside. Roll cookie dough, a heaping 1.5 tbsps of dough per cookie (I use a medium-size cookie scoop), and place 3 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 12–13 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The centers will look very soft. Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. While the cookies are still warm, I like to press a few more white chips or Oreo pieces into the tops — this is only for looks. Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.\nOREO BROWNIES\n2 cups sugar, 3/4 cup butter (melted), 1 package unsweetened baking chocolate (melted), 4 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 1/4 cups flour, 12 Oreo cookies (chopped, divided).\nHeat oven to 350 degrees. Spray 13x9-inch (33x23-cm) pan with cooking spray. Mix sugar, butter and melted chocolate in a large bowl until blended. Add eggs and vanilla; mix well. Stir in flour until blended. Stir in 1 cup chopped cookies; spread onto bottom of prepared pan. Sprinkle with remaining chopped cookies. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with fudgy crumbs. Do not overbake. Cool completely.\nOREO CHEESECAKE\n34 Oreo cookies (divided), 1/4 cup butter (melted), 3 packages. brick cream cheese (softened), 3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup sour cream, 1 tsp vanilla, 3 eggs, 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream (whipped).\nHeat oven to 325 degrees. Reserve 1 cookie for later use. Coarsely chop 9 of the remaining cookies; set aside. Crush remaining cookies into fine crumbs; mix with butter until blended. Press onto bottom and 1 1/2 inches upside of the 9-inch pan. Beat cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer until blended. Add sour cream and vanilla; mix well. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating on low speed after each just until blended. Stir in chopped cookies; pour over the crust. Bake 55 minutes to 1 hour 5 minutes, or until the center is still soft but almost set. Run the knife around the rim of the pan to loosen the cake; cool before removing the rim. Refrigerate cheesecake for 4 hours. Top with whipped cream and garnish with reserved cookie before serving.\nOREO COOKIE MILKSHAKES\n6 Oreo cookies, 1 tbsp chocolate syrup, 1 1/4 cups milk, 2 1/2 cups vanilla ice cream (softened), 1/4 cup whipped cream.\nCut 1 cookie into quarters: reserve for garnish. Chop 4 of the remaining cookies; set aside. Crush the remaining cookie into fine crumbs; pour into a shallow dish. Brush rims of 4 glasses lightly with chocolate syrup. Dip tops of glasses, one at a time, into cookie crumbs, turning to evenly coat each rim with crumbs.Blend milk and ice cream in a blender until smooth. Add chopped cookies, pulse just until blended. Pour into prepared glasses. Top with whipped cream and reserved quartered cookie pieces. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Godfrey, Calvert Marine Museum Research Associate Paul R. Murdoch Jr. and St. Mary's College of Maryland's Victor J. Perez.\nUntil now, no great white shark tooth has ever been found embedded in a fossil seal bone, but the journal article reports on the discovery of the tip of a fossilized great white shark tooth embedded in a fossilized seal heel bone.\nThe unique two-for-one fossil was surface collected by Murdoch Jr. in Mosaic's South Fort Meade Mine in Florida. The seal bone originated from within the Bone Valley Member of the Peace River Formation of the Pliocene Epoch and is about 4.5 million years old.\nThe partial tooth is identified as having come from an Early Pliocene great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). The discovery also represents the first great white shark tooth ever found embedded in any fossil bone, which may have come about as a result of active predation or scavenging.\nThe presence of the tooth in the seal's hind flipper suggests active pursuit and therefore active predation as opposed to scavenging.\nWhatever the nature of the encounter, the seal did not survive given there is no evidence of healing on the fossilized seal bone.\nTo see the report, go to https://sciencepress.mnhn.fr/en/periodiques/comptes-rendus-palevol.

    "content": "Thinking and reflecting\n\n March 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 467\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I am pleased that folks around Talbot County have a local news source that causes us to think and reflect upon who we are, what we think, what we believe and why, and how we act, or react, when those things that make us what we are, are challenged. In other words. Mr. Reel's thoughtful March 10 article was grounded in, or founded on, \"... don't confuse me with facts.\" That caused me to think about what I believe and why, how I tend to act, in my personal life and why, and to put down these words and thoughts, in reaction to his article.I do not know Mr. Reel or Ms. McCaskill personally, but Reel, being the chairman of the Republican Committee in Talbot County, clearly leans right, while Ms. McCaskill, being a former Democrat U.S. senator, clearly leans left. In my world that doesn't make either one of them bad people. It does mean they have biases, as we all do.\nThe thoughts expressed herein are an expression of how people's thoughts, views and \"truths\", can influence other people and how they strike me, personally.\nI have often expressed the view that we are all victims of our childhood, a more generous term would likely be products. I think it is a bit of both. I grew up in western Wisconsin, in a small town on the banks of the Mississippi. My mother was one of 13 children of Norwegian immigrants, who took up dairy farming in surrounding communities. My father, a World War II vet, was the son of German immigrants. Both he and his father were locomotive engineers for the CB&Q railroad, running trains between Chicago and St. Paul, Minnesota.\nMy mother's family was predictably Republican, while my father's family was Democrat. Nevertheless, I never heard one ill word about politics ever uttered at family gatherings. I have often said, growing up where I did, in the 1950s and 60s, there wasn't 10 cents worth of difference between good Republicans and good Democrats. I wonder if that is even possible, anymore.\nWhile I, perhaps we, long to return to those days, I know that is never going to happen. I would ask, however, if this were to be published, and if you were to read it, please think about how you and I can do better than to be steered by the political class to do real harm to those around us.\nWe all hear a lot of noise, some of it fact, some not, some honest opinion, some not, some well intentioned, too much not. However, we cannot, perhaps do not want to, tune it all out. What we can do is consider the sources and the potential outcomes, of words we hear and the paths we choose to take and espouse as a result.\nWILLIAM KEPPEN\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Easter treats and meats",

    "content": "Easter treats and meats\n\n March 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1378\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n To begin this week's edition of Country Cooking I want to wish each and every reader a happy Easter. No matter what you cook, no matter what you eat, no matter who you share dinner with or where you eat — make those memories with your loved ones.At this stage in my life, I value these memories as they are all I have left of the good ole days.\nRiding down the country road, the house appears with the yard lined with cars and pickups. Pulling in the large driveway, there are children running in the yard playing, and as I get close to the back door I smell the delicious aroma of many types of foods.\nThere is lots of laughter and talking going on as I open the back door and there stands Mom at the stove finishing last minute side dishes.\nHer happy voice rings out with, \"come on in. Dinner will soon be ready — find a seat and sit down.\" She is so happy to have her family home for Easter dinner. She is dressed in her bright cotton dress with her bib apron over it.\nMom has been gone for 27 years, but those beautiful memories will last my lifetime.\nThose long-ago dinners featured one of the smoked hams or one of her sugar-cured hams that my parents processed after the yearly hog killings in the winter months.\nA lot of hard work was involved in this way of country living, but mom used to say, \"hard work never hurt anybody.\"\nToday folks eat many different types of meats for Easter dinner, such as seafood, turkey, chicken and beef.\nMy first recipe today is using lamb, which can be served with any number of sides. A roasted rack of lamb is the perfect centerpiece to wow a dinner crowd, especially when it comes to Easter dinner. If working with lamb isn't something you do often, it can seem intimidating. But trust me it's not and can be found in most local stores such as Food Lion, ACME, Giant, Sam's Club and Harris Teeter.\nRACK OF LAMB\n3 cloves garlic, 3 tbsps fresh rosemary leaves, 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, 1/2 tsp salt (plus more for sprinkling), 2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, 2 (8-rib) frenched racks of lamb (about 1 1/4 lb. each), freshly ground black pepper, freshly chopped parsley (for garnish).\nIn a food processor, pulse garlic, rosemary, thyme and salt until minced. Drizzle in olive oil and process until a paste forms. Place lamb on a large, rimmed baking sheet and season all over with salt and pepper. Coat tops with herb rub and let sit at room temperature for one hour. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450°. Roast lamb 25 to 30 minutes for medium-rare, or until a thermometer inserted in the center reads 125°. Tent with foil and let rest 15 minutes before carving into chops. Sprinkle with parsley.\nROSEMARY PORK ROAST\n3 lb. boneless pork loin well-trimmed, 3 cloves garlic (minced), 2 tbsps grainy mustard, 1 tbsp chopped rosemary, 1 tsp chopped thyme leaves, salt, freshly ground black pepper, fresh rosemary sprigs, 3 tbsps melted butter, 1 tbsp brown sugar.\nPreheat the oven to 400°. Line a 13 by 9\" pan with foil and place a wire rack on top. Roll the flap of the boneless loin into a cylinder, and using kitchen twine, tie the pork loin every few inches. (This helps cook the pork more evenly.) In a small bowl, mix garlic, mustard, rosemary, thyme, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and freshly ground black pepper. Rub mixture all over pork loin and place in a roasting pan fat-side down. Bake for 30 minutes, then carefully flip the loin, and bake until a thermometer inserted into the middle of the meat reads 145°, about 20 minutes. Mix melted butter and brown sugar together, then brush on top of the pork loin. Broil for 2 minutes to caramelize. Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing into 1/3\" pieces. Serve pork warm with extra pan juices.\nCHEESY BACON ASPARAGUS CASSEROLE\n6 strips bacon (cut into 1\" pieces), 2 cloves garlic minced, 1/4 cip all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 cup shredded white cheddar (divided), 1 cup shredded Swiss cheese (divided), salt, freshly ground black pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, 1 bunch asparagus (ends trimmed).\nPreheat the oven to 375°. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crispy, 10 minutes. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper-towel–lined plate. Drain all but a 1/4 cup of grease from the pan. To the same skillet, add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add flour and stir until golden, 2 minutes. Slowly pour in milk and cream, whisking until smooth. Let simmer until thickened, 5 minutes. Add ½ cup each of cheddar and Swiss cheese and stir until melted. Add bacon back to sauce and season with salt and pepper and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Place asparagus in a 9 by 13\" baking pan and pour sauce over, then top with remaining ½ cup of each cheese. Cover with foil and bake until asparagus is tender, 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake until cheese is melty, around 10 minutes more or so.\nWhat is Easter without eggs? Here are a few different egg recipes to finish up today's column.\nDEVILED EGG CHICKS\n12 large eggs, hard boiled and peeled, 1/3 cup mayonnaise, 1 1/2 tsp Dijon mustard, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/8 tsp salt, 1 small carrot (peeled and sliced into rings), 6 black olives.\nPeel 12 hard-boiled eggs. With a sharp knife, slice off a very thin layer from the base of the egg — this will give it a flat surface to stand on a platter. Cut off a generous top third of the egg. Squeeze around the egg base gently to loosen the yolk, and it should pop right out. Keep the lids paired with their bases. In a medium mixing bowl, combine 12 cooked yolks and mash well with a fork. Add mayonnaise, dijon (to taste), garlic powder and tsp salt. Mash everything together until smooth. Transfer mixture to a Ziploc bag and pipe generously into egg bases. Place the top 1/3 back over the base and press down slightly to adhere.\nPEANUT BUTTER EASTER EGGS\nOne 16-ounce package confectioners' sugar, 1 cup creamy peanut butter, 1/4 cup butter, 1 tbsp milk, 8 (1 ounce) squares semi-sweet chocolate, 1 tbsp shortening.\nIn a mixing bowl combine confectioners' sugar, peanut butter, milk and butter. Blend well. Shape mixture into a bunch of small eggs. Freeze eggs for about an hour. While the eggs are freezing, cut semi-sweet chocolate into small pieces and place on top of a double boiler with the shortening. Melt over medium heat, stirring frequently until smooth. Stick a long-tined fork into top of each peanut butter egg, dip it in melted chocolate to cover them and then drain on waxed paper. When the eggs are cooled and set, decorate them to your desire.\nCHOCOLATE COVERED EGGS\nThis is a great recipe that you can add different ingredients to that will make 4 different kinds of eggs... all yummy. 1/2 cup softened butter, 1 tsp vanilla extract, one 8-ounce package softened cream cheese, 2 1/2 pounds confectioners' sugar, 1 cup flaked coconut, 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 cup creamy peanut butter, 2 cups semisweet chocolate pieces,1 tbsp shortening.\nIn a large bowl, mix together the butter, vanilla and cream cheese. Stir in the confectioners' sugar to make a workable dough — for best results use your hands. Divide the dough into four parts. Leave one of the parts plain. To the second part mix in the peanut butter. Mix the coconut into the third part and the cocoa powder into the last part. Roll each type of dough into egg shapes and place on a waxed paper-lined cookie sheet. Refrigerate until hard, at least an hour. Melt the chocolate chips in a heat-proof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally until smooth. If the chocolate seems to be too thick for coating, stir in a teaspoon of shortening until it thins to your desired consistency. Dip the chilled eggs in the chocolate and return to the waxed paper lined cookie sheet to set. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to harden. Then decorate as you wish. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Best way to honor legacy of Anne Frank is simple\n\n March 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 725\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A recent chain of events led me to think about another chain of events during World War II for a young girl who once aspired to be a famous writer.She ultimately achieved that goal, but not in a way that she had ever dreamed about or ever aspired to do.\nHer name is Anne Frank.\nAnne died at age 15 along with most of her family in a Nazi concentration camp.\nBefore she and her family were sent to the concentration camp, they spent two years hiding from the Nazis in a secret sealed apartment in Amsterdam. During that time, Anne kept a written diary now known as \"The Diary of Anne Frank.\"\nHer diary was published posthumously in 1947. Translated into almost 70 languages, it is one of the most widely read accounts of the Holocaust.\nI had largely forgotten about Anne Frank and her diary until a series of unexpected events unfolded during a recent weekend.\nOn a Saturday afternoon, my wife and I drove to St. Michaels to enjoy a beautiful early spring day. It was a by all measures a perfect day.\nThe next morning was far from perfect.\nIt started when my wife launched a frantic search for her wallet. Like most wallets it contained her driver's license, credit cards and health insurance cards. It also included a substantial amount of cash for a Monday bank deposit to be used to pay for long-planned and much needed home improvement project.\nAfter retracing all her Saturday steps, we concluded her wallet likely fell out of her back pocket while we were sitting on a park bench in St. Michaels.\nI called the St. Michaels police to ask if anyone had turned in a lost wallet. The answer was no, not yet. The officer volunteered to go to the park and search for it. When he called back, he told us there was no trace of it. He also told us some who find lost wallets take the cash and throw the wallet into a trash can. He was kind enough to search the trash can in the park, but with no success.\nOnce we accepted that reality, I started to write a list of all the onerous tasks that follow the loss of a wallet.\nAngry and frustrated, I said to my wife, \"This is what the world has come to. No one cares anymore except about themselves. You lose a wallet, and no one turns it in. Worse yet, they probably took your cash and credit cards with no remorse telling themselves it was an unexpected stroke of 'good luck.'\"\nMinutes later, there was knock at our front door. A couple from Washington, D.C., whom we had never seen before told us they were also visiting St. Michaels on Saturday. They discovered her wallet. Using the address on my wife's driver's license they drove to our house on their return to Washington and delivered it.\nThey refused any reward other than accepting a heartfelt thank you.\nAs I reflected upon that unexpected random act of honesty and kindness my thoughts turned to Anne Frank and words she wrote in her diary.\nWith a wisdom and eloquence well beyond her years she penned, \"It's difficult in times like these: ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.\"\nWith all due respect to the memory of Anne, I cannot fully embrace her thinking that people are truly good at heart. Many are, but some are not and never will be. This was confirmed by her death, the deaths of most of her family (all but her father who saved her diary) and at least six million other innocent people who perished in concentration camps during the holocaust.\nThat said, our experience with a lost wallet was a reminder the best way to honor the legacy of Anne Frank is simple. Not always easy but a most meaningful way.\nIn difficult times like these when dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality, we can and we should strive very day to be people who are \"truly good at heart.\"\nDavid Reel is a public relations and public affairs consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Welcome fresh spring vegetables",
    "date": "2024-04-03",

    "content": "Welcome fresh spring vegetables\n\n April 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1362\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I recently moved some of the late fall frozen vegetables to the top rack in the freezer to be used before it is time to begin preserving, canning and freezing for the 2024-25 season. I usually make that mental list of what not to freeze or preserve too much of and what I need to increase the most.A lot depends on what is best and just how late it is to begin these procedures. Each year is different from the last because of availability, favorites and space to use for storage.\nNo matter the situation, let's enjoy some fresh early spring veggies and incorporate last year's leftover veggies.\nCHICKEN & RICE WITH SPRING VEGETABLES\n2 tsps extra-virgin olive oil, 2 tsps unsalted butter, 1 shallot (finely chopped), ½ cup finely diced red pepper, 1 tsp dry thyme, 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast (cut into bite-sized cubes), 2 ½ cups reduced-sodium chicken broth or home-made chicken stock, 2 cups quick cooking brown rice, ½ tsp salt, 2 oz cream cheese, ½ bunch asparagus (trimmed and cut into small pieces), 1 cup shelled peas (or frozen and thawed), 1 cup snap peas (cut in half), ¼ cup shredded parmesan (plus more for serving), 2 tbsps chopped chives, 2 tesps chopped tarragon.\nHeat oil and butter in a large skillet or straight-sided sauté pan over medium-high heat until the butter is melted but not browning. Add the shallot, red pepper and thyme and cook, stirring often until the vegetables start to soften, 1 to 3 minutes. Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally until the chicken is no longer pink, 4 to 6 minutes. Add broth, brown rice and salt, and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low to maintain a simmer and cook until the rice has absorbed most of the broth, about 5 minutes. Remove lid and increase to high. Stir in cream cheese until melted. Add asparagus, peas and snap peas on top. Make sure the mixture comes back to a simmer, then cover, reduce heat to medium-low and let cook for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, without removing the lid and let sit for 3 to 4 minutes or until the rice absorbs the liquid and fully softens. Before serving, stir the vegetables, ¼ cup parmesan, chives and tarragon (or chervil) into the rice to combine. Serve with additional Parmesan if needed for flavor.\nROASTED PARSNIPS\n2 pounds parsnips, 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, 1 ½ tsp herbs of your choice, Italian seasoning, 1 tsp kosher salt, chopped parsley for extra flavor and garnish.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees. Peel parsnips and cut into 1-inch chunks. Toss with oil, herbs and salt in a large bowl. Spread out on a large, rimmed baking sheet in a single layer. Roast, stirring once or twice, until the parsnips are tender in the center and browned in spots on the outside, 25 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a platter or plates and garnish with parsley.\nGREEK ORZO SALAD\n1 ½ cups dry orzo pasta (about 11 oz), 1/3 cup lemon juice, 1 clove garlic (finely minced), ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, 2 tbsp chopped fresh dill, 2 tbsp chopped fresh mint, 2 ½ tsp dried oregano, 1 ¼ tsp salt, ½ tsp ground black pepper, 1 pint cherry tomatoes (cut in half), 1 European or Mediterranean cucumber (peeled, seeded and diced), 1 cup crumbled feta cheese (preferably reduced fat), ½ cup pitted black Greek olives (roughly chopped), ½ cup minced red onion.\nBring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook orzo according to package instructions. Drain through a fine mesh sieve and rinse with cold water. Drain thoroughly. Whisk lemon, garlic, olive oil, dill, mint, oregano, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Add the pasta and toss to coat. Add tomatoes, cucumber, feta, olives and red onion and toss to combine. Serve immediately or chill. You can make this a day ahead, but cut and add the cucumber and tomatoes just before serving for the best texture. You may need to add additional olive oil on the second day so taste it to see if it seems a little dry.\nSPINACH QUICHE WITH ARTICHOKES AND ROASTED RED PEPPERS\nNine-inch baked pastry shell, 6 oz ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup cottage cheese, 5 green onions (chopped, include green tops), 1 tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp dried basil, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp garlic salt, 5 eggs, 1/2 cup light cream, 2 cups baby spinach, 1/4 cup artichoke hearts (chopped, pat dry with paper towel), 1/4 cup roasted red peppers (chopped, pat dry with paper towel).\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees. In a food processor, blend the ricotta cheese, cottage cheese, chopped green onions, olive oil, dried basil, pepper and garlic salt together until smooth. Add eggs and light cream; blend again until smooth. Layer your spinach at the bottom of the pastry shell, then add chopped artichoke hearts and roasted red peppers on top. Hold aside a little bit of roasted red peppers if you'd like to add a bit of color to the top. Pour egg mixture over the top of the vegetables. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until the toothpick inserts into the center cleanly. Let quiche sit for 10 minutes before cutting.\nEASY ROASTED ARTICHOKES\n3 large artichokes, 2 lemons, 2 tbsp olive oil (sub with butter), 6 cloves garlic (halved or quartered depending on size), 1 large sprig fresh thyme (broken into smaller pieces, sub with your favorite herbs), salt and pepper to taste.\nTrim about 1/4 inch off the bottom and peel the tough outer peel with a vegetable peeler. Cut off the top 1/3 of the artichoke. Snip off the thorny tips off each petal. Cut in half and remove the fuzzy top of the artichokes. Rub cut sides with fresh lemon juice to reduce browning from oxidation. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place the artichoke halves cut side up in a 13-by-9-inch baking dish or rimmed baking sheet. Coat each side with oil, season with salt and pepper to taste, and fill each cavity with the garlic and thyme. Cut the remaining lemon in half, then cut one half into small slices. Place one small lemon slice on top of the garlic and herbs in the artichoke and turn upside down (the lemon slice will help hold the garlic and herbs in the middle). Brush the artichoke leaves with the remaining oil in between the leaves and season with salt and pepper. Cover the artichokes with foil and roast for 30-40 minutes or until the artichokes are very tender. Remove from heat and allow it to cool slightly. Flip the artichokes and remove the garlic and herbs. From there, you can smash the garlic and add it to mayo for garlic aioli if desired. Serve with additional lemon if desired. Enjoy.\nANGEL FOOD CUPCAKES WITH WHIPPED CREAM AND BERRIES\n1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, 1 cup cake flour (sifted), 12 egg whites (the closer to room temperature the better), 1/3 cup warm water, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 1/2 tsp cream of tartar, whipped cream, strawberries and raspberries (any sort of berry you want, those two are just the ones I prefer).\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. If you have regular sugar: Blend the sugar for about 2 minutes until it is superfine. Sift half of the sugar with the salt and the cake flour in a medium bowl and set the remaining sugar aside. In a large bowl, use a whisk to thoroughly combine egg whites, water, vanilla extract and cream of tartar for two minutes. Then, using a hand blender, slowly sift the reserved sugar into the eggs, beating continuously at medium speed to achieve medium peaks, Once the eggs are whipped to medium peaks, sift the flour over the mixture, 1/4 a cup at a time. Repeat until all of the flour mixture is finished. Carefully spoon mixture into a lined cupcake tray and fill 3/4 of the way up. Bake until the tops of the cupcakes are turning slightly golden, and you can insert a toothpick between the liner and the cake and have it come out clean. Cool completely & top with whipped cream and berries. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "'And the sun was darkened': Eclipse sparking everything from a mass wedding to theories on signs of the Apocalypse\n\n April 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: News \n \n 854\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n More than 4 million people — including teams of astronomers and researchers — are expected to travel to parts of the U.S. that will see the moon completely block out the sun during the total solar eclipse Monday.That path of totality stretches from Texas to New England and includes parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Ohio and New York.\nMillions more will watch partial versions of eclipse across the country donning protective glasses at local events and outside their homes, schools and workplaces.\nThe celestial event will be visible across the continental U.S. It's the biggest eclipse in America since 1806 — and there won't be another one until 2044.\nBut others are looking to the heavens for other reasons.\nA quick scan of social media shows a keen and ramped up interest in the eclipse on the spiritual, astrological and metaphysical levels.\nThat also includes plenty of conjecture and postulation to whether the moon darkening of the sun will bring with it some kind of cosmic event or spiritual upheaval. The curiosities extend to clues or indicators of biblical End Times or other prophecies — including the Rapture, Tribulation and Judgment Day referenced in the Book of Revelation.\nSpiritual interests in eclipses are not new, according to theologians.\n\"Throughout human history people have tried to explain and get a degree of control over things that make us feel very small and out of control,\" said Erik Thoennes, a professor of theology at Biola University, a private Evangelical college near Los Angeles.\n\"Cataclysmic events like an eclipse are awesome and can be scary to people, so all cultures have tried to interpret events like this through religious and spiritual lenses,\" he said.\nEvents like the April 8 eclipse have spiritual significance across cultures and faiths. Chinese folklore recommends banging pots and pans or making other noises to make an eclipse — which symbolizes a dragon eating the sun — go away. \"It has never failed,\" Thoennes joked.\nThe focus on events such as a total eclipse and its potential \"End of Days\" and Armageddon scenarios are especially prevalent among some Christians.\nThoennes said there are nine references in the Bible of the darkening the sun with ties into \"divine judgment.\" That includes when Jesus died on the cross on Good Friday. \"And the sun was darkened\" reads the Gospel of Luke's account of the crucifixion.\n\"Unlike some religions that have a cyclical view of time, the biblical view is linear and is heading to a day when God brings his kingdom once and for all and judges people for how we lived our lives, especially in relation to Him,\" Thoennes said.\n\"The end of human history on Judgment Day is described in the Bible with dramatic and apocalyptic imagery which includes awesome effects on the natural order. These events include the sun going dark which is why people think about these end time events when there is an eclipse,\" he said, stressing the importance of enjoying the eclipse as a wonder of creation.\nDave Robbins, vice president of content for End Time Ministries (a Texas-based Pentecostal group), does not expect anything spiritual will happen \"during or after the eclipse\", pointing to Old Testament scripture saying \"be not dismayed at the signs of heaven.\"\n\"The Bible does say there will be signs in the sky, but we are not to use them to predict future events,\" Robbins said.\nRAPTURE, ROCKETS & WEDDINGS\nBut that is not stopping plenty of others from trying to read the tea leaves and connect the spiritual or metaphysical dots related to the eclipse.\nThe war in the Holy Land between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is helping stoke some of that interest in the Second Coming and prophecies across the Abrahamic faiths.\nSocial media theories focus on the April 8 eclipse and previous Oct. 2023 eclipse both crossing in an area of southern Illinois named Rapture.\nThere is also plenty of interest in the restarting of the Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator operated by the European Council for Nuclear Research (CERN) on eclipse day.\nNASA is also launching three sounding rockets from Wallops Island on Virginia's Eastern Shore on April 8 \"to study how Earth's upper atmosphere is affected when sunlight momentarily dims over a portion of the planet,\" according to the U.S. space agency.\nThe three rockets will be launched in 45 minute intervals before, during and after the eclipse and follow up on similar launches during an eclipse in October 2023.\nAstrologers are also zeroing in on the eclipse along with other planetary events tying them to current and expected world events. A number of astrologers and End Times prognosticators did not respond to requests for comment about what they are expecting for the eclipse.\nOthers are taking the plunge — literally on eclipse day.\nThe Total Eclipse of the Heart Music Festival in Russellville, Arkansas is in the path of totality for the eclipse that cuts across North America.\nThe music fest is hosting a mass wedding on April 8 along with other events including a worship service on Sunday.\nEvent organizer Rodney Williams said there will be approximately 5,000 people at the three-day festival and 331 couples have signed for the free Elope at the Eclipse event.\n\"We have a lot going on,\" Williams said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "title": "Medieval Europe was far from democratic, but that didn't mean tyrants got a free pass",
    "date": "2024-04-12",
    "author": "Joelle Rollo-Koster The Conversation",
    "content": "Medieval Europe was far from democratic, but that didn't mean tyrants got a free pass\n\n April 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Joelle Rollo-Koster The Conversation | Section: News \n \n 1157\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n My students tend to imagine the Middle Ages as something like the \"Kingdom Come\" or \"Total War\" video games: an age of utter political chaos, when swords and daggers ruled, and masculinity and physical strength mattered more than governance.As a historian of the Middle Ages, I believe this turbulent image has less to do with reality than with medievalism – a term for how modern people have reimagined life during Europe's Middle Ages, from roughly 400-1400.\nMedieval Europe may have been violent, and its standards for governance would not win praise today. But people could certainly recognize dysfunctional politics, whether in a royal court or in the church, and proposed solutions.\nAt a time of rising authoritarianism, and when U.S. politics seem mired in chaos, it's worth looking back at how societies centuries ago defined bad governance.\nTyrants, kings and bad bishops\nAuthors in the Middle Ages thought about politics in terms of leadership and often called bad politics \"tyranny,\" whether they were criticizing one leader or a whole system. In any case, tyranny – or autocracy, as it's often called today – is a concept great thinkers had been discussing since antiquity.\nFor ancient Greeks, tyranny meant ruling single-handedly for the benefit of one. Aristotle, the foundational thinker on the topic, defined tyranny as the antithesis of perfect rulership, which he believed was kingship: a single ruler ruling for the general interest of all. In his view, a tyrant was controlled by desire for \"power, pleasure and wealth,\" while a king was driven by honor.\nModern political theorist Roger Boesche observed that tyrants tend to decrease the population's leisure time. According to Aristotle, free time allowed people to think and \"do\" politics – that is, to be citizens.\nDuring the Roman Republic, political thinkers compared tyranny to a diseased limb that needed to be cut off the body politic. Ironically, certain Romans eliminated Julius Ceasar for fear he was becoming a tyrant – only to get Augustus, who eventually became an emperor.\nTypes of despots\nIn late antiquity, political writers began to think about tyranny in religious leadership, as well.\nIn his \"Sententiae,\" a set of books on theology, the seventh century archbishop Isidore of Seville broached the subject of bad bishops. These men conducted themselves like \"proud pastors,\" he wrote, who \"tyrannically oppress the common people, they do not guide them, and they demand of their subjects not the glory of God but their own.\" In general, Isidore criticized political incompetence grounded in the leader's anger, pride, cruelty and greed.\nCenturies later, European leaders and writers were still debating the nature of tyranny – and what do to about it.\nJohn of Salisbury, a bishop and philosopher in 12th century England, proposed quite a radical solution: tyrannicide. In \"Policraticus,\" writings about political theory, he wrote that it was a duty to redress the order of things and kill a tyrant who was evil, violent and oppressive.\nIn John's organic conception of tyranny, however, a tyrant (the body) could exist only with the support of society (its limbs). He was one of the earliest authors to argue that tyranny survived not simply by the whim of the tyrant but with the support of his followers.\nBy the 14th century, the leading legal thinker of the time, Bartolus de Sassoferrato, differentiated between two types of tyranny. Despots came to power through legal means but acted unlawfully. He defined usurpers, on the other hand, as rulers who assumed power illegitimately, wallowed in pride and did not follow the law.\nTaking down a tyrant\nAt times, disliked or \"inconvenient\" leaders were deposed, such as England's Richard II. The record of his deposition itemized almost three dozen charges against the dethroned king: from rejecting council, defaulting on loans and exhorting religious authorities to murdering, disinheriting and impeaching rivals. We know that he did not end well: He died during imprisonment in 1400, though exactly how is a mystery.\nIn Germany, King Wenceslaus of the house of Luxembourg was deposed on Aug. 20, 1400, on grounds of being a \"useless, indolent, careless divider and unworthy owner of the empire.\" The German newspaper Die Welt ranks him as the worst king of Germany – fond of drink and his hunting dogs, and possessed by fits of rage.\nViolent disposals of supposed \"tyrants\" were not always done in the shadows. In 1407, Louis of Orléans, brother of King Charles VI of France, rode unknowingly into a deadly trap. He was assaulted by a large group of men who escaped and chased onlookers away.\nLouis was not only brother to Charles \"the Mad,\" but a political rival of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, with both men vying for control during the king's bouts of mental illness. John assumed responsibility for ordering the murder.\nHe and the lawyer he hired, a theologian named Jean Petit, argued that Burgundy had acted in the interest of the nation by ordering the death of a treasonous and greedy tyrant, and that Louis' killing was therefore justified.\nMen of the cloth\nMedieval politics did not differentiate much between the secular and religious worlds. Popes were political leaders and could be considered tyrants, too.\nDuring the Great Western Schism of 1378-1417, a split in the Catholic Church when multiple popes competed for the throne, all parties insulted each other with claims of illegitimacy and usurpation.\nEnemies of Pope Urban VI, for example, argued a telltale sign of tyranny was his uncontrollable anger, which disqualified him for leadership. Dietrich of Nieheim, who worked at the papal chancery, noted in his chronicle, \"The more he spoke, the more Lord Urban became angry, and his face finally became like a burning lamp or fiery flame from anger, and his throat was filled with hoarseness.\" French cardinals deposed Urban in 1378 on grounds of illegitimacy and tyranny.\nHe was not the only pope unseated for being tyrannical, even if that exact word was not used. The Council of Constance, a council of European clergymen convened to end the schism, deposed Pope John XXIII in 1415 on grounds ranging from disobedience and corruption to poor administration, dishonesty and obstinacy. Two years later, the same council deposed Pope Benedict XIII, accusing him of persecution, disturbing the peace, fostering division, promoting scandal and schism, and unworthiness.\nMedieval bishops and kings are hardly role models for democracies today, but their political world was not so chaotic as we often imagine. Even a world ignorant of democracy attempted to define what bad leadership was and set limits on the authority of the ones they considered irresponsible. Rules of adequate political conduct were established, though the law did not always take precedence over violence.\nBut it's worthwhile to remember the ways people have viewed bad leadership, hundreds of years before our own era's fractured politics. Today, however, we have a big advantage: We vote our leaders in and out.\nThe Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.

This approach not only enhances the taste experience but also supports sustainable eating habits by utilizing ingredients at their peak.\nSetting the foundation\nAt the heart of every great spring salad lies its foundation: the greens. Spring brings an array of tender and flavorful greens that can transform a simple salad into something extraordinary. Choosing the right mix of greens is the first step in crafting the perfect spring salad. From the buttery softness of Boston and bibb lettuce to the peppery bite of arugula and the earthy richness of spinach, each type of green offers its own unique flavor and texture.\nThe key to a perfect base is variety. Mixing different types of greens enhances a salad's visual appeal with varying shades of green and creates an abundance of delicious flavors in each bite. For a truly spring-inspired salad, consider incorporating some of the season's first tender greens, such as baby kale, sprouts, mâche and watercress. These greens are not only packed with nutrients but also have a freshness that can only be found in the spring.\nFruits and vegetables\nLeafy greens provide a tender, flavorful base, creating the perfect backdrop for the bright, crisp textures and sweet, tangy flavors of delicious spring produce. Radishes add a peppery crunch, while sweet peas and asparagus bring a delicate, earthy, unmistakably spring flavor.\nFor a touch of sweetness, strawberries, mangoes and citrus fruits can be sprinkled throughout a spring salad, creating a delightful contrast with the more savory elements. Selecting the freshest produce and combining these elements thoughtfully ensures a salad is as beautiful to look at as it is to eat.\nProteins and crunch\nAdding protein to a spring salad adds substance, making it a satisfying meal on its own. Grilled chicken or fish can be marinated in herbs and lemon for a zesty flavor that complements the greens. For vegetarians, chickpeas, black beans or tofu are excellent protein-rich additions that bring a pleasant texture to the mix.\nA crunch factor is essential for adding depth and interest to a salad. Sliced almonds, pumpkin seeds or homemade croutons can be sprinkled over the top for a satisfying bite. These elements not only add a protein boost but also introduce a variety of textures that keep every bite interesting.\nDressing it up\nThe dressing is the final flourish that ties all the salad components together. Light and zesty dressings are preferred for spring salads to heavy, creamy ones. A basic vinaigrette made with extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, a touch of honey and fresh herbs can be whisked together in just minutes.\nFor something a bit more adventurous, a blend of avocado, yogurt and lime creates a creamy dressing without the heaviness. Fresh herbs, such as basil, mint or dill, can be blended into dressings for an extra pop of spring flavor. The key is to dress the salad lightly just before serving to maintain the freshness and crispness of the ingredients.\nServing and presentation\nHow you serve a spring salad should be as colorful and inviting as the ingredients it contains. Start with a large, shallow bowl or platter to allow all the components to be displayed. Layer the greens first, then artfully arrange the vegetables, fruits and proteins on top. A sprinkle of edible flowers or fresh herbs just before serving adds a gourmet touch that can elevate the salad to a show-stopping centerpiece. The beauty of a spring salad lies in its simplicity and the natural appeal of its ingredients, so let them shine.\nFinal thoughts\nCrafting the perfect spring salad is an art that celebrates the best the season has to offer. The joy of salad-making lies in the freedom to experiment with flavors and ingredients, always resulting in a dish as nutritious as it is delicious. Embrace the creativity and freshness of spring in every bite, and let your salad reflect the season's best.\nKristen Wood is a photographer, food writer, recipe developer and the creative force behind MOON and spoon and yum, a vegetarian food blog.

    "content": "'Absolute devastation': Wars, violence in Haiti, Sudan overshadowed, overlooked\n\n April 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: News \n \n 1690\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n With the U.S. poised to allocate $95 billion in new war focused on Ukraine and Israel and global eyes glued to Gaza and Iran, wars, violence and worsening strife in Sudan and Haiti — two of the world's poorest countries — have been overshadowed.The violence in Haiti and Sudan includes mounting death tolls from gang, mob and paramilitary bloodshed, sexual assaults against women and girls, surges in refugees and worsening food situations.\nU.S. Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, both Maryland Democrats, and others are trying to bring attention and resolution to the violent conflicts that have ravaged Sudan in Africa and Haiti in the Caribbean.\nGANG VIOLENCE, 'MOB JUSTICE'\nA new United Nations report released Friday shows more than 2,505 people (including 82 children) were killed and more than 438 people kidnapped in Haiti's gang violence during the first quarter of 2024. The death toll is up 53% from the previous quarter.\n\"More than 4,600 inmates escaped from the two main prisons in the capital, and at least 22 police stations, sub-police stations and other police buildings were looted or set on fire, and 19 police officers were killed or injured,\" the UN report said of the anarchy also referencing gang continued use of sexual violence against women and girls.\n\"Mob justice\" incidents in Haiti killed 141 persons during the first three months of 2024. There have been an estimated 7,300 deaths in the gang wars since 2023, which have worsened since the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse in July 2021.\nThere have been more than 362,000 Haitians displaced in the violence, and the Biden administration faces criticism after it resumed deportation flights back to the ravaged island nation.\n'ABSOLUTE DEVASTATION'\nThe war in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces marked a grim one-year anniversary on April 15.\nThe conflict between rival military factions has seen more than 15,000 people killed, more than 8 million others displaced and more than 2 million refugees.\nThere have been more than 150 Christian churches damaged and destroyed, and Christians have been attacked during the paramilitary civil war in overwhelmingly Muslim Sudan, according to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom.\nCardin urged additional U.S. and international aid to Sudan in comments on the Senate Floor Friday.\n\"In the last year there has been absolute devastation in Sudan. And at every turn, unarmed Sudanese have been in the crosshairs. These armed groups have committed extrajudicial killings. They have indiscriminately bombed civilian targets like hospitals that have used rape and sexual violence against woman of certain ethnic groups as a weapon of war. They have razed cities and towns, killing inhabitants, strangling commerce and trade. They have destroyed farmlands and forced farmers to leave, preventing harvests,\" Cardin said.\nHe cited a World Food Program warning that Sudan is on the verge of \"unprecedented levels of starvation.\"\nVan Hollen spoke at an April 15 event in Washington on the Sudan war hoping to generate more interest in getting humanitarian supplies and a ceasefire forged.\n\"There are lots of crises around the world that we need to address. We need to address the crisis in Sudan right now,\" Van Hollen said at the Unite for Sudan event.\n\"However we do it, we need to get more humanitarian assistance to Sudan now as we work to end the war. The best way to help people of course is to get a ceasefire and end this war and hold people accountable,\" he said.\n'WE NEED TO EXPAND THE PIE'\nThe Maryland lawmakers and relief agencies are calling for more U.S. and international humanitarian aid to Haiti and Sudan as Congress moves forward on a new $60.8 billion war assistance package for Ukraine in its war against invading Russian forces and a $26.4 billion outlay for Israel's war against Hamas and Gaza. The latter includes $9.2 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza, Sudan and other global trouble spots.\nCardin — who chairs the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee — called for increased funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.\n\"We need to expand the pie, not shrink it. Otherwise, when we try to address one crisis, we have to take money from another emergency circumstance. We should not have to choose between saving starving Sudanese or saving starving Gazans. We should not have to choose between helping Haitians or helping Ukrainians,\" Cardin said.\nThe Biden administration's FY 2025 budget calls for $42.8 billion for foreign assistance budgets for USAID and the State Department. That includes $10.3 billion for USAID humanitarian and refugee programs.\nSome baseline budget numbers for U.S. aid have been down amid partisan budget fights, but they have been bolstered by supplemental spending packages.\nThe U.S. has sent $1 billion in relief aid to Sudan since October 2023, according to the Commission on International Religious Freedom. The U.S. has moved $171 million in humanitarian funds to Haiti since October 2022. There are also questions to continue regarding the $13 billion in money raised for Haiti — including by prominent U.S. celebrities and the Clinton Foundation — after the devastating 2010 earthquake.\nThe Biden administration has already sent $75 billion to Ukraine, and Israel gets $3.3 billion annually in U.S. weapons and other military aid.\nThe Pentagon has sent additional munitions and weapons to Israel since Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks sparked the Holy Land war. The conflict has caused significant civilian casualties and dire conditions and has seen more than 13,000 and 10,000 women killed, according to the United Nations.\nThe U.S. spends close to $1 trillion on its military and national security annually.\n'WORLD'S LARGEST HUNGER CRISIS'\nU.S. Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-California) said the conflict In Sudan is \"the world's largest hunger and internal displacement crisis.\"\n\"The international community must step up to push for an end to the fighting and contribute to the grossly under-resourced humanitarian response,\" Kamlager-Dove said.\nMostly Christian South Sudan became its own country in 2011. Sudan, which has a population of more than 49 million people, is overwhelmingly Muslim.\nRosemary DiCarlo, the United Nations under-secretary-general, said the Sudan war is \"a crisis of epic proportions.\"\nIn Haiti, the situation has gone from bad to worse. Criminal gangs control much of Port-au-Prince, which has a population of more than 2.6 million.\nThe Biden administration sent a special anti-terrorism Marine Corps unit to Haiti in March to protect the U.S. Embassy.\nU.S. Army Gen. Laura Richardson, who is head of the Southern Command, said the Pentagon has a range of contingency plans related to Haiti, including a mass migration.\nRichardson told the Atlantic Council in March as of now, the U.S. doesn't have plans to send troops into Haiti but the situation needs to be addressed internationally, according to the Defense Department.\nThere are also concerns about U.S.-made guns, ammunition and other weapons making their way to Haitian gangs via smuggling and shipments into privately owned ports.\nThe U.S. has been trying to get a special police force from Kenya deployed in Haiti, but that has been delayed by the ongoing violence and the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry in March. Jimmy Chérizier, a former Haitian police officer known by the nickname \"Barbecue,\" has become a central figure in the island's crime and chaos.\nOn April 12, a Transitional Presidential Council was established to structure new elections, a new prime minister and deployment of an international police force.\nBut relief efforts have been challenging beyond the violence. A UN appeal to raise $720 million to help the situation raised 34% of that goal last year. Humanitarian groups have launched a new $674 million relief effort.\n'OUTRAGED'\nThe situation in Haiti has resulted in more refugees heading to the U.S., some via boat to Florida and others entering the U.S. and seeking asylum via the border with Mexico.\nU.S. Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio, both Florida Republicans, wrote Biden last month voicing worries about the administration \"opening the floodgates\" to a mass migration from Haiti.\nOn the other side of the immigration issue, Haitian advocates and their U.S. allies slammed reports April 18 that the Biden administration had restarted flights to deport migrants.\n\"I am deeply outraged about recent reporting that the Department of Homeland Security has resumed deportations to Haiti. A country facing a political crisis of epic proportions, where basic human rights can no longer be protected, women and girls are being sexually abused on a daily basis, young boys are recruited into becoming child soldiers, over 5 million are heading towards famine, and 80% of the capital is controlled by gangs,\" said U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-Florida).\n\"The reality is that life in Haiti is currently unbearable. Deportation, under these circumstances, is simply an act of atrocious cruelty. We are either the leader of the free world who welcomes all refugees seeking safety, or we're not. I urge the Biden-Harris Administration to reverse this misguided decision and stop deportations immediately,\" she said.\nROUGH HISTORY\nThe current situation in Haiti has seen relief workers in peril, and Haiti has long been a haven for human and sex trafficking. The Dominican Republic has also fortified its border and cracked down on Haitian refugees and migrants.\nHaiti has long been the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Its history has been littered by violence, poverty, coups and corruption. The U.S. occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934 — 18 years. That came after a violent mob killed Haiti's tyrannical president in 1915 and President Woodrow Wilson sent in U.S. Marines at the behest of National City Bank of New York (which is now Citibank / Citigroup), which had taken the reins of Haiti's central bank.\nThe Caribbean nation's economic development has further been stunted by a series of payments it made to France over the years as part of its independence agreement. Haiti's debt totaled $21 billion and was financed by Citibank and French banks.\nWhile Florida, in particular Miami, and New York City have the largest Haitian populations in the U.S, Maryland's Eastern Shore and Baltimore areas are home to a number of residents of Haitian ancestry.\nNorthern Virginia, Phoenix and the Dallas-Fort Worth areas have the largest Sudanese populations in the U.S. Van Hollen said efforts to draw attention to the Sudanese conflict need to continue.\n\"We're going to need to grow our numbers. We're going to need to make sure we are calling out injustice in Sudan,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Reporting election results can get colorful\n\n April 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 728\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In November, the every four-year routine of counting votes to determine who has been elected as the U.S president will, as always, generate intense and widely followed media coverage.While much attention will be focused on the popular vote results nationwide, the most important and meaningful results are which candidate carried enough states to win in the electoral college. Accordingly, media reporting on election night will focus largely on which states went red and which states went blue.\nFor this commentary, I did a deep dive into the history on the origins, uses, and perhaps some largely forgotten practice changes over time on red and blue color labeling in the American political arena.\nThere are several thoughts on how color labels came to be used in American politics. Some suggest they came from Britain's Parliament where blue has long been associated with their right leaning political party (the Conservative Party) and red has long been associated with their left leaning political party (the Liberal Party).\nI suggest a more plausible explanation were decisions by American television networks to use color images in their coverage of presidential election results.\nThe late 1950s and early 1960s included a wide range of changes in American culture. One was a massive shift in how Americans received entertainment and news in their homes.\nAfter World War II, steadily increasing numbers of Americans stopped listening to radios and started watching televisions. That trend accelerated when color televisions became more affordable and more widely found in American living rooms. By 1972, a majority of American households had color televisions.\nThen, as now, the most important measure of success for television broadcasters is attracting and retaining viewers. The more viewers the more revenue from commercials. What better way to do that than use colorful and easy to understand updates in news broadcasts for election night coverage of presidential elections.\nFor almost 50 years, presidential election results coverage by the three legacy networks (ABC, NBC and CBS) had no uniform protocol on which colors to use to identify state results for presidential election candidates.\nIn some presidential election cycles, ABC, NBC and CBS used blue to designate states won by the Democratic presidential candidate, in other years they used red. The color pattern was reversed with designating state states won by the Republican presidential candidate. In one election cycle, for unexplained reasons, ABC used yellow to designate states won by the Republican presidential candidate. The unintended outcome was confusion especially with viewers who were \"channel surfers\" continuously searching for the most recent results.\nNo small wonder that veteran journalism observer Jodi Enda wrote the following in a 2020 Smithsonian Magazine article \"When Republicans Were Blue and Democrats Were Red.\" \"In the beginning, blue was red and red was blue, and they changed back and forth from election to election and network to network in what appears, in hindsight, to be a flight of whimsy.\"\nUniformity and continuity with color assignments finally became the norm starting with the 1996 presidential election cycle.\nPresently ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox and MSNBC all use the same color guidelines. They use blue for identifying states won by Democratic presidential candidates and red for identifying states won by Republican presidential candidates.\nBeginning in the 2000 presidential election cycle, the use of colors expanded greatly beyond being used to display state by state presidential election results.\nSince then, red and blue labels have been used and are routinely used to label political candidates and elected officials at all levels; campaigns, and where partisan elections are held — states, counties, cities and, towns.\nNo doubt that will continue but one major change may be in the future due to steadily increasing numbers of unaffiliated voters and independent candidates.\nDespite the fact that no third-party or independent presidential candidate has had success in winning states in presidential elections since George Wallace won five states and 46 electoral votes in 1968, it may happen again. It may happen as soon as this year.\nIn recent years two current U. S. Senators have already been elected after running as independents — Bernie Sanders in Vermont and Angus King in Maine.\nIf or when an independent or third-party candidate wins a state or states in a presidential campaign, the new color used to record that may be purple, reflecting a new normal when blue and red are no longer the exclusive options.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The religious leaders who brought her to Jesus, reminding Him that the law of Moses commanded her to be stoned, demanded Him to give His opinion.\nHe said to them, \"Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.\" One by one, they all walked away.\nThen Jesus asked her, \"Where are your accusers? Has no one condemned you?\" She said, \"No one, Lord.\" And Jesus said, \"Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.\" (John 8:11)\nThis is essentially what Jesus says to every forgiven sinner — \"Go, and from now on, sin no more.\"\nThe apostle Paul elaborates concerning this truth in Galatians 2:20: \"I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.\" What gets crucified with Christ is our old self — in other words, the way we lived before we experienced the saving grace of God. (Romans 6:6)\nThe world we live in is in desperate need of seeing people that are truly transformed by the power of God. This really is possible. To find out how, I challenge you to read Colossians 3:1–17.\nPaul Twining is the Caroline County coordinator for National Day of Prayer. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I remember a pamphlet that showed sinners drowning in a literal lake of fire for all eternity. Scary stuff.Author and pastor Rob Bell presents us with an interesting thought though — do we really believe that God, who loves us so much, is going to condemn billions of people, and reward only a select few with heaven? Will He really condemn these billions, throughout history, with eternal torment for things they did in a few short years of their life on Earth? It's not a question I would presume to know the answer to.\nI do know this, just as well as you do — our God is a God of love. He loves us so much that He gave His only begotten Son. Therefore, I prefer to substitute \"fear\" with \"love.\" For instance, Proverbs 1:7 tells us, \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. Fools despise wisdom and instruction.\" I like to think that \"the love of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.\"\nI must admit, I have no fear of the Lord. Instead, what I have is respect, reverence, awe, love and an appreciation of His love for me. The love He shows us cannot not be compared to anything else. The angels who appeared to the shepherds, in the Gospel of Luke, gave us good advice: \"Don't be afraid, because a savior is born.\"\nJesus came to us — God in the flesh — bringing love and salvation.\nIf we live a life of righteousness, following Christ, what do we have to fear? Nothing. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Baked beans: a year-round favorite\n\n May 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1272\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Baked beans are a favorite any time of the year but most definitely during the summer.These beans are a picnic favorite, and who can have hot dogs without some baked beans. People around the world love these beans — each culture having their own version of cooking them. T\nhe American baked bean originated back to the Native American Eastern tribes. Their method of cooking — soaked beans mixed wirh bear fat and maple syrup, placed in earthen pots or deer skin pots and hung-over open fires and slow cooking until tender.\nThe early pilgrims who were Puritan Christians did not allow working on Sundays, which also meant no cooking on Sundays. The cooks would prepare these beans on Saturday to be slow cooked on Sunday over the low wooden fires.\nExtra bread was made and set aside for the Sunday meal over the low wood fires. When they returned from church, the meal was ready.\nThe great Boston bean connection occurred when Boston became popular for its rum production, salt pork availability and molasses production. In 1919 there was a molasses tank explosion.\nOne of the Purity Distilling Company tanks exploded near Boston's Harbor. Almost 12,000 tons of brown sticky thick molasses gushed from a storage tank. Plenty of molasse was to be had.\nTherefore, the Boston baked bean was born.\nWhether you like your baked beans slow cooked with brown sugar, molasses or honey, there is no doubt they are delicious with some BBQ sauce. Try some of today's recipes and enjoy those baked beans.\nOLD FASHIONED BAKED BEANS\n1 lb navy beans, 1 tsp baking soda water to cover, 1 tsp salt, 3 oz ham or 3 oz cooked bacon, 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, 1 medium onion (chopped). Add 1 tsp baking soda to 6 cups of water. Bring water to a boil. Sort through beans for debris. Add navy beans to water. Boil for 10 minutes. Turn off heat. Cover pot. Let sit overnight. Rinse beans well. Add beans and all other ingredients to an oven proof pot with a tight fitting lid. Stir well. Add water until the beans are just covered. Cover the pot with a lid. Bake for 5 to 6 hours at 300 degrees. Every hour, stir and add water to cover if beans are drying out. The final product should be thick and not runny.\nHELEN'S SWEET AND SOUR BEANS\nUsing a large skillet — cook 8 strips of diced bacon until crisp. Place bacon on paper towels. Drain and reserve 2 tbsps of the drippings. In the drippings, sauté 2 medium onions (thinly sliced) until tender. Add 1 cup packed brown sugar, 1/2 cup cider vinegar, 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp ground mustard, and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. Bring these ingredients to a boil. In a crock pot combine the bacon with one 28 ounce can undrained pork and beans, one 16 ounce can kidney beans, rinsed and drained, one 16 ounce can lima beans, drained, one 15 ounce can black eyed peas, rinsed and drained. Add the onion mixture and then the bacon — mix well. Cover and cook on high for 3 to 4 hours. Enjoy with rolls or corn bread squares.\nBBQ BAKED BEANS\n2 slices bacon (diced), 1 small sweet onion (diced), 1 bell pepper (diced), 2 garlic cloves (minced), 1 tbsp smoked paprika, 1/4 to 1/2 tsp chipotle chili powder, ¼ tsp salt, ¼ tsp freshly cracked black pepper, 2 tbsps apple cider vinegar, 2 tbsps BBQ sauce, 2 tbsps ketchup, 1 tbsp Dijon mustard, 1 tbsp brown sugar, 2 (22 oz) cans baked beans of your choice. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.\nHeat a large (oven safe, if you don't want to transfer) skillet over medium-low heat and add the bacon. Cook until it's brown and crisp and most of the fat is rendered. Stir in the onion, pepper and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until everything softens, about 5 minutes. Stir in the paprika, chili powder, salt and pepper. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the vinegar, BBQ sauce, ketchup, mustard and brown sugar until combined. Stir in the baked beans directly from the can. Bring the mixture to a boil, then turn off the heat. I suggest tasting the beans here and adding more salt, pepper or heat if desired. If you'd like, you can lay a few strips of bacon on top of the beans here too.\nPlace the skillet or transfer to an oven-safe dish in the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until bubbly and syrupy. Remove and let cool slightly before serving. You can make these ahead of time — cook them in the skillet then let cook to room temperature and cover, placing in the fridge. Bake the next day (or whenever you're ready). These also freeze well.\nTEXAS BAKED BEANS\n1 (16 oz) can pork and beans, 1 (16 oz) can red kidney beans, 1 (16 oz) can pinto beans, 8 slices bacon or 8 slices turkey bacon (cooked crisp, then crumbled), 1 lb lean ground beef, 1 onion (chopped), 1 tbsp prepared mustard, 1 1/2 cups ketchup, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar. Fry the bacon crisp and then crumble. Put aside. Brown the ground beef with the chopped onions. Drain. Combine all ingredients, except bacon, in a large casserole dish. Top with the crumbled bacon. Bake at 350 degrees for about 1 hour.\nCOWBOY STYLE BAKED BEANS\n1 pound dried navy, pinto or pink beans; 2 large onions (diced), 12 ounces smoked pork or ham steak (chopped), 3 cups chicken stock, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/4 cup dark molasses, 1/4 cup ketchup, 3 tbsps dark brown sugar (plus more as needed), salt and pepper. Soak the beans overnight in water in a large bowl. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Sauté the onions and pork over medium heat in a cast iron Dutch oven until the onions are tender, about 10 minutes. Add the drained beans, pork, chicken stock, cayenne, molasses, ketchup, brown sugar, and salt and pepper to taste and bring to a boil. Cover the casserole and transfer to the oven. Bake for 3 1/2 to 4 hours, until the beans are tender. Serve topped with a sprinkle of brown sugar.\nCOUNTRY BEAN SUPPER\nThis is a very hearty combination of different types of beans combined with your choice of hamburger, such as turkey or bison or the healthy 90/10 beef. This recipe is easy to make, very filling and simply add a roll to complete the meal. Perfect for a busy day dinner, Saturday lunch or hungry teens.\n1 16-oz package of 90/10 ground beef, 1 cup diced white onion, 1/4 cup of cooked bacon, 1 45-oz can of red or any kind of kidney beans, 1 can of butter beans, 1 can of cannellini beans, 1 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of black pepper, 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar, two tablespoons of water, one cup of ketchup, ½ cup of brown sugar, 1 tbsp of liquid smoke. Brown one pound of beef with 1 cup diced onion until well cooked, drain. In a crockpot place the beef and onion mixture with 1/4 cup fried bacon, drained and broken into pieces, one 45 ounce can of pork and beans, one 15 ounce can of kidney beans, drained, one 15 ounce can of butter beans, drained, one 15 ounce can of cannellini beans undrained, one tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, one tbsp vinegar, two tbsps water, one cup ketchup, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 tbsp liquid smoke. Mix slightly, place lid on crock pot — turn on low heat and cook for 4 to 6 hours. Serve with rolls. Perfect for the busy days. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Some people disagree with what it says, or do not like the way it makes them feel about themselves.However, most people do not realize that when you read the Bible, you are entering into the spiritual realm of reasoning with God.\nGod desires us to reason with Him, and even invites us to does this in Isaiah 1:18.\n\"Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\"\nHow is this even possible?\nReasoning with God always gives birth to questions within our hearts and minds. Those questions cause us to seek Him and find answers.\nGod is not afraid of your hardest questions. The ultimate thing He wants you to know is that He loves you so much that He sent His on begotten son to die for your sins, so that if you will turn from your sin, confess Jesus as your Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be forgiven and saved from His coming judgement on this sinful world.\nSo read your Bible, and start in the Gospel of John. God is waiting to reason with you, and you will not regret it.\nEd Connaster is pastor of Refuge Christian Fellowship Church. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Korean War veteran, 92, mindful of those made 'supreme sacrifice'\n\n May 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 519\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Korean War veteran Zeford Gaddy is blind because of injuries he suffered to his eyes in battle some 70 years ago, but the 92-year-old Port Deposit resident downplays his blindness whenever someone broaches the subject.That's because Gaddy knows all too well that some of his fellow soldiers lost their lives in combat during his 21-month stint in Korea.\n\"They made the supreme sacrifice,\" Gaddy emphasized, before noting that he is mindful of and ever-grateful to all U.S. servicemen and servicewomen who were killed in all wars and conflicts.\nRaised in Cecil County, Gaddy was drafted by the U.S. Army in the early 1950s, when he was about 21, and he was sent \"straight to Korea\" after finishing boot camp in Fort Indiantown Gap, Pa.\n\"Something had to be done and others did it before me. I was just picking up the baton,\" Gaddy said, explaining how he viewed his wartime military service as necessary and as a privilege. \"It was an honor. I knew what my purpose was. I was there to serve and protect our country.\"\nGaddy spent much of his tour of duty in battle zones and, as a result, he experienced that deep bond — that brotherhood — that soldiers have with one another because they're fighting side by side. \"You lived on a line and that puts you in a different frame of mind,\" he said.\nDespite the closeness that grows among soldiers in combat, there was little time for mourning in the heat of battle when a serviceman was killed, according to Gaddy. \"When one dropped out, you had to move up. Everything was too fast-paced. You had to keep the rest safe,\" Gaddy said.\nGaddy is blind today because metal fragments from a nearby explosion peppered his eyes in the midst of battle, sending him to a military hospital for about one week before he returned to duty.\nBut the damage to his eyes caused his vision to diminish gradually over the decades that followed Gaddy's honorable discharge from the Army in 1953. Gaddy's wife, Monolyne — they have been married 62 years — told the Cecil Whig that her husband has undergone 10 surgeries because he found himself plagued by cysts every time once-imbedded metal fragments surfaced on the front of his body.\nOn Sunday, Gaddy will be recognized for his wartime military service at Port Deposit VFW Post 8185 moments after the Memorial Day ceremony is completed, confirmed William Ward, who is the post commander. (Kevin Clark, a Gaddy family friend, was instrumental in bringing attention to Gaddy.)\n\"We are going to present him with a VFW coin at the end of our ceremony,\" Ward said.\nWard noted that Gaddy will be recognized during the portion of the program when the post honors \"our living veterans,\" which occurs after servicemen and servicewomen who made the ultimate sacrifice have been honored. During that latter part of the ceremony, Ward will present the Order of St. Michael medallion — a high honor — to one of the veterans affiliated with the Post 8185.\nAs for recognizing Gaddy, Ward commented, \"I will speak well of him, and I will speak well of his service.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Never forget: Greater love hath no man but that a man lay down his life for his friends\n\n May 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RICK STEVENS Special to the Star Democrat | Section: Life \n \n 541\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Recently, I attended a family wedding on Maryland's Eastern Shore, staying overnight in the small village of Cambridge.To pass the time between nuptial obligations, I decided to walk around the town. At the corner of Church and High streets, I encountered the Christ Episcopal Church and its accompanying cemetery, which I later learned has served as a burial ground dating to the 1690s. My innate curiosity led me through the iron gates to stroll among the gravestones. I discovered that four former Maryland governors are buried there, along with generations of local parish families.\nTime and weather have rendered many markers nearly illegible, but one stone slab, adorned with an American flag, caught my eye.\nLevin J. Newcomb Jr. was born April 27, 1918. He died June 19, 1944, in Normandy, France. Capt. Newcomb was just 26 years old. His marker records he was a member of Company A, 115 Infantry, 29th Division. It's reasonable to assume Capt. Newcomb was the company commander. The marker is engraved with the crossed rifles of an infantryman and the blue and gray yin and yang patch of the 29th Infantry Division. It includes the scripture, \"Greater love hath no man but that a man lay down his life for his friends.\"\nAt the top are the words, \"IN MEMORY OF,\" a phrase that intrigued me. Why were those words necessary?\nIt turns out Capt. Newcomb's final resting place is actually Plot G, Row 25, Grave 7 in the Normandy American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, France. He never came home to Dorchester County.\nIt was common in that era for servicemembers to be interred close to where they died. Many families, seeking closure or hoping to create a physical connection to their loved ones, placed tributes in their local cemeteries. Those markers allowed them to share their experience of loss with others in the community and perhaps cope with what must have been nearly intolerable grief.\nThis year marks the 80th anniversary of the Normandy invasion. It's the 80th anniversary of a campaign between June and September of 1944 that saw some 29,000 Americans killed in action.\nToday, it's impossible to know the positive impact the fallen might have had on their families and communities across our nation had they survived the war. Robbed of life's bounties and promise, we'll never know how soldiers like Capt. Newcomb would have contributed to the greater good of society. I imagine him sitting in a pew in Christ Church with his wife, June, and young son, Richard, enjoying tasty Maryland crab at picnics, quietly being a pillar of the community … rarely talking about his experiences in combat.\nBut it was not to be. His brave commitment to a calling greater than himself is his legacy.\nCapt. Levin J. Newcomb Jr., and others like him, are why we pause and reflect each Memorial Day. Understandably, I'd never heard of Capt. Newcomb before my unplanned wandering through that small, timeworn garden of remembrance. Yet, I'm honored to have learned a little more about him while researching this message. More importantly, I'm reminded of our explicit duty to \"never forget\" the contributions of our fallen … wherever they may rest in peace.\nRetired Maj. Gen.

My sister was married and prepared food several nights each week.\nMy job was to cook for my dad and three younger brothers several nights each week. Well, thanks to the Esskay Company, I became a professional hot dog and burger queen.\nOne night it would be hot dogs on a bun, the next night it would be burgers on buns, and then the third night it would be their choice — burger or dogs.\nI made it nice for them. I would have a platter all filled with chopped and sliced onions, sliced tomatoes, relishes, sliced pickles, mustard and ketchup. I was so proud of how nice the table looked and the cleanup was so quick and easy.\nOne of my brothers told mom years later that he did not eat hot dogs or burgers for many years, and my dad said his heartburn problems came from overeating burgers and hot dogs. My baby brother said he always wondered \"where are the fries\" but never asked.\nI cannot move on with recipes until I tell you about my brief experience with the hot dog toaster.\nI found a hot dog toaster while shopping one day. It looked exactly like a regular toaster, but the slots were wider and only held 4 hot dogs. I anxiously proceeded to try this great invention — no boiling water in the saucepan with a drop of vinegar (for relief of heartburn my dad would say), no having to drag out the grill or the iron fry pan.\nI was smiling as I prepared my sides when the dogs started burning. I couldn't get the release button to work, and they kept burning. Through the smell and smoke I quickly unplugged this thing, and it currently is at rest in a Caroline County dumpster.\nNow, here are the recipes.\nCHICAGO STYLE HOT DOG\n4 hot dog buns, 3 tbsps melted butter, 1 tbsp poppy seeds, 4 hot dogs, 1 tbsp yellow mustard, 1/4 cup pickle relish, 1/4 white onion (finely chopped), 1 tomato (sliced into half moons), 4 pickle spears, 8 sport peppers, 1/2 tsp celery salt.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Brush outside of hot dog buns with butter and sprinkle poppy seeds on top. Place buns, seam side down, on a baking sheet. Bake until lightly toasted and poppy seeds stick to the bun, about 10 minutes. In a large pot of boiling water, add hot dogs and boil until warmed through. Place hot dogs in buns and then top with mustard, onion, relish, tomato slices, pickle spear, sport peppers and a pinch of celery salt.\nSPIRAL DOGS\n1 wooden skewer, 4 hot dogs, 4 buns.\nHeat grill. Slide a long wooden skewer through the entirety of your hot dog. Place the hot dog on a cutting board and, using a paring knife, cut into the hot dog at a slight angle. Turn the hot dog and continue cutting until you reach the other end. Carefully remove the skewer from the hot dog. Repeat with remaining dogs. Grill for 8 minutes. Add any and all your favorite toppings.\nHAWAIIAN HOT DOGS\n8 King's Hawaiian original sweet hot dog buns, 8 hot dogs split lengthwise (be careful not to cut all the way through). FOR THE PINEAPPLE SALSA: 2 cups fresh pineapple (finely chopped), 1/2 small red onion (finely chopped), 1/2 cup freshly chopped cilantro, 3 tbsps fresh lime juice, kosher salt. FOR THE SPICY MAYO: 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1/4 cup Sriracha, 1 tbsp fresh lime juice, kosher salt.\nMake the pineapple salsa: In a small bowl, toss together pineapple, onion, cilantro and lime juice. Season with salt and set aside. Make the spicy mayo: In another small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, Sriracha, and lime juice, if adding. Season with salt and set aside. Heat a grill or grill pan over medium heat. Split King's Hawaiian Original Hawaiian Sweet Hot Dog Buns and toast as desired. Set aside. Place hot dogs on a grill or grill pan and cook for about 3 minutes, or until grill marks appear. Place hot dogs in buns, then top with pineapple salsa, and drizzle with spicy mayo. Garnish with more cilantro before serving.\nEVERYTHING BAGEL DOGS\n2 tbsps poppy seeds, 2 tbsps dried minced onion, 2 tbsps sesame seeds, 2 tsps garlic powder, 1 tsp coarse salt. FOR THE BAGEL HOT DOGS: 1 package puff pastry (thawed), 1 package cream cheese (softened), 1 package hot dogs, 1 1/2 cups water, 2 tbsps baking soda.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees. Combine all seasonings into a small bowl, stirring until well blended. Set aside. Slice the puff pastry into 1\" strips lengthwise. Spread cream cheese along each strip, then roll around a hot dog, covering it from end to end. Set aside. Microwave water until it starts to steam a little, about 1 minute. Pour into a large bowl, stirring in baking soda until dissolved. Dip each hot dog into the baking soda-water mixture, then place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Liberally sprinkle each hot dog with Everything Bagel seasoning. Bake until the pastry has puffed up and turned a light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.\nOLD FASHIONED LUNCHEON COUNTER DOG\n8 hot dogs (sliced down the middle), 8 buns, 1 onion (chopped or sliced in rings), cooking oil and butter.\nHeat oil in a non-stick pan to medium heat. Prepare fresh buns by opening and buttering them. Add sliced or chopped onions to fry. When browned, remove onions to keep warm, or keep them in the pan pushed to the side. Slice hot dogs down the middle but not all the way through (keep it connected). You want to pry them open to have a double wide face down hot dog. Lay them flat, cut side down in the seasoned pan and cook until brown, Flip to the other side and brown. When browned to your liking, remove from the pan. Keep the pan on medium heat. Put buttered buns face down in the hot pan to toast them (I press them down a couple of times so butter and pan connect). When nice and brown, remove them. Assemble the hot dog and sauteed onions into the bun. Dress with mustard and ketchup and anything else your heart desires! Pour a nice, ice-cold Coke with a straw, add some crinkle fries, and enjoy a trip back in time!\nCHILI DOGS\n1 tbsp olive oil, 1 pound lean ground beef, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce, 1/4 cup ketchup, 2 tbsps Dijon mustard, 8 all-beef hot dogs, 8 hot dog buns, grated sharp cheddar cheese, finely chopped red onion.\nHeat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add the beef, onion powder, garlic powder, kosher salt, and chili powder and cook until the beef is browned, mashing and breaking up any large pieces, about 8 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, ketchup, and mustard and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 10 to 12 minutes to let the flavors meld. Meanwhile, grill the hot dogs. Heat an outdoor grill for direct, medium-high heat. Scrape the grill grates clean as needed. Place the hot dogs on the grill and grill until well-marked and heated through, about 2 minutes per side. Turn the heat off and gently toast the buns on the still-warm grill, about 2 minutes. To serve, place a hot dog in each bun and top with the chili, cheddar cheese, and red onions. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maybe there is hope for America to recover values\n\n June 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JOHN McCULLOUGH JR. | Section: Columns \n \n 764\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n About a dozen years ago, I wrote a Star Democrat letter to the editor lamenting that the political Left had taken over all of the societal corridors of power and influence.I also stated that I believed this would require either a collapse of our nation, requiring conservatives to rebuild it, or that it would require a 30-year plan to raise our children to take them back. Thankfully, there was not a collapse, though movies like the recent \"Civil War\" remind us that this is still a possibility and in the mind of some, a very distinct possibility.\nThe American people, except for those on the coasts and in big cities, are still predominantly conservative, but the \"flyover\" areas of the country just didn't have the societal influence to prevail in the culture wars that have erupted. And though I have to admit that I was not exactly right, because conservatives are not trying to take back those lost corridors of influence, but rather I am seeing them set up a sort of \"political parallel universe\" to basically try to make those former corridors of influence obsolete, or at least to take away their power to control all narratives.\nThis is actually a better scenario for the country, because it can happen faster and without having to find ways to fire or replace those in power (who have dug in like ticks, and black ball any who might threaten them, to hold onto their positions). Instead, it simply gives Americans alternative choices on where to find more worldview-friendly places to get news and information, education, entertainment, goods and services, social media, etc.\nLet me give you some examples to buttress my point.\nA dozen years ago there was only one conservative news cable channel to get information, Fox News, while there were seven to eight liberal ones, which included the likes of CNN, MSNBC, the alphabet stations and several others. Now conservatives have at least four to five cable news channels to choose from and myriad places to get conservative news on the internet.\nConservative leaning colleges, like Hillsdale, Patrick Henry, Regent and Liberty University, are bursting at the seams as parents want to keep their children away from the culture rot and \"group think\" that is spewed by most of higher education nowadays. School board elections are being hotly contested as conservatives have realized they have to stop the liberal machine at an early age to protect their kids. Parents want their students to be taught how to think, not what to think.\nAnd Hollywood, through both viewers voting with their feet and even through the natural weaning away from movie theaters that happened during the pandemic, is also finding itself ignored in their woke bubble of self-importance. There is now even a conservative actors' guild being formed by those who were previously being muzzled or intimidated by power wielding Hollywood execs.\nIn sports, those who were being idolized for sitting down during a national anthem are now being booed. In goods and services, there are now those who proudly announce their \"made in America\" or patriotic stance on things to promote their products, and patriotic Americans are now \"canceling\" liberal businesses who try to shove their political views down our throats ... see Bud Light for a glaring example.\nAnd liberal social media, probably the most ruthless bullies out there, are now finding themselves challenged by alternative conservative options. Facebook is challenged by Truth Social and others. Twitter, bought out by Elon Musk, is a bold attempt of his to bring balance to the information universe. YouTube being challenged by Rumble. Podcast after podcast, talk radio show after talk radio show of conservative commentators are regularly growing their audiences while attempts by liberal commentators to do the same largely fall flat.\nAfter waiting a dozen years, it is encouraging to see Americans demanding and supporting this \"parallel political universe\" or what some have called an \"alternative economy\" that allows us to choose who we want to support with our time, attention and wallets.\nIn that old letter to the editor mentioned at the beginning, I stated that progressivism is just a new word for socialism and communism, and thankfully, the country is starting to push back in a dramatic and tangible way against that worldview. Maybe there is hope for us yet, to recover the values that made us the greatest nation in history with our foundations of faith, family and freedom.\nJohn McCullough Jr. is a licensed residential homebuilder.

    "title": "Paths forward: Can manufactured housing, adaptive reuse move the affordable housing needle?",
    "date": "2024-06-03",
    "author": "Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor",
    "content": "Paths forward: Can manufactured housing, adaptive reuse move the affordable housing needle?\n\n June 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: News \n \n 1205\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The need to address affordable housing shortages and higher home prices and rents has prompted plenty of talk during and since the pandemic.Cody Filipczak — a home builder and developer in Eau Claire — is translating those words into deeds.\nHe redeveloped a shuttered assisted living facility into new affordable apartments and has development plans to bring more manufactured homes to a region where real estate costs have roughly doubled.\nStill, those are just small bites at a very big and challenging nationwide apple.\nFilipczak partnered with the nearby city of Altoona and community nonprofit JONAH (Joining Our Neighbors, Advancing Hope) to turn the former assisted living center into a 25-unit apartment complex called Solis Circle featuring smaller studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments.\nRents range from $425 to $810 per month with square footage running from 280 to 620 square feet, according to John DeRose, owner/broker for Rental Resources of Eau Claire Inc., which manages the property. Units include efficiency kitchens with larger communal kitchens and on-site laundry facilities.\n\"It's the coolest project I have ever done,\" said Filipczak, co-owner of C&M Home Builders & Real Estate, who noted Solis' tenant roster includes seniors, younger tenants and persons with disabilities.\nAverage rents in the Eau Claire area are more than $1,200 per month, according to real estate firm Zumper Inc. Filipczak said entry level housing prices in northwestern Wisconsin have doubled in recent years going from $150,000 to $300,000.\nThe project was able to come to fruition via a deal that involved the city taking ownership of the land and an old zoning provision that allowed for an assisted living center to be transformed into apartments.\n\"It still cost $100,000 to get it updated,\" said Filipczak, who also builds duplexes and other housing options across price ranges, including in Rice Lake to the south of Moon Lake Park.\nOther adaptive reuse efforts to help address needed affordable and workforce housing are not as easy, said Filizpczak, who started his career as a carpenter.\nZoning rules, building codes and higher labor costs discourage the redevelopment of office buildings, church campuses and other properties into needed housing.\n\"They are just driving the pricing up,\" he said.\nThe Solis project opened in 2019. Mike Golat, Altoona's city administrator, said it was financed via a tax incremental district, a financing structure that allows local governments to invest in, collect taxes and reinvest in a designated area. Golat said the Wisconsin town has another $6 million to invest in affordable housing from that district.\nHe also noted the different approach taken at the Solis Circle redevelopment.\n\"We don't have income requirements. We didn't want to go to a voucher system,\" he said. \"We wanted a mix of people in there to give it a bit more diversity and sense of community.\"\nFilipczak also has plans to add 72 new manufactured homes to an existing 15-home community with the same type of housing stock. He said the new manufactured housing is slated to have prices between $160,000 and $200,000 with plans to allow homeowners to eventually purchase lots or form a homeowners association.\n'I think it's the future'\nThe Wisconsin builder sees manufactured housing as the key to address the shortage of affordable apartments to rent and homes to buy across the country.\n\"I think it's the key to be honest. I think it's the future,\" he said. Golat said Altoona — which has a population of 9,100 people and has seen its population grow by 36% since 2010 — is looking at manufactured homes, tiny homes and zoning changes to lift barriers to new affordable construction. \"We are looking at things like reducing minimum lot sizes, reducing setbacks, reducing infill requirements,\" he said.\nThat is welcomed by local housing advocates working to get more developers, landlords and property owners (including churches) on the affordable bandwagon.\n\"The zoning update is huge,\" said JONAH organizer Paul Savides.\nStill, many affordable housing efforts — including apartments and manufactured homes — face stigmas about their impacts on the surrounding community and property values as well as 'not in my backyard' opposition from existing residents.\n\"We have that in spades here,\" Golat said.\nOther affordable housing advocates see merits in manufactured homes because their pricing and square footage work better for families and multi-person and multi-generational households\nThe average price of a smaller manufactured home came in at $79,600 at the end of last year while larger ones more akin to a single-family home cost $149,600, according to numbers released earlier this month by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.\nThose are up 62% and 53% from Aug. 2019.\nStill, that is lower than the current median single-family home price nationally of $433,558 according to real estate firm RedFin.\nManufactured housing accounts for 11% of new housing starts with the median income of manufactured homebuyers coming in at $35,000, according to the Manufactured Housing Institute, an industry group. That compares to a $107,000 median income for single-family homebuyers, according to the National Association of Realtors.\nDavid Dworkin, president and CEO of the National Housing Conference, said manufactured homes have seen marked improvements in construction quality and offer homeownership potential to households priced out of single-family markets.\nBut Dworkin also said new climate change-inspired energy efficiency rules from the Biden administration will drive up costs on manufactured homes and in turn seniors and lower income households.\n'Insane for our area'\nAnn Malfavon, executive of the Klamath Housing Authority in southern Oregon, said while there is broad support for addressing the need for more affordable housing, \"it still carries a stigma with it and the belief that this type of housing decreases surrounding property values.\"\nManufactured housing also faces stereotypes of rundown trailer parks and how they will stand up to extreme weather such as hurricanes and tornadoes.\nMalfavon said higher costs for labor and materials before and since the pandemic and lack of inventory of apartments and homes for sales have increased prices.\n\"The median listing home price of Klamath Falls is $350,000 to $360,000, which is insane for our area, where the area median income is $75,200. This prices out a lot of individuals and families who would like to own a home,\" said Malfavon, whose group owns and manages 324 units in Klamath and Lake counties near the California border with new efforts slated to add another 99 units across four projects.\nShe said there are statewide efforts to streamline and quicken funding and financing and approvals for affordable projects.\nThe Oregon Department of Housing & Community Services also has a $10 million program to help co-locate child care facilities within new affordable housing developments and has given $20 million to four modular home builders to help spur affordable construction.\nModular homes are built in segments at centralized manufacturing facilities and then transported to property sites.\nDelia Hernandez, a spokesperson for OHCS, said the modular homes can be used as temporary housing after wildfires and other disasters and the builders \"will also prioritize low-income and middle-income housing construction.\"\nThere are concerns about developers and builders gaming the system of federal, state and local affordable housing grants, tax breaks and other incentives by designating small slices of new projects as affordable and workforce units while still charging rents that aren't helping address the larger problem.\n\"I see so much money going out from the federal government, from state and local governments for projects that are deemed affordable. They are nowhere near affordable,\" Filizpczak said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

They have all held the title \"Greatest of All Time.\"In Matthew 11:11, Jesus makes it quite clear that \"among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist.\" Now you must be rather great to be considered a G.O.A.T. by Jesus.\nWhat was it about John that made him the greatest of all time? It was John's God-given calling to prepare the way for Jesus' coming. When the Archangel Gabriel announced to Zechariah that he and his wife Elizabeth would have a son in their old age, he said this about John:\n\"He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord\" (Luke 1:16-17).\nJohn was the forerunner of Christ. He was the one chosen by God to prepare the hearts of people for the coming of their Messiah. Upon his birth, Zechariah praised God as he blessed John saying, \"And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him, to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins\" (Luke 1:76-77).\nJohn did his job well. When Jesus came upon the scene, he pointed to Him and said, \"look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). From that moment on Jesus' ministry increased while John's ministry decreased. He had fulfilled his calling.\nThat's why Jesus is considered the G.O.A.T.\nBut then Jesus makes this observation, \"yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he\" (Matthew 11:11b). In other words, you and I have the potential of being the Greater of All Time in our generation.\nLike John, we are forerunners of Christ, preparing the hearts of people to receive the salvation of God through the forgiveness of their sins. We have the God-given calling to prepare the way for our Lord and Savior to come into the hearts and lives of our friends and family and those within our sphere of influence.\nMay God help us fulfill our calling as His witnesses in this world. May His Spirit work in and through us to prepare the way for others to come to know Jesus as their Savior and Lord.\nMay we be about the business of making disciples who make disciples until the day we hear Jesus say, \"well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness\" (Matthew 25:21). May we be G.O.A.T.s in the eyes of our Lord. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

We conservatives have dropped the ball. We have allowed our Constitutional individual, local, and state rights and freedoms to be usurped by the federal government.\nIt is now evident that even our judicial system has been infected.\nFormer President Trump has been hounded since before he first took office and ever since. The legacy media has been complicit. He is the one greatest threat to the existence of this behemoth of federal government and those who benefit from it. That's why our institutions and bureaucracies have aligned against him.\nIf you think this is how our government should operate, consider what it would be like when conservatives take power again, as they always have, if they turn our judicial system against those who speak out against them. Perhaps you would lose your voice or be hounded by the courts or IRS. They won't, it's not in their nature.\nOur Constitution is a remarkable blueprint for a stable representative government. It allows us to right wrongs and to adapt to changing times. It deserves to be revered and protected.\nIf you are a conservative or a moderate, consider joining the Talbot GOP in restoring our Constitutional government as it was intended to be, a federation of states under a federal government with limited powers. Get involved and help us bring sanity back.\nIf you are a liberal who doesn't like the direction you see the country going, ask a conservative what (s)he really believes. The vast majority of us have the same concerns as you do, but different solutions. Try reading some conservative news sources to get a perspective different from the one-sided news you get from the legacy media. Be open.\nOnly after you've heard both sides of an argument can you apply your own common sense and experience to make a rational judgement. If you still disagree, we can try to build on the ground of our common concerns.\nKENT ROBERTSON\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Early wake up, turn on the coffee pot and let our dog out to do his morning business, then serve his breakfast, which quickly disappears. Then comes our walk, which we both enjoy, followed by posting of the American flag and picking up the morning edition of the Star, to read with breakfast. That is a normal Sunday morning for me and for many other newspaper readers, I hope.As I turned to the editorial articles and letters to the editor in this week's edition, I was struck, and disheartened, by the divisive nature of the thoughts and words that appear there, for all to read. I have no need, or desire, to repeat them. To do so, would only serve to elevate the practice of denigrating the ideals and beliefs of others, who may not share my political leanings. What I would like to do is to encourage those who choose to participate in our election processes to be honest, civil, and well informed.\nListen to the words, ideas and ideals that the candidates themselves speak and stand for. Be suspicious of partisan operatives that attempt to steer you, and others, to their candidates, by assigning derogatory labels on those \"others\" or with deceptive accounts of what opposition candidates have actually done, or stand for.\nAt the end of the day, or more appropriately, the election cycle, we are all God's children, aren't we? We will share the same earth, going forward, regardless of who is elected. We will prosper, or suffer, as a result of our collective decisions on who we elect to serve and lead us, in this grand experiment we call democracy. I say again, be suspicious of the motives of those who attempt to steer you to one candidate or another.\nTheir interests and values may not be what they seem.\nWILLIAM KEPPEN\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cooking for Dad\n\n June 12, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Cooking For Dad \n \n 1502\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Father's Day arrives on June 16 this year, and what a special day that is set aside to honor dads, pops, or whatever you may call that special person in your life.It is also a day to honor that person who was like a father to you or someone who filled those shoes because your own dad was not present for one reason or another.\nHonor your dad in many ways by sharing memories with him or about him with family members and others. A gift of yourself on this day is most appreciated by all dads in this busy world.\nI remember back to my own father and grandfathers. My paternal grandfather was a farmer with four sons and five daughters. I remember him as being a tall person who had very little to say. In his life it seemed to be hard work in trying times of the depression and war years.\nMy maternal grandfather worked on the railroad and retired to operate a small grocery store. He was a quiet man with a kind smile and had two daughters. In his later years, I spent a lot of time talking with him and taking rides through his countryside and he talked of his childhood.\nI lost my dad in 1974 at the age of 65. He had retired due to health issues and was still lightly active. Many of my memories go back to the early 1950s, when I would ride with him as he delivered fuel oil to the local homes around Bishopville and Selbyville for the local oil company in the winter months.\nMy father farmed in the spring, summer and fall. Eventually he started his own trucking company. His family was so proud of him — coming from a poor family with elementary education to a well-respected hard-working businessman. As for me being the young 5-year-old riding partner, I got all the Juicy Fruit gum I wanted.\nMy brothers always said Dad got me lots of gum to chew so I would \"stop talking.\" It didn't work.\nHappy Father's Day to all. Now, let's eat.\nSHRIMP BOIL\n1 lb jumbo shrimp peeled and deveined, 2 tbsps Old Bay seasoning, 2 medium ears of corn (husks removed and cut crosswise into 2-inch slices), 10 baby potatoes (halved), 2-3 sausages (sliced), 1 lemon (quartered), 5 cloves garlic (crushed), ¼ cup melted butter (divided), 3 tsps parsley (freshly chopped, divided), 1 tbsp olive oil.\nIn a medium bowl, combine shrimp and 1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning. Let it sit for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine corn, baby potatoes, sausage, lemon and garlic. Add in the seasoned shrimp. Add 2 tbsps melted butter, 1 tsp parsley, and remaining tbsp of Old Bay seasoning. Toss together and let it sit for 10 minutes. To cook on a grill pan: Brush grill with olive oil and heat on medium-high heat. Add items on the grill, and gently brush the remaining butter on top. Grill for 5 minutes until you see some distinct grill marks. Then, reduce heat to medium, flip the items over, and add 1 cup of water. Cover with aluminum foil, and simmer for 15 minutes. To cook on a barbecue grill: Brush grill with olive oil or spray with cooking spray. Add items on the grill, and grill for a few minutes until you see some distinct grill marks. Remove items from the grill, and place into a large disposable aluminum tin, add in remaining butter, and cover with aluminum foil and seal the edges or divide into four 12-inch sheets of aluminum foil. Divide the remaining butter amongst them. Fold over to create a pocket and seal the edges by rolling them up). Place aluminum pan or foil packets on the grill and cook for 15-20 minutes until cooked through. Serve with remaining chopped parsley.\nSURF AND TURF FOIL PACK\n1/2 lb sirloin steak (cut into 1-inch cubes), 1/2 lb shrimp (cleaned and deveined), 2 ears corn (each cut crosswise into 4 pieces), 1 cup grape tomatoes, 1 small red onion (cut into thick slices), 2 cloves garlic (thinly sliced), 1 tbsp Old Bay seasoning, 1 tbsp fresh thyme, 1 tsp ground cumin, freshly ground black pepper, 1 tbsp freshly chopped parsley (for garnish).\nHeat the grill too high. Cut four sheets of foil about 12 inches long. Divide steak, shrimp, corn, tomatoes, onion, lime and garlic between each foil pack. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with Old Bay, fresh thyme, cumin and black pepper. Fold each foil pack crosswise over to completely cover the food mixture. Roll top and bottom edges to seal. Place foil packs on the grill and cook until shrimp is cooked through and steak is finished to your desired doneness, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Garnish with parsley and serve hot.\nCHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS\n3 cups chicken (about 2-3 chicken breasts), 2 quarts chicken broth, 2 cups all-purpose flour, ½ tsp baking powder, 2 tbsps cold salted butter (cubed), 1 cup milk, 2 tbsps olive oil, salt and pepper to taste.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Place chicken breast on the baking sheet and drizzle a little olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Bake chicken for about 45 minutes. Once the chicken is cooked, shred it with two forks. Pour 2 quarts of chicken stock or broth into a large pot and start warming it up on the stove top while you make the dumplings. In a medium bowl, combine flour and baking powder. Then add in cubed butter. Combine using your fingers, fork or pastry cutter. Pour in the milk. Mix it all together.\nDust your counter with a generous amount of flour. Place dumpling dough on the counter and dust it with more flour. With a rolling pin, roll the dough out to about ¼-inch thickness. Be sure to add flour as necessary to keep it from sticking underneath or to your rolling pin. Using a knife or a pizza cutter, start cutting out your dumplings into squares. Dust dumplings with a bit more flour. The extra flour is all going to help keep them from sticking but will also thicken your chicken broth some as well when you add them to the pot. Bring chicken broth up to a boil. Add in shredded chicken and stir. Begin adding dumplings one at a time so they don't all stick together. Stir frequently while adding them. Allow dumplings to cook for about 15-20 minutes. You should notice your broth starting to thicken (from the extra flour) and your dumplings may start to sink a little to the bottom because they are soaking up the broth. Take one out and taste test it. It shouldn't have a doughy taste anymore.\nFRIED PORK CHOPS AND GRAVY\n5 or 6 center-cut pork chops (about 3 lbs), 1 cup flour, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 3 to 4 tbsps oil for frying (or bacon drippings), 2 1/2 cups water, 1/2 cup milk.\nPut cup of flour in a shallow pan and whisk in black pepper, salt and garlic powder. Dredge the pork chops in the flour until fully covered on both sides. Heat oil in a large skillet. Brown chops on both sides, turn down heat, cover skillet and let cook for about 15 minutes, until chops are thoroughly cooked. Remove chops from pan, place on plate and cover to keep warm. Make sure you have at least 1/4 cup of drippings in the pan (can add more oil, if needed) Add enough flour to make a roux or paste (I use any leftover flour from dredging plus more if needed). Cook and stir until flour is browned. Add water and milk. Bring to a boil and cook to desired thickness for gravy. Makes about 2 1/2 cups gravy. Serve over chops or potatoes. You can return chops to the gravy and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes if you want to serve it this way. I like doing the gravy separately as some people don't like gravy on their pork chops.\nCAST IRON SKILLET STEAK\n1 8-16 oz steak, 1 tbsp bacon grease, 2 tbsps butter, salt and pepper to taste, garlic powder.\nPlace steak on a plate, platter or sheet pan. Sprinkle it with salt. Add black pepper. Add garlic powder. Rub the seasonings into the meat, pressing firmly. Flip the steak over and repeat adding seasonings. Let sit on the counter for 30-45 minutes to come up to room temperature. Place the skillet over medium heat on the stove top. Let the pan get hot. Add the bacon grease, let it melt. Add the steak. Cook 3-4 minutes until lightly browned on the bottom. Use tongs to hold steak on edge to cook the layer of fat. Flip steak over. Add butter and let it melt. Spoon melted butter on top of steak. Cook steak until it reaches the internal temp you desire. You can serve this with a baked potato, baked sweet potato just about any side dish goes with these last two recipes. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Children are excited and parents are rearranging schedules, and the grocery list is growing.Summer day camps and programs are a great help because after the first couple of summer vacation you start hearing \"I'm bored.\"\nWell let me tell you, after growing up on a farm, I never said those words. Just when you thought the chores were done, then came three or four more. Something always needed to be raked, hoed, picked, stacked, washed out, cut or finished.\nMy first job at age 16 at the Mann's Potato Chip Factory was great — most of the afternoon workers were teenagers like myself, and we had fun. I probably did not eat chips for two to three years after that job. The next couple of summers, I worked as a desk clerk in a popular Ocean City motel, the Oceanic. One comment on that job — at least the chips could not complain.\nWhen the schools are closed, the kids soon get bored not seeing their friends, and the grandparents are exhausted, it is time to explore other options.\nVacation Bible school, summer camps, camps held by the school system and Parks and Recreation help to wipe out boredom. Assigning chores at home, and when completed, a swimming trip to the local pool or a water hose fight in the backyard are also options.\nMy mom would take us clamming and crabbing at least once a week if the chores were done. We would eat our lunch outside, slice a big homegrown watermelon and have water hose fights. These activities did not just happen in the country, but our town friends did the same.\nEnjoy these childhood activities, and as an adult, go back in time and revisit your memories of these fun days of summer vacations.\nLet's make some fun food that kids like.\nAIR FRYER PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICHES\nUsing any kind of sliced bread, spread with your favorite jelly and peanut butter and place in the air fryer.

One of the blessings of having a personally relationship with our Lord is that when He comes into our lives He is there to help us with our everyday cares, responsibilities and concerns.The apostle Paul writing to believers at Corinth wrote in 2 Corinthians 1 \"Blessed be God who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble.\"\nIt seems like all of us deal with troubles and at times more troubles than others. It is vital that we be not discouraged by the things that we face.\nToday I would like to offer some practical reminders to overcome strife in your life, your family, your workplace or your service unto God.\nFirst make sure you are trusting in the Lord. 2 Cor 1:3 \"Bless be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Mercies.\"\nLet Him be your help. Please make sure you know the Lord personally. He is the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort.\nI gave my life to the Lord over 50 years ago and have not regretted it a single day. God is so good.\nSecondly remember the comfort and blessings of the past. V. 4 \"Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble.\"\nSince He has helped us in the past, he can do the same in the present. It is always good to count our past blessings.\nThirdly, since so many of us have been helped by the Lord let us let God work through us to bless others. Be the hands and feet of our Lord.\nFinally, it is always wise recall the promises of God.\nPaul wrote in Philippians 4:13, \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthenes me.\"\nDon Reynolds is the pastor of Calvary Baptist Church in Denton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Complaints filed against Easton bishop for inappropriate public statements, misrepresentations\n\n June 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 342\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Two complaints have been filed against the Episcopal Diocese of Easton Bishop Santosh K. Marray under The Episcopal Church's Title IV canons.According to The Episcopal Church's website, both complaints allege Marray made inappropriate public statements and misrepresentations. The Episcopal Church's Title IV canons sets standards of conduct for ordained people in the church as well as provides a process for addressing misconduct allegations.\nIn a June 18 statement, the Standing Committee of the Diocese of Easton said that it, along with the Diocesan Council, the complainants and Marray, have been kept aware of the proceedings.\nAccording to the church's website, the first complaint, made by multiple complainants, was provided to an intake officer in July 2023. In January, an intake report was forwarded to a reference panel. In February, the vice president of House of Bishops, the Rev. Mary Gray-Reeves, took on the role of presiding bishop, and on May 2, a reference panel referred the matter for conciliation, which entails a third party facilitates a conversation between the complainants and respondent.\nThe second complaint, made by a single complainant, was forwarded to an intake officer in February, according to the church's website. In March, an intake report was forwarded to a reference panel. On May 2, a reference panel referred three of the five claims made for conciliation, and it said the remaining two claims did not require action other than \"appropriate pastoral response.\"\nThe Standing Committee of the Diocese of Easton said in its statement that this information was posted on the church's website on May 30. It said Gray-Reeves has advised Marray of the reference panel's referrals, and Marray has been cooperating with the Title IV process, which includes refraining from discussing the situation.\n\"We ask for the church's continued prayers for all involved in these two complaints as we move forward seeking reconciliation, healing and a renewed commitment to ensuring our churches are safe and welcoming places where all are treated with dignity and respect,\" the statement said.\nThe Episcopal Diocese of Easton did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The focus on Title IV canons and internal church processes makes 'None of these' the most accurate classification."

    "content": "PAstoral Ponderings: Turn to Proverbs in times of uncertainty\n\n June 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: THE REV. DANIEL T. GEDMAN St. Luke’s G.M.C. Denton | Section: Columns \n \n 266\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Some time ago, I had written about the book of Psalms and how it is an extraordinary series of blessings given by God that exhibits a remarkable timelessness spanning millenniums. Its constituent prayers and songs have provided inspiration, peace, tranquility and wonder for as long as they have existed.Today, I'd like to reflect upon the book of Proverbs. This book is oft believed to be the most practical book in the Bible that contains collections, axioms and discourses about how to live wisely.\nUltimately, the book provides a means for defining both wise and foolish behaviors and provides evidence for us to consider both the positive and negative consequences of such wise and foolish behaviors. There is no area in life that the Proverbs does not address. It is a complete text of God's wisdom given to us to learn and grow.\nIn the times in which we find ourselves overwhelmed by life's experiences and are uncertain of what to do next, turn to Proverbs. Chapter 1:2-3 states that this text is, \"for gaining wisdom and instruction; for understanding words of insight; for receiving instruction in prudent behavior, doing what is right and just and fair.\"\nWhile Psalms open our minds, hearts and mouths with just the words we need to find both joy and relief, Proverbs provides us with wonder of God's wisdom that helps us to order our lives as God desires for us.\nAnd so, in times when you may be uncertain what to do, seek God's wisdom in Proverbs. You will find an amazing and joyful wealth of wisdom that only God himself can provide. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Recipes that won't break the bank\n\n June 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1142\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n My mom would stand in front of the kitchen cabinets with the doors open and study the ingredients inside. She would begin to pull down boxes and cans, then out came the pots, pans and utensils to begin the meal.My mom was frugal — not wasting any ingredients but still whipping up a filling and tasty meal.\nWith today's outrageous prices for food products, we need to revert back to the '50s and '60s recipes with a slight remake to your family's likes and tastes.\nWalking down the grocery aisle, I look and compare prices from the previous week, and I shudder. Some items I place back on the shelf and move on.\nI think about families with children who must rearrange eating habits to fit the budget. My mind goes back to Bishopville where mom fed 11 children, two adults and sometimes two elderly stepparents. Then I remember back to my kitchen in the late '60s as a widowed mother of three.\nMeal planning was done before walking in the store with a mental cash register adding as you shopped.\nI am going to continue on with some recipes from years gone by, but ones that \"still feed the family and fill the tummy.\"\nCHEESEBURGER PIE\n1 lb. ground beef, 1 cup diced onion, ½ tsp salt, 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, ¼ cup ketchup, 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, ¾ cup Bisquick baking mix, 1 cup milk, 2 eggs.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees. Grease a 9-inch pie plate (or a deep 8-inch square baking dish); set aside. In a large skillet, brown ground beef and onion over medium heat until beef is no longer pink (about 8-10 minutes). Drain off fat. Stir in salt, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup and cheese. Transfer beef mixture to the prepared pie dish. In a separate bowl, whisk together Bisquick, milk and eggs, just until combined (it's fine if you still have some lumps in the batter — do not overmix).Pour batter on top of beef. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.\nFRIED GREEN TOMATOES\n3 medium-sized firm green tomatoes, salt, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tbsp cajun seasoning (optional), 1/2 cup milk or buttermilk, 1 large egg, 1/3 cup fine white cornmeal, 1/2 cup fine dry breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup oil for frying.\nCut unpeeled tomatoes into 1/2 inch slices. Sprinkle slices with salt. Let tomato slices stand for 5 minutes. While the salted green tomato slices are resting, place in three separate, shallow bowls: 1) the flour and cajun seasoning (if using), 2) buttermilk and egg, and 3) breadcrumbs and cornmeal. Whisk together the egg and buttermilk. Heat the oil in a skillet on medium heat. Dip the green tomato slices in the flour-seasoning, then the buttermilk-egg mixture, then the cornmeal-breadcrumb mix. In the skillet, fry half of the coated tomato slices at a time, for 3 to 5 minutes on each side or until brown. Set the cooked tomatoes on paper towels to drain. These fried green tomatoes are fantastic with a little hot sauce if you don't use the cajun seasoning.\nTUNA NOODLE CASSEROLE\n1 lb egg noodles, 4 (5-oz) cans tuna (drained well), 1 (10-oz) bag frozen peas, 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup milk, ½ cup panko breadcrumbs, 2 tbsps butter (melted), 1 tsp dried parsley, salt and pepper.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a 9-by-13 baking dish. Cook noodles according to package directions. Drain well. Combine noodles, tuna, soup, milk, peas, salt and pepper. Mix well. Transfer to a baking dish. In a small dish combine melted butter and breadcrumbs. Sprinkle over top. Sprinkle with parsley. Bake for 25-30 minutes until lightly browned and heated through.\nSWEDISH MEATBALLS\n1 (10.75 oz) can cream of mushroom soup (low sodium), 1 (14 oz) can beef broth (low sodium), 1 packet dry onion soup mix, 2 tbsps A1 steak sauce, 2 pound bag frozen meatballs, 1 cup container sour cream, 1 (16 oz) package egg noodles.\nIn a 5 or 6 quart slow cooker, mix cream of mushroom soup with beef broth, onion soup mix and steak sauce. Whisk together well. Then add in frozen meatballs. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high 3 to 5 hours. Just before the meatballs are done, put a pot of water on the oven to boil for your egg noodles (make according to package directions.) Drain noodles well when done. After the meatballs have finished cooking, stir in sour cream. Mix noodles and meatballs together or serve meatballs on top of noodles.\nGOULASH\n1 lb. elbow macaroni (cooked and drained), 1 lb. ground beef, 1 small onion (chopped), 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 (26 oz.) jar spaghetti sauce, 1 tbsp dried parsley (extra for garnish), salt and pepper to taste, grated parmesan cheese.\nIn a large skillet, brown ground beef and onion until no longer pink. Drain if necessary. Reduce heat, season with garlic powder, salt and pepper. When macaroni is cooked, add to the meat mixture. Add spaghetti sauce. Stir to combine. Sprinkle with parsley and stir. Cook on low for 10-15 minutes to allow flavors to combine and thicken slightly. Serve with extra parsley and parmesan cheese.\nWACKY CAKE\n1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup white sugar, 4 tbsps unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking soda, ½ tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tbsp cider vinegar, 6 tbsps vegetable oil, 1 cup water.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Sift flour, sugar, salt, soda and cocoa together into an 8-by-8-inch ungreased cake pan. Make three depressions. Pour oil into one well, vinegar into second, and vanilla into third well. Pour water overall, and stir well with a fork. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Frost with your favorite icing.\nORIGINAL PARTY MIX\n1/2 cup butter or margarine, 2 tbsps Worcestershire sauce, 1 1/4 tsp seasoned salt, 1/4 tsp garlic salt, 3 cups Wheat Chex square cereal, 2 cups Rice Chex square cereal, 1 1/2 cups nuts (such as peanuts, pecans, or cashews), 1 1/2 cups small pretzel rods.\nGather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees. Melt the margarine or butter in a shallow pan over low heat. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce, seasoned salt and garlic salt. Combine the Wheat Chex, Rice Chex, nuts and pretzel rods in a large bowl and drizzle with half of the butter mixture. Carefully mix with a wooden spoon to avoid breaking the pretzels and cereal squares. Repeat with the remaining butter mixture, evenly coating all the pieces. Place the mix in a shallow baking pan with sides. Bake for 25 to 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes to evenly toast the mixture. Cool for at least 15 minutes and enjoy.\nSHIRLEY TEMPLE\nPour 1 ounce grenadine over ice in a glass. Top with 4 ounces Sprite or 7UP soda and 4 ounces ginger ale. Stir gently to combine. Garnish with a maraschino cherry and enjoy. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Opinions are not persecution\n\n June 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 394\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On June 16, in an op-ed in The Star Democrat, Mr. Rudy Reyes accused the Republican Party of causing \"fear of persecution\" in the LGBTQ community, particularly in connection with a meeting of the Easton Town Council on June 3. While registered Republicans and members of the Talbot County Republican Central Committee may have attended that meeting, they attended as concerned citizens on their own behalf, not as representatives of the GOP.As for the council members themselves, Mr. Frank Gunsallus is not a Republican. Mr. David Montgomery is, but like the other Town Council members, he spoke on his own behalf, not on behalf of the Republican party. While individual members, myself included, may agree with Mr. Montgomery, he was not in that instance representing the GOP.\nTo be clear, the Republican Party, the party of Lincoln, does not endorse \"persecution\" of anyone. At any rate, after reviewing the video of the meeting, I fail to see how the words of either Mr. Gunsallus or Mr. Montgomery rose to the level of \"persecution.\" If someone does not choose to celebrate or promote the LGBTQ agenda, it does not signify persecution. It may mean, however, that many people have come to view the Pride movement as a political movement which heavily identifies with the far left of the Democrat party.\nThat is where the words \"socialism\" and \"ideology\" come in. And we Republicans are as free to disagree with you Democrats about your ideologies as you are free to disagree with us. For instance, a Democrat might disagree with me about the human rights of an unborn child, but that does not mean I am being persecuted.\nAs for traditional holidays being about \"feelings\" let us be clear that Christmas is about the birthday of Jesus Christ, not feelings. St. Patrick's Day is about a man who preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ under brutal circumstances. On July 4, 1776, our founders were putting their lives in danger for their country. Most of our holidays are about sacrifice for the sake of God or country. Not feelings.\nWhat I am wondering about is how drag queens came to epitomize the LGBTQ movement. I noticed on the Delmarva Pride Festival schedule that five drag queens are named as hosts. To many people drag is seen as mockery of women and degrading to femininity. Maybe women should feel persecuted.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Strawberry recipes for the Fourth of July\n\n July 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1575\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Each year as we grew older, we would have birthday celebrations on the Fourth of July — complete with freezers of homemade ice cream.Of course, some of my brothers would \"find\" some firecrackers to add to the gatherings.\nWhat a wonderful combination — Independence Day and the ending of the Strawberry season. The summer is just getting underway with schools closed, swimming pools open and just a few more trips to the all-u-can pick strawberry patches.\nAs a child, when we completed picking, loaded up in the back of the pickup farm truck and headed home, we were one sorry looking bunch, clothes wet from the heat, dirty faces and starving.\nAs soon as we hit the yard, we jumped out of the truck, ran to the water hose and soaked ourselves, along with the pigs, cow and any chickens that didn't run.\nEach year, this holiday is dear to my heart, as it was my late mother's birthday. Laura Hudson Hitchens was born in the early morning hours of July 4, 1911 in a farmhouse in the St. Martin's Neck area of Bishopville.\nWe the family would gather on the farm at West Line Road to spend a day celebrating, making homemade ice cream, full course meals, desserts of various cakes and cold slices of watermelon. In later years, it became Family Reunion Day\nFly those American flags to honor the independence of our country and honor those who fought, have fought and are still fighting for our rights.\nSTRAWBERRY SPINACH SALAD\n1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice,3 tbsps honey, 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, 1 tbsp poppy seeds, 2 tsps Dijon mustard, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp ground black pepper, 2 5-oz containers baby spinach, 1 lb strawberries (halved or sliced), 2 oranges (peeled and sliced), 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans (toasted), 4 oz goat cheese (crumbled).\nFor the dressing: In a small jar, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, honey, vinegar, poppy seeds, mustard, salt and pepper. Seal the jar; shake vigorously to combine. Set aside.\nFor the salad: Just before serving, add the spinach to a large bowl or platter; top with half of the strawberries and orange slices. Drizzle with half of the dressing; gently toss to coat. Top the salad with the remaining berries, orange slices, pecans, and goat cheese. Drizzle with your desired amount of the remaining dressing, and serve the remainder on the side, if you like.\nSTRAWBERRY MUFFINS\nNonstick cooking spray, 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup granulated sugar, 2 tsps baking powder, 1/2 tsps baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 3/4 cup melted unsalted butter (cooled), 2 large eggs (room temperature), 1/2 cup plain yogurt (room temperature), 2 tsps vanilla extract, 2 cups chopped strawberries (divided), 1 tbsp sugar.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees. Line muffin pan with paper cups, and spray cups with nonstick cooking spray. Stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Set aside. Whisk together the melted butter, eggs, yogurt and vanilla in a medium bowl. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients; stir together just until combined. Fold in 1 1/2 cups of the strawberries. Batter will be thick. Using a 2 1/4-inch scoop, drop a level scoop of batter into each lined muffin cup. Top scooped batter evenly with the remaining 1/2 cup berries; sprinkle with turbinado sugar if desired.nBake until the tops are golden brown and the wooden pick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 22 minutes.\nEASY STRAWBERRY PIE\n1 refrigerated pie crust, 1 1/2 qts fresh strawberries (halved), 3/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 3 tbsps corn starch, whipped cream for serving.\nFor the crust: Bake one refrigerated pie crust according to package directions. Let it cool completely. For the strawberry filling: Mash 1 ½ cups the berries with a fork and combine with the sugar, vanilla and ¼ cup water in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a low boil, stirring and mashing frequently, and cook until the fruit begins to soften and break down more, about 5 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and ½ cup water. Stir the cornstarch mixture into the simmering strawberry mixture and return the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove from the heat and fold in the remaining fresh strawberries. Immediately transfer the strawberry mixture to the pie crust. Let cool slightly, about 15 minutes, then place in the refrigerator to cool completely, about 4 hours.\nSTRAWBERRY BUTTER\n1/2 cup sliced strawberries, 1 stick softened salted butter.\nCombine strawberries and butter in a food processor. Pulse on and off until the butter is combined. Spread on toasted pound cake or bread.\nGRILLED CHICKEN & STRAWBERRY WRAP\n2 chicken breasts, 1/2 cup balsamic vinaigrette, 1 package (12 oz) mixed salad greens, 12 medium strawberries (hulled and quartered), 4 green onions (sliced), 1/4 cup chopped pecans, 4 oz goat cheese (crumbled), 6 large whole wheat tortillas.\nPlace the chicken breasts in a large plastic storage bag. Seal the bag, leaving a small opening, then use a rolling pin to pound the breasts until they're a uniform thickness. Pour in half the balsamic vinaigrette, then seal the bag and marinate in the fridge for 1 hour. After the chicken has marinated, grill it until it's done in the middle, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly. Dice up the chicken when it's cool enough to handle. Add the salad greens to a large bowl. Add half of the remaining dressing and toss it to coat the greens. Add more if it needs it. Add the strawberries, chicken, green onions and pecans. Toss it gently a few times until it's all combined. Top with crumbled goat cheese and toss a couple of times. Place an equal amount of salad down the middle of each tortilla. Roll up, then slice in half. Serve wraps with chips and extra strawberries.\nSTRAWBERRY BREAKFAST TACOS\n2 tbsps butter, 6 flour tortillas, 1/3 cup cream cheese (softened), 1 tbsp honey, 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/3 cup vanilla yogurt, 1 3/4 cups quartered fresh strawberries.\nIn a large skillet, heat 1 tsp butter over medium-low heat. Add 1 tortilla; cook each side until light golden, 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack. Repeat with remaining butter and tortillas. Beat together cream cheese, honey and cinnamon; slowly mix in yogurt until blended. Spread tortillas with cream cheese mixture, top with strawberries.\nSTRAWBERRY-BANANA BREAD\n¾ cup all-purpose flour, ¾ cup whole-wheat flour, ½ tsp baking powder, ¼ tsp baking soda, ¼ tsp kosher salt, 4 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese (softened), ¼ cup unsalted butter (softened), 3 tbsps canola oil or grapeseed oil, ¾ cup granulated sugar, 1 large egg, ½ tsp vanilla extract, 1 cup mashed ripe banana (about 2 bananas), ¾ cup chopped fresh strawberries.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly coat an 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Whisk all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat cream cheese, butter and oil on medium speed in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sugar; beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in egg and vanilla. With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the flour mixture alternately with banana, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Fold in strawberries. Spoon into the prepared pan. Bake until a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes. (Shield with foil after 45 minutes, if needed, to prevent excessive browning.) Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Remove from the pan and cool completely, about 1 1/2 hours.\nSTRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE COOKIES\nCooking spray, 3/4 cup chopped strawberries, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1/2 cup plus 1 tbsp granulated sugar, 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp kosher salt, 1/2 cup butter softened, 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar, 1 large egg, 1 tsp pure vanilla extract. For the filling: 4 tbsps cream cheese (softened), 3 tbsps powdered sugar, zest of 1 lemon.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper and grease with cooking spray. Make cookie dough: In a small bowl, stir strawberries, lemon juice and 1 tbsp granulated sugar until combined. Let sit for 10 minutes, then drain. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat butter, remaining ½ cup sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla extract, then stir in flour mixture until just combined. Using a wooden spoon, very gently fold in strawberries. Set aside. Filling: Line a large plate or baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, powdered sugar, and lemon zest until smooth. Scoop into 12 small balls (about 1 ½ teaspoons each) and place on a prepared baking sheet. Using a medium cookie scoop, scoop heaping tablespoons of dough (about 24 balls) and flatten into pancake-like circles on the baking sheet. Place cream cheese filling on top of 12 pieces of dough. Place remaining dough on top of filling and pinch edges together. Roll gently into balls. Arrange stuffed cookie dough balls 2 inches apart on baking sheets and bake until cookies are set and just golden around edges, about 18 minutes. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The cadet program focuses on building well rounded Americans and aerospace leaders through a curriculum targeting leadership, aerospace, fitness and character.\nJack, a rising sophomore at La Plata High School, is a cadet technical sergeant in Civil Air Patrol and Lauren, a rising senior at La Plata High School, is a cadet master sergeant.\nThe siblings started Civil Air Patrol in the St. Mary's Composite Squadron in May of 2023. However, their family often spends their summers in Florida at their grandmother's house, so they transfer their Civil Air Patrol membership to the Clearwater Composite Squadron in Clearwater, Fla., for the summer seasons.\nWhen their Florida Civil Air Patrol squadron was invited to Normandy to participate in this year's official commemoration events for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the siblings knew they wanted to go.\nThis was the only Civil Air Patrol squadron from the United States that participated in the events, according to 1st Lt. Jason Hewitt, the deputy commander for cadets at the Clearwater Composite Squadron.\n\"[The trip] was outstanding,\" Jack said.\nNot only did the siblings get to participate in the official D-Day memorial parade and ceremony on June 8, they also were part of memorial ceremonies on June 6 at Brittany American Cemetery and Memorial where more than 44,000 Americans are buried. They said their flight stood at attention for the entirety of the ceremony, which was almost an hour and a half long.\nHonoring and remembering all of the people who lost their lives in the Battle of Normandy and World War II in general is what these celebrations were for, and the siblings said standing as a representation for these lost lives makes a difference.\n\"It was representation,\" their mother, Carolyn Compton said. \"It's honor.\"\nThe D-Day invasion on June 6, 1944, left more than 4,000 Allied troops dead and between 4,000 and 9,000 German troops dead. The brother and sister visited the La Cambe German Military Cemetery in Normandy, where more than 21,000 German soldiers are buried.\nDuring the official parade, Jack and Lauren said they walked near the front of the parade, between a baton company and a marching band. The siblings and some of the other cadets handed out candy to children.\n\"[The children] were so surprised,\" Lauren said. \"It was really sweet to see.\"\nDuring the week of commemorations in Normandy, Lauren said there were many people dressed in World War II costumes representing generals and pilots. She said there were even women dressed as teleoperators and code breakers.\n\"It was a really cool experience,\" Lauren said.\nLauren, while in Normandy, met the author of the book, \"How Easy Company Became a Band of Brothers.\"\nChris Langlois, the author, told Lauren that while writing the book he met all of the members of Easy Company, a tactical unit that played a significant role in the Allies' victory on D-Day. This company included Lauren and Jack Compton's relative, Lynn \"Buck\" Compton, who flew in the Army's 101st Airborne Division.\nLynn Compton was also known for being a part of the team that successfully prosecuted Sirhan B. Sirhan for the murder of U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.\nLanglois told Lauren that her relative had a daughter that Lauren and Jack did not know about, and once the siblings returned home, Langlois could put them in contact.\n\"So cool, a new family member,\" Lauren said.\nThe siblings said they learned a lot of information about D-Day, but also quite a bit of history about France.\n\"[The trip] was really well done because I learned as much about France as I learned about World War II,\" Lauren said.\nThis nine-day trip cost more than $8,000, so the Compton family knew they needed to raise money, and that's what they did. The family raised all of the necessary funds using donations from family, friends and small businesses, with their largest donation coming from the Harry White Wilmer American Legion Post 82.\nJack, through his nonprofit Musical Traditions, started playing the clarinet at patriotic events for the American Legion more than two years ago. Lauren, a harpist, accompanied her brother during a Memorial Day performance for the Legion, deepening the family's rapport and connection with the organization, their mother said.\nThe Harry White Wilmer American Legion Post 82 donated more than $4,000 to the Comptons' trip.\n\"[The American Legion] said get us the information, we'll support that,\" Carolyn Compton said. \"It was the American Legion coming out straight at the beginning and saying 'we got you' that made all the difference.\"\nThe American Legion's ladies auxiliary, Foster's Grille, Michele Posey with ReMax and Greg Conklin with State Farm Insurance also all supported and donated to the family's fundraising.\n\"[Jack and Lauren] learned a lot,\" their mother said. \"What a trip.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Let's call timeout on the blame game in politics\n\n July 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 574\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In today's world, far too many candidates for public office claim all the credit when things have gone or are going well. They also place all the blame on others when things have not gone or are not going well.True leaders do the opposite.\nThey generously share credit when things have gone or are going well, and they readily accept full responsibility when things have not or are not going well.\nA classic example of true leadership in thought, word and deeds was Dwight Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe during World War II.\nEisenhower assembled a team to plan for and oversee the execution of D -Day.\nTheir planning faced countless unknowns, not the least of which was the presence of clear weather, an essential element for mission success.\nDespite a series of conflicting weather forecasts leading up to D-Day, Eisenhower alone made the fateful decision to postpone the invasion launch by 24 hours. It was a most difficult decision but ultimately it was a most correct decision.\nOnce Eisenhower made that decision, he issued an \"order of the day\" to all the troops.\nIt read in part: \"Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Force!\n\"You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on Fronts, you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.\n\"Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well-equipped, and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.\n\"I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full Victory!\"\nDespite his encouraging and inspiring words, Eisenhower privately had no illusions about success.\nMore importantly, he had the courage to accept full responsibility for failure.\nAfter releasing his order of the day, Eisenhower privately wrote a note now known as his \"in case of failure speech.\"\nHe wrote: \"Our landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold, and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based upon the best information available. The troops, the air and the Navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.\"\nTwo last minute revisions to his handwritten notes speaks volumes about his leadership. He crossed out \"This particular operation\" and replaced it with \"My decision to attack,\" which is emphatic and personal. He also drew a long bold line under \"mine alone.\"\nIke didn't try to camouflage failure with phrases like, \"mistakes in planning were made,\" or \"planning assumptions were not met\" or \"I have nothing further to say at this time.\" He wrote simply \"any blame or fault ... is mine alone.\"\nOf course, we now know D-Day ultimately succeeded, and Ike never delivered his \"in case of failure speech.\"\nThe important thing is, he was willing to deliver it if necessary.\nHis acceptance of full responsibility is the kind of leadership Americans deserve today from our elected officials, appointed officials and candidates at all levels.\nIt is time to call a time out on the blame game in politics.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There were speeches about independence and freedom. But do Americans truly understand the freedoms they have? I fear many take them for granted.\nOn the other side of the world, an American is locked in a high-security prison, accused without any evidence of spying for the U.S. government. Since his arrest more than a year ago in March 2023, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been denied rights that Americans take for granted.\nHis trial will take place in secret, no evidence has been shown.\n\"To even call it a trial, however, is unfair to Evan and a continuation of this travesty of justice that already has gone on for far too long,\" wrote Wall Street Journal Editor in Chief Emma Tucker. \"Let us be very clear, once again: Evan is a staff reporter of The Wall Street Journal. He was on assignment in Russia, where he was an accredited journalist.\"\nTucker said of the secret trial, \"we already know the conclusion: This bogus accusation of espionage will inevitably lead to a bogus conviction for an innocent man who would then face up to 20 years in prison for simply doing his job. And an excellent job he was doing, at that.\"\nThe right to a speedy and public trial. The right to counsel. Freedom of the press.\nThese are rights guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution. They are not rights in authoritarian Russia.\nEvan Gershkovich is not a spy. He is a journalist for the Wall Street Journal. He was on a reporting assignment when he was detained and accused of espionage. Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal and the U.S. government deny allegations he is or ever has been a spy.\nAfter Gershkovich appeared in a Russian court last month, the Journal reported John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, condemning the proceedings against Evan as a \"sham trial.\" He said Gershkovich \"is simply being used as a bargaining chip,\" along with another American held by Moscow, Paul Whelan.\nRussian investigators haven't publicly presented evidence to back their allegations against Gershkovich. And Russia's legal system offers few, if any, of the legal protections accorded in the U.S. and other Western countries. Acquittals in espionage cases are exceedingly rare.\nWhat is happening to Gershkovich shows how precious American rights and freedoms are. They should never be taken for granted.\nAs the glow of the Independence Day celebrations fade for another year, Americans should keep the rights and freedoms celebrated on July Fourth burning bright every day.\nJim Johnson is executive editor of the Star Democrat.

She is good. We are bringing in Anita from Gary, Indiana then she will travel to Dallas and work with Sharon. She needs more than her three instructors. And she needs to practice three to six hours a day.\"My parents, standing in their living room, just stared at the one instructor telling them what to do. She then pointed to a wall with wallpaper on it.\n\"This wall would be perfect for a wall mirror.\"\nMy mother instantly replied, \"That is not going to happen. I use this room for my bridge club.\"\nThus, my father trotted off to an Ethan Allen store, and for my 15th birthday in 1972, he gave me a large mirror that sat on a big wooden stand.\nI sweated my rear off in front of that mirror for years and, yes, practiced more than three hours each day.\nMy father moved that mirror nine times, including to my college housing in Cumberland, Maryland. Cursing the mirror as he climbed three flights of steps of a row house on an extremely sweltering day, a woman peeped out of her own rowhouse window, recognizing my father. \"Is that Willie Passmore the\njockey?\" she inquired.\nI replied, \"Yes, he is my father, and I am renting the top floor bedroom.\"\nShe said, \"My golly, I remember him riding racehorses in the 1950s at the Cumberland racetrack.\"\nI walked up the stairs, saw that my father was still gently cursing the mirror and said, \"Dad, there is a woman outside who recognizes you.\"\n\"A woman?\" he asked.\nWith that, my flirtatious father erased the bad memories of moving me and the heavy mirror into my new abode.\nI thought it would be an easy exchange to bring the piece back into the family realm even though it was in my former marital home, now my ex-husband's home, for my daughter's use until she purchased her own home.\nMy ex-husband resisted.\nOn Monday, July 1, a Maryland judge reminded him that anything brought into the marriage, prior to the marriage, is not a marital asset, especially a family gift or heirloom. Thus, the mirror was returned to me.\nIt is nice to have the memories and the mirror back in my home.

Her last one was in the spring of 1997.It was a part of her life, and she excelled at all phases of the country garden, from planting, to hoeing, to picking and processing the vegetables.\nMom was busy planting her large garden before school let out, and I can swear that by the time the school bus door shut for the summer, it was time to start hoeing and picking.\nEach year, the baskets used to put the picked vegetables in to bring up to the water hose area to rinse down had to be brought out and cleaned. We had a small trailer hooked to the tractor to carry the supplies down and fresh veggies back.\nThat was always a comical act, as we pushed and shoved each other out of the way to get to drive first.\nThose baskets were used for many years and came from the basket-making factory in the next small town. We had two sizes — one was the small basket perfect for tomatoes, peppers, squash and other small vegetables. Then we had the bushel basket that was great for large stuff, like sweet potatoes, beets, potatoes and more.\nNow, the stand. I know you want to know just what a \"stand\" is.\nOur family never had a produce stand, as we used most of our garden vegetables. When we would have an excessive amount of vegetables, they were shared with other family members and the older folks who could no longer garden due to health.\nNothing went to waste on the farm — it was shared and given away.\nThe stands back in the day were on back country roads in front of farmhouses or in our small town in front of the post office or the gas station.\nThe kids would get excited when a car pulled up. You can bet the veggies were pulled fresh each morning.\nToday the roadside stands are like small stores, selling everything from sweet smelling soaps to fancy lunch linens and \"homemade\" jams, jellies and relishes. I still love the old family stands with grandma's veggies and the youngsters getting excited to get a customer.\nLets prepare some of these great farm-fresh foods with garden produce.\nBISHOPVILLE FRIED GREEN TOMATOES\n4 large green or slightly under-ripe tomatoes, 1/4 cup fine dry unseasoned bread crumbs, 1/2 cup flour, 1 tsp seasoning salt, 1/2 tsp ground black pepper, 1/4 tsp thyme leaves, 1/8 tsp ground red pepper, 1 egg beaten with 1 tbsp water, butter.\nWash tomatoes and remove stems. Cut each tomato in three thick slices. Combine bread crumbs with the next five ingredients. Mix well. Dip tomato slices in egg mixture, then roll in crumb mixture. Sauté in melted butter over medium heat, turning once to lightly brown both sides. Serve hot. Makes 12 slices.\nTOMATO PIE\nPastry dough for single crust 9-inch pie (a package of pre-made dough works well), 6 ripe tomatoes (peeled and cut in 1/2 inch thick slices), 1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar, salt and pepper to taste, pinch ground mace, 1 cup dried bread crumbs, 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice, 1/4 cup butter, 1 egg beaten with 1 tbsp water.\nPrepare pastry dough, wrap and chill (or leave pre-made packages in the refrigerator). Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan. Make a layer of tomato slices in pan and sprinkle with some of the sugar, salt, pepper, mace and bread crumbs. Continue making layers as described, ending with bread crumbs. Sprinkle on lemon juice and dot with butter. Roll out pastry dough (or remove 1 piece from the package), transfer to pan and flute edges. Brush the top with egg-water mixture. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until nicely browned. Serves 6 to 8.\nHONEY BAKED SQUASH\n2 medium squash (about 1 pound each), 1/4 cup honey, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1/4 tsp allspice.\nCut each squash in half lengthwise; discard seeds and membrane. Combine honey, lemon juice, and allspice. Spoon into squash shells. Place squash in an 11-by-7-inch baking dish. Cover dish and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 10 minutes, basting occasionally with the honey mixture. Uncover the dish and bake for an additional 5 minutes or until squash is tender.\nSTUFFED PEPPERS\n1lb ground beef, 6 medium bell peppers (can use any color of peppers), 2 tsps garlic powder, 1 can French-fried onions, 1 can tomato soup with an added 1 1/2 tablespoons italian seasoning, 1 1/2 cups cooked rice, 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese.\nHeat oven to 375 degrees. Grease a 2-quart baking dish. Slice tops off of peppers and remove seeds and membranes. Blanch peppers in boiling water if desired. Set peppers in a prepared dish. Cook beef and garlic powder until beef is browned. Drain. In a medium bowl, stir together half of the French onions. Add rest of ingredients, mix well. Evenly spoon mixture into peppers. Cover with foil. Bake for 20 minutes or until the peppers are tender and the filling is hot. Remove cover; top with remaining onions and bake for 10 minutes more.\nZUCCHINI AND YELLOW SQUASH CASSEROLE\n1 tbsp coconut oil or olive oil, 1 large onion (sliced), 3 tomatoes (sliced), 2 yellow squash (sliced), 2 zucchini (sliced), ¼ cup panko bread crumbs, ¼ cup parmesan cheese, 1 tsp of Ms Dash seasoning or thyme, 2 cloves garlic, salt and pepper to taste.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees. Grease the bottom of a 13-by-9-inch glass baking dish with the coconut or olive oil. Place the sliced onion on the bottom of the dish. Layer the zucchini, yellow squash and tomato in 3 rows. In a separate bowl, combine in other ingredients. Sprinkle the panko mixture over top of the veggies. Bake for 30 minutes.\nSUMMER SWEET CORN SKILLET\n4 tbsps butter, 4 ears sweet corn (kernels sliced from cobs), 3 green onions (chopped), 2 cloves garlic (pressed or minced), salt and pepper, 8 medium-sized basil leaves (chopped).\nAdd butter to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once melted, add sweet corn kernels, green onions and garlic, then season with lots of salt and pepper and saute until kernels are crisp-tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Add chopped basil then stir to combine and serve.\nThis last one has been a staple lunch for as long as I can remember.\nTOMATO MAYO PEPPER ON WHITE BREAD\n1 good ripe tomato that is getting soft but not spoiling, your favorite mayo (I prefer Helmans) and Schmidt white sandwich bread (or your favorite bread).\nSlice the tomato in thick slices, then set aside. Take your bread and slather the mayo on two pieces. I like to sprinkle the pepper right onto the mayo so it sticks. Then add your slices and go to town. A great summer snack to get you through until supper time. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It focuses on what our goals and plans are and how we are going to accomplish them. It is more about the living, and not just responding to life's challenges.\nIn 1 Peter 4:7-11, the Apostle Peter wrote about living in light of eternity. He emphasizes \"living life\" and not just responding to life.\nIn these verses, Peter reminds Christians that we should be living in light of eternity. Motives for how to live, goals for what to do in life, should be weighed in view of eternity. Peter tells us four key things in these verses to do in order to live in light of eternity.\nFirst, he says to have a focused prayer life. In order to do that, verse 7 says to be \"serious\" and \"watchful.\" The Christian's mind must be focused on what is right as well as exercising self-control in how they live. These two things are essential to a focused prayer life.\nSecondly, he says to love others deeply in verse 8. God loves us deeply. That is why he sent Jesus to die on the cross for our sins. Allowing God's love to flow through our lives to others is essential for living in light of eternity.\nThird, in verse 9, he says to be hospitable without complaining. Showing hospitality with joy will touch other people's lives and it will impact the giver's life as well. A little hospitality goes a long way in building meaningful relationships with people.\nThe last thing he says about a person who lives in light of eternity is that they use their talents to bring honor and glory to God in verses 10 and 11. God is the One that blesses each person with their talents and abilities. It only seems natural to make sure that the One who gives the talents is also the One who receives the glory for how the talents/abilities are used to help others.\nIn light of eternity, how are you living today? I want to encourage you that you can live in light of eternity — to love and help others, to glorify and honor God. Living this way is a blessed life. So live well, and live in light of eternity. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Decline of civil dialog in society is a threat\n\n July 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 753\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Every Sunday when I was a child, we eagerly awaited the delivery of the Sunday newspaper. It always included a feature with riveting pictures from previous editions.They were not just a collage of all the pictures from previous editions.\nThey were selected by the newspaper's editors thinking not so much on how timely they were at the present, but how timeless they might be going forward.\nIf that program were still in place today, two pictures that most certainly would be selected would be from the 2024 presidential election campaign.\nOne is of former President and current presidential candidate Donald Trump after an attempted assassination at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.\nIn that surreal picture, Trump is being taken with a bloody hand on a wounded ear, blood on his face and his other hand raised as a defiant fist from the event stage by Secret Service agents.\nAnother picture would be from the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\nIn that picture, Trump is standing alone on a stage next to the helmet and bunker coat of Corey Comperatore, who was a volunteer firefighter and Trump supporter who attended the Pennsylvania rally.\nCorey died shielding his family from the fusillade that almost killed Trump and seriously wounded two other rally attendees.\nProminently displayed next to Corey's bunker coat and helmet is an American flag.\nTrump appears to be gazing with deep contemplation of and reverence for the memorial for Comperatore.\nIn deeply divided America, both pictures are generating widely different reactions.\nSome Trump detractors claim the assassination was preplanned to generate support for the Trump campaign. They have implied Trump exiting the stage largely under his own power was done to show a stark contrast to a former opponent who often stumbled and needed assistance while walking.\nSome Trump detractors claim the picture of Trump looking at the Comperatore's memorial was staged for nothing more than scoring political points. They question if Trump's hand on the shoulder of the turnout coat was orchestrated and insincere.\nSadly, a significant number of seriously deranged Trump adversaries have posted messages on social media with messages like \"sorry the shooter missed\" and \"hope he [Trump] is killed the next time.\"\nI found the vileness and hate in those messages so disturbing I couldn't read all of them.\nNot all those adversaries are radical fringe malcontents.\nThey include a wide range of elected officials, celebrities and political commentators who have regularly characterized and continue to characterize Donald Trump as a Nazi, a neo-Nazi, a fascist, a dictator wanna be and an existential threat to America.\nSome Trump supporters believe the attempted assassination was a deep state conspiracy.\nThey maintain the spectacular failure of security at the event was by design.\nThey also believe constant inflammatory comments from Trump's many adversaries created an environment where the question on an assassination attempt was not if, but when.\nI am not going to engage a debate on the credibility on either side on these deeply held beliefs.\nI am more concerned such debate affirms that an alarming and steady decline of civil dialogue in our society is the greatest existential threat to democracy in America.\nIn today's intensely polarized political environment, it is considered normal and acceptable to disagree by being viciously disagreeable, to listen only to those who share and affirm that their views are the right views. Worst of all, we expect and accept the practice of demonizing anyone, and everyone who doesn't agree with us on every issue all the time.\nWe desperately need a renewed national commitment to critical thinking, listening to others, avoiding group think, respect for differing opinions and acceptance of a system of government where the majority rules, even when that can and does result in public policy decisions that do not have universal agreement.\nMuch easier said than done.\nThe underlying reality of where we are as a society is best captured by the cogent observation of veteran political communications consultant, Frank Luntz: \"It's not what you say or write, it's what people hear or read. You can have the best message in the world, but the person on the receiving end will always understand it through the prism of their own emotions, preconceptions, prejudices and preexisting beliefs.\"\nIn other words — my mind is made up. Don't try to persuade me otherwise with facts.\nWhen dealing the deep divisions caused by the issue of slavery and the American Civil War Abraham Lincoln said, \"A house divided cannot stand.\"\nAmerica has been and is a house divided.\nIf we do not change course soon, we will not stand.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings: Live at peace with everyone?\n\n July 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: PETER SMITH | Section: Columns \n \n 338\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In the shadow of the attempted assassination of former President Trump last week, President Biden challenged both political parties to calm things down in the race, to be more civil with those who have differing political opinions and views.Many must have thought, \"What an impossible request!\" What do you think?\nThe Apostle Paul challenged Christians living in Rome in a similar way. He said, \"If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.\" (Romans 12:18). Paul, did you really mean everyone? Does everyone include my enemies, crazy people at work, an ex-spouse or even a former convict? Are their parameters to follow? Guidelines?\nIt comes down to valuing others through the lens of love. If we claim to have faith in Jesus, then His love in us must respond through us in every situation.\nI'm learning by watching others who do this well. They say, \"I've learned to swallow my pride.\" Another told me he doesn't always try to get the last word in when he disagrees with someone else. Seems practical. And Paul did say \"if it's possible…\" which means sometimes we won't be able to live peacefully with others. But for sure, it comes down to me, to you, not the \"other\" person. Again his words: \"as far as it depends on you…\"\nWill there be exceptions? Of course. When face to face with evil, we must deal with it and not cave in. But pastorally I've seen people use exceptions as their rule for living and dealing with others all the time. My prayer is that we learn to take the high road as much as possible when tough situations come our way.\nPaul's challenge is to dig deep into our character, into our faith, when confronted with people who are not peace oriented at times. I pray God will help us discover ways to agree to disagree when we don't get along with others. Though it might be a difficult challenge, God says it's possible to do. May we believe it is too. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Canning day in the kitchen",
    "date": "2024-07-30",

    "content": "Canning day in the kitchen\n\n July 30, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: News \n \n 1630\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The fresh vegetables were picked, washed and ready to be processed for \"canning day\" on the farm.Canning day was decided by the ripeness of the vegetables. Let me tell you, canning involves a lot of work.\nOutside in the storage building were baskets full of empty jars that were washed and stored during the year as the contents were eaten. In an empty \"lard can\" were the rings off the jars and boxes of new caps were waiting to be used in the process of the two-piece jar lids.\nTwo washing tubs were set up outside, one with hot soapy water and the other with clear water for rinsing. The bushel baskets holding the canning jars from the previous year's canning day were carefully carried to the house and placed on the long counter tops in the old-fashioned country kitchen.\nOn top of the kitchen stove would be two heavy-duty kitchen pots filled with vegetables — maybe green beans or lima beans or tomatoes or corn — and as soon as it was blanched, the veggies were placed in the canning jars.\nThe jar lids were put on lightly, and the jars placed in the canning pots. The canning pots started rolling on the fire, thus cooking the vegetables.\nThis scene lasted all day, or until the veggies were all used.\nI must say what a beautiful sight — rows of glass jars with corn, green beans, beets, relishes, jellies, jams and so much more.\nBut thank you, technology, for the pressure cooker, food processor, microwave, portable oven and more.\nCANNED PEACHES4 lbs. peaches (about 9 large peaches), 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, 8 cups water.\nbring a large pot of water to a boil. Fill a large bowl with ice water. Using a paring knife, cut a shallow \"x\" into the bottom of each peach. Add peaches to boiling water and let boil for 3 minutes. Remove peaches and place directly in a bowl of ice water. When peaches are cool enough to handle, peel peaches. Slice peaches and discard the pit. Divide peaches between 4 sterilized canning jars, being sure to leave about 1 inch of space from the top of the jar. In another medium pot over medium heat, add sugar and 8 cups water and bring to a simmer. Stir until sugar is dissolved. Pour simple syrup over peaches, leaving about 1/4 inch of space from the top of the jar. Gently tap jars on the counter to settle peaches and syrup. Add more syrup as necessary to each jar. Tightly seal jars with lids. Fill a large stock pot about halfway with water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Once water is close to a simmer, use tongs to carefully lower jars into hot water. Let water come to a gentle boil and boil for 25 minutes. Carefully remove jars from the stock pot and let sit at room temperature until completely cool. Press down on the lid of the jars to test if they are properly sealed. If the lid bounces back or pops the jar is not sealed. Once jars are properly sealed and cooled, store in a dry dark space until ready to eat.\nPICKLED BEETS4 to 5 lbs small beets, 2 tsps pickling salt, 1 1/2 cups white sugar, 3 cups white vinegar, 2 tbsps mixed pickling spice tied in cheesecloth bag, 1 cup water.\nWash the beets and remove most of the tops, leaving about 1/2 inch of beet top remaining. In a large boiling pot of water, cook the beets until barely tender. Remove from the stove. Submerge the beets in a large bowl of ice water. Cut off the tops and the roots completely, then remove the skin. Peel and slice beets into preferred size. Combine the vinegar, sugar, water, salt and pickling spice in a nonreactive pot and bring mixture to a boil; reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the beets to the pickling liquid and return to a boil. Remove the spice bag. Carefully ladle the beets and pickling liquid into hot sterilized pint jars, leaving 1/2 inch headspace. Remove any air bubbles with a non-metal utensil. Add additional pickling liquid, if needed, to keep the proper headspace. Wipe the jar rims thoroughly with a clean damp cloth, failure to do this can result in the jars not sealing properly. Seal the jars and process for 35 minutes in a boiling water bath.\nHOMEMADE PICKLE RELISH2½ lbs cucumbers (peeled, center row of seeds removed and finely diced), 1 large yellow onion (finely diced), 1 small red bell pepper (finely diced), 1 small green bell pepper (finely diced), 3 cloves garlic (finely minced), ¼ cup kosher or pickling salt, 3 cups white vinegar, 1/2 cup sugar, 2 tsps dill seeds, 1 tbsp yellow mustard seeds, 2 tsps celery seeds, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 2 bay leaves.\nPlace the diced cucumbers, onion, bell pepper and garlic in a large mixing bowl. Combine with the salt and pour water over the mixture until covered. Let sit for at least 6 hours or overnight. Drain the cucumber mixture in a colander, rinse thoroughly with water, and drain again. In a large stock pot, add the sugar, vinegar, and spices and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the drained cucumber mixture and return to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Discard the bay leaves. Ladle the hot relish into hot sterile jars, leaving ¼ inch of headspace. Wipe the rims of the jars clean and seal tightly with the lids. Process the jars in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes. Sealed jars will store in a cool, dark place for a year. If the seal is broken, the relish will keep in the fridge for at least a month. Makes 4 pints. Best eaten at least a week later after the flavors have had time to meld and the vinegar mellows out a bit.\nSTRAWBERRY JAM5 cups crushed fresh strawberries, 4 16-oz. containers, 7 cups granulated sugar, 1 packet original Sure-Jell premium fruit pectin powder, 2 tbsp lemon juice, 1/2 tsp butter.\nWash jars, lids and bands in hot soapy water, dry completely, and set bands aside. Simmer lids in warm water in a saucepan until ready to place them on jars. Keep jars warm by simmering in hot water until ready to use. Do not boil. Fill a 20 quart stock pot or water bath canner with hot water, and place on the stove over medium-high heat. You'll need enough water to later cover your jars with at least 1 inch of water. Crush strawberries in a large mixing bowl or shallow glass baking dish using hand masher until nice, smooth consistency. Transfer crushed strawberries to 8-quart stock pot. Add pectin, lemon juice and butter to the pot, and stir constantly with a wooden spoon over high heat while bringing to a rolling boil. Once boiling, add sugar, return to rolling boil, then boil for 1 minute while stirring constantly. After 1 minute, remove foam from top of jam by skimming it off with a metal spoon.one by one, remove a jar from hot water, transfer to a cookie sheet, place regular mouth canning funnel on jar, and ladle in strawberry jam mixture leaving 1/4 inch empty head space at top of the jar. Then wipe off the rim of the lid and threads of the jar with damp cloth.\nContinue until all jars have been filled. Remove warm lids from the saucepan and place one lid on each jar. Then screw one band on each jar just until snug but not overly tight. Place filled jars on a rack in a 20-quart stock pot or water bath canner, then lower down into hot water. Make sure there is enough water in the pot that there is at least 1 inch of water above the jars. Place the lid on your pot and bring to a gentle boil. Once water is boiling, set your timer for processing and boil for 10 minutes, once jars have finished boiling, turn off heat, remove the lid from the pot and let jars sit for 5 minutes before removing. After 5 minutes, lift up the rack to an elevated resting position, then carefully remove jars one by one using a jar lifter, and transfer to a folded towel to cool. The lids on the jars will begin to 'pop' into the sealed position, signifying the jam has been preserved. If any lids do not pop within the first 12-24 hours, transfer those to the refrigerator and use those up first. It may take up to 24-48 hours to finish setting. Jars can be stored in your pantry, or a cool, dry cupboard for up to 1 year.\nHOMEMADE SALSA10 cups peeled, chopped and drained tomatoes; 3 cups chopped onion, ¾ cups chopped green bell pepper, 5 jalapenos (finely chopped, membranes and seeds removed), 7 cloves garlic (finely minced), 2 ½ tsps ground cumin, 2 ½ tsps coarsely ground black pepper, 2 ½ tbsps canning or pickling salt, ⅓ cup chopped fresh cilantro, ⅓ cup sugar (optional, depending on sweetness of tomatoes), 1 ¼ cups apple cider vinegar, 16 ounces tomato sauce (necessary for safe canning/proper pH), 12 ounces tomato paste (optional if you want a thicker salsa).\nCombine all the ingredients in a large pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring often, Fill sterilized pint-size canning jars within 1/2-inch of the top. Wipe the rim of the jar clean and seal with a lid and ring. Process in a water or steam bath canner for 15 minutes Remove the jars carefully from the water or steam bath and let cool to room temperature. Check to make sure the jars have sealed correctly. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Memories of crab catching adventures\n\n August 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: News \n \n 1632\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n My grandson Mason has been spending some time down on Tangier Island this summer. Mason has been telling me all about the crab cakes and steamed crabs he's been eating fresh out of the water and right into the steamer.Mason's brings back memories of the 1950s and 1960s adventures of crabbing. Mom would back the pickup out, and we would load the supplies, which included baskets with inner tubes attached to help the baskets float, chicken necks for bait, heavy string to tie the hook and sinker to, crab nets, towels, a picnic basket with sandwiches and a big jug of water.\nWe loaded up and rode in the back of the truck so we could hoot and holler at our friends as we rode through town. Our destination would be one of two country landings with docks for crabbing and areas for swimming.\nThe first was Mumford's Landing down off St, Martin's Neck Road (now a development off the Route 90 bridge outside of Ocean City), and the second was a dock called Little Georgetown, just down the road from our farm on the Delaware side.\nOne particular day, we were headed to Mumford's Landing. Upon arriving, Mom picked a spot to tie our strings on the dock poles. We took the lines and hung the nuts, bolts and sinkers on the bottom so the weight held the line down. Then we tied on the chicken neck for bait.\nYou had a choice — go swimming now or later — but you had to move down a good distance to stay away from the baited lines. Mom got two baskets ready with inner tubes to float the baskets, grabbed a crab net and walked along the shoreline crabbing. Someone stayed back with another net and basket to gradually pulled up the lines, placing the neck under the line to catch the falling crabs.\nUpon arriving at home, the still kicking crabs were unloaded, the fire started and the Old Bay seasoning was pulled out. Once the crabs were bright orange/reddish in color the fire was pulled away and the crabs pulled and placed on the picnic tables to be picked.\nOf course, we ate the delicious meat until we were full, and then we put it in containers to be carried to the kitchen to be made into dishes such as crab cakes, crab soup and much more.\nYou can purchase crabs locally at LNT Seafood in Preston, Blough's Seafood outside of Denton, Kool Ice and Seafood in Cambridge, Kayla's crabs in Federalsburg on Preston Rd, Trident Seafood on Rt 50 IN Hebron and Fat Boys Seafood on Old Ocean City Road in Salisbury. There are many other small local spots featuring fresh seafood catches, but trust \"word of mouth\" for the best recommendations.\nCRAB DIP8 ounces crab meat, 8 ounces cream cheese (softened), 1/2 cup sour cream, 2 tbsp mayonnaise, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp dry mustard, 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese, 1 pinch garlic salt (optional), 2 tsp Old Bay seasoning or JO seasoning.\nIn a large bowl, mix cream cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce and dry mustard until smooth. Stir in 2 tbsp of shredded cheddar cheese. Add crab meat into the mixture. Pour mixture into a 1-quart casserole dish. Top with remaining cheese, or more. But not too much because you don't want the cheese to overtake the taste of the crab. Add some of your favorite crab or seafood seasoning on top. Bake at 325 degrees for about 30 minutes or until the top is browned.\nCRAB MAC N CHEESE1 16 oz box dry Cavatappi pasta or elbows, 1 lb jumbo lump crab meat, ½ cup unsalted butter, ½ cup all-purpose flour, 1 ½ tsp seafood seasoning such as Old Bay or JO, ½ tsp garlic salt, ½ tsp ground mustard, ¼ tsp black pepper, 2 oz chive & onion cream cheese (softened), 5 cups whole milk, 5 cups shredded cheddar and Monterey jack cheese (divided). For the topping: 2 tbsps unsalted butter (melted), ½ cup panko breadcrumbs, 1 tbsp grated parmesan, ¼ tsp seafood seasoning, 1 tbsp chopped fresh Italian parsley.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 13-by-9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Set aside. Cook the pasta in salted water per the package directions until al dente. Drain well and set aside. Pick over the crab meat removing any shells and cartilage. Set aside. In a medium-size heavy bottomed saucepan, melt ½ cup butter over medium heat. To the melted butter add flour, 1 ½ teaspoon seafood seasoning, garlic salt, ground mustard and black pepper. Mix until the flour has been absorbed by the butter stirring constantly. Whisk in the milk. Whisk constantly to prevent clumping. Bring the milk to a boil then immediately lower the heat to low. Simmer for 3-5 minutes gently bubbling and stirring to prevent sticking. Turn off the heat. Add cream cheese to the sauce. Stir until melted then add 3 cups of Borden shredded Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese. Remove from the heat, stirring until melted. Add the cooked pasta and crab meat to a large mixing bowl. Pour the cheese sauce over and mix until fully coated and the crab meat is evenly distributed. Pour ½ into the baking dish. Top with 1 cup shredded cheese. Repeat with macaroni then top with the final 1 cup of shredded cheese. Topping: Melt 2 tablespoon butter in a small microwave safe bowl.. Mix with the panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and ¼ teaspoon seafood seasoning, Sprinkle on top. Place into the oven and bake for 30-40 minutes or until the top is golden and the edges are bubbly. Garnish with chopped parsley just before serving.\nCHICKEN, CRAB, SAUSAGE GUMBO1 cup bacon grease, 3 tbsps olive oil, 1 yellow onion (chopped), 1 red bell pepper (chopped), 2 cups andouille sausage (sliced), 1 cup all-purpose flour, 4-6 cloves garlic (minced), 3/4 gallon chicken stock, 1 15-oz can chopped tomatoes, 1 tsp apple cider vinegar, 2 cups stewed and shredded chicken, 3 tbsps fresh parsley, 1 tbsp dried basil, 1 tbsp dried oregano, 2 cups frozen okra, 2 cups crab meat, salt, white pepper, lemon juice and Tabasco to taste, shopped green onions and rice.\nAdd 3 tablespoons olive oil or bacon grease to a cast-iron skillet and cook the onion and bell pepper until soft and set aside. Cook the sausage in the same skillet until browned and set aside with the vegetables. Add1 cup of the bacon grease to the skillet over medium heat and stir in the flour. Lower the heat to low and cook for at least 1 hour, stirring every 5 minutes. The roux should be thick, but not chalky. When it is dark tan and smells like toasted nuts, it is done. In a large stock pot or Dutch oven, add the sautéed vegetables and sausage, and heat over medium high heat. Add the garlic and simmer for 2 minutes. Add stock, tomatoes, vinegar, chicken and all other dry ingredients. Simmer on low to medium heat for at least 1 hour. Add salt, white pepper, lemon juice and Tabasco to taste. Skim off about 3 cups of liquid from the pot (with as few solids as possible) and combine in a bowl with about 1 cup roux. Stir until it thickens and becomes paste-like. Add about half this mixture back to the pot on low heat. Stir well. Let simmer for a few minutes and add more roux mixture to thicken or water or stock to thin. The gumbo should be thick, but not as thick as gravy. Add half of the okra. Simmer on very low for at least 30 minutes. Be careful, as it can easily burn. Add the remaining cup of okra and the crab meat 5 minutes before serving. Taste again for salt, white pepper, lemon juice and Tabasco. Serve in bowls with rice and garnish with green onion.\nCHESAPEAKE CIOPPINO2 tbsps unsalted butter, 1 tbsp olive oil, 1/2 cup celery, (medium diced), 1 cup onion (medium diced), 1/2 cup fennel (thin sliced), 2 tbsps garlic (thin sliced or minced), 1 tbsp Old Bay or JO seasoning, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper, 1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 2 cups chicken stock, 3 cups tomato puree, 1/2 lemon (sliced), 1 lb shrimp, 1 lb Maryland blue crab meat, 12 oysters (shucked), 1 lb rock fish (cut into large cubes), 24 mussels (cleaned or frozen).\nCombine butter and olive oil in a medium stock pot. Heat on medium until butter has melted. Add celery, onion, garlic and fennel to the stock pot. Sauté until onion has become translucent, add crab seasoning, oregano, crushed red pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes, add chicken stock and tomato puree. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes, Add the sliced lemon, shrimp, whole crab meat, oysters, rock fish and mussels, staggering to accommodate for cook times. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes or until mussels have opened. Serve hot.\nMARYLAND CREME OF CRAB SOUP1/4 cup butter, 1 medium onion (coarsely chopped),1/3 cup flour, 4 cups milk or half-and-half, 1 tbsp Old Bay or JO seasoning, 1/2 tsp parsley flakes, 1 lb lump crab meat.\nMelt butter in a three-quart saucepan on medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir 5 minutes or until softened. Add flour, Old Bay or JO, and parsley; whisk until well blended. While whisking constantly, gradually add milk. Bring just to boil. Stir in crabmeat. Reduce heat to low; simmer for 20 minutes stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with additional Old Bay or JO if desired.\nTo end this week, I'd like to send a special hello to Mr. Alan Planner and Mrs. Darlene Planner of Federalsburg. Thank you for being loyal readers and great friends. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Lifetime of observations contribute to column\n\n August 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 890\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On a regular basis, some individuals have responded negatively to my guest commentaries on politics and public affairs. They have included assumptions about my background and motivations. As a result, they have a perception that I am using the commentaries to promote the Republican Party in general, and Donald Trump in particular.Such assumptions and perceptions are simply not true.\nI am not an avid supporter of Donald Trump in his comeback bid for another term as president and have not been an avid supporter of him since he launched his first presidential campaign.\nIn one guest commentary last fall I even predicted he would not be nominated as the 2024 Republican presidential candidate.\nI am not an avid supporter of the Republican Party and have never been a blindly loyal voter for Republican candidates.\nBeginning with the first election when I was eligible to vote, and continuing to today, I have never voted a straight Republican ticket in any local, state or national election.\nCandidate quality always has been and will always be my guiding principle on who to support and for whom to cast my vote.\nAt one time I was active in the Republican Party. I served as chair of the Republican Central Committee of Talbot County and as a member of the executive committee at the Maryland Republican Party.\nI voluntarily stepped down as Talbot County Central Committee chair in February 2022. That resulted in my relinquishing my seat on the GOP's executive committee.\nMy past service with the local and state Republican Party is old history and irrelevant to today.\nSince February 2022, I have not had any conversations or dealings with either organization.\nWith regards to the upcoming presidential election, I acknowledge that Donald Trump has flaws. So does Kamala Harris.\nThat said, I embrace the observation of Don Nielson the author of \"Presidential Leadership: Learning from United States Presidential Libraries & Museums.\"\nNielson writes, \"… leaders are not perfect. Try as they might, every leader still has flaws. They still make mistakes. They still fall short. They still have regrets. They still yearn to do better. Every leader is imperfect.\"\nOn at least two occasions I have written positive commentaries about a Democratic leader.\nIn one I praised Democratic President John F. Kennedy for his masterful leadership during the Cuban Missile crisis. His leadership has led many historians to conclude his actions avoided World War III.\nIn another guest commentary on President Kennedy, I suggested voters everywhere should embrace his timeless admonition to always ask this question — \"What am I not being told?\"\nIn all my commentaries, I strive to engage independent thinking and to follow lessons learned about bipartisanship from two awesome political mentors.\nOne was a Republican state senator in Pennsylvania for whom I served as his administrative assistant. Our office received more constituent requests for assistance than any other senator.\nHis ironclad rule was to help everyone regardless of their party affiliation, relative level of support or lack of support for him or their views on the issues. We never researched or even considered that information before we worked diligently on every constituent contact on every matter regardless of how small or how big.\nA second mentor is the CEO of a Pennsylvania-based public affairs and public relations consulting firm where I serve as Maryland director.\nFor almost 45 years, this mentor, a staunch Republican, was a close friend of a long time equally staunch Democratic political operative in Pennsylvania.\nHis friend served as the executive director of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, as a communications director for two Democratic governors, and as a communications director for two Democratic speakers of the House in the state House of Representatives.\nFor over 20 years, my mentor and his friend were verbal sparring partners on a weekly point-counterpoint television program. They also sparred in point-counterpoint columns for two publications and frequently shared the stage at conferences, seminars and classrooms. Many times, they rode together to and from those events.\nIn a city mayoral election, my mentor provided campaign counsel to a Democratic candidate because he felt strongly that she was the best person for the job.\nLast, but not least, my mentor hosts a monthly policy briefing at our office in Pennsylvania.\nOn a regular basis, Democratic-elected officials, Democratic candidates and Democratic party operatives are featured as speakers and are welcomed as guests.\nGoing forward I will continue to offer my thoughts based upon a lifetime of participating in and observing a wide range of events in the political arena.\nI will continue to respect the right of those who choose to disagree, sometimes vehemently, with the central messages in my commentaries.\nI will continue to read every comment, pro and con, on my commentaries with a willingness to think, \"You may be right.\"\nIn return, I ask all who disagree with me to do this:\nRefrain from attacking my opinions using unsubstantiated assumptions about my background and motives.\nFocus more on my content, staying on topic and giving due thought and consideration to that content, rather than trying to attack the messenger.\nRemember two former and greatly missed U.S. Supreme Court Justices — conservative icon Antonin Scalia and liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsberg. They were polar opposites on their opinions on almost every issue brought before the court. Still, they respected each other and never attacked each other. Justice Scalia said it best, \"I attack ideas. I don't attack people.\"\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings: God's provision is nourishment for the soul\n\n August 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILLY JOHNSON | Section: Columns \n \n 298\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Throughout the Bible, we see a beautiful and consistent theme: God, like a joyous chef in the kitchen, always provides a feast for His people.From the very beginning, in the Garden of Eden, God set the table for humanity, providing every kind of plant for food (Genesis 2:9). This theme continues with the Passover feast, where the Israelites ate the lamb as a sign of God's deliverance from Egypt (Exodus 12).\nAs the Israelites journeyed through the wilderness, God provided manna from heaven, sustaining them daily (Exodus 16). This miraculous bread was a daily reminder of His constant care. Similarly, the prophet Isaiah paints a picture of a grand feast of rich foods and well-aged wines, symbolizing the Lord's generous provision and the promise of a future filled with His blessings (Isaiah 25:6).\nLooking ahead, the Bible speaks of a glorious wedding feast of the Lamb in Revelation 19:9, where believers will gather in celebration and communion with Christ. This image points us to the ultimate fulfillment of God's provision and fellowship with His people.\nJesus is the ultimate picture of this when He declares, \"I am the bread of life that came down from heaven\" (John 6:51).\nJust as God provided manna in the desert, He now offers spiritual nourishment through Jesus. In Christ, we find not only our daily bread but the sustenance for our souls.\nAs we reflect on these biblical feasts, let's remember that God's provision is not just about physical sustenance but also about spiritual nourishment. He invites us to His table, where we can find rest, refreshment and joy in His presence. Let's embrace this divine provision with gratitude and share it with our community, knowing that the Lord who fed His people in the past continues to feed us today with His love and grace. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Cooking like The King\n\n August 13, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: News \n \n 1178\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Time for my yearly tradition, even though still a sad one.On Aug. 16, 1977, the Rock N' Roll world lost a legend — Elvis Presley. I remember that day as well as I remember the first time I heard his voice at the age of 10.\nMy brother, age 12, and I were sick of Honkytonk music and Boogie Woogie songs. Our older siblings were into those crooners. Our first Elvis experience was in 1954, and the song was \"That's Alright\" followed by \"Heartbreak Hotel.\"\nHe and I would take my sister's transistor radio outside and put on our little show until my sister came home and took her radio back. We had so much fun. We had a dance floor made with wooden chicken coops turned upside down.\nWhen you go to Graceland and take the tour. The kitchen is one of the most popular stops after the Jungle Room. It hasn't been touched since the late '70s and has been recreated the way it was the day Elvis died based on photos taken from the death investigation, right down to the bowls of fruit and veggies that are replaced every few days to keep up the magic.\nOne of the most interesting stories was about the microwave. Elvis had one of the very first microwaves ever produced. He paid around $1,000 for the microwave, which can still be seen in the kitchen to this day.\nAnother story told is how he fell in love with Texas-style food when he was stationed there with the Army. Elvis was drafted in December 1957 and was assigned to the Second Armored Division at Fort Hood for his basic training.\nElvis, who was raised on lower class Mississippi and Memphis food quickly took a liking to the spicy, meaty dishes he was now eating daily. BBQ Pork pizza was one of those dishes, and I'll include that recipe here in this column.\nAs I said above, I have been lucky to go to Memphis and Graceland as well as Sun Records and to stand right in the spot where Elvis recorded \"That's Alright Mama.\" I am thinking about going back in February for my birthday.\nMemphis is such a soulful town that you can't help but bob your head and tap a foot at the sounds of the blues coming out of every door on Beale Street. And the food! On top of the amazing barbecue at Charles Vergos' Rendezvous, there is Gus's World Famous fried chicken, whose fried green tomatoes are out of this world.\nI enjoy Elvis's music as I can associate it with many happy and tragic stages in my own life. Well folks this is my story from my heart. Enjoy today's recipes, which were Elvis's favorites.\nFRIED PEANUT BUTTER AND BANANA SANDWICHESSmear peanut butter on one slice of bread, and on the other slice smear the bread with mashed banana. Put the slices together, smear each outside slice with bacon grease and fry in a hot skillet.\nFRIED DILL PICKLES1 jar (32 oz) whole dill pickles, 1 cup buttermilk, 2 tbsps Louisiana-style hot sauce, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup cornmeal, 2 tbsps garlic salt, 2 tbsps paprika, 1 tbsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp pepper, oil for deep-fat frying, ranch salad dressing.\nDrain pickles, discarding liquid. Cut pickles into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Drain on paper towels; blot with additional paper towels until dry. In a shallow bowl, mix buttermilk and hot sauce. In another shallow bowl, mix flour, cornmeal, garlic salt, paprika, cayenne pepper and pepper. Dip pickles in buttermilk mixture, then in flour mixture. In a Dutch oven, heat one inch of oil to 375 degrees. Working in batches, fry pickles for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with ranch dressing, if desired.\nBBQ PORK PIZZA1 large ready-made pizza base or your favorite pizza dough, 2 cups of your favorite barbecue sauce, 2 tbsps vegetable oil, 1 1/4 pounds boneless pork tenderloin, 4 oz mild cheddar or American cheese (shredded), 10 oz mozzarella cheese (shredded), basil leaves.\nPrepare pizza dough according to the instructions on the package and set aside, or use a ready-made pizza base. Pour the barbecue sauce into a small saucepan and heat gently over medium heat, stirring occasionally.\nIn a medium skillet or frying pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the pork tenderloin and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden, turning to brown evenly. Add about 1/2 cup of the barbecue sauce and cook the pork over medium-low heat, covered, for about 20 minutes. Baste occasionally. Remove from heat and reserve any pan juices.\nPreheat the oven to 500 degrees. Place the prepared pizza base on a baking sheet according to the directions. Spread about 1 cup of the barbecue sauce over the base to within half an inch of the edge. Toss the cheeses together; reserve 1/2 cup. Sprinkle remaining cheese over the base and bake for about 10 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and the crust is golden. While cheese is melting, carve the tenderloin into slices, then shred the slices into thin strips. Remove pizza from the oven and sprinkle pork strips over the cheese. Pour over the remaining sauce and any remaining pan juices. Sprinkle reserved 1/2 cup cheese over top and return pizza to the oven for 5 minutes, until hot and bubbling. Divide into wedges and garnish with basil leave\nHAMBURGER STEAK2 1/2 pounds ground beef, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1/2 cup chopped green pepper, 1 tbsp garlic, 1 tbsp salt, 1 tbsp black pepper, 2 cups mushroom soup, 2 eggs (beaten).\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl mix together ground beef, chopped onions, chopped green pepper, garlic, salt, black pepper, mushroom soup and eggs. Mix well Shape into mini steaks and fry in a skillet with 2 tablespoons Crisco. Cook for about 12 to 15 minutes, making sure steaks are cooked inside well. Drain on paper towels and proceed to make gravy with grease left in the pan.\nELVIS BANANA BREAD2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 4 medium ripe bananas (mashed), 2 large eggs (room temperature), 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter, 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/4 cup canola oil, 2 tsps vanilla extract, 2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk the first six ingredients. In another bowl, whisk bananas, eggs, peanut butter, applesauce, oil and vanilla until blended. Add to flour mixture; stir just until moistened. Fold in chocolate chips. Transfer to three loaf pans coated with cooking spray. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in pans 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool. If you make multiple loaves like Mary Jenkins Langston would make for his plane rides to Las Vegas, you can freeze them and reheat. Securely wrap the cooled loaves and freeze. To use, thaw at room temperature or, if desired, microwave each loaf on high for 60-75 seconds or until heated through. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Labor Day — cooking for end of summer celebrations\n\n August 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1353\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Labor Day is the last official summer holiday to be celebrated.The kids are ready for the return to school, the last-minute vacations are planned, and it is time to plan that Labor Day party.\nToday we will explore some tasty dishes for that special day that does not require a lot of labor. Cooking outside is done year round now, and the grill awaits the food. Hot dogs and hamburgers are some of the favorite grill foods.\nThe 2024-25 school year does not start until after Labor Day this year for most schools, which is great for the kids who work in the summer. An extra paycheck helps pay for the school fees, shoes, clothes, classroom supplies and tuition.\nMason, my oldest grandson, has been going to college part time as well as working full time this summer. Colin, his little brother, also started working this summer in the food service industry. I tell both of them how lucky they are to be able to work in the air conditioning while others aren't so lucky.\nThat first day of school is always exciting and emotional for the first-time student and parents. In 1970 and 1971, when my two oldest boys started school, I played the strong parent role — walking them down the hallways of Buckingham Elementary, leaving them in the care of the teacher, walking bravely out to my car.\nTurning around, I got out of the car and walked across the lawn to the back of the school and peered in the windows. How embarrassing when the teacher and students waved at me — including my own boys.\nThank you, American workers, for working to support your families, the young children, the elderly, the disabled, and those who supported you as long as they could. You are the backbone of America, and we support you. And just know it comes from the bottom of our hearts.\nHere are some recipes for the grill to savor the ast days of summer.\nDIJON GRILLED CHICKEN BREAST\n1 tbsp Dijon mustard, 1 tbsp mayonaise, 1 tsp vinegar, 1 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 garlic clove (minced), cooking spray, chicken breasts (boneless, skinless).\nIn a small bowl, mix together Dijon mustard, mayonnaise, vinegar, black pepper, salt and garlic clove. Lightly coat the grill with cooking spray and preheat for 4 to 5 minutes. Place 4 chicken breast halves on the grill. Spoon the sauce over the chicken and grill for 5 to 7 minutes. Make sure you use all of the sauce. Double this recipe for a crowd.\nGRILLED ITALIAN SAUSAGE AND PEPPERS\n2 lbs Italian sausage, green peppers (seeded, thinly sliced), 1 onion (thinly sliced), 1 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp salt.\nCut Italian sausage into 4 portions. Lightly spray the grill with cooking spray and preheat for 3 minutes. Place the sausage on the grill. On top of the sausages place green peppers, onion, black pepper and salt. I sometimes sprinkle Old Bay seasoning. Double this recipe to fill the grill.\nHow about some great side dishes?\nGERMAN POTATO SALAD\nMy friend Hannah always brings this great dish to cookouts, luncheons and dinners.\n10 medium potatoes (peeled), 6 slices bacon, 3/4 cup sliced onions, 2 tbsps flour, 2 tbsps sugar, 2 tsp salt, black pepper, 1 tbsp celery seed, 3/4 cup water, 1/3 cup vinegar.\nCook potatoes until just done — do not overcook. When cool, cut into slices and set aside. Fry bacon, remove bacon from pan. Cook sliced onion in the bacon drippings. Add flour, sugar, salt, dash of black pepper, and celery seed. Cook until just bubbly. Add water and vinegar and stir until slightly thickened. Pour this mixture over the potatoes. Crumble the bacon over the top. Serve warm.\nJELLO COOKIES\n4 cups flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup sugar, 1 3-oz package of dry Jello (flavor of your choice).\nSift flour with baking powder. Cream butter and gradually add sugar and package of dry Jello. Cream well. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Drop batter by heaping tablespoons on a greased baking sheet. Bake for 12 to 13 minutes. Makes about five dozen.\nSTEAMED CORN\n6 ears corn (husked), 2 tbsps granulated sugar, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tsp salt.\nFill a pot full of water and bring it to boil. Stir in the sugar, lemon juice and salt. Place the corn into the boiling water. Let the water return to a boil. Once boiling again, cover with a lid and turn off the heat. Cook the corn for 8-10 minutes or until tender.\nSWEET CORN RELISH\n10 fresh ears of sweet yellow corn (husks and silk removed, slice kernels off the cob with a sharp knife), 2 large red bell peppers (cored, and finely chopped), 2 large green bell peppers (cored and finely chopped), 8 ribs celery (finely chopped), 1 large yellow or sweet onion (finely chopped), 4 cups apple cider vinegar, 2 cups sugar, 1 tbsp ground mustard, 3 tsps salt.\nCombine all the ingredients in a pot and bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Ladle the relish into hot sterilized jars and seal with lids. Process the jars in a water bath for 10 minutes. Keep stored in a dark, cool place. Will keep at least one year. Once opened, store in the fridge for up to two months. Makes approximately eight pints. Wait a week or two before eating the relish to allow time for the vinegar to mellow out. Use it on hamburgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, fish, serve it with roasted chicken or mix with tomatoes/onions/cilantro for a Summer salad.\nMEXICAN SALAD\n1 onion, 4 tomatoes, 1 head lettuce, 4 oz grated cheddar cheese, 1 8-oz bottle French dressing, 2 cups Dorito chips, 1 lb ground beef, 1 15-oz can red kidney beans.\nChop onion with tomatoes and lettuce and put in a large bowl. Toss in cheddar cheese and French dressing. Crunch and add Dorito chips. Brown one pound of ground beef and add kidney beans when beef is browned. Simmer for 10 minutes. Mix into the salad and serve.\nGRAHAM FROZEN STREET\nCool Whip (8 oz. container), box of graham crackers, container of color sprinkles or toppings such as nuts and cookie crumbles.\nLay out a cookie sheet to place your graham cracker sandwiches on. Pour sprinkles on a paper plate. You can separate if you have different varieties of patriotic sprinkles. Break sheet of graham cracker in half. Scoop Cool Whip with a tablespoon and place 2 tbsps on one half of the graham cracker. Close the sandwich gently and smooth sides with your finger or spoon. Dip each side of the sandwich in sprinkles. Place the finished sandwich on a cookie sheet. When the cookie sheet is full, cover with foil and place in the freezer for a few hours.\nPINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE\nTopping: 1/4 cup butter (melted), 1/2 cup brown sugar, 20-oz can pineapple slices (or 20 fresh pineapple rings), 1 jar of pitted maraschino cherries. Cake: 1/2 cup butter (softened), 3/4 cup sugar, 2 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (sifted), 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 cup milk.\nPreheat the oven to 350-degrees. Grease a 8-by-8-inch baking dish. Topping: Add the brown sugar to the bottom of the pan. Melt butter, pour over the top of the brown sugar, mix together, and spread over the entire dish. Place the pineapples and cherries on top of the brown sugar, place cherries in the center of each pineapple slice.\nCake: Start by adding the butter to a large bowl and cream for one minute. Add the sugar and cream again for one more minute. Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix together. Add the vanilla and mix together. Combine flour, salt, and baking powder. Sift into the bowl and mix. Add the milk, mix together, and gently pour cake batter over pineapple. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean. Let the cake cool to room temperature and turn the cake upside down onto a cake plate. If you used canned pineapple, be sure to drain pineapple juice before removing the pineapple slices. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chestertown’s casual gin connoisseurs\n\n September 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LISA J. GOTTO Special to the Star Democrat | Section: News \n \n 1229\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CHESTERTOWN — It all began with the little juniper berry, which actually isn't a berry at all, but what botanists describe as a seed cone with an unusually fleshy circumference and merged scales called a galbulus that gives it its berry-like appearance.It was this humble berry-like seed cone, however, that became the go-to ingredient for the all-important spirit and mixologist staple, gin.\nThe true origin of gin, has been historically debated, some tracing it back as far as the Middle Ages, where it was consumed for medicinal purposes only, and later in history it shows up again in the Netherlands in the 1700s as a more refined spirit called 'jenever' that was developed by a Dutch doctor, who also administered it for its healing properties.\nThis later iteration of gin was further developed in England after juniper berries were imported by Dutch merchants, who also talked up the wonders of the elixir derived from them. It is this history and, of course, the flavor profiles of the spirit that has made gin enthusiasts out of Lynn and Steve Mitchell of Chestertown.\nThe Mitchells are what you might consider casual aficionados of gin in the sense that they collect both common and rare varieties and are known to have about 20 different types on-hand at any given time. They enjoy entertaining friends and neighbors at smart gin-themed soirees and love discovering new gins on their various travels.\n\"With wine in the middle part of the 19th century becoming extremely expensive in England due to the duties placed on it, no one was buying wine, and they had to diversify,\" said Steve, a self-described fan of gins with a traditional juniper profile.\nAmong the bottles in their collection, Steve pulled out a large bottle of Gilbey's, which he described as a standard gin: one that offers good value for the money.\n\"If you're going to have a party and you're serving gin, this is the gin you want to serve,\" said Steve, who remarked that it is also a designated London Dry Gin, which historically means that it meets a standard for quality, although the term is often interpreted by some to be indicative of its flavor profile.\nThe distillers of Gilbey's gin, Steve said, were originally part of the larger contingent of wine producers that needed to pivot once those duties on wine and brandy were imposed. Gin consumption then became extremely popular in England creating what would become labeled as the \"Gin Craze.\"\nSteve, who attests to having more than a wee bit of British blood, (his mother was a World War II GI bride) said he learned later in life that he had ancestors who worked for Gilbey's early in the distiller's history. While he takes some of his ancestral tales with a grain of salt, he can verify that his great grandfather worked as a warehouseman for a liquor company in London.\nAs far as other solid, reasonably priced gins he pulled out a bottle of his secret weapon, something he said they often find at Costco.\nYes, Costco.\nIn fact, their Kirkland Signature label London Dry Gin made from natural botanicals is rumored to be produced by one of the most prestigious distillers in the world, although as part of the deal, Costco is forbidden to reveal which distiller it is.\nWhile the online scuttlebutt often surmises it is a Tanqueray or Gordon construct, Steve has his own theory.\n\"I think it may be Bombay gin,\" he said, noting the shape of the bottle and its characteristic handle molded into the glass. These are gins that you can easily pick up locally, but there are others in the Mitchell's collection that are harder, if not impossible, to come by stateside.\nThere are two similar bottles that take a prominent place in the collection from the Slingsby Premium label, one a rhubarb-infused gin, the other gooseberry. These, he said, are best enjoyed sans-mixer in the cocktail style of a martini.\n\"Those I know I can't get until I go back to England.\"\nSome of the smaller batch brands in the collection originate from as far away as Japan and New Zealand, and one organic seaweed gin from London-based distiller, Dà Mhìle, didn't even smell like seaweed at all, but does, indeed, leave the palate with a salty taste, according to Steve.\nThere's a gin from a boutique distillery once located in D.C. that has since closed that Steve is fond of called Green Hat. The name, he says, is a nod to the shady purveyor that supplied Congress members with alcohol during Prohibition. This particular purveyor was identified to those in-the-know by the green hat that he wore.\nThe \"Navy Strength\" designation, he said, denotes a 57% alcohol content, whereas traditional gin ranges between 40 to 45%.\nAccording to Wikipedia, the British Navy required all booze and rum to be at 57% or higher; because if the casks on their ship ever broke and the gunpowder was flooded, the gunpowder would still need to be able to fire.\"\nAnd then, there's a purple bottle of Hendrick's special edition gin in the grouping called Midsummer Solstice that was distilled for a limited time only.\n\"This gin was only produced in 2019 for one season, and I bought a bottle at Pip's (Liquors) and drank it, and figured they'd have it again the next year. They didn't [have it] and have not had it since then.\"\nFortunately, he received a call from the couple's daughter who lives in Cyprus, who told him she found a dusty bottle in a store there and asked if he wanted her to grab it for him. Needless to say, the answer was \"yes\", and that bottle has been consumed sparingly.\nWhen it comes to gin, Lynn differs from her husband when it comes to flavor profiles.\n\"I'm not a Juniper fan,\" she said. \"And coupled with my interest in gardening and cooking, I like more of the offbeat botanicals and the other flavors that are now being introduced.\"\nHer favorite is a Japanese Craft Gin called Roku which she usually enjoys with an elderflower tonic.\nAn avid gardener, Lynn, is attracted to its vibrant floral notes balanced with the subtle spiciness of the Roku. She is also a fan, overall, of the approach some boutique distilleries had on the evolution of gin, particularly Hendricks.\n\"I think Hendrick's was really the trailblazer with their cucumber and rose combination; it showed that there was potential in the market for something other than just juniper.\"\nSteve referred to Hendrick's approach to gin distilling as, \"…. the watershed moment where actually the person who makes Hendricks gin is a female. And she, I guess said, 'Why are we making gin out of just juniper? Let's try something different.'\"\nThis difference is being seen in the craft gin distilling business in a big way as it is now a more palatable option and is being favored by a newer generation of consumers, with a definite increase in popularity among women. According to a 2022 report by the American Distilling Institute, the gin category, and specifically the craft category, has seen exponential growth, specifically a 9% increase each year for nearly a decade.\nOur conversation winded down with what else, but a good, old-fashioned gin and tonic while the late day summer sun faded with the couple talking about the possibility of one last gin-themed gathering in their screened-in back porch, and the next trip to England they may take as part of a tour around the holidays. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Lemuel Dent Jr., a native of Charles County, was interred on Sept. 5 at Cheltenham Veterans Cemetery in Prince George's County. Johnson Funeral Services of White Plains performed graveside services preceding the interment.\nAt the service last week, Donald Dent, Lemuel Dent's nephew, received the flag covering his family member's coffin. Lemuel Dent was survived by four sisters and five brothers, but Donald Dent said that they have since died.\n\"It was a surprise to me,\" Donald Dent said about hearing that Lemuel's remains were identified.\nPrior to this, all Donald Dent knew was that his uncle had died during World War II.\nLemuel Dent was killed Feb. 8, 1945, at age 30 near the Cinquale Canal, north of Viareggio, Italy, when the tank he was aboard was struck by enemy fire.\nA resident of Ironsides, an area on Route 6 in Charles County, Dent was assigned to Company L, 3rd Battalion, 366th Infantry Regiment, 92nd Infantry Division, known as the \"Buffalo Soldiers\" in the European Theater.\nThe U.S. Army recognizes the 92nd Infantry Division as the only African American infantry division to see combat in Europe during World War II.\nThe tank Dent was in was struck by enemy mortar, machine gun and artillery fire. His body was not recovered at the time, and the Germans never reported him a prisoner of war, the Defense POW/MIA Account Agency said in a release.\nOn May 5, 1945, the American Graves Registration Command, Army Quartermaster Corps, was tasked with recovering missing American personnel in the European Theater. Investigators recovered a set of remains, designated as X-124 Castelfiorentino, from a gravesite approximately 2 miles west of Pietrasanta and 500 yards north of the Cinquale Canal.\nThe investigators initially identified the remains as possibly belonging to a soldier of the 92nd Infantry Division but did not have enough data to make a positive identification. The remains were interred at what is now Florence American Cemetery in Impruneta, Italy.\nDent was accounted for by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency earlier this year after X-124's remains were exhumed in June 2022 from the Italian cemetery for laboratory analysis and identification.\nAt the funeral, local veterans and family members paid their respects to Dent. Members of the Buffalo Soldiers Motorcycle Club attended to salute Dent and pay homage to the rich history of the 92nd Infantry Division.\nThe name Buffalo Soldiers was initially selected for the club to pay homage to and ensure the legacy of African American military contributions in the post-Civil War era, according to the motorcycle club's website. The membership of the club is comprised of many active duty and retired service members, as well as law enforcement.\n\"I think it's a huge deal,\" Lonnie Bellamy, a member of Maryland's Buffalo Soldier chapter, said. \"Taking the time to do all that work to lay him to rest, spending all that energy to put a name to the remains. … It absolutely resonated with us.\"\nIn Italy, Lemuel Dent's name is recorded on the Tablets of the Missing at Florence American Cemetery.\nNow, a rosette rests alongside his name, indicating he has been accounted for and brought home. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled (NIV).\" Fortunately, we're here today because God found righteousness in a man named Noah.Even today, we are prone to sin, whatever our upbringing.

But God still loves us.\nWe might grow to adulthood and become so dedicated to serving God that we go on missionary trips, memorize the Bibl, and go to Christian schools. We might become deacons or pastors, but even if we know and serve God and Jesus all our lives, we are still going to sin, and we are still going to be sinners. It's part of our nature.\n\"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\" No matter how good we are, no matter how faithful, we will, on occasion, do wrong. The inclination to do wrong is in our hearts. God sees this. It's a part of our make-up, it's in the genes, it's in our DNA. But He still loves us.\nWe have always done wrong and we always will do wrong. God knows this better than we do, and it is because of our constant shortcomings that God sent His Son. Through Christ Jesus, we can wash our sins away. Yes, God still loves us.

It's about the community,\" Linette said.\nThanking Rhodes-Ickes and the Tides of Grace team for their initiative in servicing the community, County Commissioner Phil Dumenil noted it can be easy for the commissioners to fund worthwhile outside agencies, but \"it takes a single person to get to that point,\" he said.\nServing about 300 people a month, the Stevensville based nonprofit would like to eventually expand to a larger space, Rhodes-Ickes said.\nTides of Grace is continually growing and is always looking for more involvement from the community and volunteers.\nMore information about Tides of Grace can be found at tidesofgraceinc.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Advice for choosing candidates based on faith\n\n September 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JEFFREY S. TRIMBATH | Section: Columns \n \n 754\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In just over a month, Marylanders will begin casting their votes in this year's general election. Every year, citizens of our state get to exercise their \"consent,\" deciding who they want to represent them in government. In keeping with the scripture's command to love our neighbor (Mark 12:31), Marylanders of faith have a particular responsibility to participate.But how should Christians decide? What criteria should we use to choose one candidate over another?\nI suggest the following five criteria may be helpful.\nPerson. Obviously, the most immediate vote one makes is for the candidate. What is the person like? What is their experience, both in politics and in life? What is their family life like? Do they have children? Have they been successful in a variety of different vocations and callings?\nAnd what about their character? One important aspect of character emerges from the ancient meaning of the term as a \"stamping tool.\" As an image embossed on a coin, does their public persona mirror their stated commitments? For example, if a candidate publicly claims a particular religious faith, his or her position on policy issues ought to be in conformity with, or at least not contradict, the fundamental teachings of that tradition.\nPart of the character consideration is understanding that you are voting for political office, not ecclesiastical office. Of course, we want leaders in all sectors to be of good character. Favoring a presidential candidate, however, is fundamentally different than favoring your own pastor or priest.\nPrinciples and Policies. Every person has core values, rooted in what they love and believe to be true. What are those core convictions, and where do they come from?\nEvery candidate possesses core values. For Christians, our core convictions about the most important issues in life are grounded in how God created us, and what He says in the scriptures.\nWhat does the candidate believe about the human person, the nature of justice and how we're to live together? Which of these principles are more important than others?\nA candidate's principles will inform their policies. For Christians, issues of life, family, education and religious liberty are top tier. There are important lower-priority issues too — property rights, rule of law, taxes, immigration, inflation, national security — which are informed by our commitment to justice.\nParty. In our country there are two major political parties, both of which adopt platforms. Which platform most closely aligns with how God has created us and tells us to live? A candidate is one person, but that individual brings along with them the staff, resources and commitment of a political party. Which party has a history that aligns with biblical values?\nPeople. Depending on the level of office, winning candidates bring with them staff and personnel to help them serve in office. The newly elected president will place 4,000 staffers in his new administration. Who are the people who will fill those positions? Are they known for their expertise and work ethic, or known for other things that distract from the task?\nPrudence. After considering all of the above criteria, a Christian must ask: what is the most prudent choice? People of faith make political decisions in a fallen world, with a phalanx of competing dynamics and realities. Prudence is showing good and careful judgement as we make these choices. Part of making a prudent choice is understanding what is possible given this environment. Will the candidate you're choosing get elected? If that's not likely, are you supporting that candidate for another legitimate reason (to send a message, for example)?\nA key aspect of making a prudent choice is weighing which candidate is the least bad. Scripture teaches, and experience confirms, that every human is fallen. Every election, therefore, is the choice of the lesser of two evils. Both candidates may favor abortion, for example. In that case, is there one that favors other policies that better align with other biblical principles?\nThere you have it — 5 \"P's\" to help you evaluate which candidate you will choose this November. I would add a final \"p,\" and that's prayer. People of faith should fervently pray that God would give them wisdom and courage to vote for the right candidate, and pray that His will be done regardless of the outcome of the election.\nGod's people are called to \"seek the welfare\" of the city in which they find themselves, even if that land is hostile (Jeremiah 29). Taking the time to thoughtfully evaluate which candidates most effectively pursue that welfare is an important way we can love our neighbor and steward the gift of citizenship. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One thing for us to consider is that poor relationships with others can hinder our prayers.When our kids were little, we would give them rewards for doing things around the house. We would tell them that if they picked up the toys in their room or took out the trash, we would go out for ice cream.\nBut at times, they would begin to argue and fight with each other while they were trying to earn their reward. During those times, I would simply say, \"if you are going to fight, we are not going.\"\nJesus said, \"…you can pray for anything, and if you believe that you've received it, it will be yours. But when you are praying, first forgive anyone you are holding a grudge against, so that your Father in heaven will forgive your sins, too.\" (Mark 11:24-25; NLT)\nIn other words, God says, \"You can pray, and I will give you the desires of your hearts. But if you have some things going on in your relationship with someone else, you need to get that cleared up first.\"\nThe Apostle Peter tells husbands to honor their wives and to treat them with great respect, so that \"…your prayers will not be hindered.\" (1 Peter 3:7; NLT)\nBitterness, disrespect and unforgiveness in our hearts will hinder our prayers before God. As a father, how our kids treat each other matters to me. To our Heavenly Father, how his kids treat each other matters to Him.\nYour relationships with each other matter, and your prayers can be hindered if those relationships are not what they should be. Let's work on our relationships. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Well, that's sort of how they met.\nOn Tuesday, Ralph and Nancy celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary, a special day featuring delivered flowers sent by family members, friends and Ralph and dinner at a popular Cecil County restaurant.\n\"We see God's hand in how we met,\" Nancy said matter-of-factly while relaxing on a living room sofa inside the couple's home near Rising Sun.\nSeated right next to his bride of seven decades, Ralph smiled and nodded in agreement.\nIt would be a much easier love story to tell if Nancy and Ralph had met at Sandy Cove while both worked there as camp counselors. That streamlined love story would include their summer friendship blossoming into love and leading them to the altar to exchange their wedding vows.\nBut Ralph didn't work at Sandy Cove.\nWhen Nancy traveled some 350 miles south to work at that camp as a counselor in the Summer of '53, Ralph, a native Cecil Countian, was living on his family's dairy farm near Rising Sun. And he was working as a physicist at Aberdeen Proving Ground, where he and his colleagues conducted research on explosions.\nOK, so if Ralph was working a good 25 miles away from Sandy Cove at that time, studying blasts on a military installation, how did he and Nancy cross paths?\nThis is where Ruth — Ralph's sister — enters their love story.\nAs it turns out, Ruth worked that summer as a Sandy Cove camp counselor, just like Nancy, and they had the same shift schedule. As Nancy and Ruth worked together at that Christian camp, they discovered commonalities and their friendship grew. (Ruth passed away in 2014.)\n\"Ruth also went to Wheaton College, but I had never met her before coming to Sandy Cove,\" Nancy noted.\nRuth invited Nancy to a family dinner on one of their shared off days. Because they were camp counselors, Nancy and Ruth lived at Sandy Cove that summer.\n\"She took me home with her — and there was Ralph,\" summarized Nancy, breaking into a smile.\nTheir conversation came relatively easy, considering that, according to Nancy, she wasn't very outgoing back then.\nSo how did Ralph feel after spending some time with Nancy during that family dinner?\n\"I was thinking, 'I better ask her out',\" Ralph recalled.\nAnd Ralph did just that, which led to another date and then another . . .\nThe Summer of '53 ended way too soon, however, and Nancy returned to Wheaton College, where she later would earn her elementary education degree.\nShe and Ralph kept in touch through letters.\nRalph also made a point to see Nancy in person as much as he was able to do so. During the next year, Ralph traveled periodically to Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean and to Nevada, as part of a work-related project. At both places, Ralph and his colleagues researched large explosive blasts.\nHis westward travels typically included a Chicago stopover, allowing him to spend time with Nancy.\n\"Back in those days, airlines would allow you to get off a plane at an airport that was on the way and get on another one heading to your (original) destination, without having to pay extra,\" Ralph explained, before noting, \"Wheaton College is about 25 miles west of Chicago. So I planned my work trips so I could do a little courting.\"\nFlash forward to Christmas 1953: The couple was seated together inside his parents' home when Ralph asked Nancy to marry him.\nFor the sake of spinning one of those dreamy love stories, it would have been fitting if Ralph and Nancy were lounging in front of crackling, dancing flames inside a brick fireplace when he popped the question. But they actually were keeping warm in front of a space heater.\nAnd it would have been more storybook romantic if Ralph had dropped to one knee and slipped a diamond ring on Nancy's finger when he proposed. He did neither.\nThe kicker, though, was Nancy's answer — or lack thereof.\n\"I didn't give him an answer right away. I told him I needed to think about it. This was a big thing,\" Nancy said.\nRalph's feelings weren't hurt, though, because he understood Nancy's perspective.\nHe accounted for the fact that he was 25 and already had graduated from college, something Nancy was trying to achieve. Interesting fact: Ralph graduated from Wheaton College with a physics degree in 1949, one year before Nancy had arrived on that campus to start her academic career. Ralph also considered the fact that Nancy was 19 when they met.\nSo he gave Nancy time to think and to pray because both understood what a major commitment marriage is. Ralph still gently made Nancy aware of his feelings for her, though, in the months that followed. \"I was persistent,\" Ralph said.\nFlash forward to May of 1954: Ralph and Nancy are together on the front lawn of the Wheaton College campus, where Ralph pulls out an engagement ring and, once again, asks Nancy to marry him. Ralph didn't drop to one knee during the proposal — but that is OK.\n\"This was a little more romantic,\" Nancy said, laughing. \"He said all the right things and kissed me.\"\nNancy said yes, of course.\nRalph and Nancy exchanged their wedding vows at her family's church near Boston on Sept. 17, 1954 — eight days before Ralph turned 26. Ralph turns 96 on Wednesday.\n\"The joke is, I asked God to be married by 25 and He did it with eight days to spare,\" Ralph said.\nRalph and Nancy have five sons — ranging in age from 54 to 68 — and 12 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.\nAs for the reason they have been happily married for 70 years, Ralph and Nancy are quick to give God all of the glory.\nActive members of Grace Bible Chapel near Rising Sun for nearly as long as they've been married, Ralph and Nancy believe that God wanted them to meet each other and that He made it happen in an interesting, roundabout way.\nRemember the beginning of this perfect love story?\nNancy's first perceivable step toward Ralph was the disappointment that she experienced when her summer job in Boston fell through some 71 years ago, changing her plans and putting her on a new path — which led to her to Sandy Cove, which led her to Ruth, which, in turn, led her to Ralph.\nBecause Ralph and Nancy have personal relationships with God, they have been able to hold onto His guiding hand throughout their 70 years of marriage, at the highest peaks and through the deepest valleys.\n\"Following God's precepts and going to church,\" Ralph opined with little hesitation, when asked to give some keys to a long, successful marriage.\nRalph's comment prompted Nancy to quote Matthew 6:33, which essentially explains that blessings come to those who have their priorities in proper order in God's eyes. That Bible passage in the New Living Translation reads, \"Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and He will give you everything you need.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Kamala is prancing around the country trying to convince everyone that she would make a great president despite the fact that her values have not changed.\nShe has stated many times she is against funding the police, is against fracking, wants to continue with an open border and give the millions of illegals whatever they want at your expense, tax unearned income, control the food market and take away your legally purchased gun.\nIn addition she signed off on the horrific Afghanistan failure and doesn't really like Israel.\nShe is joyous, however. Let's hope Putin and the Chinese leaders do not read this paper to realize our country is the most vulnerable it has ever been not to mention increased crime and high terror alert. Support Trump.

    "content": "Meet the new boss: Artificial intelligence (AI) brings a whole new meaning to political machines\n\n September 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks | Section: News \n \n 1175\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Vic Miller is in the matrix of artificial intelligence's intersection with politics and governance.Miller ran for mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming, in August, finishing a distant fourth in the race.Miller's campaign centered on his plan to turn local governing decisions over to an AI-created system called VIC (Virtual Integrated Citizen).\nMiller's AI-run for local office drew international attention. He said views of AI are still frequently defined by dystopian science fiction movies with Orwellian outcomes.\n\"There is a learning curve that hasn't been achieved yet,\" he said.\nMiller said his AI goal is to prioritize public feedback and rational governance and rebuild public trust.\n\"I'm looking to get politicians out of democracy,\" Miller said.\nMiller said he is looking at a future AI run for Cheyenne City Council, and he expects to see others look at bringing machine learning to governance.\n\"The toothpaste is out of the tube,\" he said.\nBut Miller is concerned about who will be able to access and use AI going forward.\nHe created VIC via ChatGPT's Open AI, but was booted from that platform over using the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence technology for political purposes.\n\"What I didn't do is read their huge terms of service,\" Miller said.\nHe hopes the future of AI sits with open-source technology, rather than being controlled by large players. He said if the latter happens, it will be a \"horror show\" that will create a technological \"caste system.\"\nMiller has created the Rational Governance Alliance to foster open-source use of AI for data and public driven governance. Miller is looking to raise $10,000 to get the effort going.\nThat is a stark contrast to the big technology corporations and big money in the AI space.\nThe largest corporations in the AI space include six of the largest companies in the world (Apple, Microsoft, NVDIA, Amazon, Alphabet/Google and Meta/Facebook). They have a combined value of $15 trillion, according to CompaniesMarketCap.com.\n'SCARY GREAT'\nWhile Miller is focused on proving \"the viability\" of AI governance, for others, AI generates worries about misinformation and manipulation.\n\"It has become easier than ever to manipulate source material, create propaganda and influence narratives,\" said Isaac Mashman, founder of Mashman Consulting Group (a Little Rock, Arkansas-based consulting and branding firm), noting the amplified conservations around misinformation and \"fake news\" this campaign cycle.\nLou Steinberg, founder and managing partner of CTM Insights, a New York-based cyber research lab, said AI enable individuals to create convincing images and videos, and institutional and govern- mental actors to take their information and disinformation – dissemination to a mass production level.\n\"We've been using all open-source models, and they were great; Like, scary, great,\" Steinberg said.\nHe noted one of the AI voice fakes his group made of a foreign leader cost $20 to make and took a couple of man hours. \"It no longer takes Pentagon-level resources,\" Steinberg said.\nMiller said he spent limited money developing VIC via a $20 monthly ChatGPT subscription, but spent \"hundreds of hours\" feeding his creation documents and information.\nSteinberg said there are also productive uses, pointing to India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi used AI to translate his speeches and other campaign content into various languages and dialects.\n\"Better communication, better outreach, without subtitles. You can train these models to sound just like a voice. In fact, it only takes, you know, a couple hours of training time and a relatively small amount of video,\" Steinberg said, noting they don't look as awkward as past dubs.\nHe said there is a penchant to try to spot deep fakes and manipulated content.\n\"That's a fool's errand,\" said Steinberg, the former CTO at TD Ameritrade, stressing the focus should be on confirming what is real, rather thantrying to figure out what is fake.\nMashman said as AI technology improves and more creators adopt it, it will get harder and harder to discern \"what is real and what is fake.\"\nCody Buntain, an assistant professor of information and cybersecurity at the University of Maryland, recommends increased due diligence for election-year content.\n\"When it comes to the 2024 election, don't take a single piece of information at face value. Always consider the source and how it fits in the broader picture,\" Buntain said.\nWhile some AI applications will ban users who produce politically oriented content, there are scores of applications to choose from across the growing space.\n\"Generative AI is almost entirely unregulated, and there are countless platforms available for any person to use, so virtually anyone can create political misinformation with the help of AI,\" said Edward Tian, CEO of GPTZero, a New York-based AI detection company.\nThere are measures at the state level, especially in California, and proposals in Congress related to AI-generated content, especially so-called \"deep-fake\" pornography.\nSome content created via AI enjoys First Amendment free speech protections in the U.S., especially parody or opinion. There are instances where prosecutors could pursue AI creators under election interference or fraud statutes.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said in an August interview \"misinformation and hate speech\" do not enjoy First Amendment protections, sparking push back from speech advocates.\nScott Dylan, founder of NexaTech Ventures (a Silicon Valley-based, AI-focused venture capital firm), said laws and lawmakers are playing catch up to the AI wave.\n\"The political system, particularly candidates and officeholders, seems ill-equipped to fully grasp the depth of AI's influence,\" he said, noting that privacy and other laws will have to play catch up to all the changes.\nDespite AI's reach and potential impacts on jobs, it has not been at the forefront in the U.S. elections, including the presidential campaign.\n'DATA DRIVEN'\nDylan said AI is already a \"transformative and disruptive' force behind the political curtains.\n\"Campaigns are increasingly leveraging AI tools to personalize voter outreach, optimize resource allocation, and enhance messaging,\" Dylan said.\nHe is seeing campaigns using AI to analyze social media trends, predict voter behaviors and maximize fundraising.\n\"Political groups are using machine learning to identify funding patterns, which helps them allocate resources more efficiently,\" Dylan said.\nU.S. political campaigns are predicted to spend a record $10.7 billion on campaign ads this election (up 19% from 2020), according to research firm AdImpact LLC.\nNeil Sahota, CEO of ACSILabs, a San Diego-based AI firm, who is also an artificial intelligence advisor to the United Nations, said political and campaign operatives view AI as \"an indispensable tool\" to gain a \"competitive edge.\"\nHe points to both presidential camps and other political entities using AI for micro-targeting of voters and advertising buys — and machine-driven analyses of polling numbers.\nThe machines are also helping campaigns with speeches, social media and other content.\n\"Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms assist campaigns in generating speeches, social media posts, and advertisements that align with their messaging strategy,\" said Sahota, who sees even more AI in politics going forward, including more use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\nBIG BROTHER\nBut Sahota and Dylan also see voters concerned about privacy and groups surveilling their social media posts and online behaviors.\nThat gets back into the Big Brother dystopian worries referenced by Miller in Wyoming.\nDylan said voters might not like the sausage-making of AI-dominated politics.\n\"Many voters are wary of how their personal data is being harvested, analyzed and used by AI to predict their political leanings or behaviors,\" Dylan said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2024-09-25",
    "author": "MIke Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor",
    "content": "Breaking barriers: Access has improved, but challenges persist for voters with disabilities\n\n September 25, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIke Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: National \n \n 1280\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n People with disabilities make up 13% of the U.S. population, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and U.S. Census Bureau.That's more than 42 million people.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control has an even broader estimate, which includes more persons with cognitive and mobility issues.\nAccording to the CDC, 28.7% of Americans have physical, cognitive or mobility disabilities.\nWhether it's 13% or more than one-in-four Americans, persons with disability also make up a sizable — and frequently ignored — voting bloc as the November elections loom.\n\"All Americans have the right to vote for candidates and issues that are important to them, and people with disabilities have a lot at stake as what is decided in November can greatly impact their day-to-day lives,\" said Claire Manning, senior director of advocacy and mobilization at The Arc (an organization which helps and represents those with developmental disabilities).\nBARRIERS TO VOTINGAccording to analyses by Rutgers University, persons with disabilities made up 17.7% of the electorate in 2020.\nThat was on par with Blacks (18.5%) and more than the Hispanics' (16.5%) share in the 2020 elections, according to Rutgers.\nBut 11 million disabled adults didn't vote in the 2020 election — making up 14.2% of nonvoters in the last presidential election.\nManning said disabled voters are a big enough block to sway the tight November elections — but they face continued barriers to voting.\n\"People with disabilities have always faced unacceptable barriers to casting their vote, and they continue to in 2024,\" Manning said. \"This means they've been less likely than people without disabilities to turn out to vote in elections.\"\nAccording to Rutgers' analyses, voter turnout among persons with disability in 2020 was 8.4% lower than among persons without disabilities. Turnout rates among persons with cognitive disabilities and mobility challenges were 25% lower than the non-disabled population.\nIn some parts of the country, voters with disabilities were more than 20% less likely to vote than voters without disabilities.\nThat includes Maryland where persons with disabilities are 20.9% less likely to vote than persons without disabilities. In Delaware, people with disabilities were 14.9% less likely to vote in 2020 and those without special needs.\nEven with the Americans with Disabilities Act, which has been in place since 1992, some polling places have accessibility issues, said Anna Anderson, voting rights coordinator with Disability Rights Wisconsin.\nAnderson points to polling places at schools, churches and other locations that might have challenges with steps, hallways, parking and voters being able to adequately use accessible voting machines.\nManning said pushback against mail-in voting and ballot drop boxes over concerns about fraud work against voters with disabilities.\nShe also said guardianship laws, lack of visual and audio voting aids and restrictions on who can help a disabled person cast ballots are also impediments.\nAnderson said mail-in curbside voting and drop boxes are a big help for disabled voters. \"There are never too many options that can exist to help people vote,\" she said.\nAnderson would like to see disabled voters to be able to cast ballots from home. \"One of the things that could be the most helpful is to allow people to vote electronically from their homes,\" she said.\nAnderson said persons with disabilities can feel stigmatized voting when they draw extra attention or if poll workers are not properly trained or aware of protocols.\nLEGAL ACTIONDRWI has also filed a complaint against Thornapple Township over the Wisconsin locality's move to remove an accessible electronic voting machine for this year's election.\nOn Sept. 20, the U.S. Department of Justice also filed a complaint against Thornapple in federal court over the action saying it violates the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), a 2002 federal law that requires polling places to be equipped with at least one voting machine that is accessible to voters with disabilities during federal elections.\nThornapple has a population of approximately 800 people and is located in the northern part of Wisconsin — 126 miles from Minneapolis.\nTownship officials have not yet responded to a request for comment.\nDOJ also said it resolved a similar dispute with the town of Lawrence, the agency said.\nThat town — which along Thornapple is located in Rusk County and is about 150 miles east of Minneapolis— has agreed to install a disability accessible voting machine for the upcoming presidential election.\n\"Our democracy works when voters with disabilities have the right to vote on the same terms as any other voter,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke. \"By failing to offer accessible voting systems, Thornapple and Lawrence shirked their responsibilities under the Help America Vote Act to provide equal access to the ballot for all voters.\"\nStacy Zimmer, who served on the Lawrence township board up until earlier this month, said the accessible voting machine was not used in a state election earlier this year and he contends Wisconsin law gives localities that option.\nHe was frustrated by outside groups' involvement in the issue in the small town of approximately 400 people\nCharidy Ludescher said there will be one accessible voting machine at the township's one polling place in November.\n'REASONABLE MODIFICATIONS'Sara Kempner, campaigns and strategic collaboration coordinator with the U.S. Vote Foundation, said the HAVA law has helped improve the voting landscape for disabled Americans.\n\"The 2002 Help America Vote Act (HAVA) has stipulated that the entire process of voting — from registering to casting ballots — must be made accessible,' she said.\n\"Voters can ask for reasonable modifications. This includes requesting curbside voting, skipping the line, or the opportunity to sit in a chair if standing is difficult. If one's assigned polling location can't meet these needs, voters can ask to be reassigned to a polling location that can,\" she said.\nKempner said the accessible voting system requirement \"means voters with print disabilities may use screen readers. Voters with motor skill disabilities may use touchscreens or sip and puff devices.\"\nHAVA also allows voters with disabilities to receive voting assistance, as long as it is not their boss or union leader.\nKempner said the law has helped shrink the turnout gap between disabled and non-disabled voters.\nIn Maryland and Delaware, voters with special needs can request mail-in or absentee ballots with online assistance tools, receive help in voting in-person and there are accessible voting machines at polling places including for persons with impaired or low vision.\nIn Montana, for example, every polling place has a specialized voting machine to help voters with disabilities vote privately. Curbside voting is also available, Voters with special needs can also get assistance filling out ballots from election judges or a designated friend or relative.\nVITAL ISSUES\nStill, Kempner sees challenges.\n\"Many polling locations are not yet fully compliant with HAVA standards. Sometimes the accessible voting systems sit unopened in boxes. Poll workers have not been adequately trained on rights and procedures,\" said Kempner, stressing the need for more awareness of disability voting rights.\nAnderson said curbside voting for those with special needs is also helpful and that her group is working with nonprofits, community and churches to help disabled and mobility challenged voters get rides to the polls on Election Day.\nShe said that is easier in bigger cities such as Madison and Milwaukee.\n\"In rural areas, it's much more difficult to provide transportation,\" Anderso said.\nManning would like to see disabled voters and the issues that impact them more present during the 2024 campaign.\n\"The disability vote is powerful. Yet all too often, people with disabilities and the issues vital to them and their loved ones are absent from candidate debates, interviews, and media coverage,\" she said.\nManning said the general public is \"overwhelmingly unaware of the experiences of people with disabilities in this country\" and how elected officials approach various programs have big impacts.\n\"They decide how government programs like Medicaid, Social Security, and Special Education, which are vital to the independence and futures of people with disabilities, function and are funded,\" Manning said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Encounter with Jimmy Carter provides memories\n\n October 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LINDA EVANS | Section: Columns \n \n 724\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Editor's note: This column originally appeared in the Star Democrat on Oct. 17, 2021. It is repeated here after Jimmy Carter celebrated his 100th birthday this week.It was the mid-seventies and I was a young Washington, D.C., Republican staffer with the rare opportunity to work as a personal assistant for the Honorable and Mrs. George Romney (Mitt Romney's parents).\nPretty exciting for a farm girl from the Eastern Shore of Maryland. When the Romneys invited me out to formal occasions, as a member of their staff, I was occasionally mistaken for Mitt's sister, Lynn.\nIt was cherry blossom time, and a longtime friend who drove me to the Tidal Basin that day happened to be an employee of the Secret Service. As we walked around the Tidal Basin, a long, black limousine pulled up and my friend yelled, \"It's the president.\"\nI nonchalantly responded, \"The President of what? What company?\"\nHe repeated, \"It's President Carter! It's Carter!\nAs a government employee, he knew to position us near where the president's car door would open, with the idea of taking a photograph of the president, if possible. When President Carter emerged from the limousine, I was indeed one of the first in line, and even though I was a staunch Romney Republican, I did what any American would do, outstretched my hand and shook the hand of the president of the United States. Many would be lost for words at that point, but I somehow found the presence of mind to say sincerely, \"Thank you for being our president.\"\nPresident Carter, apparently touched by my sincerity, thanked me. My friend had his old Polaroid camera with him and asked the president if he would mind posing for a photo. The president quickly agreed, and then said to no one in particular: \"Isn't she beautiful?\"\nWhat a compliment for me. I smiled for my friend's camera and that was the end of the exchange; my friend and I were off to tour the cherry blossoms with hundreds, possibly thousands of others that evening.\nThe Polaroids turned out so-so, but my friend, being politically minded, said he had seen White House photographers there. In fact, since I had my new black velour jacket over my arm, he said he felt the Secret Servicemen were carefully watching me for the president's safety.\n\"Why don't you call the White House and see if any of them got you on film?\" he suggested. What an outlandish thought, but tempting. The next day, I looked up the White House switchboard number and hesitantly dialed 212-456-1414, and asked for the White House press secretary, as I had been instructed by my friend.\n\"Hello, this is Karl Schumaker,\" the voice on the phone answered with a German accent. Since I am also of German descent, we had something in common. I said, \"Sir, you won't believe it, but the president of the United States told me I was beautiful yesterday at the Tidal Basin. \"\nPause.\n\"What were you wearing?\" he asked.\n\"I was wearing a pink jumpsuit and pink scarf.\"\n\"You are beautiful,\" Karl said. \"I have three photographs of you. Would you like me to mail them to you or would you like to come to the White House and pick them up this week?\"\nI chose the date of Thursday that week because my sister would be in town, and we not only got autographed photos that day, but a tour of the Oval Office and presidential memorabilia. I showed the photos to our parents and then I filed them in my big, old file cabinet, with only one of the photos on my office wall, seen by almost no one. I'm still a Romney Republican and always will be, but also a Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter fan.\nAnd a fan of someone else in the White House, the Press Secretary Karl Schumaker, who would teach the importance of customer service and taking extra time out to make memories that have lasted over 40 years. It was President Carter's birthday on Oct. 1 (he turned 100), and he received the Nobel Peace Prize also on Oct. 11 (in 2002), which reminded me of this occasion.\n\"To this day, Jimmy Carter looks back on a life of faith and service, and ahead to a more peaceful world,\" Mark K. Updegrove wrote in an article titled \"Building a Better World,\" found in in Parade Magazine, Feb. 18, 2018. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings: Where we end up\n\n October 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: PAUL TWINING Caroline County Coordinator, National Day of Prayer | Section: Columns \n \n 293\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Please take a moment out of your busy schedule to ask yourself a very pertinent question: \"Will the road of life on which I am traveling take me to where I want to go?\"Of course, I am not thinking of a destination along the way, but of the final consequence of how I have chosen to live my life. Proverbs 14:12 says, \"There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.\"\nThe death spoken of in this verse is that of an eternal separation from God, so I dare not just shrug my shoulders and say, \"Whatever.\"\nWhat resolve is God looking for in a person's response to Him? The Scriptures make it clear that His approval of me is not based on the production of good things that I do in my lifespan. (Isaiah 64:6)\nDavid in Psalm 51:17 informs us that \"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.\" God is looking for people who humbly admit their sin, and then turn in faith to Jesus for His forgiveness. (John 3:16)\nColossians 1:13 tells us that Jesus came to rescue us from Satan's domain and to transfer us into His kingdom. This provision puts us on the road that leads to a forever home in heaven with all who believe in what Jesus has done for us.\nOur faith is not based on what we have done, but on what God has done on our behalf. John 3:1–21 is a great read for anyone who wants to be sure of being on the right road. May God give us honesty of heart and mind to evaluate where the road we are on ends up. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings: Teaching the faith\n\n October 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: The Rev. David Casey-Motley Immanuel Lutheran Church | Section: Columns \n \n 285\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Christianity is full of mystery, and yet, in another way, it's simple.The truth, in summary, could be placed on a page. Christ, born of Mary, is God's eternal Son. There is one God, three persons, Father, Son, Holy Spirit. Christ died as a payment for our sins, satisfying justice, a propitiation for our sins. Neither the works of the saints nor our own works in any way contribute to our salvation, which is wholly won by our Lord. As Christ's rose from the dead, so shall we, and when we rise we will see our returning Lord face to face. All of this is attested to in the scriptures, which are God's word.\nAnd then, yes, baptism brings infants into the family of God, making them heirs of salvation. Why would we think that baby boys are somehow Israelites via circumcision, but our own baptized children are not Christian?\nBy instinct, then by our Lord's teaching about children. The Lord's Supper is the true body and blood, and brings to us the work of the cross, bringing us into communion with Christ. In baptism, we become members of Christ's body, and in the Supper, we take Christ's body into ourselves.\nAll of this is to say, doctrine is one, and it is whole, and there is no barrier in understanding. This is not a matter of depending upon a magisterium, for the scriptures are clear. I am happy to teach this stuff, but it is not so high or deep that you or anyone cannot get it. For it is God's Word that does the work. It is He who saves, forgives, and gives grace. It is His and His alone. May it ever be so. Amen. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Maryland unions seek influence in election beyond membership numbers\n\n October 16, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KATHARINE WILSON Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1329\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n WASHINGTON — When Darlene Butler-Jones, a 66 year-old shop steward for Giant, walks into a store, people listen.Butler-Jones is part of a group of grocery store workers assigned by her union — United Food & Commercial Workers Union Local 400 — to explain the organization's political endorsements to her fellow employees.\nAs she walks through the store, talking to employees at cash registers and counters, Butler-Jones hears their concerns about fair scheduling, retirement, and dignity in the workplace.\n\"People want change,\" Butler-Jones said.\nAs Democrats and Republicans argue over which party truly represents working people and who will secure their vote, Maryland union leaders say it's not about party, it's about policy.\nCapital News Service spoke to six Maryland-based union presidents and political leaders to better understand how union endorsements work and the impact of unions on politics in Maryland.\nWhat the unions wantMaryland union leaders said they are focused on improving the lives of their members, which most said comes down to their ability to organize.\nDonna S. Edwards is the president of the Maryland State and D.C. AFL-CIO, a federation of more than 50 unions.\nTo get union backing, Edwards said, politicians need to support the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, commonly known as the PRO-Act, and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, a bill to guarantee the right to organize for public sector employees.\nThe PRO-Act, a bill promoted by the labor movement, aims to protect the right to join and form a union by prohibiting common employer intimidation tactics and requiring employees represented by collective bargaining units to pay their fair share of representation fees.\nThis Congress, 263 Democrats, three Republicans and two independents sponsored the PRO-Act. The bill has not been put up for a vote in either chamber. The Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act has seen no action.\nTo get an endorsement from the Maryland State and D.C. AFL-CIO, candidates must first fill out surveys detailing their stances on nearly every issue in some way related to labor. Then top candidates are interviewed by union members and leaders before a final selection is made.\nThe top three factors union officials making the AFL-CIO endorsements consider are the candidate's views on issues, viability and voting record, according to Kayla Mock, the political and legislative director for the local food and commercial workers union, which falls under the state's AFL-CIO.\nUnions are focused on fundamental issues important to working people, like healthcare, child care, and the right to organize, Mock said. These issues, many union leaders say, typically favor Democratic candidates.\nIn the 2024 election, the Maryland State and D.C. AFL-CIO only endorsed Democratic candidates for Congress.\n\"I tell my members this all the time, please bring me a pro-labor Republican. I would love to talk to them. I would love to endorse them,\" Mock said.\nWhile many major unions in Maryland endorsed Democrats for local and federal office, as they have continuously done for decades, this isn't true among all unions and union endorsements aren't always followed by rank-and-file members.\nMaryland-based Teamsters Joint Councils 55 and 62 endorsed the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, breaking from the national union's decision to not endorse a candidate. However, in a Teamsters member poll from July 24 to Sept. 15, 49.4% of Maryland members wanted the national union to endorse Trump, compared to 46.5% for Harris.\nIn the 2020 election, around 60% of union households voted for President Joe Biden, Axios reported.\nJason Ascher, the Mid-Atlantic Pipe Trades Association's political director, said he has some union members who will vote for former President Donald Trump regardless of what Ascher and other union leaders recommend.\nThis trend, particularly among the building trades, Ascher said, followed the 1994 implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement — a pact among the United States, Mexico and Canada — that the Economic Policy Institute, a non-profit think tank affiliated with the labor movement, says led to the loss of thousands of union jobs.\nThe trade agreement, combined with social issues promoted by Democrats, pro-gun attitudes and the populism of Trump, created hard-line Republican voters within the union base, Ascher said. Now he and others are working at the local level to draw more of their union members back into voting for endorsed Democrats.\n\"It's a fight every day,\" Ascher said. \"We have to convince our members, at least in the trades, that the Democrats are the ones helping us right now.\"\nRyan Whittington, the president of the Ocean City Career Firefighters Paramedics Association, leads one of a dozen first-responder unions endorsing the Senate candidacy of former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican.\nWhen his union's board of directors decides to get involved in a state or local election, Whittington said, they open up a poll to every member of the union to select their preferred candidate. In the 2024 Maryland Senate race, Whittington said only two members of his union, which has more than 70 people, did not want the union to endorse Hogan.\n\"Within our local we have individuals who are Democrats, we have individuals who are Republicans,\" Whittington said. \"For us, it's about looking at a candidate who is going to listen to the needs of our firefighters, our public safety officials, and make sure that they have our backs.\"\nWho looks at union endorsementsWhile union members made up just 10.7% of the Maryland working population in 2023, union leaders say their impact stretches beyond their membership.\n\"We are members of the same communities that we're working in and living in. We're the next door neighbors,\" said Paul Lemle, the president of the Maryland State Education Association. \"It's natural that people trust us.\"\nUnion popularity has seen record highs nationwide in recent years. In an August Gallup poll, 70% of Americans said they approved of labor unions.\nPart of this increase can be attributed to younger Americans.\nAround 88% of people under 30 supported unions in an August 2023 poll by the Democratic polling and research firm GBAO, conducted on behalf of the AFL-CIO.\nMock said she has seen first-hand a rise in young people embracing unions.\nHer chapter of UFCW — which includes 35,000 workers across six states and the District of Columbia — held two successful union membership votes for cannabis dispensary workers within one week in Montgomery County, Maryland.\nMock, who was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, said this attention from younger voters could be behind the Democratic strategy to boost the union vote.\n\"We're kind of the cool kids club,\" Mock said. \"Democrats, very smartly, are going 'oh yeah, we actually do need labor.'\"\nIn the 2022 statewide election, Maryland State Education Association members voted at a 24 percentage point rate higher than the rest of the state, according to the director of the union's political and legislative affairs, Samantha Zwerling. In every election, she said, politicians endorsed by the education association have more than an 80% chance of winning.\n\"Unions are inherently part of the democratic fabric of our society...That's what's meant by freedom of assembly and freedom of speech… they encourage participation and democracy,\" Lemle, the union president, said.\nWhat unions want the public to know\"Unions are not these big bosses. Look at me. I'm the union,\" Edwards, the Maryland State and D.C. AFL-CIO president, said.\nThe talkative, charismatic union leader was sitting in an emptying event space during the Democratic National Convention in August, showing her union friends in the Maryland delegation a photo of her holding a \"Union Yes!\" sign during the convention the night before.\nEdwards, a social-worker by trade, grew up in a union home. She first joined a union while working for the Baltimore City Department of Social Services in the 1970s.\nHer union leadership was able to get a pay raise for her unit of social workers — kicking off her passion for labor activism.\nThe union \"is the only institution, in my view, that holds the line on a democracy in this country,\" Edwards said. \"It allows for workers and their families to be involved in the political process, but it also gives you the financial security… to be able to be a contributing part of your community.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In fact, many people have complained to Sheriff Gamble since Maryland election law is being violated. As a good citizen and duly elected law enforcement officer, the sheriff wrote a letter to the election director questioning the intent of violating the law.For months, the election director has been dodging questions made by the public and apparently has been manipulating the law; however, this issue of flagrant abuse of the law has gone national. As anticipated, our Maryland state attorney general finally decided to weigh in. The Attorney General sent a letter to duly elected Sheriff reminding him that, as sheriff, he has nothing to do with enforcing election law.\nOf course, we citizens of all political parties have a responsibility to ensure fair and safe elections, and the sheriff, unlike the attorney general, was properly amplifying the disbelief of concerned citizens.\nIntentionally breaking the law? Are you really?\nAfter the slap, the attorney general quoted the law, which states each polling place shall have an equal number of election judges from Democrat and Republican parties. He then says that, although that is true at each polling place, the total number of judges need not be equal between the two parties. What? Where are these unequal judges on duty if not at a polling place?\nIn past years, the people of Talbot County were told by the director of the Board of Elections that there weren't enough Republicans who signed up to be election judges. Nonsense.\nIf judge totals must be equal at every polling place, then the totals across the county will be equal. There are now 61 Democrats, 53 Republicans and 10 \"other.\"\nIn our 10 precincts, only four abide by the law. It appears that information has been withheld from Talbot voters.\nWhat part of equal does the election director Tammy Stafford and the Talbot election board not understand?\nMARYANN JUDY\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

For the holidays, there is a big effort by the food pantries to provide festive meals.\n\"It is always so special. People line up long in advance because it is so unusual,\" Poe said.\nCoordinating holiday plans for the food pantries begins months in advance, she said.\n\"The one (at the Senior Center) has already gotten their meals for Thanksgiving and Christmas. At Christmas it will come from The (Maryland) Food Bank,\" Poe said, describing the plan for one of the providers the organization works with.\nGiven the volume of food needed, the pantries get it at bulk prices and never buy from a supermarket. Sometimes donors help out.\n\"The other place is Mountaire Farms. It gives away thousands of free Thanksgiving meals. They are sending the Senior Center 100 boxes. All the pantries have to plan early where they are getting their meals from,\" Poe said.\nThey also get food from the Maryland Food Bank, a nonprofit hunger relief organization. Items from the food bank have to be purchased by the local providers, which Poe said gives citizens who want to help an opportunity to participate.\n\"We prefer cash (donations) because our money goes a long way,\" Poe said. \"... The larger pantries spend about $7,000 a month, so they have to raise that every month.\"\nSt. Marks and St. Vincent dePaul food pantries use funds from their associated thrift shops to support feeding the community. Some other providers have grant writers to try to raise money.\nAlthough the pantries take food from the public, it is more difficult to integrate it into their program than cash donations, Poe said.\nPoe says the best bet is to cut a check to any of the nine food pantries in Talbot County — CarePacks, Talbot County Early Head Start, Brookletts Place, St. Michaels Community Center, St. Marks United Methodist, BAAM (Building African American Minds), Talbot County Local Care Team, WIC (Women Infants and Children) and The Talbot Family Network. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Divided by economics, nationality, race, social status, and in the U.S.A, specifically during this time of national elections, political affiliation.\nIt seems impossible to get through this cycle without increasing venom, hatred or suspicion.

As never before, the admonition given to us in the Bible found in Romans 12:18 seems to be worth our consideration.\n\"If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.\"\nWe don't have to agree on every position, but that doesn't make us enemies. We don't have to have the same world view, but that doesn't have to also create division between us. Let's agree that we are a diverse community with different views but linked together with a common thread, and let brotherly love continue. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is not a God-given right, it's a right detailed by our founding father's document to orchestrate a democratic world to exist and prosper in. And it's not about who you vote for, more importantly it's that you take the time to process choices and select a candidate you would be happy with in hopes others feel the same and provide enough support to move your candidate forward. Your candidate may or may not win.I shudder to think at what the founding fathers would say about the word smithing, arbitrary use of language, misinterpretation of the truth, and just some outright tomfoolery that some candidates show. I suspect that was not their original goal.\nBut why is this all so divisive? Why are our human choices creating chasms of space between people, friends and family?\nMy perspective comes from a small, rare point — I am a political refugee from Cuba. My father was in a prosperous country with lots of acceptance until the Russians made friends with the Communist Party in Cuba. My father was told he would be going to Czechoslovakia to teach the Russians how to fix cars. It was the second time they came for him.\n\"No thanks\" was not an option. A friend from UNESCO smuggled my parents into the American Embassy and helped fake some documents so we could leave the country.\nCome hang out in our communist world and see how popular it feels.\nWith $75, me, my sister, my dad's parents and my mom and dad flew to Miami to start over. Crowded living conditions, hard work ethic, no handouts were the beliefs we followed. Life of service — how can we help you? — was my mother's driving core belief. Ny uncles served in the Army to give back the country that accepted us.\nWe turned down relocation efforts around the U.S. because we would work to create our own prosperous world. We earned our keep each and every day. Our friends who were doctors and engineers pumped gas and sold newspapers to help generate money for the family until they could get an education and be certified to do what they did in Cuba.\nThe world was OK. We were tolerant of each other. Could we say that today? Should we say that today?\nI visit the old neighborhood occasionally to remind me of my roots — the upstairs apartment over the garage that housed all of us, the old Sts. Peter and Paul church where I did my first Holy Communion, and the local markets where we shopped before the supermarkets existed.\nPeople knew of you and helped you. We never fought over who to vote for. The most contentious conversations were the ones debating when the regime in Cuba would fall and how all would return to how it was. But we were still together.\nWhat happened?\nToday we can't put the genie back in the bottle. We are where we are and need to move forward. We need to find more middle ground and help all of us prosper. We need to vote and be tolerant.\nPlease join me in exercising your constitutional right on Nov. 5. And let's all be more tolerant. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Gedman St. Luke’s Global Methodist Church | Section: Columns \n \n 312\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n While the world and its ways are always subject to change at the whims of those in control, God and the Bible are not subject to change.In a world of seemingly endless lies, we must remember that truth is not subject to new whims or reimagining. It is not up for negotiation. The truth does not change. It is objective, not subjective.\nWhen reading the Bible, the truth is often disclosed by the definite article \"the.\" It is stated definitively and singularly. One does not have to connect bits and pieces of a verse here and a verse there to find the truth, it is discernibly clear.\nFor example, Jesus said, \"I am the way and the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father except by me.\" Notice that there are four statements of absolute truth in that sentence all highlighted by the definite article.\nJesus did not say, \"I am a way.\" There are not many ways to God. Also, rather importantly, the definite article is set before \"Father\" as well. This highlights the fact that there is only one God the Father, not many gods.\nTruth is not a series of ideas pulled, redacted, edited and restated from manifold sources. One will not discover the truth of God through the study of comparative religions or philosophies. It is found only in the Bible. There is but one way of salvation; Jesus the Christ. (Note my inclusion of the definite article for Jesus is the one and only Messiah).\nUltimately, the Bible is the perfect standard of truth. It defines truth as being absolutely reliable and enduring. The reason is quite simple: Authentic, biblical truth is inextricably linked to the dependable, unchanging character of God.\nYou can trust everything He says; He never lies; He always keeps His Word; He's faithful to all His promises. Thanks be to God we have the Bible. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It's not a season everyone likes or voted for but the season is changing. For some it's better, for some it's worse. For some it's good news, for some it's bad news.Your perspective colors your season. For example, if you love autumn then you have enjoyed the current season in much of America. You haven't enjoyed it if you've been in the path of a hurricane, but you've enjoyed it if you live in most any other place in America. We've had a dry fall season, but it has been beautiful. Many dread the winter months, while some welcome cool weather over the long months of dry hot weather. If you live in Southern Arizona, you are ready for some cooler weather.\nPolitical seasons are hard on our nation. We've been immersed in political advertisements for months. The presidential campaign has gone on forever. We are so ready to move forward. For many in America this doesn't feel good while others think it's great.\nSeasons come and seasons go. No season lasts forever. There is always a new season around the corner. It's best for all of us if we can make the best of whatever the season of life is at the time. Winter or summer, make the most of the season. Youth or old age, they pass by so enjoy your season. Small children or adult children, love them and roll with the seasons. Young parents or old parents, roll with the seasons. Making great money or making less money, roll with the seasons.\nTry to make the best of your current season in life. It's not always easy. We don't like the seasons of life when we are sick or even dying. Some seasons are difficult and even harsh and cruel, but they come to us all if we live long enough. So, enjoy the good seasons, tread water or make the best of what seems to be a bad season because in time in some way the season will change. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "date": "2024-11-09",
    "author": "DAVID REEL",
    "content": "Infrastructure spending needs to use common sense\n\n November 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 730\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n In late October, President Biden visited Baltimore to announce that the Maryland Port Administration will receive $147 million in federal funds for infrastructure improvements.During his visit, Biden did not acknowledge or address serious issues with another much larger federally funded infrastructure project in Baltimore.\nThat project is construction of a new $6 billion Frederick Douglass Tunnel in Baltimore for Amtrak, America's quasi-public rail passenger company.\nThe current tunnel is over 150 years old and is a major bottleneck on Amtrak's high-speed northeast corridor passenger rail service between Boston and Washington, D.C.\nAs a long-time, staunch supporter of Amtrak, I understand the need for this long overdue tunnel replacement project.\nThat said, I am stunned and disheartened by how much this project has been mismanaged.\nIn early October, Amtrak's Office of Inspector General released a scathing report on this project.\nThe mission of Amtrak's inspector general is simple and straightforward.\nConduct and supervise independent and objective audits, inspections, evaluations and investigations relating to agency programs and operations; promote economy, effectiveness and efficiency within the agency; prevent and detect fraud, waste and abuse in agency programs and operations.\nConsistent with their mission, in the inspector general's report on the Baltimore tunnel project, they noted that Amtrak did not establish a program management structure early enough. As a result, they struggled to complete the necessary planning in scheduling, communications, document management and risk management for this project on a timely basis.\nThe inspector general criticized Amtrak's initial assignment for project management responsibility of a $6 billion dollar project to a single individual.\nEventually, the program team was expanded to seven members, but five told Office of Inspector General auditors that they were still overwhelmed by their workload.\nAmtrak officials have since acknowledged staffing was insufficient and said the Capital Delivery team should have been staffed before it received responsibility for the program.\nAmtrak later decided to hire a \"delivery partner\" to provide management and oversight, but that contractor wasn't engaged until the spring of this year. Amtrak officials agreed that the decision \"should have been made earlier\" to \"maximize the benefits the delivery partner was intended to provide.\" As a result, the new contractor has to plan a management structure as it also prepares for construction.\nThe Office of Inspector General report made three recommendations:\nComplete program management planning for the tunnel project.Establish processes to ensure the a project's management structure is established early enough to produce strong oversight for the life of the project.Establish processes to ensure program teams have sufficient staff before projects are assigned to the Capital Delivery department.\nAmtrak management, in their response to the report, agreed with the recommendations and outlined how it is acting to meet those goals.\nThe inspector general's report concludes the project now \"faces a significantly increased risk of cost overruns and additional delays as it proceeds into major construction.\" The report does not include projections for future cost overruns and additional delays.\nOn a $6 billion construction project, one thing is almost certain. Cost overruns and completion delays will likely be substantial. As a result, funds needed for other Amtrak service improvements to increase ridership and reduce their government subsidies will not be available.\nI am sure this colossal mismanagement of federal funding by Amtrak is not unique.\nUnfortunately, conventional thinking is public infrastructure projects completion delays and cost overruns are standard operating procedure. In other words, this is the way it has always been and the way it will always be.\nThat thinking needs to change especially when the federal budget deficit is at record levels, currently at $1.83 trillion and growing.\nFormer U.S. Sen. Everett Dirksen once observed, \"A billion dollars here and a billion dollars there and pretty soon you are talking real money.\"\nMany Americans are carefully monitoring their budgets and adjusting their spending habits on a regular, even daily, basis in order to pay their bills for basic living expenses.\nGoing forward, we need and deserve elected and appointed officials at every level of government to take appropriate steps to ensure funding for all government funded infrastructure improvement projects is spent efficiently and effectively.\nThey need to address the fact the current audit process is largely reactive, not proactive.\nConcurrently, government project managers must be fully aware of and committed to best practice project management policies and procedures prior to and during large scale and complex infrastructure improvement projects.\nIt is common sense to help ensure things go right in the first place as opposed to learning what went wrong after the fact. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Not only do I love it, but I had a request from one of Mom's great granddaughters who had heard about it and wanted to see a repeat. This column fits right in with your holiday dessert planning, so enjoy.GIVING THANKSToday I am starting my column by giving thanks for the 52 years I was blessed with having one of the most influential women in my life — my mother. Mom was born on July 4, 1911, and died on Nov. 18, 1997 after a brief illness.\nMom graduated at the age of 16 after completing 11 years of school, as required in those times. By the age of 21, she had married my father; bought a farm; built a house, barn and chicken house; and was raising hogs and cows along with growing truck crops for market.\nDid I forget to mention my parents throughout the years had nine sons and two daughters?\nWhat a wonderful family life we had — the most complaining I ever heard her say was, \"How many more can we feed at the table, 'cause company is coming or get them fresh eggs from the hen house for breakfast or I will eat after everyone else has eaten.'\"\nLaura Hudson Hitchens was not a woman to back down from whatever life handed her — she made the most out of a little and asked for nothing in return from anyone. I can never fill her shoes, but I have never given up trying.\nMom loved to cook anything, and she never really had a favorite food to cook, but her desserts were loved by everyone as she made the best pie crust ever. And those biscuits came in a close second! Let's make some Thanksgiving desserts today.\nFOOL PROOF PIE CRUST4 cups flour, 1 1/3 cup shortening, 2 tsp salt, 1 tbsp sugar, 1 egg, 1 tbsp vinegar, 1/2 cup water.\nMix flour with shortening, salt and sugar. Set aside. Beat together egg, vinegar and water. Begin sprinkling the dry and wet ingredients together. Turn ingredients together with a fork. Chill 15 minutes or longer in the refrigerator before working into pie crust. Remove from the refrigerator and break into portions. Work the dough on a floured surface until smooth and proceed to roll out into the appropriate size crust you need.\nEASY PIE DOUGH1 cup shortening, 1/2 cup boiling water, 3 cups flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt.\nCream together shortening with boiling water. Beat well. Add flour, baking powder and salt. Mix lightly and roll out on a floured surface.\nPUMPKIN PIE2 cups pumpkin, 5 tbsp flour, 1/2 cup white sugar, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spices, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 3 cups milk, egg whites.\nMix pumpkin, flour, sugars, salt and spices. Add milk. Beat egg whites and fold into the mixture last. Pour into an unbaked pie shell and bake in a preheated 450-degree oven for the first 15 minutes and then 350 degrees until toothpick inserted comes out clean — maybe 20 to 25 minutes.\nSWEET POTATO PIE3 cups mashed sweet potatoes, 2 cups evaporated milk, 4 eggs, 2 1/4 cups sugar, 2 tsp lemon extract, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp baking powder, 1 tbsp milk, 1 cup coconut (optional)\nCombine sweet potatoes, evaporated milk, eggs and sugar. Beat at a high speed and then add lemon extract and vanilla. Then mix baking powder with 1 tablespoon milk and add to potato mixture. Add coconut, if desired. Mix well and put in two 9-inch baking pans (pie pans) and bake in a preheated 375-degree oven for one hour.\nAPPLE PIE4 cups peeled and diced apples, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 cup half and half.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. Prepare pastry for one two crust 9-inch pie. Place one crust on the pie plate. Mix apples, lemon juice, sugar, flour, salt and half and half. Mix well and pour into the unbaked pie crust. Cover with the remaining crust and cut slits in it, seal and flute the edges. Bake until the crust is brown, and juice begins to bubble — 50 to 60 minutes. You can place small strips of foil around the edges of the crust, before baking, to keep edges from burning. Remove foil for the last 15 minutes of baking. You can also add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.\nOLD FASHIONED MINCE PIE28-oz jar prepared mincemeat, 1/12 cups diced apples.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place one unbaked pie crust on a 9-inch pie plate. Mix mincemeat with apples. Pour this mixture into the pie crust. Cover the top with another unbaked pie crust. Flute edge and seal. Cut slits into top crust and bake for 40 to 45 minutes.\nNO ROLL PIE CRUST3 cups flour, 2 tsp sugar, 1 tsp salt, 1 cup vegetable oil, 1/3 cup milk.\nMix ingredients gently to combine. Divide in half and place each half of dough in a regular 9-inch pie pan. Pat out gently Push pastry up the sides and form a nice edge with your thumb and finger. Prick pastry on the bottom to prevent bubbling of the pastry during baking. Bake in a preheated 350-degree oven with your favorite filling or bake empty — let cool and add your favorite filling.\nNEVER FAIL CRUST5 cups flour, 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp baking powder, 2 cups shortening, 1 egg, water, 1/4 cup vinegar.\nCombine flour, salt, baking powder and shortening until coarse crumbs. In a measuring cup beat egg lightly with a fork and add enough water to equal 3/4 cup. Add vinegar and slightly beat with a fork again. Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and stir just to make a ball. Roll out shells for your pies. I found that with this recipe if you place the shell in the pie pan and freeze slightly then the shell does not shrink during baking.\nIMPOSSIBLE COCONUT PIE4 eggs, 2 cups sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 2 cups milk, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 can flaked coconut.\nIn a blender, mix together ingredients. Pour into two 9-inch pans, lightly greased. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until set.\nPECAN BARSFor crust: 1 cups unsalted butter at room temperature, 1/2 cups packed brown sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour.\nFor filling: 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces; 1 cup packed dark brown sugar, 1/3 cups honey, 2 tbsp bourbon, 2 tbsp heavy cream, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 1 tsp pure vanilla extract, 3 cups pecan halves chopped roughly.\nHeat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly coat 9- by 13-in baking pan with cooking spray. Line with parchment, leaving an overhang on two long sides; spray parchment.\nTo make crust, using an electric mixer, beat butter, brown sugar and salt until light and fluffy. Reduce mixer speed and gradually mix in flour until small clumps form. Press into the bottom of the prepared pan. Using a fork, poke holes all over then bake until light golden brown, 20 to 25 min. Let cool while making filling.\nFor filling, in a small saucepan on low, combine butter, sugar, honey, bourbon, heavy cream and salt. Increase heat and bring to a boil; boil for 2 min. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla, then fold in pecans.\nPour mixture over baked crust, return to oven and bake until nuts are golden brown and edges are bubbling, 25 to 30 min. Let cool completely in the pan, then use overhangs to transfer to a cutting board and cut into pieces.\nAPPLE PEAR CRISP1/2 cup old-fashioned oats, 3 small Gala or Empire apples (peeled and chopped), 2 medium pears (peeled and chopped), 1 tbsp water, 2 tsp brown sugar, 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1/3 cup chunky sweetened peanut butter, 3 tbsp whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup fat-free whipped cream.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees. Spread the oats in a single layer on a jelly-roll pan. Toast them 5 to 8 minutes or until golden brown, stirring once halfway through. In a 4-quart saucepan, combine the apples, pears, water, sugar, cinnamon, and ginger. Cook on medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 12 minutes or until sugar dissolves and fruit softens. Remove from the heat and stir in the cranberries. Divide the mixture among 6 shallow 12- to 16-ounce baking dishes.\nIn a medium bowl, combine the oats, peanut butter, and flour. Rub the mixture between your fingers to form small clumps then sprinkle it over the fruit mixture in the baking dishes. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until browned and bubbling. To serve, top each crisp with 1 tablespoon of whipped cream. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

HINES Eternal Life Ministries | Section: Columns \n \n 436\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As I sit here recovering from a lung infection, I am reminded that I still have a reason to be thankful to God for all He has done for me and all that He is to me. I am led to reflect upon Psalm 138:1-8.This is a psalm of David, and it was sung by him as a declaration of high praise unto Almighty, God our heavenly Father, for His excellent greatness. It is a bold statement made by the psalmist because it expresses the human soul's deep need to worship the creator and articulates the heartfelt sentiment that God alone is worthy of all our praise.\nDavid says, \"I will praise the Lord with my whole heart, that means with a heart that is fully committed to pouring out the oil of gratitude as a sacrifice of thanksgiving upon the altar of God. I will praise my God with all that I have in me, and I will do it in the presence of everything and everybody that this world has exalted, to show forth my estimation that there is no God like Yahweh.\"\nDavid further declares that he will always turn toward the God of his salvation to worship Him because of His lovingkindness and for His truth.\nAnd we can bear witness to that, for we know that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son so that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. In a world of lies and deceit, this is the one truth that can cut through every falsehood that Satan has deceived us with concerning ourselves and bring us into the marvelous light of the Gospel.\nDavid said of God, \"in the day that I cried out to you, you answered me and gave me strength deep down in my soul.\" How many of you know what it's like to cry out to God during your time of troubles and God answered your prayers and gave you strength to run on to see what the end was going to be? That should make you feel grateful that God, Almighty took the time to incline His ear to hear your cries and deliver you from your distress.\nIn the light of all the wonderful things that God has bestowed upon us and considering the magnitude of all that He alone is, David just could not help but to give our God all praise.\nAnd when you and I look at our lives after all that the Lord has done for us, we too should not be able to withhold our praise from Him and shout Hallelujah. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "How to use up every one of your Thanksgiving leftovers\n\n November 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Sarah Jenkins Food Drink Life | Section: News \n \n 1055\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As you prepare for your Thanksgiving feast, it's natural to focus on the big meal. But have you thought about how you'll handle that mountain of Thanksgiving leftovers that often follow? Rather than letting extra turkey, mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce go to waste, why not reimagine them into new, exciting dishes?With a little creativity, those leftovers can be transformed into fresh meals that extend the joy of Thanksgiving long after the day is over. From turkey sliders to mashed potato cakes, these ideas will help you turn your post-feast extras into a series of mouthwatering meals that keep your Thanksgiving flavors alive while reducing food waste.\nWhy it's important to use up those leftovers\nThanksgiving is a celebration of togetherness and gratitude. However, it's also one of the biggest food waste days of the year. According to ReFED, a nonprofit working to combat food waste based in the United States, Americans will waste approximately 316 million pounds of food during Thanksgiving in 2024 alone. \"This represents more than $556 million worth of groceries thrown away in a single day — a sharp contrast to the spirit of gratitude the day is meant to embody,\" said Selena Mao, manager at ReFED.\nWith millions of pounds of uneaten food tossed annually, finding creative ways to repurpose leftovers isn't just practical — it's a small step toward cutting down on food waste. By giving your Thanksgiving staples a second life, you can help minimize waste while continuing to enjoy your holiday feast in fresh and delicious ways. Here's how to use every last bit of your Thanksgiving leftovers.\nTurkey\nTurkey is undoubtedly the centerpiece of Thanksgiving, and there are plenty of ways to repurpose it in tasty, inventive dishes. Consider making turkey cranberry sliders, a sweet and savory option that pairs leftover turkey with cranberry sauce on soft Hawaiian rolls. These sliders make for a perfect snack or light meal. Adding leftover turkey to soups is also an easy way to repurpose this Thanksgiving staple. Turkey and rice soup or turkey noodle soup are both classics that are easy to prepare and ideal for cozy nights.\nMake turkey enchiladas to give your leftovers a Mexican-inspired makeover. For taco lovers, leftover turkey tacos are a quick and delicious option that brings a bit of spice to the table.\nIf you love traditional chicken pot pie, switch things up by using turkey for a fresh twist on this classic comfort food. Simply combine your leftover turkey with a mix of fresh or frozen vegetables, then stir in a creamy sauce made from a butter and flour roux, milk and broth. Top the mixture with a buttery pie crust, bake until golden and bubbly, and you've got an easy, delicious meal that's perfect for repurposing leftovers.\nFinally, don't forget about the turkey carcass. Use it to whip up a flavorful turkey stock that can be a base for future soups and stews. Simply toss your turkey bones in water with some herbs and veggies — chopped onion, carrots, garlic, celery and thyme are favorites — and allow to simmer for about three to four hours over the stove for a flavorful homemade stock.\nPumpkin\nPumpkin isn't just for pies — there are many creative ways to use it. You can transform leftover pumpkin into a savory pumpkin quiche, stir it into oatmeal or yogurt for a boost of flavor or even blend it into a creamy batch of mac and cheese. Adding it to a hearty pumpkin chili for a warm, satisfying meal that's full of fall flavor is also a hit.\nMashed potatoes\nBasic mashed potatoes are a Thanksgiving staple, and there are tons of ways to repurpose them. Fried mashed potato balls are a fun way to take your leftovers to the next level. These crispy, cheesy bites are always a hit and a great app if you're hosting any football parties on Thanksgiving weekend.\nIf you're feeling adventurous, try making a mashed potato chocolate cake. Believe it or not, adding a cup of mashed potatoes to your favorite chocolate cake recipe can add moisture and richness to this decadent dessert. Plain mashed potatoes work best here.\nCranberry sauce\nAn unsung hero of the Thanksgiving table, cranberries are often left lingering in the fridge. However, there are lots of ways to repurpose this sweet sauce. Use it as a topping for Greek yogurt for a tangy morning treat. You can also stir your leftover cranberry sauce into your favorite quickbread recipe for a great breakfast treat.\nFor a more festive twist, add a couple of tablespoons of leftover cranberry sauce to your favorite cocktail for a holiday-inspired drink. And for dessert, don't miss the opportunity to make cranberry shortcake, where the tartness of the sauce pairs beautifully with the sweetness of the cake.\nStuffing\nStuffing may be one of the most versatile Thanksgiving leftovers. Instead of just reheating it, try making savory stuffing waffles. They're quick and easy to whip up — simply mix your leftover stuffing with a couple of eggs and cook for about five minutes in your waffle maker. These crispy waffles are brunch perfection, and they're an ideal treat if you have weekend guests staying over.\nStill have more stuffing? Try frying it into crispy stuffing fritters, using it as a filling for egg rolls, or stirring it into a casserole. If you've got leftover turkey and mashed potatoes, why not layer the stuffing into a turkey shepherd's pie for an extra layer of comfort?\nBread\nLastly, don't forget about leftover bread. Whether it's rolls or loaves, that bread can easily be transformed into something special. Try making an overnight blueberry French toast casserole, which is perfect for a weekend brunch. It's an easy way to turn stale bread into a delightful, sweet breakfast treat.\nDon't let those leftovers go to waste\nWhether you're hosting a huge family gathering or your first Friendsgiving, don't let the spoils from your Thanksgiving dinner weigh you down. With so many creative ways to use up your Thanksgiving leftovers, there's no need to let any food go to waste. From sliders to soups, and cakes to fritters, these recipes offer flavorful ways to make the most of your holiday feast. Give them a try, and you'll have delicious meals that last well beyond Thanksgiving Day.\nSarah Jenkins is the blogger behind Front Range Fed.

    "content": "Thanksgiving leftovers: What to do with them\n\n November 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: News \n \n 1137\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Thanksgiving dinner is over, and there are lots of leftovers to be eaten in the days to come. My family always said the first round was great, the second round was good and thereafter was \"OK.\"Today I will share some recipes and ideas for moving those foods.\nLine the countertop with plastic containers that have lids to package small individual meals. Place a small amount of each food in the containers to be reheated. Lunch is packed or a quick meal-on-the-run. Maybe a shut-in or elderly neighbor would appreciate a dish or two.\nFreeze any food that could be eaten in a week or so. Those turkey leftovers are great frozen to be used in that pot of soup on a cold winter day, especially the carcass with a little meat on it.\nTURKEY POT PIE2 tbsps butter, 1 onion (chopped), 2 stalks celery (chopped), 3 carrots (chopped), 4 tbsps flour, 4 cups chicken or turkey stock, 2 potatoes (peeled and diced), 2 cups shredded turkey, 2 tbsps chopped parsley, 1/2 cup frozen peas (thawed), 1 prepared pie crust, 1 egg (lightly beaten).\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Melt butter in a saucepan and cook chopped onion until tender. Stir in celery and carrots and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in flour and cook for 2 minutes. Add chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Add potatoes and simmer until tender. Stir in turkey, parsley and peas. Pour mixture into the casserole. Top with pie crust and brush with egg. Bake for 30 minutes until the crust is golden.\nTHANKSGIVING POTATO SKINS6 to 8 small to medium russet potatoes, 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, Kosher salt, 1 1/2 cups leftover mashed potatoes, 1 1/2 cup leftover turkey (chopped or shredded), 1 1/2 cups leftover stuffing, 1 cup grated sharp white cheddar, 1/2 cup cranberry sauce.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. Scrub potatoes well, then gently pierce with a fork five to six times. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Roast potatoes until tender and a knife can be inserted without resistance, 50 to 60 minutes. Let cool on a baking sheet. Cut each potato in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, carefully scoop out potato flesh, leaving a 1/4-inch border; reserve potato flesh for another use. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush inside and outside of potato skins with oil; season with salt. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees. Set a wire rack in a baking sheet. Arrange potato skins skin side down on rack and roast until just beginning to crisp, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool slightly. Layer each potato skin with leftover potatoes, leftover turkey, and leftover stuffing, then top with cheese. Continue to roast until the cheese is melted and the filling is warmed through, about 15 minutes more. Arrange potatoes on a platter. Top with cranberry sauce.\nDEEP FRIED GREEN BEANSToss 1 pound leftover cooked or raw green beans with 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and 1 cup buttermilk. Soak for 15 minutes. Season 1 cup cornmeal with salt and cayenne. Dredge the green beans in the cornmeal, then deep-fry in 2 inches of 375-degree vegetable oil until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.\nLEFTOVER TURKEY AND STUFFING REUBENS4 tbsps unsalted butter (room temperature), 8 slices rye bread, 4 tbsps Russian dressing, 8 slices Swiss cheese, 2 cups leftover stuffing (warmed slightly), 2 cups sauerkraut, 1 pound leftover thinly sliced turkey, salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nPosition a rack about four inches from the broiler heat source and preheat. Line a baking sheet with foil. Spread some butter on one side of each slice of bread. Place four pieces, buttered side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Spread some of the Russian dressing on the sides facing up. Top each with a slice of cheese and evenly crumble some of the stuffing over the cheese. Top each with some sauerkraut, turkey and then the remaining cheese on top. Put the open-faced sandwiches under the broiler and cook until the cheese melts, about 2 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the broiler. Spread the rest of the dressing on the uncovered side of the four remaining bread slices, place on top melted cheese and push down, buttered side up to finish the sandwiches. Return to the broiler and toast sandwich, carefully turning once so both sides get nice and golden brown, about 2 minutes total, serve hot.\nGRILLED TURKEY SANDWICH¾ cup mayonnaise, ¼ cup basil pesto, 4-6 slices crusty Italian bread or sourdough, 1/4 cup butter or margarine, 8 or so slices of your baked turkey, artichoke hearts, sliced tomatoes, whatever cheese you like (such as provolone cheese or sliced mozzarella).\nIn a small bowl, mix mayonnaise and pesto. Spread 1 side of each bread slice with butter. Turn bread slices butter sides down; spread other sides with 1 tbsp pesto mixture each. Top eight bread slices with turkey, artichokes, tomatoes and cheese. Top with remaining bread slices, butter sides up. In a sandwich grill or 12-inch skillet, cook sandwiches over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, turning once, until bread is toasted, and cheese is melted.\nTHANKSGIVING LEFTOVER NACHOS1 cup sour cream, 1 tbsp minced chipotle chile in adobo (plus more sauce for serving), 10 cups tortilla chips, 2 cups shredded leftover turkey meat, 3 cups shredded cheddar cheese, 2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese, 2 cups thinly sliced leftover cooked Brussels sprouts, 1 1/2 cups leftover cubed roasted butternut squash, 1 cup packaged french-fried onions, 1 cup lightly packed cilantro leaves or parsley leaves, 1/2 cup sliced black olives, 1/4 cup chopped pickled jalapenos.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. Stir the sour cream and chipotle chile together in a small bowl. Cover with plastic wraps and refrigerate. Scatter half the chips on a rimmed baking sheet. Top with one-third of the turkey, cheeses, Brussels sprouts, butternut squash and fried onions. Scatter the remaining chips on top followed by the remaining two-thirds of turkey, cheeses, Brussels sprouts and fried onions. Bake until the cheeses are melted and bubbly, about 5 to 7 minutes. Drizzle the nachos with chipotle sour cream and extra adobo sauce. Garnish with cilantro, black olives and jalapenos.\nI'd like to wish everyone a safe, happy and healthy Thanksgiving.\nPlease take the time to check on your shut-in or elderly neighbors as they might not be as fortunate as others. There is nothing that puts a smile on someone's face like a nice big plate of food.\nAs you sit down together at the Thanksgiving dinner table, give thanks for all that we have — no matter how little or much, give thanks to those serving our country at home and abroad, give thanks for anyone working today so others can be home, and bless the hands who prepared your meal.\nSee you next week as we enter December and some amazing Christmas cookie recipes. God bless you all. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "11-year-old killed in hit-and-run remembered in Elkton\n\n December 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Carl Hamilton cahamilton@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 1038\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ELKTON — Mesiah Lafayette produced a big barrel of cheese puffs recently after the dismissal bell rang at Cherry Hill Middle School and happily shared them with every fellow student who approached him.His display of generosity — one of Mesiah's many endearing qualities — is the last memory that most will have of him.\nMesiah, 11, was killed at approximately 8:30 p.m. on Nov.16, when a motorist struck him as he attempted to pedal his bicycle across Elkton Road from Belle Hill Road and then allegedly drove away. Police arrested the suspect on three days later, after tracking him down in Wilmington, Del., and charged him with involuntary manslaughter and numerous other offenses.\nGauging by the turnouts for two candlelight vigils that were held for Mesiah last week near the intersection where he lost his life, it's quite clear that the smiling boy who loved football, dancing, cool hairstyles, jokes, island music, Skittles and most assuredly his family and friends was adored in his community.\nAfter moving with his family from New Jersey to Elkton in November 2023, Mesiah finished the remaining eight months of his fifth-grade year at Kenmore Elementary School, before starting sixth-grade at Cherry Hill Middle School in September.\nMesiah was here for only a little while, one year, but he made a beautiful, lasting impression on many in that short time.\n\"He was a kind, loving and gentle child. He spread joy through the school,\" one Kenmore Elementary School teacher commented Monday night during the first vigil.\nAn administrator at that school recalled, \"He had a bright smile. He hugged people. And he always showed students and teachers affection and gave them attention.\"\nFrom a much more profound standpoint, Mesiah was here on this earth for only a short time and, yet, he still positively impacted a vast number of people.\n\"Mesiah was only here 11 years, but he touched a lot of lives — more than most people do in 50 years,\" emphasized The Rev. Moneira Hawkins of Spirit Life Ministries International in Wilmington, Del. on Tuesday night after praying aloud during the second vigil.\nSpeaking to the group of children, parents, teachers and others in attendance, Hawkins soothingly said, \"His spirit is still alive. He touched every one of you.\"\nOne night earlier, some Kenmore Elementary School and Cherry Hill Middle School teachers, administrators and other staff members attended the first vigil and huddled with approximately 20 students.\nThey shared their fond memories of Mesiah.\n\"He was a wonderful big brother to his sister. He walked her to her classroom every day,\" one Kenmore Elementary School administrator said, recalling how fifth-grade Mesiah looked out for his third-grade sibling last school year.\nA teacher volunteered, \"I remember how friendly and outgoing he was.\"\nThe teachers, administrators and staff members spoke words of comfort.\n\"It's OK to feel sad. It's OK to cry. Take a moment,\" one of the teachers softly told the students, for whom it was likely that this was the first time most of those children have experienced the death of a peer.\nAfter the circle disbanded, Joanne Carradin, a Cherry Hill Middle School counselor, told the Cecil Whig that crisis intervention counselors were at that school Monday morning to help students deal with their grief.\n\"They were very busy all morning. They had a lot of questions,\" Carradin said, adding that some students were sent home.\nOn Tuesday evening, Mesiah's surviving family members attended the second vigil — and somberness seemed even stronger than it did one night earlier. As supporters standing in a large semi-circle watched silently, Mesiah's relatives gathered in front of a makeshift memorial for Mesiah.\nMore than 25 candles flickered there. Poster boards covered with decorations and photos of Mesiah smiling and laughing with family members were displayed. Flower bouquets, a football and a bag of McDonald's food were lying there, too. Some helium balloons hovered slightly above the memorial.\nThe boy's relatives hugged, stood, crouched, sat and cried while gazing at the memorial for several moments amid the hush. Mesiah's stepfather made a couple of comments to the reverently quiet onlookers, expressing the family's gratitude for the show of support and love.\nMesiah's surviving family members include his mom, dad, stepdad, younger sister, 8; older brother, 15; and older sisters, ages 16 and 20.\nAttendees of the two vigils fondly remembered Mesiah, who played wide receiver on a boys league football team. Mesiah rooted for the Philadelphia Eagles, probably because he and his family lived in Philly at one point. Without hesitation, one of his school buddies answered, \"Professional NFL player,\" when asked what Mesiah wanted to be when he grew up.\nMesiah had flair.\n\"I remember his fancy hairstyles,\" one of the teachers shared during Monday night's vigil. Another teacher referred to them as \"adorable hairstyles.\"\nAs it turns out, Mesiah's 16-year-old sister was the person responsible for keeping his hairstyles sharp and different. \"I do his hair. I do it in different ways about once a month. He likes braids, straight backs — I guess you'd call them cornrows,\" his sister said Tuesday night, still speaking of Mesiah in the present tense.\nMesiah had a special spot in his heart for island music, which includes reggae, calypso and other genres. His favorite song was \"I Am A Bajan,\" a festive recording by an artist known as Rupee.\nHe loved to dance — unabashedly. His stepdad smiled when he recalled the times he saw Mesiah dancing with his mom in the kitchen.\nMesiah's stepdad and dad, both of whom write and record music, agree that Mesiah had a gift for composition. His stepdad recalled how Mesiah, after hearing one of his beats, sat down and wrote lyrics. Mesiah titled the song, \"I Wish I Had You,\" a tribute to his twin sister who died before birth. Mesiah then seamlessly rapped that fresh new song to the beat.\n\"He's a natural. He has a way with words,\" his stepdad marveled, before shifting into past-tense and declaring, \"That kid was special.\"\nMesiah had a winning, charismatic personality and the football, the hairstyles, the dancing, the music and all of the other things that he loved were just some of the countless manifestations of it.\n\"He was a bright light. When he walked into a room, he lit it up,\" his dad summarized while walking away from the memorial site at the conclusion of Tuesday night's vigil. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Artificial intelligence won't replace reporters\n\n December 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SISCO The Daily Times | Section: Columns \n \n 429\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When I first received an invitation to attend a seminar concerning artificial intelligence in the newsroom, I had mixed feelings. There was a bit of excitement — I am a bit of a computer and technology geek, after all — about exploring some of the tools that are available. I was also a little wary. Most of us have read or have heard about some of the more cringeworthy attempts to bring AI into journalism, and I was more than a little hesitant to entertain the notion here at The Daily Times.Now that the course has completed, though, I came to a startling two-part revelation. The first phase of my resolution was pretty basic. These tools can help — a lot.\nWe've started experimenting with AI technology, focusing primarily on routine data processing tasks. Marriage reports, real estate transactions and business licenses are the kind of data-heavy work that has traditionally consumed hours of valuable reporting time. Now, they can be completed in a matter of minutes.\nThe second part of my personal revelation came after I spent more time experimenting with available tools — from programs that can help streamline your email inbox, create possible story outlines and reveal areas of inquiry to audio tools that can simulate human voices (and even clone your own voice) to read text. These tools can be scarily good. I cloned a snippet of my voice, read a two-sentence script and played it for my younger brother. He could tell the difference only after listening several times.\nBut here's the thought that began the second part of that revelation. As good as these tools are, they can never replace a living, thinking, feeling reporter. AI can immediately tell one of our reporters how much money agencies like The Empty Pantry Fund has raised over the past five years. It cannot, however, describe the dedication of its volunteers, or put into words the joy of being able to help out a neighbor in need.\nSo no, AI will not be writing our stories. It will not conduct interviews. It will not replace our reporters. They are our nerdy assistants, doing some of the more time-consuming data entry so reporters can focus on what matters most — getting out, talking to our neighbors, attending local government meetings and telling the important stories about our lives.\nThe future of journalism will be shaped by how we choose to implement new technologies. I think we're choosing a path that puts our community first, supports our journalists and ensures that technology serves our mission of delivering reliable, comprehensive local news coverage. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Don't let challenges overcome your Christmas season\n\n December 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: GLENN MOLLETTE | Section: Columns \n \n 525\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Christmas is a joyful season but always has some challenges.The place of Christmas is often a question. Mary and Joseph ended up in Bethlehem when Jesus was born. They had gone there to pay taxes. Paying taxes is never fun but something we have to do. The place they ended up when Jesus was born was probably not their desired location to bear their first child, but they made the most of the location.\nLocation trips a lot of people up on Christmas. Many have no choice. They will spend Christmas in the nursing home or jail. Many have no options. They may be too elderly or sick to travel. They may not have any place to go. If you have options then be thankful. If you have a place to spend Christmas then this is one of your best gifts of all. Don't fight about the place where you will spend Christmas. Make the best of wherever you end up and celebrate with whoever is around.\nThe presents of Christmas are often stressful. Presents are expensive and often we don't know what to buy and how much to spend. You may have a lot of gifts to buy or maybe you don't have a single person for whom you will buy a gift. If you can afford to buy gifts and want to then enjoy the opportunity. If finances are meager this year, then be honest with yourself and others and say our list and budget is very limited this year. Don't put yourself in financial jeopardy by spending money you don't have. The greatest gift is the baby Jesus. Focusing on Him will bring more peace than a house filled with gifts.\nThe pageantry of Christmas often becomes work. How many lights can you string on your roof or around your shrubbery? I enjoy putting up lights on a warm day but despise taking them down in January. Just remember what goes up must come down, eventually. Try to find a mild weather day, and you won't feel like the grinch.\nThe pressure of Christmas gets to a lot of people. People die in December. Loneliness takes over. Stress becomes paramount. People get depressed. Christmas should never be a time of loneliness, stress or pressure, but it was a difficult time for Mary and Joseph. They were poor people. Bringing a child into the world in a stable would not be considered an option for most of us. Traveling was a hassle and very difficult back then. While they were overjoyed with the baby Jesus, life's circumstances were not easy. Later, they would flee to Egypt for the safety of their family which had to add to their pressure.\nThe person of Christmas must be our focus in order to truly celebrate this season. Let's not lose sight of the main character in the Christmas story. If we do, then we will focus on the place, presents, pageantry and pressures of Christmas. Thus, we will miss out on the real joy that the heavenly host proclaimed to those shepherds watching their sheep.\n\"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\" (Luke 2:14). \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Archaeologists work with Indigenous Peoples, DNR\n\n December 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: A.J. Metcalf Maryland Department of Natural Resources | Section: State News \n \n 880\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Indigenous sites in Maryland have been dated as early as 12,000 years ago by archaeologists. Many Indigenous people lived along the then Susquehanna River, using the resources provided by the land.As the Susquehanna's channel widened and the Chesapeake Bay began to form about 10,000 years ago, a majority of these settlements were inundated by water. The people who lived there moved, often following food resources such as oysters and fish.\n\"The Chesapeake Bay has long been a vital resource for people including Native Americans, especially as the Bay began to form,\" said Julia A. King, professor of Anthropology at St. Mary's College of Maryland. \"It provides all sorts of seafood. The rising waters created marshlands that sort of acted as a refrigerator by providing animals and plant species that people could use. A lot of native settlements were located near riverine environments and marsh.\"\nThanks to state and federal grants, a growing relationship with today's Piscataway descendants, and a strong partnership with Maryland's Department of Natural Resources, King has been working with her students and colleague Travis Hanson, an archaeologist, to uncover the history of Indigenous peoples in Southern Maryland.\nOn a cloudy fall day earlier this year, Hanson joined park rangers and others at Chapel Point State Park to detail their ongoing work in the park as part of the Department of Natural Resources' annual Science Week. In pre-colonial times this area was home to the Potobacs, who were part of the Piscataway Chiefdom, which had emerged on the shores of the Potomac River around 1200 AD.\nHanson guided the small group through a narrow trail at Chapel Point State Park to an area next to a natural spring where paw paw trees were growing. The area was chosen for exploration due to the concentrations of oyster shell middens–basically dumping areas for discarded oyster shells, which indicate people had been gathering nearby and eating oysters. In 2023, Hanson, King and others dug several small test pits to search for artifacts and any structural remains.\nEvidence indicates there was an extensive Indigenous settlement in the area that likely stretched to the other side of the Potomac.\n\"We found lots of projectile points, ceramics, and stone tools,\" said King. \"We only scratched the surface and found hundreds of artifacts.\"\nThrough her work, King has developed a collaborative relationship with contemporary Piscataway descendants including Francis Gray, the tribal chairman of today's Piscataway Conoy Tribe, one of three state-recognized tribes in Maryland. Gray joined the group that had gathered at Chapel Point.\n\"We've come to understand that by having conversations with archaeologists and researchers we can help each other out,\" Gray said. He noted that through their collaborative work they've been able to confirm Native American community locations and find ways to protect those sites.\n\"It's important for researchers and others to understand that they're finding artifacts that belonged to a people who still exist,\" Gray said. \"This whole river here was not one small concentrated community. Like the Nanticoke, Choptank, and Wicomico, these were all metropolises before colonization, people lived on both sides of the Potomac River.\"\nKing hopes that through further research the team can discover the location of the Jesuit mission where Father Andrew White operated. White led the first Catholic Mass in the English-speaking colonies after Maryland colonists first arrived in the new colony in 1634. His parish was set up around 1641 in Chapel Point, although the exact location is unknown. Finding the parish may help inform the history of how early colonists interacted with the Piscataway and other tribes in the area.\nWhat is known–the arrival of the colonists caused feuds among the Piscataway, who had previously been attacked by colonists from Jamestown. Records uncovered from that time suggest that the Piscataway Tayac Kittamaquund–the tribe's chief–killed his brother to take power in an effort to normalize relations with the arriving colonists. Kittamaquund's older brother–Wannas–had mistrusted the English.\nDespite some initial normalizing of relations, the English colonists expanded their reach and took over the land once foraged and farmed by the Piscataway and other Indigenous peoples during the next several decades.\nGray hopes that the history of the Piscataway can be more accurately told and preserved through respectful archaeology, signage in state parks and interpretive education about Indigenous Peoples throughout Maryland.\n\"This is just woods to most people, they don't see the history,\" Gray said, as he stood in the middle of the former dig site at Chapel Point State Park.\nAt the Department of Natural Resources, staff are working with Gray, King, and Hanson to better tell the story of the Piscataway. During the fall event, the department's Environmental Justice Officer Mariah Davis discussed opportunities with Gray and park staff to create interpretive programs, written in coordination with the tribal community, to educate visitors about the rich Indigenous heritage in Southern Maryland at the park.\nDavis and Gray also discussed opportunities to collaborate with the Piscatoway Canoy Tribe to grow culturally important crops and plant species on park land.\nGray welcomed the idea and suggested that a red cedar be planted in a prominent position at Chapel Point.\nThe red cedar tree is a sacred plant for the Piscataway people. They consider the evergreen as full of life and believe its red center core represents the life-blood of all animals, including man.\n\"We don't want the footprint of our people to be erased,\" Gray said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's my prayer that they have left us with kind and loving memories to encourage and keep us moving forward.\nAt Thanksgiving, we surrounded the table with family, friends and good food — what a blessing.

The concern of a safe work place, safe schools and safe Houses of Worship are becoming high alert status.\nA fresh start is appealing to many — a new administration to lead the nation forward for a better and brighter future, to have a cost of living thats bearable and not a burden or for the Golden Rule to come alive in our hearts (to do unto others as we would have them do unto you).\nWe've celebrated Christmas, the birth of Jesus, the perfect gift given to mankind. Our fresh start born in a manger, crucified on the cross, buried in a borrowed tomb. Our fresh start rose on the third day. He's coming again in Glory to take unto himself his own.\nWhat ever state we may find ourselves in physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, socially, just know that Jesus is in our story.\nFor a true fresh start, come to Jesus.\nJohn 3:16… For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son the whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.

The date changes. Some of us will mess up writing a check a time or two because we'll write 2024 until it finally sinks in that we are in a new year.The new year means change. It always has, and this year will not be any different. We will see a changing of the guard in our presidency. President Biden is exiting after an unbelievable 50 or so years in national politics. President Trump is coming back, and he has done what no other human has done before. I'm not simply referring to being elected a second time after sitting out a term because that has happened.\nWhat I mean is no one has been vilified and harassed as he has been and even survived let alone ascend to the highest office in the world. January will bring immediate change upon his inauguration. However, it remains to be seen what will change and what won't.\nLife is always transitioning, but we sometimes have difficulty making the transition. Some men never get over their high school sports career. They live in the past of the time when they were star athletes, but that may have been 20 to 40 years ago. We often have great difficulty overcoming a failed relationship or marriage.\nIt happened 10 years ago, but the impact of it still troubles us. We often still grieve over the loss of a loved one who died 20 years ago. We still miss them and the joy they brought into our lives. We often cannot transition from our jobs or careers. We remember those 20 to 40 years that we worked a certain job or business. We look back to those days often as great days that we would like to go back to.\nIt's not easy to transition. The college freshman often misses their senior year of high school. Even as adults we remember those wonderful wasted days of childhood. The 35-year-old misses their teen years, the 80-year-old would like to be 50 again.\nOften, we dread birthdays. The actual birthdate brings a new number. The 15-year-old loves that 16 number because it means freedom to drive. The 64-year-old anticipates 65 and Medicare and the Social Security check soon to come.\nOur hope must be to transition as well as we can because transition is coming for us all.\nAn old preacher friend said, \"At every level there is a new devil.\" At every stage and age of life there are joys and obstacles. There are new struggles and also new opportunities.\nLet's make 2025 the best year we've ever had. That may not be easy, but it's worth a try and even if it's not our best year, keep in mind, it's the only year we have at this time.\nThe life we have today is the only life we have. We don't have yesterday or even tomorrow. Let's give 2025 our best effort and do our best to be here at this same time and place next year. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

A couple of months later, while we were visiting and chatting about nothing, he asked me what my dinner plans were, and I told him wifey wanted me homemade chili and cornbread, but I didn't feel like stopping at the store.\nWe chatted a few more minutes when he quietly said, \"make the chili.\"\nIt took me a few minutes to realize we were no longer talking about dinner. It was about going out of your way to do something for someone you love because at any moment, they could unexpectedly be taken away from you.\nSo today I'm sharing with you that wisdom handed to me by my dear friend, that I've pondered many times since that day.\nThe next time someone you love, (especially our children) wants you to go for a walk or watch a football game or play a board game or just put your phone down and give them your undivided attention, just do it. \"Make the chili.\"\nMake the chili is a friendly reminder that life is short and as scripture tells us, no one knows the day nor the hour. None of us born of a woman knows when our time here on earth will be up. You will either have a heart full of regrets or a grateful heart full of memories.\nToday, and only today is our chance to choose. Joshua 24:15 advises \"choose ye this day.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "date": "2025-01-16",

    "content": "The secret world of fancy butter: Is the hype worth your buck?\n\n January 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jennifer Allen Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1200\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Enter the secret world of fancy butter, where class and sophistication define every dish they're added to. While high-end butters like Bordier and Kerrygold offer richer flavors and a smoother texture, the question remains: Is it worth splurging $20 or more for the indulgence?What is fancy butter?Fancy butter is a high-quality butter with unique characteristics that you just don't get in your supermarket brands. These distinct qualities can include higher butterfat content, a complex taste or a softer texture. They can also be made from the milk of grass-fed cows or select breeds that have more flavorful milk, or even from goat's milk.\nIf you're wondering why butter usually tastes better in restaurants, gourmet butters might be the reason. In 2021, The Guardian discussed the growing restaurant trend of using fancy, handmade butter, such as those flavored with herbs, spices or even smoked bone marrow, to deliver a different flavor experience.\nIs a stick of fancy butter worth it?An article in HuffPost states that fancy butters contain higher butterfat than ordinary butter, especially those from Europe which can go up to 87% versus your store brand which hovers around 80%. This higher butterfat content gives the butter a richer flavor and lower moisture content, which improves mouthfeel, taste and texture. \"What's the point of having good bread if you don't use good butter,\" is a sentiment shared by many, including Amanda Luhn from Knoxville Backyard & Beyond.\nStatista has projected the price of butter to rise even more in 2025, and with increased demand, is gourmet butter better? From French butter that could range up to $82 per pound to Irish grass-fed butter like Kerrygold, are these pricey spreads worth every buck, or are they just a modern fad?\nBordier butter: Justifying the French crazeFrench butter is revered worldwide for its rich flavor and texture, which elevates everyday dishes from soups to pastries. Ashley Wali, creator of Wanderlux, recommends visiting creameries and grocery stores in France to experience true French butter craftmanship. \"They pass airport security and will stay cold until you get home. It's the perfect edible souvenir you can't get anywhere else,\" she says.\nOne of the most famous French butter is Bordier butter, a handcrafted butter made with high-quality organic milk from small local French farms in regions like Brittany, Normandy and Pays de la Loire. Starting at $12 for a 4-ounce stick, this premium butter will give you a unique creamy, silky texture and complex flavors, which change with the seasons due to the varying cow diets.\nBordier butter is made using traditional methods, including churning, kneading and salting by hand. With meticulous attention to detail in its production, this luxurious butter is a beloved ingredient in professional kitchens and among food enthusiasts, making every penny you spend worth it.\n\"Sure, it's not always cheap — hello, sticker shock — but there's no comparison when you're spreading it on warm bread or swirling it into a sauce,\" says Bitty of Eighty Recipes who's been stashing specialty butters in their freezer. \"Flavored ones, like Bordier, are incredible and hold up perfectly for months. When you treat butter as more than just an ingredient, it can make a meal sing,\" she adds.\nGrass-fed butter: Healthy and fancyGrass-fed butter is made from the milk of cows that eat a diet of 100% grass without grain or corn supplementation. This means the color of grass-fed butter is deeper due to the carotene and chlorophyll in the grass, making it richer than grain-fed cows. Because of the diverse grasses and herbs the cows consume, grass-fed butter offers a rich, creamy taste with nutty undertones.\nAngus Dalton explains in the TastingTable that grass-fed butter contains higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids which are essential for brain and heart health and could help manage depression. It's also rich in conjugated linoleic acid which can aid in weight loss.\nGrass-fed butter is a healthier option than traditional grain-fed butter that are high in saturated fats. This premium butter can cost $5-12 per pound based on brand and whether it's organic or specialty butter.\nIs Irish butter just better?An 8-ounce slab of Irish butter for $4-7 will give you a sweeter and more flavorful alternative due to its higher butterfat content and the cows' grass-fed diet. According to Real Simple, it contains 82% butterfat, which makes it creamier, spreadable and more flavorful than American butter. Lovers of Irish butter, like Glenda from Glenda Embree Blog, reserve this pricy butter for special occasions.\nReal Simple states that the sweeter taste comes from the beta-carotene in Ireland's lush, nutrient-rich pastures the cows graze on. This also contributes to the butter's distinctive bright yellow color. Irish butter is mostly uncultured and unsalted, unlike most European butter, making it smoother and milder in taste.\nThe most famous brand of Irish butter is Kerrygold which launched in the United States in 1990 with its first product, Kerrygold cheese. The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society reports Kerrygold holds the number one position in the U.S. market for imported butter, and Wirecutter has named it one of the best butters of 2024, describing its texture as \"luxuriously creamy, dense and silky, without any mouth-coating greasiness.\"\nThe creative spreads of flavored butterIf you want to go fancy without spending a fortune, try making flavored or compound butter at home. Compound butter is butter mixed with other ingredients, like herbs, spices or even alcohol, to enhance its taste. It's another method of adding flavor to your dishes and improving your butter's flavor profile. Here are some notable examples you can whip up to make you feel like a five-star chef in your kitchen.\nHerb compound butterIf you're looking for butter that adds a luxurious aroma to your dishes, herb compound butter might be for you. This flavored butter ranges from combining shallot, rosemary asiago or lemon herb for that rich, savory flavor to your recipes.\nGarlic compound butterA popular staple in restaurants and home kitchens, garlic compound butter, such as roasted garlic, lemon garlic, garlic powder and black garlic, offers various savory, aromatic flavors for bread, meats, seafood, vegetables, pasta and even vegetarian meals. This makes this fancy butter a versatile ingredient that will help you invent that signature dish you've been planning ever since.\nSweet compound butterUse sweet compound butter, such as apple herb, cinnamon honey and maple brown sugar, to combine sweet and savory flavors in your dishes. Flavored butter of this variety works wonders in baked goods, breakfast items and meats.\nSavory compound butterTo introduce bold and rich flavors, incorporate savory compound butter into your dishes, such as blue cheese, bacon, four cheese and pesto basil. This flavored butter is ideal for meats, vegetables and baked goods.\nFinal words on fancy butterAdding fancy butter to your arsenal of ingredients should be based on your preference and budget, not primarily on social status. With several options to choose from, gourmet butter should not only be used for sophistication but to also create mouthwatering dishes that will have your guests asking for seconds.\nJennifer Allen, retired chef turned cookbook author, blogger and traveler, shares her adventures and travel tips at All The Best Spots. Living at home with her family — and the cats that rule them all — her work has been featured in The Washington Post, Seattle Times, MSN and more. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Jimmy Carter: lifelong goal of service to others\n\n January 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 638\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Jimmy Carter was both a nuclear engineer educated at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis and a strong supporter of nuclear disarmament in the world. He was a white, poor peanut farmer's son from Plains, Georgia, where only 20% of the population was white. He understood what it meant to be in the minority and told the Academy he was happy to share a room with a black midshipman.President Carter's main diplomatic achievement during his presidency was the Camp David Accords in 1978 between Israel and Egypt. Carter was hosting the two heads of state with staff in different cottages at Camp David in Maryland. These two countries had been at war since 1948, and Carter persuaded them to recognize each other and to cease the on and off wars that nobody won.\nJimmy Carter's one-term presidency ended when he could not persuade the young Iranian protesters to free the U.S. embassy staff they had taken hostage. But his diplomacy won in the end, as the embassy staffers were sent home shortly after President Reagan was inaugurated. They all came through that year alive. One small group of staffers absconded to the Canadian Embassy in Teheran from the outset and were smuggled out earlier by the Canadians. (See the movie Argo.) Carter's presidency also suffered from higher prices in the grocery stores and long lines of cars waiting to gas up.\nIt was after his presidency when Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn really blossomed. They established the Carter Center in Atlanta and joined Habitat for Humanity building affordable housing. For more than 30 years they worked with over 100,000 volunteers in 14 countries building, renovating or repairing more than 4,000 homes for the needy. We have a local Choptank Habitat for Humanity with many homes still built in Talbot and Dorchester counties by volunteers. When I first came out to the Shore, I worked on a Habitat home built by women volunteers.\nPresident Carter was very critical of apartheid in South Africa. He became a close friend of Nelson Mandela, who after 30 years of political imprisonment on Robins Island was freed and eventually was elected president of South Africa.\nIn the Carters' travels around Africa, they saw the blind beggars that I also have seen in Africa. Their blindness is caused by a disease called River Blindness. It is a tropical disease caused by a parasitic worm found in rivers and streams where people swim. The medication Ivermectin can treat the disease. Jimmy Carter saw to it through the Carter Center's employees and volunteers in Africa that this medication was given out free to villages around Africa, as it was very cheap to make.\nAfrica went from having hundreds of thousands of infections every year to 14 last year. This was Jimmy Carter's greatest success in saving lives now and in the future.\nIn 2002, Jimmy Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace prize for his dedication to humanitarian efforts around the world and trying to end international conflicts. The award is given by the Norwegian Nobel Committee to somebody whose work has benefited mankind and world peace. (The Swedish Nobel Committee gives out all the Nobel prizes in science and literature.) Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist and inventor of dynamite, made a lot of money from dynamite but believed in peace between countries.\nThe eulogies to Jimmy Carter given by dignitaries and relatives during his funeral celebration in the Washington National Cathedral portrayed a president and life thereafter with a lifelong goal of service to others. His grandson said, \"… in my 49 years I never perceived a difference between his public face and his private one. He was the same person no matter who he was with, or where he was, and for me that's the definition of integrity.\"\nHe was a president the likes of which we may never see again. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Hot chili on a cold day\n\n January 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1070\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The weather outside is freezing, wind blowing leftover snow across the driveway.After shoveling the snow or struggling to get home from work safely, open the kitchen door to the smells of hot chili steaming and freshly baked cornbread. This combination puts a smile on everyone's face — almost makes you want to go shovel snow and salt the ice again.\nI remember as a child getting to stay home from school was great, but a farm kid did not exactly get to sleep in until noon. The fun began after the chores were done.\nOur dad would hook the corn shuck sled, like a large wooden sled, up to the tractor and pull us across the fields. What a rough ride, and what fun.\nBack to the kitchen for that delicious bowl of chili and warm slice of cornbread. When it comes to chili, I like a dryer cornbread that helps to soak up the chili flavor.\nCOUNTRY DRY CORN BREAD1 tbsp bacon drippings or cooking grease, 2 cups cornmeal or 1 1/2 cups cornmeal and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp sugar (optional), 1 large egg, 1 1/4 cups buttermilk, 6 tbsps unsalted butter (melted). Put the bacon drippings or grease in a 9 or 10-inch well seasoned cast iron skillet and put the skillet into the oven. Then preheat the oven to 400 degrees with the skillet inside. If you don't have an iron skillet, you can use an uncovered Dutch oven, or a metal cake pan. Whisk together all the dry ingredients (cornmeal, baking soda, salt, sugar if using) in a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the egg and buttermilk until combined, then mix that into the bowl of dry ingredients. Stir in the melted butter. When the oven is hot, take out the skillet (carefully). Add the cornbread batter and make sure it is evenly distributed in the skillet. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the edges are beginning to brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean. Let the bread rest for 10 to 30 minutes in the skillet before cutting it into wedges and serving.\nVENISON CHILI1 lb boneless cubed venison steak, 1 lb pork sausage, 1 chopped onion, 2 minced garlic cloves, c beans (drained and rinsed), 6-oz can tomato paste, hot pepper sauce, salt and pepper, 15-oz can cannelini beans (drained), 10-oz can diced tomatoes with chilies.\nPlace venison and pound pork sausage in a large skillet and cook, breaking with a wooden spoon as necessary, over medium heat until no longer pink. Drain grease and mix in onion, garlic and c beans and cook for about 3 minutes. Drain and mix in tomato paste and season with hot pepper sauce, salt and black pepper to taste. Pour in cannellini beans, and diced tomatoes with chilies. Pour all of this into a slow cooker, adding the venison-sausage mixture in with the tomato-bean mixture. Cook 8 to 10 hours on low or 5 hours on high. Serve with shredded Cheddar cheese.\nWENDY'S CHILI\nIn a large skillet brown 2 pounds of fresh ground beef. Drain off fat and put the beef in a 6 quart pot with 1 quart of tomato juice, one 15 ounce can of tomato puree, one 15 ounce can of drained red kidney beans, one 15 ounce can drained pinto beans, one large chopped onion, 1/2 cup diced celery, 1/4 cup diced green pepper, 1/4 cup chili powder, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 1/2 tsps garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. Cover and simmer for one hour, stirring often.\nINSTANT POT VEGGIE CHILI\n1 tbsp olive oil, 1 medium white or yellow onion (diced), 1 medium red bell pepper (diced), 4 cloves garlic (minced), 3–4 cups vegetable stock, 1 (15-oz) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, 1 (15-oz) can beans of your choice (rinsed and drained), 1 cup uncooked green or brown lentils (picked over and rinsed), 1 tbsp chili powder, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tsp ground cumin, salt and freshly-cracked black pepper. Some extras that go great with this are diced avocado, chopped fresh cilantro, diced green or red onions, shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, and/or crumbled corn tortilla chips.\nPress the \"Sauté\" button on the Instant Pot. Add oil, followed by the onion and red pepper. Sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion has softened. Add garlic and sauté for 1 more minute, stirring occasionally. Press the \"Cancel\" button. Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl of the Instant Pot. Place the lid on and set to \"Sealing.\" Using the \"Manual\" button, cook the chili on high pressure for 12 minutes, followed by a quick release. Taste and season with salt and pepper (or any other additional seasonings) as needed. Serve immediately, piled high with all of your favorite toppings. Or transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.\nIf you prefer to use a slow cooker, add all ingredients to the bowl of a slow cooker and stir briefly to combine. Cover and cook on high for 3-4 hours or on low for 6-8 hours, until the lentils are tender. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve immediately, piled high with all of your favorite toppings. Or transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.\nOLD FASHIONED CHILI\n2 pounds 85% lean ground beef, 1 tbsp canola oil, 2 sweet onions (diced), 4 cloves garlic (sliced), 1 red pepper (diced), 1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes, 2 15-ounce cans dark red kidney beans (drained), 2 15-ounce cans pinto beans (drained), 2 tbsps dark chili powder, 1 tbsp cumin, 1 tsp ground chipotle pepper, ½ cup chicken stock, 2 tbsps smoked paprika, 1 11-ounce can tomato juice such as V8, salt and freshly ground black pepper, shredded cheese, sour cream, green onions.\nIn a large soup pot over medium-high heat, add the canola oil and ground beef. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Sear for about 10 minutes. Add the onion, garlic and red pepper, and sauté about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, beans, chili powder, cumin, chipotle powder, paprika, chicken stock and tomato juice; simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve with shredded cheese, sour cream, green onion, tortilla chips or crackers. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This is not surprising, considering that 80% of travelers visit just 10% of the world's tourist destinations, according to a McKinsey report.As travelers gear up for 2025, a growing emphasis is being placed on taking the road less traveled. In Expedia's Unpack '25 travel trends report, travelers are looking to take detours to less well-known and less crowded destinations, with 63% of consumers saying they are likely to visit a detour destination on their next trip.\nA Shift Toward Experiential TravelTechnavio predicts the travel market size is set to increase by $5,506.7 billion between 2023 and 2028, with experiential travel being a key driver of the market. Experiential travel allows modern travelers to connect to local cultures and traditions, and captivating content on social media sites like Instagram and TikTok fuels this trend.\n\"2025 is the year to leave your comfort zone and chase experiences that will truly take your breath away,\" says Ellen Flowers, travel editor at The Perennial Style. \"Travel is about pushing your boundaries, discovering new worlds, and connecting deeply with the places and people you encounter. For 2025, make it your goal to fill your bucket list with experiences that will shape your memories for a lifetime.\"\nHighlights of Bucket List DestinationsWe asked travel experts to discuss destinations and activities that go beyond the typical tourist trail, emphasizing adventure, cultural immersion, and sustainability. Travel experts singled out the following destinations and activities for their uniqueness and appeal:\nSvalbard, NorwayLocated in the Arctic Circle, Svalbard offers pristine wilderness and the chance to spot polar bears while experiencing some of the harshest and most stunning landscapes on Earth.\n\"Camping under the midnight sun in Svalbard, Norway,\" says Andrea Affinati, founder and travel expert at Voyaged Magazine. \"There's no dark sky to signal bedtime; you're wide awake at 2 a.m., basking in sunlight while surrounded by Arctic landscapes. It's surreal, and it forces you to disconnect from any concept of time. Add in the occasional visit from a curious reindeer, and it's something you'll talk about forever.\"\nLake Bled, SloveniaKnown for its emerald-green waters and fairy-tale setting, this European gem combines natural beauty with opportunities for hiking and local culinary indulgence.\n\"For a more serene yet equally memorable experience, head to Lake Bled, Slovenia, where you can row a traditional wooden boat across crystal-clear waters to reach the iconic Bled Castle — perfect for an Instagram-worthy moment and a peaceful escape,\" Flowers remarks.\nKanazawa, JapanKanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture's capital, might be less crowded than other parts of Japan but just as impressive, with the entire city classed as a UNESCO site for crafts and folk art.\n\"I always recommend Japan, and beyond the usual cities, Kanazawa should be on your list. This city is known for its Edo-period architecture, beautiful Kenrokuen Garden, and an up-and-coming art scene,\" says Affinati. \"It's also famous for its gold-leaf crafts — you can even try your hand at applying gold leaf to souvenirs or desserts.\"\nCultural Immersion and ConnectionCultural tourism and authentic experiences are leading to the exploitation of new paths. Destinations like Sri Lanka's Ceylon tea region and Oaxaca, Mexico, offer travelers the chance to connect deeply with local cultures and nature. Experts say these interactions can be a very rewarding aspect of travel.\n\"For a cultural experience, I suggest celebrating the Day of the Dead in Oaxaca, Mexico,\" Affinati says. \"This festival draws you in completely. Families invite you to see their altars, you can join them in the cemetery, and you [can] share traditional foods. It's a beautiful mix of joy and remembrance that really stays with you.\"\nFlowers says Sri Lanka's Resplendent Tea Trails offers the perfect cultural retreat. \"Nestled in the hills, it's the ideal place to sip tea while soaking in the serenity of tea plantations. It's a journey of both personal growth and cultural immersion, where each destination challenges you to step outside the ordinary and embrace the extraordinary.\"\nAdventure and Personal GrowthFor travelers seeking physical challenges, trekking the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal provides a unique opportunity to connect with the majestic Himalayan landscape while pushing personal limits.\n\"I would suggest trekking the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal,\" says Affinati. \"It's tough, but the views are worth it, and the connections you make with local communities along the way are deeply rewarding. Plus, you'll come back with a renewed sense of what you're capable of.\"\nSimilarly, Namibia's Sossusvlei dunes and Oman's wild camping experiences promise an exciting escapade alongside breathtaking scenery.\n\"Namibia is pure adventure. The landscapes here are epic, from the towering dunes of Sossusvlei to the shipwrecks along the Skeleton Coast, not to mention the incredible opportunities for spotting wildlife,\" Affinati says.\nAs for Oman, \"You'll feel like the last person on Earth with an incredible night sky. You might even see camels and nomads roaming around,\" Oberman says.\nOberman also puts in a good word for Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan in Iraq, for someone looking for a real adventure.\n\"I lived there for two years, and while it's in an 'orange' area, the region offers beautiful and unexpected nature: snow-capped mountains — even glaciers — waterfalls, gorges, canyons, and lush valleys,\" he says. \"One of the most stunning spots is Rawanduz, a small town built on a cliff edge. However, always go with a guide familiar with the area.\"\nWhile Oberman provides an interesting insight, the current Level Four \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for Iraq suggests that potential visitors may need to reconsider their plans or explore safer alternatives until conditions improve.\nSustainable Travel Takes Center StageTrip.com Group, a leading global travel service provider, reviewed 9,867 survey samples from 109 countries and territories for their Sustainable Travel Consumer Report 2024. They found that while an overwhelming 92% of travelers may consider sustainable travel, only 56.9% say they have actually practiced it. Travelers are on the lookout for more transparency around sustainable options, but a gap between awareness and action is still present.\nAs environmental awareness grows, travel experts we interviewed encourage travelers to plan trips responsibly. They recommend traveling off-season when there are fewer crowds, supporting sustainable, locally-owned businesses, and opting for eco-friendly accommodations.\nAffinati recommends taking it slow. \"Instead of hopping from city to city every couple of days, stay longer in one place. It reduces your transportation footprint and lets you experience a destination on a deeper level.\"\n\"Another practical tip is to choose eco-certified accommodations. These aren't just hotels with a 'save your towels' sign but places that actively work to reduce waste, conserve water, and support local ecosystems. I suggest looking for certifications like Green Key or EarthCheck when booking,\" she adds.\nAffinati also points to low-impact activities such as electric-powered boat tours, which \"allow you to explore without disturbing wildlife or polluting the water.\" In addition, you can cut down on single-use plastics, which are \"a huge problem in many popular destinations.\" Instead, opt for reusable items such as water bottles, utensils, and shopping bags.\nLooking Ahead to 2025With the lingering effects of pandemic-era restrictions, experts predict that 2025 will continue to see a surge in bucket-list trips as people make up for lost time. The McKinsey survey reports that 66% of travelers are more interested in travel now than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Travelers are highly influenced by the stories behind the destination, with 92% of young travelers taking inspiration from social media for their last trip.\nThe expectations for meaningful and experiential travel destinations are high for 2025 and beyond. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings: Love is...\n\n January 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DOUG MORLEY | Section: Columns \n \n 232\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n February is the month of hearts and roses, chocolates and cards, romance and love. But what is love?Is it merely an emotion, a feeling, a hormonal reaction, or does it include a choice? Sure, there is chemistry involved in the initial attraction that brings two people together. But is that all there is to love or is there more?\nThe Bible explains that there is more to love than emotional or physical attraction. Love, true love, is a commitment, a choice, a willingness to put the interest of another above our own. According to 1 Corinthians 13:\n\"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.\" (1 Corinthians 13:4-8)\nWhy not take a few moments this February to evaluate the health of your love? Put your name in the place of the word \"love\" in this passage and ask yourself, \"am I patient? am I kind?\"\nCan you say with a straight face that you are not selfish, or rude or easily angered, and that you keep no record of wrongs?\nAnd then, based on your self-evaluation, commit to improving your love life in 2025. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Troublesome letter\n\n February 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 314\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n You published a troublesome letter by Ms. Wieland in your Jan. 25-26 edition. You do not fact check letters to the editor, but someone must if we care about truth. Ms. Wieland's short letter contains false claims.She writes that we on the Eastern Shore need to be alert, so we don't turn into California. That state spends $22,821,903,942 on benefits to \"illegal immigrants.\" She claims California's budget deficit is $76 billion. And she writes regulations are driving insurance companies out of California.\nHer estimate of $22,821,903,942 probably comes from House of Representative Republicans. That group cites the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) as the source of their estimate. FAIR is a right-wing, anti-immigration lobbying group, but that number can't come from them as FAIR rounds off estimates to $100 million. They never get as absurdly specific as the number provided by Ms. Weiland. The estimate by House Republicans and repeated by Ms. Weiland lacks any credibility.\nHer claim that the budget deficit for California is $76 billion is inaccurate. The most reliable estimate is $38 billion, half of what Ms. Weiland claims. Regardless, any current estimate is irrelevant. At the end of California's fiscal year, their deficit must be no larger than $0. State law requires a balanced budget, just like in 48 other states.\nMs. Weiland letter states insurance companies are leaving California due to the state's regulations. Florida, notorious for a lack of building regulations, has a crisis because so many insurance companies are leaving that state. At the very least, this throws doubt on Ms. Weiland's claim.\nMust we in Maryland be terrified of becoming like California, even the false picture of California provided by Ms. Weiland? No. Maryland's financial situation is nothing like California and likely never will be. And insurance companies are not bailing out of Maryland, most likely because we don't have fires like California or hurricanes like Florida.\nMICHAEL DAVIS\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This shift is called having the mind of Christ . . .\nWho, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross! (Philippians 2:5-8).\nAs we shift from celebrating the birth of Christ to commemorating the example of His life, death and resurrection, let us also shift our self-centered tendencies towards others by prioritizing their needs and well-being.\nWe can do this by lending a helping hand, offering a listening ear, including someone who feels left out, volunteering time or donating resources to a worthy cause, and by essentially putting others first in our decision-making and actions.\nWhat a different world this would be if in our relationships with one another we had the mind of Christ by doing \"nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. But rather, in humility valuing others above ourselves, not looking to our own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.\" (Philippians 2:3-4) \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is very interesting to consider what people seem most passionate about.Everyone seems to be passionate about something.\nAs Christians, we are passionate about many things — God, family, rights, the list can go on and on. But how many of us Christians (followers of Christ) are passionate about Jesus' last words before ascending to Heaven?\nMark 16:15 — And He said to them, \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.\"\nThere are so many Christians today passionate about politics, conspiracies, health, theology, but not many are passionate about Christ's last words.\nWe need to on guard so that we do not become better at winning arguments, than at winning souls. God have mercy on us and forgive us of this great neglect. Give us ears to hear and hearts to receive and obey your word to us.\n2 Timothy 4:2. — Preach the Gospel in season, and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine. Help us Lord to remember that the last words of our Lord Jesus Christ are called the Great Commission, and not the Great Option.\nLord strengthen us to do your will. In Jesus' name, Amen. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "author": "MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking",
    "content": "Country Cooking: Inventive recipes from the 1940s\n\n February 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1294\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Yes, it is that time of year again. And I do not mean Super Bowl, or Valentine's Day or tax time. It is a time that I let slip by quietly.I was born on Feb. 11, 194... My mother told me it was 3 degrees that February morning. I was born at home, so that meant the doctor traveled across town on snow- and ice-covered roads. My sister was 10 years old and at that time. I already had six older brothers, soon to be followed by three more brothers.\nMy sister's birthday was Feb. 15, and she did not want to share birthday parties. Some world and national news in the 1940s included the Italian partisans killed Mussolini, Hitler committing suicide after destroying major cities in Germany, World War II ending, Harry Truman taking the office of President after Roosevelt passed away.\nNot only were things hard on our Bishopville farm, but the whole world was feeling the impact of World War 2. Creativity blossomed during the Great Depression and carried on into the 1940s.\nThe decade of the 1940s brought many things to our world: The microwave oven, ball point pens, Velcro, Tupperware and the frozen orange juice.\nHistory has shown us again and again that financial hardship drives people to get a little more inventive in the kitchen.\nWartime rations necessitated substitutes and ingredient-stretching techniques. As a matter of fact, on the back of my birth certificate are stamps for sugar and flour. Thankfully, my parents never needed to use them.\nAfter the war ended, food manufacturers explored methods that gave products a longer shelf life. During the latter half of the decade, more convenience products arrived on shelves as scientists delved into researching food preservation.\nLike most 1940s recipes, meatloaf experienced a resurgence in popularity during the Great Depression. The use of bread or cracker crumbs helped stretch the ground beef as it was getting harder and harder to come by.\nWhen the soldiers came back home from the Pacific they also brought home a love of SPAM. Philippines, Guam, Hawaii and Okinawa were places Spam was the most popular. Most of the time eggs were mixed with Spam because they were cheap and most everyone had chickens in the backyard.\n\"Victory Gardens\" were another big thing in the 1940s. Many papers circulated various vegetable recipes. Soups and stews were cost-effective meals that could also stretch more precious ingredients such as meat and dairy.\nNo bake cookies that used things such as Corn flakes were served in just about all houses, even the White House.\nOne invention that has surely at one time or another been in just about everyone's hands — the corn dog — was created by German immigrants in Texas, who were sausage-makers finding resistance to the sausages they used to make. They have been credited with introducing the corn dog to the United States in the early 1920s, though the serving stick came later.\nCarl and Neil Fletcher can claim that having introduced their \"Corny Dogs\" at the State Fair of Texas sometime in 1942. In 1946, on Muscle Beach in Santa Monica, California, Dave Barham opened the first Hot Dog on a Stick location.\nSo, as you see, the corn dog has a long disputed history, but boy are we glad to have it.\nHere are some recipes from the 1940s this week to not only celebrate my birthday but to revisit a time where counting every penny and getting creative was a must.\nHOMEMADE CORN DOGS1 cup yellow cornmeal, 1 cup all-purpose flour, ¼ cup white sugar, 4 tsps baking powder, ¼ tsp salt, ⅛ tsp black pepper, 1 cup milk, 1 egg, 1 quart vegetable oil for frying, 2 (16-oz) packages beef frankfurters, a pack of wooden skewers.\nCombine cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and pepper in a medium bowl; stir in milk and egg to make a batter. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees, pat frankfurters dry and insert a skewer into each one, roll frankfurters in batter until well coated. Fry two or three corn dogs at a time in preheated oil until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.\n1940s BROWN SUGAR MEATLOAFCooking spray, ½ cup packed brown sugar, ½ cup ketchup, 1 ½ lbs lean ground beef, 2 large eggs, 1 small onion (chopped), ¾ cup milk, ¾ cup finely crushed saltine cracker crumbs, 1 ½ tsps salt, ¼ tsp ground black pepper, ¼ tsp ground ginger.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease a 5-by-9-inch loaf pan. Press brown sugar into the bottom of the prepared loaf pan and spread ketchup over sugar. Mix all remaining ingredients thoroughly in a mixing bowl and shape into a loaf. Place on top of the ketchup and sugar crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour or until juices are clear.\nSPAM AND EGGS2 large eggs (beaten), 1 container fully cooked luncheon meat, 2 oz Cheddar cheese (grated).\nCube the meat. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour eggs into the skillet, then scatter luncheon meat over top. Cook and stir until eggs are nearly set, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle cheese over top and stir until cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes.\nGARDEN FRESH TOMATO SOUP4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes, 2 cups chicken broth, 4 cloves garlic, 1 large slice of onion, 2 tbsps butter, 2 tbsps all-purpose flour, 2 tsps white sugar to taste, 1 tsp salt to taste.\nCombine tomatoes, chicken broth, garlic cloves and a large slice of onion in a stockpot over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and gently simmer for about 20 minutes to blend flavors. Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl or pan, Melt butter over medium heat in the now empty stockpot. Stir in flour to make a roux by cooking, whisking constantly, until the mixture turns medium brown. Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture to prevent lumps from forming, then stir in the rest. Season with sugar and salt to taste.\nNO BAKE COOKIES½ cup white sugar, ½ cup light corn syrup, 2 tbsps butter, ½ cup peanut butter, 3 cups of corn flakes cereal.\nBring sugar and corn syrup to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in butter and peanut butter until thoroughly combined, then remove from the heat. Place cornflakes into a large bowl. Pour peanut butter mixture over top and mix until cornflakes are well coated. Drop 1-tablespoon scoops of the mixture onto a waxed-paper lined baking sheet. Flatten slightly if desired, then allow to cool for 30 minutes before serving.\nSTUFFED PEPPERS\n1 cup cold water,½ cup uncooked long grain white rice,1 tablespoon vegetable oil,1 pound ground beef,6 medium green bell peppers,16 ounces tomato sauce, divided,1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce,¼ teaspoon garlic powder,¼ teaspoon onion powder, salt and ground black pepper to taste,1 teaspoon Italian seasoning. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Bring water and rice to a boil in a covered saucepan. Reduce heat to low and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef and cook until evenly browned and crumbly, 7 to 9 minutes. Hollow out bell peppers by removing and discarding the tops, seeds, and membranes. Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary to make sure they stand up straight. Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward. Prepare filling by mixing cooked beef, cooked rice, 1/2 of the tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Spoon an equal amount of filling into each hollowed pepper. Mix remaining tomato sauce and Italian seasoning in a bowl, and pour over the stuffed peppers. Bake in the preheated oven, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until peppers are tender, about 1 hour. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings: 'You have done it to me'\n\n February 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KEN GEORGE Ridgely Church of the Brethren | Section: Columns \n \n 280\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I once heard a pastor say that sitting in a garage doesn't make you a car. In the same way, sitting in church doesn't make you a Christian.A Christian isn't someone who goes to church. This church is a place for us to gather; to praise and worship God; to learn about Jesus, His teachings and how we can apply these to our own lives. With that in mind, a Christian is someone who walks and talks the way of Jesus not just in church, but anywhere and everywhere.\nIn Matthew 25, verses 34-40, Jesus teaches us how we should treat the hungry, the thirsty, the destitute, the sick and the imprisoned, saying \"What you do for the least of these, you do for Me.\"\nHe didn't specify that this should be done for fellow Hebrews, or just His followers. My friends, whatever we do for the poor, the downtrodden, the helpless, the homeless, the oppressed, the imprisoned, the stranger, we do for Jesus. He also made it clear that what we don't do for those in need, we don't do for Him.\nI believe all of us will do whatever we can to help those in need. When they come to us, we are ready to assist in any way we can. Better yet, let's make the effort to seek them out. Jesus did that, too.\nJohn Wesley made it easy to remember, saying, \"Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, for as long as you can.\"\nAfter all, we're doing it to Jesus. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Less is more: 5 ingredient dinners are easier than you think\n\n February 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jessica Haggard Food Drink Life | Section: Entertainment \n \n 1004\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n From TikTok trends to Jamie Oliver's newest cookbook, minimalist cooking is extremely popular. The internet agrees: five-ingredient dinners are not only easier to cook but can be just as delicious and satisfying as more elaborate meals.Whether you're short on groceries or looking to simplify your way of cooking, mastering the art of minimalist meals is surprisingly easy. Here are tips to help you create effortless, minimal-ingredient dinners without the stress.\nBuild around pantry staplesStart with versatile pantry staples like pasta, rice or canned items like beans, corn or tomatoes as your base. Canned goods are not only affordable and convenient but also have a long shelf life, making them perfect for quick and easy meals.\nThese staples pair well with a variety of ingredients and create a solid foundation for your dish. For example, combine spaghetti, olive oil and garlic, then top with red pepper flakes and parmesan for a straightforward yet delicious pasta dish, or toss canned black beans with rice, salsa, diced avocado and shredded cheese for a quick burrito bowl.\nKnoxville Backyard & Beyond 's Amanda Luhn's go-to quick meal is rice and beans. She says, \"You can add almost any kind of vegetable about to go bad and make it into a stir fry with some soy sauce. Or make it a casserole-like dish with ground beef and cheese and bake it. Add chicken and some mushroom sauce and it's something else.\"\nUtilize multi-use ingredientsOn TikTok, creators showcase a variety of quick and easy recipes that require only a few ingredients. For instance, the five-ingredient dinner with one hand trend emphasizes simplicity by using protein, vegetables and basic seasonings to craft a wholesome meal.\nThis approach is perfect for when you want to keep things simple and versatile in the kitchen. Opt for ingredients that can do double duty in your recipe. A rotisserie chicken can be shredded for tacos, tossed into a salad or mixed into a casserole. Humble potatoes can be turned into mashed potatoes, French fries and potato soups.\nThis TikTok video created by @_terriesmith shows an easy creamy ranch bowtie pasta made with chicken breasts, cream cheese, cream of chicken soup, ranch seasoning and bowtie pasta. A simple search of \"five ingredient recipes chicken\" on the platform will give you plenty of fun and easy ideas for using a multi-use ingredient like chicken.\nEmbrace prepped and packaged itemsDon't shy away from pre-cut vegetables, frozen fruits or jarred sauces to reduce prep time. For example, frozen stir-fry veggies paired with soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic and cooked shrimp can make a quick and flavorful meal. Convenience items can be a lifesaver when working with fewer ingredients.\nGena Lazcano from Ginger Casa shares, \"I always keep noodles in all varieties, jarred pasta sauce, mozzarella cheese and ground beef on hand. I have three kids who love this meal each and every time, so I know I can't go wrong. It makes a quick and easy meal.\" These simple, go-to items make meal prep much faster while allowing you to create a delicious dish without much effort.\nUse bold flavorsWith fewer ingredients, it's essential to maximize flavor. As celebrity chef Jamie Oliver shared on Good Morning America while talking about his newest cookbook, \"5 Ingredients Mediterranean: Simple Incredible Food,\" \"Keep the shopping list really low. Keep it easy. Focus on flavors and technique and really nice quick meals that you can have for breakfast, lunch or dinner.\"\nThe same philosophy applies when cooking with just a few ingredients — using fresh herbs, citrus, spices or vinegar can enhance your dishes without adding complexity. A squeeze of lemon or a sprinkle of smoked paprika can transform even the simplest meals into something memorable. Whether you're making a quick pasta or a salad, bold seasonings can improve your meal without complicating the process.\nMaster one-pan mealsOne-pan meals are perfect for keeping things simple and reducing cleanup, making them ideal for busy nights when you want a satisfying meal without the mess. The beauty of one-pan meals lies in their versatility — simply toss together ingredients that you have on hand then roast everything on a sheet pan. Pork chops with potatoes, carrots and onions roasted in olive oil make a filling five-ingredient dinner.\nNot only does this method save time, but it also allows all the flavors to meld together as they cook. You can easily swap in different proteins and vegetables based on what you have on hand, which makes cooking easier and more flexible. The result is a hearty, satisfying dish with minimal effort and just one pan to clean. This cooking style is ideal for busy families, singles or anyone looking for a no-fuss way to prepare a wholesome family meal.\nGet creative with leftoversTransforming leftovers into a fresh, new meal is a great way to reduce food waste and stretch your ingredients further. Take last night's roasted vegetables and combine them with eggs and cheese to create a quick frittata, or turn leftover rice into a delicious fried rice dish with soy sauce, scrambled eggs and frozen peas.\nThese simple swaps not only save time but also allow you to be creative in the kitchen, making the most out of what you already have. You can even use leftover two-ingredient salsa chicken to make a tasty stir-fry or repurpose it into wraps or sandwiches, offering endless possibilities for quick, flavorful dinners. By thinking creatively, you can easily breathe new life into leftovers and enjoy a fresh and exciting meal.\n5 ingredients, zero stressCooking with just five ingredients is all about simplicity and smart choices. Cap off your dinners with desserts like three-ingredient fudge and you'll wonder how you ever cooked any other way. By building around staples, using bold flavors and embracing a little creativity, you can make delicious dinners without breaking a sweat — or your budget.\nJessica Haggard is dedicated to helping people cook easy everyday recipes focusing on bioavailable and nutrient-dense foods.

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings: What happens when a person is born again?\n\n February 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DON REYNOLDS Calvary Baptist Church | Section: Columns \n \n 330\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When anyone who turns from their sin and truly believes in the Lord Jesus Christ to be their Savior, that person's life truly changes. Today I would like to mention some of the things that happen.First, if a person is in Christ, he or she does not enjoy sin any more. If we love Him, we will remember that our sin is crucifying Him afresh, and then we just simply can't enjoy that sin. Yes when our Lord and Savior comes into our hearts we lose our pleasure in sin.\nSecondly when a person is truly saved (born again — John 3:3) he loves the gospel of Jesus Christ. One lady stated, \"I never do get tired of hearing you proclaim Jesus as Savior.\" It ought to be that way with every Christian.\nThirdly, if a person is in Christ, he loves to see others saved. A genuine Christian remembers that once he was lost, and he remembers the joy that came to him when he was saved. Now he wants others to have the same joy. The born-again person feels a burden for lost souls. He rejoices when others are saved.\nFourth, if a person is in Christ, he has a different attitude toward all others. A proof of a genuine follower of Christ is that a Christian must love all people. This is proof of his salvation. \"By this shall men know that ye are my disciple, because ye have love one for another.\"\nAnother piece of evidence of a person who is truly born-again — he truly lives for two worlds. The person who is truly saved sees that the things of this world do not count. His life becomes one of giving living, always wanting to do for others in the name of Christ. Every bit of service rendered, every dollar contributed means that you are laying up treasure in heaven.\nJesus changed my life over 50 years ago. Yes, when He comes into one's life all things become new. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

That may have been the time when remains interred was part of a live person.\n\"I believe it was from somebody's private cemetery when the cliffs used to be way, way out,\" George Oliver told Southern Maryland News.\nOliver, who resides in Chesapeake Ranch Estates, frequently visits beach areas at the base of the cliffs, mostly in search of sharks' teeth and other fossils.\nThe Alabama native recalled the discovery of what turned out to be a coffin containing human remains at the edge of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\"I found it in November and discovered there was a skeleton in it,\" Oliver said. \"I had been seeing it for months. It was sitting up out of the water. I just thought it was wood filled with sand.\"\nOliver said he contacted local law enforcement and was told of his find, \"You can have it. There's nothing there.\"\nNotifications were made to Calvert Marine Museum and the Calvert County Historical Society.\n\"Our parish was contacted several weeks ago by the county historic planner, Christopher Sperling,\" Hugh Davies, a parishioner at Middleham and St. Peter's, said. \"He informed us that the county had received the remains of an unknown person and asked if they might be reinterred in the Middleham cemetery. The church had provided such a reinterment over 10 years ago.\"\nOliver also had been involved with that discovery.\n\"In 2008, we found a leg,\" Oliver said, adding that he had hoped the leg was missing from the remains he had found in late last year. However, remains of two legs were identified from that find.\nOther information provided by the church stated the best estimate of the time of the coffin and remains is the late 19th century.\nChurch officials reported that a general conclusion reached is that the person \"was likely a Christian\" and that reinterment was needed. The Lusby church was deemed the most appropriate place for the interment, in part since Middleham Chapel is the oldest church building in Calvert County, dating back to 1684.\nPastor Erin Betz Shank, priest in charge at the parish, recited the service drawn from the Book of Common Prayer.\nA white cloth bag containing the bones located within the coffin was re-placed in the coffin and attendees were invited to deposit handfuls of earth into the grave.\n\"We therefore commit their body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust,\" Shank recited during the service, which included the reciting of the Lord's Prayer. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pastoral Ponderings: The Lenten season\n\n March 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DANIEL T. GEDMAN St. Luke’s GMC | Section: News \n \n 332\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Lenten season begins today, a day called Ash Wednesday.Ashes are a sign of mortality and repentance. The uses of ashes dates back to ancient Jewish tradition and often were associated with sacrifices, mourning and fasting. A person would properly express grief, humiliation and repentance sitting in ashes or placing them on the head.\nAt one time, during the early centuries of the church, public penitents at Rome were ceremonially admitted on this day to begin their penance.\nThis ceremony fell into disuse between the eighth and 10th centuries as general penance of the entire congregation began to take place. This penance was symbolized through the imposition of ashes.\nAnother use for ashes in the early church (second century) included a regular ceremony of public confession and penance. This use had acquired so much significance that Tertullian (a prolific early Christian author from Carthage in the Roman province of Africa) spoke of \"the substitution of sackcloth and ashes for a man's usual habit.\"\nToday, ashes symbolize the same meanings though the ceremonial customs have vanished. The one exception to this is Ash Wednesday.\nThe word \"Lent\" derives from the anglo-saxon term lencten, meaning \"spring.\" During this time we earnestly recount all that God accomplished through the work of Jesus Christ.\nWe experience this period every year in the life of the church, but often, we forget, or sometimes we never knew what this time of year is about. Lent as a forty-day period of focus on penitence and preparation for the Resurrection Event of Easter. Today, we tend to observe Lent as a time of penance, by abstaining from festivals, by almsgiving, and by devoting more than the usual time to exercises of the faith. In recent years, more emphasis has been placed on these aspects than the physical fasting that marked this season in the early church.\nI pray that this Lenten season would be a holy and sacred time of preparation for the celebration of the greatest day in human history; the resurrection of Jesus Christ. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hundreds pay their final respects to UD skaters killed in plane crash\n\n March 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Josh Shannon jshannon@chespub.com | Section: State News \n \n 596\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Hundreds gathered at the Fred Rust Ice Arena last month to pay their final respects to the five members of the University of Delaware ice skating community who died in a plane crash in January.Beloved coach Alexandr \"Sasha\" Kirsanov, promising young skaters Sean Kay and Angela Yang, and the kids' mothers, Julia Kay and Zheheng \"Lily\" Li, were among 67 people who were killed Jan. 29 when a commercial airliner collided with a military helicopter on the approach to Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. The Delaware victims were returning from a national skating competition in Wichita, Kansas.\nAt the arena Feb. 22, five caskets were placed on the ice where Kirsanov and his young students spent so much time honing their craft. Family members, friends and community members filed by them as a large screen displayed photos and videos of those lost.\nOutside, the Delaware State Police Pipes and Drums Unit played a somber song as the five caskets were carried to waiting hearses. They received a police escort to Gracelawn Memorial Park near New Castle, where the families held a private burial.\nThe victims\nKirsanov came to the University of Delaware in the mid 1990s as a Russian junior champion. He was part of a group of Russian skaters who followed their coaches to train at UD's storied skating program, which has seen many of its skaters have success at the highest levels.\nAfter retiring from competition, he stayed at UD and served as a coach with the High Performance Training Center and the university's collegiate skating team. He was known as a tough coach who cared deeply about the skaters he mentored.\n\"He brought so much love and energy to our team, filling every practice, every competition and every moment in between with passion and encouragement,\" Melissa Maldonado, president of UD's club figure skating team, said earlier this month. \"He wasn't just invested in our skating. He was invested in us as people.\"\nEleven-year-old Sean Kay was outgoing and funny. His smile lit up the arena, he was always ready with a fun fact about roller coasters, and his love for the band Metallica was legendary.\nAngela Yang, also 11, was quieter but sweet. She made other skaters laugh with her Snapchat messages and always dreamed big.\nBoth kids had trained at UD for a while but this was their first season as ice dancing partners. Both dreamed of making the Olympics, and they had won gold in a recent ice dancing competition.\nThe young skaters still had a lot of training to do but were on pace to be elite, according to coach Joel McKeever.\n\"They loved the sport,\" McKeever said earlier this month. \"It was their lives. And you could tell it was going to be their lives for the rest of their lives.\"\nBoth Julia Kay and Lily Li worked hard to support their kids' dreams.\nKay spent her days taking Sean and his siblings to training and her nights working as a nurse to pay for costumes, travel and coaching. Yang raised Angela and two other children by herself while her husband worked overseas to support the family. She managed her own business and moved the family to Delaware to help Angela pursue her skating dreams.\n\"They were their biggest supporters, their strongest advocates and their greatest source of love,\" Maldonado said. \"They dedicated so much of their time, energy and hearts to making sure their kids had every opportunity to succeed. Their love for their children was limitless. Their strength, kindness and emotion were evident in everything they did, and the bond they shared with their kids was something truly special.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Relighting candles over the years\n\n March 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 335\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Recently, as I was sorting through papers I have kept over the years, I came across a letter to the editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer that I had written on March 30, 1982. Of course, I was much younger then.I had attended a peaceful protest march to Stop the Nuclear Arms Race. There were two images I particularly carried with me from that experience. I still do.\nQuoting from that letter: \"The first is the image of the middle of the road. With police and courteous drivers granting us the right of way, we walked literally down the middle of the roads leading from our meeting places to Independence Hall, over 15,000 people joined in a cause neither radical nor reactionary, but reasonable, logical, right and absolutely necessary.\"\n\"The second is the image of the lighted candle. In the cold night with a chill wind blowing, one has to be alert and active to keep one's candle burning. Mine went out several times, but when mine went out the candle of the person next to me seemed to stay lit. Someone's candle always re-lit mine, and I had chances to re-light others' too.\"\nWe are all older now, and the issues are surely different; however, some seem equally dangerous. The United States of America must not desert Ukraine and our allies in the free world. In my opinion that would be unprincipled, even immoral and extremely ill-advised for the sake of our own nation.\nAgain, quoting from the letter, \"I hope and pray our political, intellectual, scientific, social and religious leaders will put their enormous energies into finding a way that will not embrace the extreme ... but will find a way for peace with justice.\" I believe that is what the great majority of citizens in our country want, and it is our duty to say so. As someone who sometimes finds it hard to keep one candle lit, I think I must try harder. If this letter has re-lit anyone else's candle, I am glad.\nPATRICIA BRADLEY\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "On Gardening: Three-part harmony container design for beginners\n\n March 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Norman Winter | Section: Entertainment \n \n 560\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As spring approaches at jet speed and you start thinking about planting mixed containers (but perhaps with a little fear of the partnerships) keep in mind three-part harmony. It certainly works in church music, and it is perfect for gardeners too!In the world of garden color, we call it triadic harmony. Simply put, triadic harmony is three colors spread equal distance apart on the color wheel. So in the mixed container or basket, this would be three colors of flowers to create pleasing harmony.\nRowe Farms is not only one of my favorite growers of seasonal flower color, but their Facebook page is a textbook on design ideas. Though they are in Jacksonville, a small city in east Texas, their product is found in Dallas, Fort Worth, Oklahoma City, Houston and Shreveport and locations in between.\nRecently they featured some recipes that would soon be hitting garden centers. One was called Prime Time, and the other was Santa Belle. Of course, if you find ready-made baskets or planters, you've got your design creation. If you find the individual plants for sale you can copy the recipe. But Prime Time and Santa Belle, though created with different plants, have one thing the same, and that is color. They each have red, blue and yellow in a perfect triadic or three-part harmony.\nThe PrimeTime recipe features three Supertunia Mini Vista petunias, Yellow, Indigo and Scarlet that will dazzle all summer. Superbells Grape Punch, Pomegranate Punch and Yellow calibrachoas could have accomplished a similar look or recipe. This is what the Santa Belle recipe did but using Laguna Dark Blue lobelia, Superbells Yellow calibrachoa and Superbena Scarlet Eye verbena.\nThe red, blue and yellow scheme is one of the easiest for gardeners to put together. I used Superbena Violet Ice verbena, Supertunia Mini Vista Scarlet petunia and Superbells Yellow calibrachoa. Triadic harmony with red, blue and yellow delivers a lot of dazzle in quick and easy fashion.\nLast spring I did another container with some of this year's new flowers, Virtuoso Classy Carmine dahlia, Stardiva Blue scaevola and Supertunia Saffron Finch petunia with cheerful yellow flowers. The colors were perfect!\nIf you have noticed, the rules in triadic harmony, particularly when using flowers, are not exacting or mandatory in color, but approximations. Some of our blues were violets and indigo, and even Superbells Grape Punch is purple with blackeye but looks blue throughout the day with changing light angles.\nAlways remember substitutes are allowed. One of my favorite containers from a couple of years ago featured Superbells Grape Punch calibrachoa, Supertunia Mini Vista Scarlet petunia and since I did not have a yellow flower available, I used Snow Princess sweet alyssum with white flowers as the perfect substitute. They say white is the absence of color, but I am not sure I buy that when it comes to flowers.\nRed, blue and yellow is like harmony for beginners. Look at color wheels online and pick out your favorite color. Then you can see which colors are equal distances apart. I like orange so one of its colors is green, which of course will come from leaves.\nYou may have heard an old saying that close only works with horseshoes and hand grenades, but I assure you it works in picking harmonious flower colors too.\nStart planning for spring and follow me on my Facebook page @NormanWinterTheGardenGuy for more photos and garden inspiration. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

When people share accurate information, our community stays safe.The Dorchester County Republican Central Committee recently said protesters were being brought here on buses. That is not accurate. While some protesters come from other counties, most are local. They live here in Dorchester, mostly from Cambridge, which is a Democratic stronghold, or nearby places like Worcester and Talbot counties. They are Andy Harris's constituents, just like you.\nEven more troubling are claims about threats of violence. No proof has been shown to support these claims.

    "content": "COUNTRY COOKING: Hamburger favorite recipes\n\n March 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1226\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After a cold snowy winter, we are ready for that extra hour of daylight and warmer temperatures. Everyone is already talking about the yard work and clean-up that needs to be done. This brings back those memories of my childhood on the farm.We would go out on a spring Saturday morning to do yard and farm work for the day. My mother, my sister and I did the yard work around the house, and my dad and brothers did the barnyard and ditch banks close to the house and barn.\nThe fields were eventually spread with manure later during the week by the farmhands. Oh, what a lovely spring cleaning smell that was.\nSince we lived out in the country, we were used to it, but boy, those town kids on that school bus that came to the country were not.\nI decided to make the recipes this week using ground beef, and I remembered the farmer my father bought our beef from. We raised our own pork but bought our beef.\nRaising beef began with a small herd of cows who gave birth once a year to calves. We had one milk cow, and that was enough to do with all the chickens, hogs, ducks and geese we had. The cattle needed lots of grazing fields, and we had a small pasture.\nGround beef was always popular with the cooks as you could make so many different dishes. When you are looking for the tastiest, cheapest, fastest meals, ground beef is number one.\nIt is very versatile, quick cooking and great for when you have a crowd to feed. Keep some burger on hand to make those classic dishes like meatloaf, burgers, barbecue meatballs, tater tot casserole, goulash, tacos and taco bake, stuffed peppers, chili, sloppy joe's, shepherd pie and much more. Let's get started.\nSTUFFED PEPPERS\n6 medium green bell peppers (tops and seeds removed), 2 tbsps vegetable oil, 1 large onion (finely chopped), Kosher salt, 1 pound ground beef, 2 large cloves garlic (finely chopped), freshly ground black pepper, 1 28-oz can diced fire-roasted tomatoes, 2 cups cooked rice, 1 cup loosely packed fresh parsley leaves (roughly chopped), 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella, 1/2 cup plain dry breadcrumbs, 2 large eggs (lightly beaten), 4 tsps Worcestershire sauce.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Add about 2 inches of water to a large pot fitted with a steamer insert, and bring to a high simmer. Arrange the peppers in the steamer, cover the pot and cook, rotating the peppers as needed, until they are very tender and pliable, about 25 minutes. Remove the peppers with a slotted spoon and drain upside-down on paper towels. Put the oil, onions and a pinch of salt in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent, about 8 minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high. Add the beef, garlic, 2 tsps salt and a few grinds of pepper, and cook, stirring and breaking the beef up, until browned and mostly cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat. Let cool in the skillet for at least 10 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl, add the rice, parsley, 1 cup of the mozzarella, breadcrumbs, eggs and Worcestershire and mix to combine. Stand the peppers up in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. If they fall over, cut away a little of the bottoms (without cutting through the pepper) to make a flat surface. Generously fill and pack the peppers with the meat-rice mixture. Top with the remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella. Add just enough water to the pan to cover the bottom to help steam the peppers. Loosely cover with foil, and bake until the peppers are tender and the filling is heated through, about 30 minutes. Remove the foil, and continue to bake for 10 minutes more. Traditionally people use green peppers, but you can use any of the colors available.\nHAMBURGER STEAKS WITH GRAVY\nHamburger Steaks: 1/2 tsp ground mustard, 1/2 tsp smoked paprika, 1 large egg, 1 clove garlic (minced), salt and freshly ground black pepper, 1 pound ground beef (80/20 works the best), 2 tbsps breadcrumbs, 1 tbsp vegetable oil.\nOnion and Mushroom Gravy: 10 ounces baby bella mushrooms (sliced), 2 sprigs thyme (leaves picked and stems discarded), 3 tbsps unsalted butter, 1 small onion (thinly sliced), 1 clove garlic (sliced), 3 tbsps all-purpose flour, 2 cups low-sodium beef broth (hot), 2 tsps Worcestershire sauce, 2 tbsps fresh parsley (roughly chopped).\nFor the hamburger steaks: Whisk together the mustard, smoked paprika, egg, garlic, 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper in a medium mixing bowl. Mix in the ground beef and breadcrumbs by hand, then form into 4 oval patties, about 1/2 inch thick. Set a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat and add the oil. Add the patties and brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the patties to a plate; set aside. For the onion and mushroom gravy: Turn the heat down to medium and add the mushrooms and thyme. Cook until the mushrooms release their liquid and are browned, about 8 minutes. (The mushrooms might seem dry at first, but will eventually release liquid and add moisture to the pan.) Transfer the mushrooms to a plate; set aside. Melt the butter in the pan, add the onions and garlic and cook until translucent and lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour and cook, stirring, until the butter and liquid are absorbed, about 1 minute. Pour the broth and Worcestershire into the pan and stir until the flour is dissolved. Turn the heat to high and bring to a boil. Stir the mushrooms back into the pan and nestle in the beef patties. Cover with a lid and reduce the heat to medium low. Let simmer until the sauce has thickened and a thermometer inserted into the patties registers 165 degrees, about 10 minutes. Turn the patties over a few times to coat in the sauce. Season with salt and pepper and top with the parsley.\nWESTLINE MEATLOAF\n1 tsp dry mustard, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1 pound ground beef, 1/2 onion (finely chopped), 1 egg, 2 tsps Worcestershire sauce, 1 cup breadcrumbs, 1 cup ketchup.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, mix together the horseradish, mustard, salt and pepper. Set aside. In a large bowl, mix ground beef, onion, egg and Worcestershire sauce. Add the contents of a small bowl and mix thoroughly. Add the breadcrumbs and combine well. Place mixture into a 1-pound loaf pan. Pour ketchup over top and place in the oven. Bake uncovered for 45 to 60 minutes.\nHAMBURGER or CHEESEBURGER\n1 large egg,½ tsp salt, ½ tsp ground black pepper, 1 pound ground beef, ½ cup fine dry breadcrumbs.\nPreheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Whisk egg, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Add ground beef and breadcrumbs; mix with your hands or a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties. Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook for 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees. If you are going to use cheese, this is the time you'd lay a slice on top so it starts to melt as the burger cooks. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It brings with it a new birth and freshness we all seem to need after this winter's cold and snow.The days get longer, the temperature rises, the tulips break through the earth, singing a song of praise, the soil is being prepared for the planting of fresh crops. New life is unfolding before us each day. There seems to be joy and a sigh of relief that says moving forward.\nThis is also the Lenten season, where we as Christians remember and observe the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert before his ministry began. He was challenged and tempted by Satan but endured it all so he could be Our Lord, Our God of all.\nThis is a special and hollowed time leading to Resurrection Sunday. We prepare our hearts through prayer and fasting to celebrate the victory given to all mankind at the blood-stained cross of Calvary.\nKing David prayed in Psalm 51 that the Lord would purge and wash him, to blot out his sin and renew a right spirit within him. This should be the daily prayer and cry from all mankind, especially during the Lenten season.\nLord make me, make us pure, clean and Holy in your sight. We are all children of God created in his wonderful image, called to sing and show forth his praises and glory.\nWe occupy a world that is torn and broken by the hands and minds of man. Because of this our families, communities and even our churches are experiencing brokenness and collapse. Fear not, I can assure you today that we serve a God who is over it all and will get the Glory. Praise God.\nAs we seek his face, seek his wisdom, repent and turn from every weight and besetting sin, we will see his hand and power during this Lenten season. Just make it all about Jesus, the one who can fix it, the one who is faithful and true. This only comes through prayer and fasting.\nAll our need, the Lord will supply. Help us, Lord Jesus, during this Lenten season to acknowledge you and receive you afresh and anew. God's blessings upon you all. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The second challenge was how Britain should deal with the Soviet Union whose leaders were key allies during that same war, but post war; those same leaders were pursuing, maintaining and expanding the Soviet Union's spheres of influence and their communist ideology worldwide.\nChurchill's guiding principle forward was pragmatic. In a world characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, he would not expect permanent allies or permanent adversaries. He would pursue permanent interests.\nRecently, two U.S. senators from Pennsylvania embraced Churchill's guiding principle in American politics in a relatively small, but very instructive way. What makes this instructive is these two senators have deeply held and stark differences in their political allegiances and political philosophies.\nJohn Fetterman is a left-of-center Democratic senator who was endorsed by Bernie Sanders in his successful Senate primary election campaign and his successful general election campaign.\nIn the 2024 Presidential election, Fetterman strongly supported Joe Biden's reelection and strongly defended Biden when there were widespread calls for him to withdraw from the race.\nWhen Biden did withdraw and was replaced by Kamala Harris as the Democratic standard bearer, Fetterman endorsed her and campaigned for her throughout Pennsylvania.\nDavid McCormick is a right-of-center Republican senator who was endorsed by Donald Trump in his successful Senate primary campaign and his successful general election campaign.\nIn McCormick's challenge to Pennsylvania's then incumbent left-of-center Democratic Sen. Robert Casey, Fetterman endorsed Casey and campaigned for him.\nSince those elections, their differences have not stopped the two senators from working together on select issues of shared interest, shared thinking and mutual respect.\nOne example is the role of mentorships in changing lives.\nBoth McCormick and Fetterman have a deep commitment to mentoring based on their respective firsthand experiences.\nWhile in college, Fetterman's best friend died in a car accident. Immediately following that tragedy, Fetterman volunteered to be a mentor for Big Brothers and Big Sisters of America. He was assigned to an 8-year-old boy whose father had died from AIDS and whose mother was dying from cancer. Fetterman promised the boy's mother he would continue to be his mentor after her death.\nIn high school, McCormick was a mediocre benchwarmer on the football team. A new coach saw promise in him, mentored him and made McCormick one of the team's co-captains. That experience helped McCormick boost his low self-confidence and graduate from West Point.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, McCormick and his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, concluded that too many Americans, including their six daughters, suffered greatly from a lack of mentors.\nAs a result, they coauthored \"Who Believed in You?\" a book that includes interviews with successful leaders who had a mentor who saw something in them they may not have seen in themselves and helped them find and achieve their purpose in life.\nThose interviewed include Gov. Wes Moore; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Tory Burch, chief creative fashion designer and executive chairperson of Tory Burch LLC as well as founder of the Tory Burch foundation; Hollywood producer Brian Grazer, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\nAs a result of their mutual appreciation of the value of mentoring, McCormick, Fetterman, and their spouses (both of whom also have personal positive mentoring stories to share), agreed to three events where they would discuss their experiences and promote Who Believed in You?\nMcCormick, Fetterman and their spouses also met for a dinner, a most effective way for people to get to know, understand and respect each other. Following that dinner McCormick said, \"I trust him. I think he's a very authentic guy. I think he's going to be a good partner.\"\nSadly, the first two of the mentoring events were postponed due to \"unforeseen logistical issues\" and the third event was canceled due to a \"scheduling conflict.\" I believe the reasons were concerns over peaceful outcomes from protests before, during or after the events.\nThis is a prime example of how a tyranny of the loud is regularly disrupting much needed efforts to advance the cause of civil political discourse in our society.\nThis unexpected turn of events is also a call to action for elected officials and citizens in our community, our region, our state and our country to commit to doing two things.\nWe can, and we must replicate the actions of two these U.S. senators with efforts to get to know, understand, trust, respect and seek common ground with others who have opposite political affiliations and opposite views on many local, state and national public policy issues.\nMore importantly, we can, and we must commit to maintaining a permanent interest on civil and respectful dialogue, which will help us coexist in a society where even when we have inevitable disagreements on a wide range of public policy issues, we can disagree without being disagreeable. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "For many Social Security is their sole income\n\n April 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LENA GILL | Section: Columns \n \n 678\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Frances Perkins, the famous female labor secretary appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt, chaired the committee that drafted legislation for Social Security, enacted in 1935.It was a reliable insurance system for all working Americans. If you paid into it monthly, you knew that if you lost your job, became disabled or died, you or your survivors would receive a pension based on how much you paid in. Before that, the consequence was often destitution. As of February 2025, an estimated 73.2 million Americans received Social Security checks. In Talbot County, 30% of residents rely on Social Security benefits for income. For nearly half of them, it is their sole income.\nSocial Security is so popular it is considered a \"third rail of politics\" because politicians dare not vote to reduce benefits, as they and their party will face certain defeat in the next election. Most Republicans and President Trump pledged before the election not to reduce Social Security benefits.\nInstead, Trump brought in his front man, Elon Musk and his DOGE musketeers to eviscerate Social Security, not by reducing benefits, but by slashing workers and field offices that make the program administrable. They suggest staff cutbacks of 7,000 persons, out of today's staff of 57,000 that is already considered insufficient. The ratio of one staffer to 1,369 beneficiaries is twice the ratio in 1995. The average processing time of disability claims has already doubled from four to eight months.\nMusk's approach avoids Republicans in Congress voting on the evisceration. Perhaps Musk will then sell Social Security to the highest bidder who will privatize it, promising to make it function again. (At the end of 2024, the two Social Security trust funds held approximately $2.027 trillion in asset reserves. These reserves are owned by the beneficiaries of the Social Security program.)\nWhat have the DOGE musketeers accomplished so far?\nSeveral people who are quite alive were declared dead and their benefits terminated. For example, Ned Johnson, an 82-year-old retiree from Seattle not only discovered his Social Security checks stopped, but more than $5,000 of his prior benefits were clawed back as he allegedly died on November 23, 2024. He waited for eight hours at the Seattle Social Security office to prove that he was still alive. That same office is now earmarked for closure. Earlier, Trump fired the inspector general who would have investigated and avoided such mistakes. DOGE musketeers also claimed to have found $232 million in waste to cut from Social Security. Closer examination changed that to $560,000.\nElon installed one of his musketeers, Leland Dudek, as acting commissioner. In response to a lawsuit, a judge forbade the DOGE musketeers from accessing sensitive taxpayer data. Dudek then threatened to bar Social Security employees from accessing Social Security systems. The next day Dudek backed down and let the employees resume their normal work.\nWhich field offices will be closed is still not decided. There were protests around the country outside field offices last weekend, and the public was very vocal about keeping their local Social Security offices open. The phone lines available for the elderly and disabled to discuss their claims are already shut down. People are told to do much of their business online. However, it is believed that about 10% of people over 65 are not computer literate. A new claimant must appear in person at a remaining office alive.\nFor those who rely on the check from Social Security to pay for the essentials every month, failure to receive it is an emergency. I encourage everybody to call or email Sens. Chris van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks, as well as Congressman Andy Harris to tell them to stop the plunder of the Social Security insurance program.\nOn June 1, 1950, Sen. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine stood up in the Senate chamber during a debate on Sen. Joseph McCarthy's claims of unidentified traitors in our government and said: \"It is high time we all stopped being tools and victims of totalitarian techniques — techniques that, if continued here unchecked, will surely end what we have come to cherish as the American way of life.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit.\"This passage of scripture reveals to us that none of mankind is without fault.\nRomans 3:23 NKJV reads, \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. James 5:16 tells us that if we are able to (1.) acknowledge our wrong to one another, (2.) and pray for one another agreeing in the name of Jesus than we can be healed.\"\nThis passage of scripture reveals the power of confession to us.\nI John 1:9 says, \"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\"\nThe scriptures state the effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. In verse 17, the word of God confirms that Elijah was a human just like you and I. He prayed for rain and for it to stop, and God honored his prayer.\nMen and women of God, know that your prayers produce results. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Speak up or you may lose your guaranteed rights\n\n April 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LARRY PIFER | Section: Columns \n \n 345\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The first 10 amendments to the Constitution are known as the Bill of Rights. These rights apply to everyone in the United States including citizens, and with few exceptions, to non-citizens and legal residents. The First Amendment grants freedom of religion, press, assembly and petition. The fourth amendment protects against illegal searches, seizures and requires warrants.We now know that these rights are being violated by the Trump administration at an alarming frequency.\nPerhaps you read about the student at Columbia University, a legal permanent resident who has been arrested and detained, apparently without due process, for leading protests about the situation in Gaza. He has been sent to a detention center in Louisiana.\nAlso recently arrested without due process of law is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident. In a recent administrative error, Mr. Garcia was deported to a prison in El Salvador, despite a 2019 court order stating that deporting him to El Salvador could result in his harm or death from gangs there. Mr Garcia has no criminal record in the United States. The Supreme Court has decreed that the United States must correct its error and facilitate his return to the United States. The Trump administration denies having any responsibility to correct this error and states that the courts have no right to require the correction, and in short, it is none of their business.\nThese two cases are headlines but clear violations of the Bill of Rights. There are many more outrageous violations of our rights are occurring daily.\nOur rights are under attack. The president is interpreting the Bill of Rights to align with his own objectives.\nWe should all fear for ourselves. It is not hard to imagine that U.S. citizens and legal residents may be ensnared in efforts to deport or detain anyone who does not agree with the president. Mr. Trump has already expressed a wish to overturn the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States.\nWe all need to resist attacks on the rights that our Constitution grants us. Speak up or you may lose them. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Country Cooking: Fresh asparagus",
    "date": "2025-04-21",
    "author": "MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking",
    "content": "Country Cooking: Fresh asparagus\n\n April 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1230\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Fresh asparagus is a sure sign that spring has arrived.My mom did not plant asparagus, as not many in the family liked this vegetable. Years later, when I had a garden of my own, I learned how to grow asparagus that would continue coming back each year for at least 18 to 20 years.\nSome rules I learned were to find a space in the garden that had direct sunshine for at least six hours each day. This spot also needs to be well-drained with rich, deep soil. I added compost to ensure the soil was rich and lots of it to have a nice tall row.\nA very important factor: do not plant onions, potatoes, garlic, leeks, shallots or beans near the asparagus, as they seek the sun and overpower with growth to overcome the asparagus sprouts. Properly planted, this delicious vegetable produces many sprouts.\nOne of my first recipes was fried asparagus, given to me by a true southern lady, Ms. Lillie Mae. She has been gone for many years, but the recipe lives on with me.\nFRIED ASPARAGUS\nPrepare about a pound of fresh cut asparagus for cooking. In a skillet over medium heat melt 1/2 cup butter, add 2 tbsps olive oil, 1 tsp coarse salt and 3 minced garlic cloves. Stir and cook until the garlic is strongly fragrant. Place asparagus stalks in the pan and continue cooking and turning with a fork until tender. Drain on paper towels and serve warm.\nASPARAGUS CASSEROLE\nThis goes great with baked ham. In a buttered casserole dish, place a layer of asparagus, then a layer of crumbled cheese nips crackers. Wet with cream of mushroom soup mixed with water according to directions on the can. Finish the casserole with a few more crushed cheese nips. Bake in a 350-degree oven until asparagus is tender.\nROASTED ASPARAGUS\n1 large bunch fresh asparagus, 1 to 2 tsps olive oil, salt, freshly ground black pepper.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees and line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup. Cut off the woody ends of the asparagus, usually about an inch or so is taken off. Place the asparagus on the sheet and drizzle with olive oil, just enough to lightly coat. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the asparagus and toss until the spears are lightly coated in oil. Arrange the spears in a single layer on the pan. Thin asparagus will take as little as nine to 12 minutes, whereas thicker asparagus will need 15 to 20 minutes. Roasted asparagus is best served when it's fresh out of the oven, but it will keep at room temperature for up to one hour or up to two days in the refrigerator.\nASPARAGUS FRITTATA WITH HAM, SPINACH AND CHEESE\n6 eggs, kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, 4 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, 4 stalks asparagus (sliced on a into 1-inch pieces), 1 green bell pepper (diced), 1/2 medium red onion (sliced), 3 medium cloves garlic (sliced), 1 cup packed spinach leaves (roughly chopped), 3 ounces sliced ham (cut into 1/2-inch pieces), 4 ounces medium-firm cheese such as cheddar or Jack (cut into 1/2-inch cubes).\nLightly beat eggs with a large pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a large bowl. Set aside. Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a 10-inch nonstick, cast iron or carbon steel skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add asparagus and peppers, season with salt and pepper, and cook, tossing and stirring frequently, until asparagus is tender-crisp, about two minutes. Transfer to the bowl with the eggs. Heat 1 tbsp oil in the now-empty skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook, stirring, until starting to brown around the edges, about two minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until onions and garlic are lightly browned, about a minute longer. Add spinach and cook, stirring, until wilted, about a minute. Transfer to the bowl with the eggs. Add ham (if using) and cheese to the eggs and stir the mixture until everything is evenly combined. Wipe out the skillet. Add remaining 2 tbsps oil to skillet and set over medium-high heat until shimmering. Scrape egg mixture into skillet and cook, swirling and shaking pan rapidly, until bottom and sides begin to set, about three minutes. Using a heat proof spatula, press the edges in to begin to form the frittata's puck shape. Continue to cook, adjusting heat to prevent bottom of frittata from burning, until beginning to set around edges, about three minutes longer. Working over a sink or garbage can, place a large overturned flat plate or lid on top of skillet, set hand on top (using a dish towel if you are sensitive to heat), and, in one very quick motion, invert frittata onto it. Carefully slide the frittata back into the skillet and continue to cook until the second side is beginning to firm up, about two minutes. Use a rubber spatula to again press the sides all around to form a rounded puck shape. Continue to cook the frittata until lightly browned on the second side but still tender in the center when pressed with a finger, about two minutes longer. If desired, you can flip frittata two to three more times during these last minutes of cooking, which helps to cook the center more evenly and reinforce the shape. Carefully slide frittata out of the skillet onto a clean plate and serve.\nCHEESY BAKED ASPARAGUS\n1 bunch of asparagus, 3/4 cup mozzarella (shredded), 1/4 cup parmesan (finely grated), 2 cloves of garlic (minced/finely diced), 1 tbsp olive oil, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp black pepper.\nTrim the woody parts of your asparagus and toss will 1 tbsp olive oil, garlic cloves, salt and pepper. Lay out flat on a baking tray. Place in the oven at 390 degrees for eight to 10 minutes, or until it just starts to wrinkle and soften. Take out the oven, sprinkle over mozzarella then top with parmesan. Put back in the oven and broil until the cheese turn golden and bubbly, with the asparagus fork tender. Serve up right away.\nLEMON ASPARAGUS SALAD\n1 pound penne pasta, 1 pound thin asparagus (trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces), 3 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil, 1 small onion (diced), 2 cloves garlic (thinly sliced), 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 lemon (zested and juiced), 1 tsp kosher salt, 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan plus more for serving, 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper plus more for serving, 1/4 cup fresh parsley (finely chopped), 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve ½ cup pasta water, then drain. Set aside. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tbsp of oil. Cook asparagus until crispy, then season with a pinch of salt. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Heat remaining 2 tbsps of oil over medium heat. Cook onions and garlic until softened, about five minutes. Add heavy cream, lemon juice and zest. Bring mixture to a boil, then simmer for five minutes. Add in salt, parmesan and black pepper. Reduce heat to low and mix until well combined. Turn off heat and mix in pasta, asparagus, and parsley until well coated. Add small amounts of pasta water until you reach desired consistency. Serve with more grated parmesan, cracked black pepper and red pepper flakes. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Country Cooking: The other side of the barnyard\n\n April 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1187\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Driving down the country road to the farm, I realized that you always see one side of the barnyard as you turn into the driveway.This is the side where the water trough sits, and the feed containers are placed on metal tracks. The cows and hogs hang out here waiting to be fed. The corn cribs and the smokehouse are nearby.\nOn the other side of the barn is the area where the pony and goats hang out. At one time, we had a small lamb that we cared for while its owner was away. The goats would constantly get out and wander down to neighboring farms — eating everything in sight. They soon found new homes.\nThe Easter holiday is over, but I have some ham and lamb recipes I want to share with you. What was on your table for Easter dinner last week? For most, ham rates number one, with lamb, beef, seafood, turkey and chicken as other choices.\nI know many families opt for lamb, but even though I know it is a very healthy choice, I just can't cook or eat lamb. Lamb meat comes from the young lambs and is a very rich source of iron, high quality of protein, zinc and vitamin B12.\nI will include a lamb recipe today for those who like lamb. My mom always prepared the tastiest hams but only once or twice ever cooked lamb — probably because the children refused to eat it.\nThis past week I purchased a small ham — on sale — and decided to cook it instead of freezing it. It was delicious.\nHam and lamb can be eaten at any time of the year.\nBONE IN BAKED HAM\nThis ham recipe comes from my kitchen. I have used it for many years. I purchase one whole bone-in ham, about 15 pounds and trim off any excess fat.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a mixing bowl combine one-pound brown sugar and 1/2 cup yellow mustard, mixing until you have a thick paste. Line a baking pan with foil, making sure the foil is long enough to fold over covering ham completely. Spray foil with cooking spray just in case the brown sugar mixture escapes from the foil. Place the ham on the foil and spread with sugar-mustard paste on top. Fold and seal foil. Keep ham sealed until cooking is complete — Bake for 4 hours. Check for doneness and let sit, covered, for another hour. Carve and serve.\nNOTE: the ham bone will be great after Easter for seasoning in a pot of bean soup or ham and cabbage.\nPINEAPPLE HAM\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Use a 8 to 10-pound ham and score the top in a diamond-shape, making the cuts half an inch deep. Place ham in a roasting pan. Mix together 3 cups brown sugar with 3 tablespoons yellow mustard, mixing until smooth and spooning onto top of ham. Mix together the juice from an 8-ounce can of pineapple rings and 1 cup honey. Drizzle this mixture over the ham and brown sugar paste. Place the pineapple rings on top of the ham and secure with wooden toothpicks. Cover and place in the preheated oven. After 15 minutes, remove the cover (foil or a lid) and baste with pan drippings, doing this several times until the scouring marks have opened, letting the juices seep into the meat. Continue baking until ham is well done according to size of ham (see package directions).\nLEG OF LAMB\n4 to 5-pound leg of lamb (bone-in, fat trimmed), salt and pepper, extra virgin olive oil, 5 garlic cloves (peeled and sliced), 2 cups water, 8 gold potatoes (peeled and cut into wedges), 1 yellow onion (peeled and cut into wedges), 1 teaspoon paprika,1 teaspoon all-natural garlic powder, fresh parsley for garnish (optional). For the rub: 15 garlic cloves (peeled), 2 tablespoons dried oregano, 2 tablespoons dried mint flakes, 1 tablespoon paprika, 1/2 tablespoons nutmeg, 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, juice of 2 lemons.\nTake the leg of lamb out of the refrigerator and leave in room temperature for about 1 hour. In the meantime, prepare the remaining ingredients and make the lamb rub. Prepare the seasoning.\nTo make the rub or seasoning, in a food processor, combine the rub ingredients. Blend until smooth. Set aside (or in the fridge, if preparing in advance). Salt the meat. When ready, pat the lamb dry and make a few slits on both sides. Season with salt and pepper. Sear the Lamb. Turn the oven on broil. Place the leg of lamb on a wire rack and put it directly on the top rack so that it's only a few inches away from the broiler element. Broil for 5 to 7 minutes on each side or until the leg of lamb is nicely seared. Remove from the oven, then adjust the oven temperature to 325 degrees. Apply the seasoning or rub. When the lamb is cool enough to handle, insert the garlic slices in the slits you made earlier. Now cover the leg of lamb on all sides with the wet rub and place it in the middle of a roasting pan with an inside rack. Add two cups of water to the bottom of the roasting pan. Season the potato and onion wedges with paprika, garlic powder and a little salt, then add them to the pan on either side of the lamb. Cover and roast. Tent a large piece of foil over the roasting pan (make sure it does not touch the lamb) then place the pan on the middle rack of the 325-degree oven. Roasted for about 1 hour. Remove the foil and return the roasting pan to the oven for another 15 to 20 minutes or until the lamb temperature registers 125 degrees. Let rest. Remove the pan from the oven and let the leg of lamb rest for about 15 to 20 minutes before serving (the lamb will continue to cook, and its internal temperature will continue to rise to around 130 degrees).Place the roast lamb and potatoes in a large serving platter over a bed of rice, you like. Garnish with parsley. Or you may carve the lamb first, then arrange the sliced lamb with the potatoes over the rice.\nBAKED PINEAPPLE\nMultiple generations love this side dish. My son John will eat this even as a dessert or breakfast dish. It goes perfect with any of these recipes today.\nOne 20-ounce can of crushed pineapple including juice, ¾ cup granulated sugar, 2 large eggs, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 1 ½ tablespoons butter (divided into small pats), 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon.\nPreheat your oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease a 9-by-9-inch baking pan to prevent sticking. In a mixing bowl, add the crushed pineapple (with its juice), granulated sugar, eggs, cornstarch and vanilla extract. Stir until the mixture is smooth. Transfer the pineapple mixture into a greased baking pan. Evenly distribute the small pats of butter across the surface of the mixture, then sprinkle with ground cinnamon to enhance flavor. Bake for 45 minutes, or until the mixture begins to exhibit a golden hue perfectly caramelized. Let cool and serve. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Country Cooking: Strawberry patches, fields, recipes and memories\n\n May 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1424\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n When I was standing at my kitchen sink this afternoon washing, capping and slicing several small baskets of freshly picked strawberries, I had flashback memories of Mom doing this chore many years ago.The only difference was Mom had a large strawberry patch at one side of our garden, and my berries came from the local market.\nEarly in their farm life, my parents had a large strawberry field with workers who picked and drove the berries to a small packing house in town. Immediately, the berries got shipped to the large city markets. A lot of work was involved — from the day the plants were put in the ground, to the care and watering to the actual picking days.\nIn the meantime, let's go back to the kitchen, where our berries were being prepared for canning, freezing and the recipes the family loved. That large bowl of fresh \"sugared down\" strawberries that appeared at the dinner table was soon eaten.\nOnce again, the canning jars were carefully washed and waiting for that strawberry jelly and jam. The freezer was rearranged to make room for the frozen berries to eventually be used for pies, cakes and much more.\nTwo of my favorite strawberry memories are the old-fashioned homemade strawberry ice cream and strawberry shortcake.\nEnjoy today's recipes.\nSTRAWBERRY JAM\n5 cups crushed fresh strawberries (you'll need approximately 8 cups fresh strawberries or approximately 4 16-oz. containers), 7 cups granulated sugar, 1 packet original Sure-Jell premium fruit pectin powder, 2 tbsp lemon juice, 1/2 tsp butter.\nWash jars, lids and bands in hot soapy water, dry completely, and set bands aside. Simmer lids in warm water in a saucepan until ready to place them on jars. Keep jars warm by simmering in hot water until ready to use. Do not boil. Fill a 20 quart stock pot or water bath canner with hot water, and place on the stove over medium-high heat (you'll need enough water to later cover your jars with at least 1 inch of water). Crush strawberries in a large mixing bowl or shallow glass baking dish using hand masher until nice, smooth consistency (small chunks are okay). Transfer crushed strawberries to 8 quart stock pot. Add pectin, lemon juice and butter to the pot, and stir constantly with a wooden spoon over high heat, while bringing to a rolling boil. Once boiling, add sugar, return to rolling boil, then boil for 1 minute while stirring constantly. After 1 minute, remove foam from top of jam by skimming it off with a metal spoon.one by one, remove a jar from hot water, transfer to a cookie sheet (this will catch any spills), place regular mouth canning funnel on jar, and ladle in strawberry jam mixture leaving 1/4 inch empty head space at top of the jar. Then wipe off the rim of the lid and threads of the jar with damp cloth.\nContinue until all jars have been filled. Remove warm lids from the saucepan, a magnetic lid lifter works like a charm, and place one lid on each jar. Then screw one band on each jar just until snug but not overly tight. Place filled jars on a rack in a 20 quart stock pot or water bath canner, then lower down into hot water. Make sure there is enough water in the pot that there is at least 1 inch of water above the jars. If necessary, add more hot water. Place the lid on your pot, and bring to a gentle boil. Once water is boiling, set your timer for processing and boil for 10 minutes, once jars have finished boiling, turn off heat, remove the lid from the pot and let jars sit for 5 minutes before removing. After 5 minutes, lift up the rack to an elevated resting position, then carefully remove jars one by one using a jar lifter, and transfer to a folded towel to cool. The lids on the jars will begin to 'pop' into the sealed position, signifying the jam has been preserved. If any lids do not pop within the first 12 — 24 hours, transfer those to the refrigerator and use those up first. It may take up to 24-48 hours to finish setting.\nJars can be stored in your pantry, or a cool, dry cupboard for up to 1 year. Label the top of each lid with the type of jam and the date it was made. Remove bands when storing and be sure to never stack jars on top of each other. Always inspect lids to ensure the seals are good before using. When ready to use, transfer a jar to your refrigerator, and use within 1 month.\nSTRAWBERRY PIE\n1 1/2 cups water, 1 cup granulated sugar, 3 tbsps cornstarch, 1 3-oz package strawberry Jell-O, 1 1/2 pints fresh capped strawberries, 8-inch pre-baked pie shell.\nMix together water, granulated sugar and cornstarch. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until thick. Remove from heat and Jell-O; mix in well and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes; then fold strawberries. Pour into pie shell. Refrigerate until firm. Serve with a cool whip on the top. You may also use a graham cracker crust.\nSTRAWBERRY RHUBARB PIE\n1 cup + 2 tbsps granulated sugar, 6 tbsps cornstarch, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 pound fresh rhubarb, 1 pound strawberries (stemmed and quartered), 1 tbsp orange juice, 2 tsps orange zest, 2 tsps vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract, 1 large egg, 2 tbsps turbinado sugar.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees. Place a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet on the center rack of the oven to preheat. Roll out one piece of dough on a floured surface into a 12-inch round, starting at the center and working your way out (sprinkle flour over the top of the dough if it's a bit too moist). Carefully lift the dough and place in a 9-inch pie pan (not deep dish); gently press against the sides of the pan. Trim excess overhanging dough at the edge of the pie plate. Stir together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a large bowl until evenly combined. Add the rhubarb, strawberries, orange juice, orange zest, and vanilla. Toss until evenly coated. Pour the fruit mixture into the pie crust. Roll out the other piece of dough into a 12-inch round on a floured surface. Cut into eight 1 1/2-inch-wide strips. Arrange 4 strips of dough in parallel rows on top of the filling. Working with one strip at a time, arrange the remaining 4 strips perpendicular to the first ones, weaving the strips over and under to form a lattice. Trim the ends of the strips and press them against the bottom crust. Press with a fork all around the edge of the pie crust to crimp. In a small bowl, whisk the egg and 1 tbsp of water with a fork. Brush the dough lightly with the egg wash and sprinkle with the turbinado sugar. Bake the pie until the filling is bubbly and thickened in the middle of the pie, 1 hour 20 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes. (Cover the pie with foil if the crust is getting too dark after 45 minutes.) Allow the pie to cool to room temperature before slicing, about 4 hours.\nSTRAWBERRY BREAD\n2 quarts fresh strawberries, 4 beaten eggs, 3 cups all purpose flour, 2 cups sugar, 3 tsps cinnamon, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 1/4 cup cooking oil, 1 cup chopped nuts.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour two 9 inch loaf pans and set aside. Wash and cap and slice berries. Drain well and place in a medium bowl. Stir in eggs, flour, sugar, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, oil and nuts. Mix well, pour into prepared pans and bake one hour or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.\nSTRAWBERRY LEMONADE\n1 pound strawberries plus more to garnish, 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, 2 cups fresh lemon juice (strained and divided), ice, lemon slices to garnish.\nHull and quarter the strawberries. Place the strawberries in a large bowl, stir in the sugar and ¼ cup lemon juice. Allow to sit, covered for 30 minutes. In a countertop blender, blend the strawberry mixture until pureed. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve to get the seeds out. In a large bowl, combine the strawberry puree with the remaining 1 ¾ cups of lemon juice and 4 cups of water. Add up to 1 additional cup of water to taste if the mixture is too sweet or strong. To serve, stir the lemonade and pour it over ice. Garnish with sliced lemon and strawberries. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Jesus tried to show them that all people matter, even those who are lost and far from God.\nIn fact, God takes the initiative and does an all-out search, rescue and restoration mission for those who are lost. \"For the Son of Man came to seek and save those who are lost.\" (Lk 19:10; NLT)\nIt would not be strange for a sheep to be lost while out on the hillside. And it really would not be strange for a good shepherd to seek out the lost sheep. Jesus basically said, \"Wouldn't you all do the same thing?\"\nWhat would be strange would be for the shepherd or the woman who lost a valuable coin or a father to do nothing to seek and save that which was lost.\nAnd not only to seek and rescue but to restore that which was lost. The sheep's injuries were tended to and cared for. The coin was placed back into safe-keeping. The son was restored back to his position as son in the family.\nGod is on a mission to bring restoration back to people's lives. He wants to restore joy and peace and relationships. He wants to restore dignity. He wants to restore our significance and purpose. May all who are lost be found. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Bringing back the 'Votes for Women' sashes\n\n May 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: GLENNA HECKATHORN | Section: Columns \n \n 468\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Women are going to have a tough time registering to vote if a new executive order and the House-passed SAVE Act are enacted.President Trump's March 25 executive order requires those registering to vote to provide a passport or similar documentation proving citizenship. According to The Center for American Progress, the SAVE Act \"would require all Americans to prove their citizenship by presenting documentation in person when registering to vote or updating their voter registration information.\"\nThe center says \"More than 140 million Americans do not possess a passport, and as many as 69 million women, who have taken their spouse's name, do not have a birth certificate matching their legal name. … These women lack citizenship documents showing their original names, because they changed their names after marriage and their birth certificates do not match their current IDs.\"\nThe U.S. League of Women Voters responded to the executive order by filing suit in April. In League of Women Voters v. Trump, a federal court judge has issued a temporary stay \"blocking the U.S. Election Assistance Commission from … adding a requirement to show a passport or similar document proving citizenship when registering to vote. … The injunction preserves the status quo where … voters already affirm under penalty of perjury that they are U.S. citizens.\"\nOne hundred years ago when women rallied for equal voting rights, sashes were often worn by suffragettes during parades, rallies and other events as a way to bring attention to their cause. A simple phrase \"Votes for Women\" drew attention to their message and helped to unify them with each other and their supporters.\nThe colors of the sashes were symbolic — with purple for loyalty, white for purity and gold for light and hope. Through their hard work and persistence, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, giving women the right to vote in elections, passed on Aug. 19, 1920.\nNotably, the League of Women Voters was established in that same year on Feb. 14, 1920. To celebrate the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the League and passage of the 19th Amendment , the Mid-Shore chapter distributed replica sashes to store fronts in Cambridge and Easton. The sashes were made by Cambridge resident Anne McAnulty and lettered by Margaret and George Anzalone.\nNow, after a century, the right of women and other citizens to vote is once again in jeopardy. In response, the League of Women Voters-Mid Shore will resurrect the sashes worn by the suffragettes calling for \"Votes for Women.\"\n\"Now we will proudly wear our sashes in solidarity with those suffragettes and the many others who fought for voting rights, past President Kathi Bangert said. \"As we work in the community to register voters, promote civic education, empower voters and defend democracy, the LWV-Mid Shore members will proudly wear our sashes in support of voting rights.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There were letters to the editor regarding bringing back civility.What does civility mean, is it defacing signs you don't agree with; is it giving the middle finger (that was a favorite of the party of civility), or was it calling the other party Nazis?\nA friend who is new to the area was standing at the GOP tent chatting with the workers for a couple of hours.

Bradley III who served Talbot County as a county councilman for 29 years. My wife and I are still residents in Maryland. We, like many, look to the lone Republican Congressman, Andy Harris for a voice of sanity and representation.Congressional District 6 (Western Maryland) lost its Republican representation because of gerrymandering to deliberately include non-Western Maryland liberal voters. Maryland is a one-party state. And given the current state administration's views, spending and planned tax increases, there is plenty of reason for Republicans to give up on Maryland. Some even move out of the state.\nBut perhaps nothing is as disheartening as our lone Maryland congressman Harris voting \"present\" on HR1 (\"the one big, beautiful bill\") and using his platform as the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus to not support President Trump, who is the leader of the Republican party. According to his press release, Harris says he voted \"present\" after meeting with Trump.\nSo, now I am asking myself, who does Harris represent? How is he advancing the interests of Maryland conservatives, Delmarva folks, or the national or state Republican party, or even the House Freedom Caucus where most of its members voted to support HR1 after meeting with Trump?\nMy father used to say, \"I have to earn your vote.\"\nI do not see how Congressman Harris is doing this for Congressional District 1 or Talbot Countians. Gerrymandering is one way to lose your voice and representation; another is when an elected representative at any level votes \"present.\"\nCLINTON S.

    "content": "Country Cooking: Steaks for Father's Day\n\n June 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: News \n \n 958\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Father's Day was introduced in the United States in the early 20th century to complement Mother's Day.Father's Day was founded in Spokane, Washington at the YMCA by Sonora Dodd, who was born in Arkansas. Her father was a Civil War veteran and a single parent who raised six children. After hearing a sermon about Anna Jarvis' Mother's Day in 1909, Dodd told her pastor that fathers should be celebrated as well. Beginning in 1915, Father's Day has been celebrated on the third Sunday in June.\nHats off to all fathers on this special day. My own father was a proud father of nine sons and two daughters. There were many of our friends included in our family functions that had no father figures in their lives, and \"Pop\" treated us all the same.\nHis famous saying was \"You put your feet under our table, then your hands were put on farm work like my own kids'.\" Needless to say, it did not deter anyone from coming to the table.\nToday, I am turning the column to my son John. Proud father to three boys — Mason, Colin and Braxton. Enjoy your day with some wonderful grilled steaks.\nGrilling Steak\nI prefer not to freeze my steak. It is not always convenient, but I try to get my steak the day of or day before I plan to grill it. I think steak that is not frozen and then thawed out tastes better. Could just be me.\nHowever you do it, whether from the freezer or out of the refrigerator, take that steak out and let it sit. Steak right out of the fridge will cook unevenly. Set yours out at room temperature for 30 minutes before grilling.\nHere are a few ways to grill various cuts of steak as well as the various temperatures for getting the grill you want.\nRare: 120 to 130 degrees.Medium Rare: 130 to 135 degrees.Medium: 135 to 145 degrees.Medium Well: 145 to 155 degrees.Well Done: 155+ degrees.\nSIRLOIN\nPreheat the grill over high heat. Season steak generously with salt and pepper. Grill steak over direct heat 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.\nSKIRT STEAK\nPreheat the grill over high heat. Season steak generously with salt and pepper. Grill steak over direct heat 3 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.\nRIBEYE\nPreheat the grill over high heat. Season steak generously with salt and pepper. Grill steak over direct heat 4 to 6 minutes per side for medium-rare.\nFILET MIGNON\nPreheat the grill over high heat. Season steak generously with salt and pepper. Grill steak over direct heat 5 to 6 minutes per side for medium-rare.\nT-BONE STEAK\nThere is something magic about a nice, fat T-bone. That piece of bone gives this steak so much flavor that you'll want to pick it up and eat steak right off the bone when your plate is clean. I like my T-bones to be at least 1 inch to 1 ¼ thick. This is so you can get a good crust but still have nice tender meat. Thaw your T bone out and let it sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. If your grill doesn't have a thermometer, you can try to use a meat thermometer to check the surface heat, but it is not always accurate.\nHere is what you'll need: 2 T-bone steaks at least 1 1/2 inches thick, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, 1 stick unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary (chopped), 2 cloves garlic (finely minced), ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper.\nTurn on your grill and let it warm up to medium-high heat. Clean the grill grates and oil them. Pat the steaks dry with paper towels, then generously season with salt and pepper from all sides including the edges. Make the garlic butter, in a small saucepan, melt the butter with rosemary, garlic, and pepper. When the butter starts bubbling, cook for 1 minute then remove from heat so you don't burn the garlic. Allow the herb and garlic to steep in the butter as you grill the steaks. Add the steaks to the grill and reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 minutes per side. Check the temperature. For a medium rare steak, grill the steaks for about 4 minutes on each side until the internal temperature reaches 130 degrees.When the steaks are done, remove from the grill onto a plate and pour the butter all over the steaks and cover with foil. Allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.\nNEW YORK STRIP\nNew York strip is my second favorite cut of steak that is much prepared the same way with a few adjustments. After letting steaks sit out for maybe 20 minutes, pat them dry. You want to try to get the same thickness of at least 1 inch thick. Pat dry to absorb any extra fluid or moisture.\nHere is what you'll need: 2 New York strip steaks at least 1 inch thick, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, 1 stick unsalted butter.\nI preheat the grill to high heat. Heat the butter in a microwave safe bowl and then when ready I coat each steak on all sides as well as edges. I sprinkle the Kinder's Prime Steak seasoning on both sides of the steak. When you are ready to grill the steak turn the heat down to medium then place the steaks on the grill. Let sit for about 4 minutes a side then flip. At this point I coat with butter and sprinkle more seasoning on each side after I flip. About 5 minutes a side and I check the temperature using a meat thermometer. I like my steak medium rare so I pull them off when they hit 130 to 135 degrees. I slice immediately and eat while hot off the grill. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Are we waiting for a big, wooden one like Jesus carried?\nAs Christians, one of our goals is service to the church and to the community. It's easy to pick up something we're capable of. Maybe we have the skills, time and desire. We know we'll take joy in doing them. Yet, despite the time, money or sweat we put into it, this is not our cross.\nIf it's easy, and if we take joy in it, this is not our cross. Do you think Jesus took pleasure in carrying the cross He did? Was it easy?\nThe cross we are being asked to pick up and carry in His name will have the same weight as the one He carried. It will be just as cumbersome. So pick up your cross.\nOur cross will not be shaped like the cross that Jesus carried. It might be big or it might be small, but it will be heavy.\nThis is how we follow Jesus. We must step out of our comfort zones and go above and beyond what we think we're capable of. Doing the will of God becomes our cross to bear. So pick up your cross.\nJesus didn't want to carry His cross, but He did. When the time comes for you to pick up your cross, you're not going to want to carry it either, but pick it up and carry it for Him, just as He carried His for us. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Goodall brings to the role a distinctive blend of medical, psychological and theological expertise, shaped by years of hands-on work as a physician and counselor.Her deep commitment to holistic care uniquely equips her to lead the Shelter Alliance in its mission to serve Kent County's unhoused population.\nRaised in Kingston, Jamaica, Goodall briefly resided in Baltimore, where she attended Baltimore Polytechnic Institute. She later returned to Jamaica to complete the International Baccalaureate program at Hillel Academy in Kingston. She earned a Bachelor of Pure Sciences and a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) from the University of the West Indies.\nAfter graduating from medical school in 2018, Goodall served more than six years as a physician at both the University Hospital of the West Indies and the Constant Spring Medical Center in Kingston.\nDuring her medical practice, she developed a deep passion for addressing the psychological and emotional needs of vulnerable populations.

He was transported to Shock Trauma in Baltimore for treatment of life-threatening injuries. He died on Wednesday afternoon, his family said on Facebook Thursday.\nIn a Facebook post on Wednesday, Darren's father, Len Foxwell, wrote that the family is \"eternally grateful for everyone who has sent their love and support, for those who have stepped up with profound gestures of support, and for Darren's friends who drove here from Easton yesterday to say goodbye to their childhood buddy.\"\n\"Each of you have been a lifeline and have honored Darren in your own special way,\" Len Foxwell wrote.\nHis father added that the team at Shock Trauma in Baltimore \"fought like a tiger to keep Darren comfortable, preserve his dignity and provide solace for a family that has been destroyed.\"\nA member of Easton High School's wrestling and lacrosse teams, Foxwell graduated last month. He planned to attend Bethany College in West Virginia this fall and play lacrosse for the Bison.\nFoxwell played the last two years for Easton as a backup defenseman. Easton High boys head lacrosse coach Dennis Keenan said he was popular among his teammates and had a \"bright future.\"\n\"I think he was funnier than he actually thought he was,\" Keenan said. \"The things he would say would just crack me up. He was getting better each day. You could see flashes of brilliance.\"\nFoxwell wrestled for three years at Easton, including under head coach Jason Biringer during his senior year. Biringer said Foxwell had an \"infectious\" personality.\nEarly this past season, Foxwell stepped away from the wrestling team. But after speaking with his coach, he returned and started at the 167-pound weight class for the Warriors.\nAfter returning to the team, Biringer made Foxwell a team captain because of Foxwell's work ethic and focus.\n\"The other wrestlers looked up to him,\" Biringer said. \"He has such a good, gentle demeanor that he was just very well liked.\"\n\"He just had one of those infectious smiles that you're like, 'It's always good to see Darren,'\" Biringer added.\nFamily said on Thursday that arrangements for funeral services and a celebration of life are being made and will be announced soon. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Voice provided people under Nazi domination a way to hear the truth about World War II. The Voice provided the first real notification of D-Day, the invasion of Nazi controlled Europe and, thereby, triggered partisan uprisings all over Europe.After World War II and during the Cold War the Voice of America expanded its efforts to fight communism and played a role in the decline of communism in several countries. Today the Voice of America provides digital and radio content in 48 languages for affiliate stations around the world. The target and primary audience for the broadcasts is non-Americans living outside the United States borders, especially those without a free press or independent journalism.\nIt is the voice of freedom for them.\nNational Public Radio or NPR is an American public broadcasting organization that serves as a national syndicator to a network of more than a thousand public radio stations in the United States. NPR caters to local stories and news, local foods, local history, local culture and local dance. Classical and jazz music is played on NPR stations around the country. Programs like \"Kids, screen time and mental health\" might be a topic.\nThe Public Broadcasting Service or PBS is a publicly funded nonprofit organization and the most prominent provider of educational programs to public television stations in the United States. Some of the programs we have all enjoyed include NOVA, Frontline, Masterpiece Theater, Sesame Street, Mr. Rogers Neighborhood, Barney and Friends, American Experience and the most popular, Downton Abby.\nThese well-known and in most cases revered broadcast organizations are and have been a part of our lives for many decades. They have given all of us good things to entertain us, good things to think about and unbiased information. In the case of Voice of America, it has been our only way to reach places like Russia with the truth about world events like the war in Ukraine.\nMr. Putin is no doubt breaking out the vodka to celebrate this gift from Trump.\nAll these well-known and revered broadcast organizations are under fire from Mr. Trump to be cut off from any support that has come from the federal government. Wny is this being done? VOA, NPR and PBS all support us, the make our lives a little better, they give us a voice to reach other people.\nI urge all of you to support VOA, NPR and PBS by letting our elected representatives know that you do not agree with ending this contribution to our lives. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Get those sweets and treats ready because the \"I'm hungry\" crowd has arrived.Ever wonder how kids can sit in school six hours a day with only lunch but when school is closed the \"I'm hungry\" cry is every two to three hours? It is easier to have snacks prepared and ready to hand out.\nBuy a large economy size box of zipper snack bags and fill assorted crackers and chips. Fill another batch with assorted raisins, nuts, dried banana chips and gummy bears. Have small, flavored water bottles ready to simply hand out. I remember those summer shopping carts when I bought the little Kool-Aid flavored drink mixes in as many flavors as possible.\nIt seems I bought mostly grape and orange flavors. Homemade lemonade and sweet tea were saved for dinner time. At one point in the early '70s, with enough package points, you could order the plastic Kool-Aid pitcher with matching drinking cups for free. The Kool-Aid emblem was on the side of the cups.\nSometimes I would mix a package of Kool-Aid and pour in the ice cube trays, freeze and add to the glass of Kool-Aid for fun. This could also be tasty with a mixture of different flavors with the drink and ice cubes.\nMaking lunch sandwiches could be fun by using large cookie cutters to cut the bread. Place the cut-out sandwich on a plate and lay chips and pickles on the side. Use toothpicks to push into small chunks of cheese for added fun and nutrition.\nFROZEN BANANA BITES\n1 cup peanut butter, 4 bananas (sliced into 1-inch rounds), 8 (1 oz) squares semisweet chocolate, 1 tbsp shortening, ⅓ cup toffee baking bits.\nCover a baking sheet with waxed paper. Spoon a thin layer of peanut butter on top of each banana slice. Insert a toothpick through the peanut butter layer into the banana. Place banana bites onto the prepared baking sheet; freeze for 30 minutes to overnight. Melt chocolate and shortening in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Cover another baking sheet with waxed paper. Remove 2 to 4 banana bites from the freezer at a time; coat each bite with chocolate mixture. Place coated banana bites on the second baking sheet; sprinkle each with toffee bits. Repeat until all the bites are coated. Return banana bites to the freezer until set, at least 1 hour. Allow bites to sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes before serving.\nICE CREAM SANDWICH POPS\n6 ice cream sandwiches, 2 bottles chocolate shell topping (such as Magic Shell), 12 popsicle sticks, assorted toppings (such as sprinkles, crushed cookies, nuts, crushed candy bars. We love Oreo cookies.)\nCut ice cream sandwiches in half crosswise. Insert a popsicle stick through up through the center of each cut end. Remove the caps and seals from the shell topping. Place in the microwave and cook for 8 seconds. Pour each bottle shell topping into a glass measuring cup. Dip each pop into shell topping until completely covered, allowing excess to drip off. Dip the top ends in desired toppings and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Freeze pops at least 1 hour before serving.\nCLASSIC PUDDING POPS\nOne of my son John's favorite snacks as a kid was pudding pops. You don't really see them in the stores too often anymore. Here is a homemade recipe for that nostalgic sweet treat.\n2 cups milk, ½ cup evaporated milk, 1 (3.5 oz) package instant chocolate pudding mix, ¼ cup white sugar.\nBeat milk, evaporated milk, instant pudding and sugar in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Pour into ice pop molds and freeze until firm, about 3 hours. Also for this recipe if you are diabetic or making you can prepare it this way. Use zero sugar pistachio pudding, substitute liquid Splenda for the sugar (1/2 tsp) and they are wonderful.\nS'MORES POPSICLES\n2 cups cold milk, 1 package instant chocolate pudding mix, 2 whole graham crackers (crushed), 1 ½ cups vanilla ice cream (softened).\nBeat milk and pudding mix together in a bowl using an electric mixer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Measure 1 1/2 cup pudding and set remaining pudding aside for another use. Sprinkle graham cracker crumbs into the bottom of each ice pop mold; add about 1/4 cup ice cream. Sprinkle another layer of graham cracker crumbs and top with about 1/4 cup pudding. Add a final layer of graham cracker crumbs. Freeze until completely frozen, about 3 hours.\nTROPICAL FRUIT ICICLES\n½ cups low-fat vanilla yogurt, 1 cup sliced mango, 1 (8 oz) can pineapple chunks (undrained), 1 small banana, 1 orange (juiced).\nBlend yogurt, mango, pineapple chunks with juice, banana, and orange juice in a blender until smooth. Pour into ice pop molds; freeze until set, 4 to 6 hours.\nPEANUT BUTTER BANANA\nICE CREAM\n4 ripe bananas cut into 1-inch slices, ¼ cup peanut butter.\nArrange banana slices on a baking sheet and freeze, 8 hours to overnight. Process frozen bananas in a food processor until evenly chopped; add peanut butter and process until thick and creamy.\nSTRAWBERRY LEMONADE\n1 lb. strawberries plus more to garnish, 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, 2 cups fresh lemon juice (strained and divided), ice, lemon slices to garnish.\nHull and quarter the strawberries. Place the strawberries in a large bowl, stir in the sugar and ¼ cup lemon juice. Allow to sit, covered for 30 minutes. In a countertop blender, blend the strawberry mixture until pureed. Strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve to get the seeds out. In a large bowl, combine the strawberry puree with the remaining 1 ¾ cups of lemon juice and 4 cups of water. Add up to 1 additional cup of water to taste if the mixture is too sweet or strong. To serve, stir the lemonade and pour it over ice. Garnish with sliced lemon and strawberries.\nHOMEMADE FRUIT POPSICLES\nStrawberries, blueberries, raspberries, pineapple and mango are just a few of the fruits you can use here. For this one we will use 2 cups fresh blueberries, raspberries, strawberries and sliced bananas (mixed); 2 cups plain or vanilla yogurt, ¼ cup white sugar, 8 small paper cups, 8 popsicle sticks.\nPlace the mixed blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, sliced bananas, yogurt, and sugar into a blender. Cover, and blend until the fruit is chunky or smooth, as desired. Fill paper cups 3/4 full with fruit mixture. Cover the top of each cup with a strip of aluminum foil. Poke a popsicle stick through the center of the foil on each cup. Place the cups in the freezer for at least 5 hours. To serve, remove foil and peel off the paper cup. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Crackin my shell: Emotional detachment and war\n\n June 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: SARENA NEYMAN | Section: Columns \n \n 827\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Every spring, someone in my town posts hand-drawn \"turtle crossing\" signs near the roads where turtles lay their eggs. I'd never actually seen one crossing and used to wonder why anyone bothered with these signs.But recently, I spotted a small painted turtle inching across the road, likely returning to the pond after burying her eggs. I considered moving her but worried I'd throw off her inner compass.\nThe next day, on a morning bike ride, I saw a massive snapper the size of a watermelon, slowly making her way across the asphalt. I got off my bike and paused the podcast I'd been listening to: Peter Beinart's interview of Israeli journalist Gideon Levy.\nLevy said many Jews, both in Israel and the U.S., shut their hearts to Palestinian suffering. They skip the disturbing images of destruction and starvation, avoid the headlines, ignore the unbearable. His words brought to mind \"The Zone of Interest,\" the Oscar-winning film about an Auschwitz commandant's family unmoved by the screams beyond their walls. What's chilling is how ordinary people adapted, how they built lives alongside atrocity by refusing to see the victims as fully human.\nAs I stood by the turtle, a car pulled up. The driver rolled down the window. \"Should we move it?\" she asked. We both admired the majestic prehistoric-looking creature, its jagged shell and ancient eyes, like a living dinosaur that had somehow lumbered out of the deep past. These animals have not changed in 90 million years.\n\"I don't think it's safe to move a snapper unless you've done it before,\" I said.\nShe nodded, rolled up her window and carefully drove around it.\nI was pulling out my phone to take a photo when I saw another car approaching. I assumed they saw the huge turtle. I didn't wave or signal. Surely they'd slow down.\nBut then, in an awful instant, I realized they weren't slowing down at all. The impact was immediate. The snapper was thrown into the air. When she hit the ground, I heard a sound I will never forget: her shell exploding beneath the tire — a violent, cracking thunder that tore through my ears. The car never even slowed down.\nIt felt like something in me had cracked too.\nI'm not someone who cries easily. I have a hard shell — quicker to think than to feel. Maybe it started in childhood. I was the one who had to wake my grandmother from her nightmares. No one else heard her cries at night, but my room was next to hers. I hated the job. A Nazi soldier had ripped her 4-year-old daughter from her arms. She never saw the little girl again.\nShaken by the turtle's death, I got back on my bike and resumed the podcast. Levy was describing a Palestinian friend in Gaza with only two days of insulin left. This is everyday life in Gaza, Levy says. We all know what happens when severe diabetics can't get their insulin, he adds.\nThe death of the turtle reminds me of how vulnerable the earth's creatures are and the cruelty of humans. I hear the high-pitched screech before a bomb explodes, the scream of a father pulling his daughter's body from the rubble, the cries of hungry children with ribs like bird cages.\nIt's strange what breaks through. It's rarely facts or numbers. Dozens of Israeli children were killed by Hamas on Oct. 7. Thousands upon thousands of Palestinian children have been killed since that date. Among much of the Jewish community I grew up in, one number evokes national mourning. The other is met with silence.\nIn a recent interview, Ezra Klein spoke with writer Kathryn Schulz about the challenge of staying emotionally awake.\n\"I spend days covering efforts to rip health care from people and torch the global economy,\" Klein said, \"and then I'm supposed to go to a birthday party.\"\nWe can't live every second in full awareness, Schulz tells him. We'd collapse. But, she says, if we're lucky enough to feel suffering only indirectly, we must choose, again and again, not to look away. Even if we don't know how to intervene.\nThroughout the day, I keep remembering the snapper's death. The arc her body made in the air. The shattering crunch. These turtles can live for up to 100 years. Who knew how many years were cut from her life? She had survived predators, pollution, drought. And then in an instant, she was smashed to pieces.\nI am haunted by my inaction.\nWhy didn't I wave at the car? Why didn't I hold up my hand? I keep thinking about how preventable it all felt. How easily we destroy what we don't slow down to see. How easy it is to detach from it all.\nOver time, the memory of this day will fade. But I want to remember that sound. That cracking. Because in its violence it connected me to the fragility of life, the tragedy of indifference, the ease with which one becomes numb — and how dangerous that can be. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They love four wheelers, they love balls, they love their daddy, they were outside boys. They had to be outside all the time.\"\nBentley was 3 years old, Puckett said. He was just beginning riding his four wheeler by himself. Bentley also enjoyed riding a four wheeler with his older brother, Mikey, who Bentley called \"his Mikey.\"\n\"I mean he was life,\" Puckett said about Bentley. \"From the time he got up to the time he went to sleep, he was outside playing.

Bentley was not a morning person and Mason was. When they woke up, Mason wanted to give his brother kisses and hugs, and Bentley didn't want nothing to do with him. They always just wanted to go outside, I don't care if it was rain, cold or nothing, they wanted to go outside.\"\nMason and Bentley have seven siblings who they loved dearly.

GEDMAN St. Luke’s GMC, Denton | Section: Columns \n \n 340\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n What does God want from me?Without question, our belief in Jesus as the Christ is the prerequisite to everything else. Nevertheless, what does Christ want after our salvation?\nCertainly, He does not need anything from the physical world. After all, God is the provider of all things. But there is one thing we can offer: Time.\nTime is definable and measurable. It controls our lives, it marches on no matter what we do, and our days are limited. We sell it, give it away and waste it. The best we can do is to utilize our time efficiently and effectively. In our culture, time is precious commodity. God wants our time. Interestingly, time is the one thing may people claim not to have.\n\"They are too busy,\" they'll say. Well, as someone noted, the acronym BUSY means \"buried under Satan's yoke.\" Yep, too many times our being \"busy\" causes us to not spend time with God.\nJesus taught that we should \"seek first his kingdom.\" This requires time. Just as we prioritize bills and purchases, our time is prioritized, and God is not always at the top of the list. While this seems to be a part of our human condition, there is one solution I can offer, whereby you can begin to commit more of your time to God: weekly worship.\nPaul admonished us to \"not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing.\" Consider for a moment that we have 168 hours per week. An average worship service is one hour. By dividing 1 into 168, we see that Sunday worship consumes six-10ths of 1 percent (.6%) of our time.\nEven netting our time by a 40-hour work week, 56 hours for sleep and one hour preparation and travel time to church, only amounts to 1.4% of our time.\nIs God worth 1.4% of our time? Commit yourself to attending corporate worship once a week. God will bless your commitment, and you'll find that you want to spend more time with God in prayer and reading His Word, the Bible. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

My heart leapt into my throat, and I shouted my husband's name. He had already turned and was sprinting through the shallows toward our youngest daughter.Our family of five had gone to a little stretch of sandy beach in Cambridge, Maryland. We watched our girls playing at the water's edge, our toddler splashing nearby. But in what seemed like an instant, she had wandered out too far and was now completely submerged, with only her tiny hands reaching up for help.\nThat near-tragedy rattled us deeply. We considered ourselves good parents, careful and attentive, but in one unguarded moment, everything could have changed forever.\nThis memory has been on my mind again after hearing of two recent tragedies: the loss of two toddler brothers who drowned in Greensboro, Maryland, and the young girls swept away by flash flooding at Camp Mystic in Texas.\nThe grief of those families is unimaginable, and my heart aches for them.\nI find myself asking the same questions they surely ask: Where was God? Did He see? Did He hear their cries?\nI don't know why some are rescued and others are not. But I do know this: God did not turn His face away.\nEven when Jesus hung on the cross, suffering unimaginably, God saw. Many assume He turned His back when Jesus cried out, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" (Matthew 27:46). I once believed that too. But as Bible teacher Rich Schmidt explains, Jesus was quoting Psalm 22 — a psalm that begins in agony but ends in hope: \"For he has not despised or scorned the suffering of the afflicted one; he has not hidden his face from him but has listened to his cry for help\" (Psalm 22:24).\nJesus was not alone on the cross. And those children were not alone in the water.\nGod's watchful eye misses nothing:\n\"The eyes of the Lord are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good.\" (Proverbs 15:3)\n\"The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.\" (Psalm 34:18)\nMy prayer is that the grieving families somehow feel His gaze upon them now — not with answers, but with presence.\nBecause He sees.\nEven here.

    "content": "Shame of being poor becomes empathy, motivation\n\n July 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ARLYCE MENZIES | Section: News \n \n 898\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I grew up poor, that is, American poor.I fantasized about food at night–mashed potatoes, buttery dinner rolls, raspberry cheesecake. I would wake up and imagine a breakfast — strawberry waffles with whipped cream, cold orange juice — then, talk myself toward accepting what I knew was there — toast with peanut butter and usually, milk. My dad did not tolerate ungratefulness.\nI couldn't pay school fees like the dreaded $10 workbook fee and was harangued by the dogged collectors as I repeated that I forgot it. I couldn't rent an instrument, so I didn't play one but singing lit my heart on fire. I couldn't join sports, couldn't buy uniforms or pay for trips. My gym teacher in seventh grade said I was great at running and hurdles, and she encouraged me to join the track team. I joined, but immediately sprained my big toe and quit. I think my teacher, the coach, knew I could have overcome this minor injury, but couldn't overcome going without the right shoes, walking two miles home from practices, having no money or rides or, in fact, confidence to run.\nI got the free lunch at school. We had to walk up to the stage in the cafeteria to find our ticket — a white card with our name on it — before getting in line. Not only were we conspicuous, frantically searching for the ticket in front of everyone, but we were also the last to get the food our bagged-lunch friends couldn't recognize.\n\"What is that? Are you going to eat that?!\"\nWhen we had to bring a lunch for field days, my dad would pack something in a bread bag like an only-peanut-butter sandwich and a whole carrot with the white root hairs obscenely pressed against the clear plastic. Variations on this lunch included a boiled egg crayoned with \"B\" on the shell or a plain baked potato.\nPackaged snacks weren't covered by food stamps or WIC — milk stuffs for Women Infants and Children. We had whole milk and bricks of government cheese food. We had unmarked cans and other food bank finds including, once, a sugary cereal we were excited about until we tasted that it had been contaminated by the powdered laundry soap it had sat with in the donation box.\nWe were turned away in shops because what we wanted couldn't be bought with this other-colored money or because they said they didn't have change for food stamps. Thankfully, my mom mostly knew where she could stock up and on what.\nWe rarely went to the doctor. We all have scars that show no one stitched them or set the bones straight — OK, only one broken finger set with a stick and tape. When my sister was really sick, the irritated doctor didn't want to take Medicaid. He only gave her Claritin. It turned out to be mono, and she was in bed for a week, then she got pneumonia. She recovered. Our remedies were to pray, drink water, put a cloth on your head or where you hurt, hot or cold, depending.\nMy mother-in-law says I'm an exception.\nShe says people on welfare are lazy, only busy pumping out babies and watching TV. She thinks it's easy to have no job, let the checks roll in, buy steaks and chocolate with your government winnings. She hasn't sat in the welfare office for three hours only to be yelled at, looked down upon and rejected for the second time because you couldn't get the papers right.\nShe hasn't had a disability or loved a person who is blind from a genetic disease like my dad was. She hasn't had a nervous breakdown, spent months in mental wards after suicide attempts like my mom has. She doesn't know anyone who grew up on or is on welfare, except for me.\nIn some ways, I am an exception. I grew up with both my married parents. My great-grandfathers were a doctor and a lawyer. The lawyer left us each $4,000 for college. There wasn't any question — we had to go to college. My dad went blind slowly. He memorized children's books so he could \"read\" to us without seeing the pages.\nAlthough she didn't finish college, my mom loves poetry and had a full mahogany bookcase. She planted daffodils in the yard; we lived in our own house. My parents got a settlement after being in a dormitory fire. My mom's dad got a lawyer who won them enough to buy a house on an acre of grassy land with crab apple trees that bloomed pink in spring.\nI am not an exception in that I am white. More than 62 percent of welfare recipients are white and about 46 percent are single mothers. Despite the term \"white trash\" my mother-in-law imagines this waste of money is for People of Color.\nI am not an exception in that my parents are disabled. The majority of welfare recipients are children, the elderly, and people with disabilities.\nI am not an exception in that I am hardworking and work to improve my life and the lives of others.\nI am not an exception in that very young, I knew some strangers, teachers and people around me thought I was a useless weight, a tax burden, a bad decision, a mistake. I am not an exception in carrying this shame, trying to shape it, alchemize it into empathy, motivation, a commitment to justice. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Texas tragedy has shown worst of American society\n\n July 19, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 782\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The recent flash flood tragedy in central Texas resulted in seeing the best and the worst of American society.The best has been an outpouring of sympathy, caring and support for the flood victims, their families and the survivors. There have been countless reports of selfless rescue and recovery efforts by first responders and volunteers, some from well beyond the immediate flooded area.\nThe worst has been numerous messages on social media and other media platforms — e.g., a newspaper editorial cartoon — that were vile, hateful and some of which were vulgar.\nMany of them chose to blame Trump supporters or policy decisions of the Trump administration for this tragedy.\nFar too many did not include expressions of sadness or sympathy for the deaths of innocent children and adults or compassion for the lifelong impact on all the flooding survivors.\nThe level of vitriol in these messages is so offensive, I will not repeat any of them in this column.\nThe only thing they have in common is they are devoid of any sense of decency and civility.\nSomewhat surprising has been dismay and even outrage expressed from unexpected sources over these vile messages.\nNina Turner is a former national co-chair for the Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign.\nShe recently said, \"It takes a serious lack of humanity to see children to be in a politicized discussion and respond something like lines of \"that's what they [voters in Texas] voted for.\"\nTurner's closing one word comment says it all — \"Shameful.\"\nJohn Favreau and Tommy Vietor are co-hosts on the left of center, Pod Save America.\nBoth worked for Barack Obama prior to and during his presidential administration.\nBoth have condemned social media posts that blame local Texans and the Trump administration for all who died as a result of the recent floods.\nFavreau said: \"I think the really gross stuff was, I saw some people be, like, 'Well, Texas, you voted for Trump, and this is what you get.'\"\nFavreau has challenged suggestions that staffing levels at the National Weather Service in Texas had anything to do with the tragedy. Favreau has said, \"It seems like the National Weather Service, like I said, did send out a timely warning, it just didn't get to people. And that's, you know, not the Trump administration saying that; independent meteorologists and experts have all said this.\"\nVietor has said that while questions about the effect of weather services cuts could be \"an important question going forward, I could have done without the, like, instant, you know, leap to blame name-your-political-opponent for this tragedy on Twitter.\"\nThe \"blame your political opponent\" campaign on this tragedy is already well underway.\nShortly after news broke on the flooding, Sen. Chuck Schumer demanded the Commerce Department's inspector general investigate vacancies at National Weather Service offices and whether the purported vacancies resulted in a higher death toll in in Texas.\nSchumer has suggested that proposed but yet-to-be-implemented Trump budget cuts resulted in unfilled weather service positions in Texas were to blame. Sen. Chris Dodd has said likewise.\nSchumer proclaimed: \"The American people deserve answers.\"\nYes, we do, but not from you two or anyone who wants to advance a political agenda from this tragedy.\nWe deserve answers only if the following investigative guidelines are agreed to, in advance of, and are strictly adhered to during every phase of any investigation. At a minimum, the investigation must focus less on assigning blame for what happened or did not happen with regard to timely and effective flash flood alerts.\nThe laser like focus must be on what can be done going forward to help ensure it never happens again.\nDiffering opinions must be welcome and considered provided they follow the timeless observation of former U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who once said, \"Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts.\"\nOne new previously unreported fact comes from a recent Washington Post article headline — \"Camp Mystic's leader got a 'life threatening' flood alert. They evacuated an hour later.\"\nWe also need to accept that we never have and never will live in a risk-free world.\nWe can only anticipate risks and take prudent steps to try to avoid them or deal with them if and when necessary. Accidents can never be totally avoided despite plans and best intentions.\nGoing forward, we desperately need a renewed universal commitment that when tragedies strike, to make sure social media posts and other public reactions reflect common decency and respect for each and every person impacted in any way by that tragedy.\nThis is especially vital in dealing with those who hold different political party affiliations or different views on a wide range of public policy issues.\nWe must do so if we have any hope of reversing the steadily declining levels of decency and civility in our society. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to his daughter, Clarissa Fuentes Diaz, Espinal, who also does construction work, was arrested by ICE agents early Monday morning after stopping by Lowe's to pick up material for a job site.\nICE confirmed Espinal's arrest in a statement to the Star Democrat Thursday.\n\"Daniel Omar Fuentes Espinal is an illegal alien from Honduras who was arrested by ICE on July 21, in Easton, Maryland,\" the statement read. \"Fuentes entered the United States on a 6-month visa and never left in 24 years. It is a federal crime to overstay the authorized period of time granted under a visitors visa.\"\nDiaz said Espinal had no other criminal history. She said the family is working with an immigration attorney, but access to and information about Espinal is limited other than occasional 20-minute phone calls, which cost $50.\nAccording to Diaz, her father has not had access to his medications and is sleeping on a concrete floor in the ICE detention center. She said he has been helping other detainees by preaching, praying and giving them faith.\nMembers of the Mid-Shore community have organized efforts in support of Espinal in the wake of the arrest.\nTred Avon Strategies principal Len Foxwell created a GoFundMe with a goal of $15,000 to support Espinal's growing legal fees and help cover costs for Espinal's wife and three children during his absence.\nFoxwell's son, who recently died in a car accident, was best friends with Espinal's son.\nThe GoFundMe, created Thursday morning, was more than halfway toward its goal as of 4 p.m. Thursday.\nThe Talbot Democratic Forum and the Talbot Democratic Central Committee plan to hold a rally on Friday from 5:30 to 7 p.m. on Route 50 and Dover Road in Easton to demand Espinal's immediate release from ICE custody.\n\"Pastor Daniel Fuentes Espinal was ripped from his family and congregation by ICE with no warning. He has no criminal record. He's a father, a faith leader, and a vital part of our Eastern Shore community,\" Cambridge Indivisible wrote in a Facebook post promoting the rally.\nDemocratic politicians from throughout the state are also calling for Espinal's release.\n\"The Trump Administration clearly isn't targeting the most dangerous criminals living in the U.S. illegally — they are snatching up anyone they can find as they pursue their mass deportation agenda and terrorizing our communities in the process. My team is engaged with Pastor Espinal's family and I will be monitoring this closely,\" U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen said in a statement to the Star Democrat.\nRep. Andy Harris (R-Md. 1st), whose district includes Easton, said in a statement to the Star Democrat that he was aware of Espinal's situation but did not have the specifics of the case.\n\"Congressman Harris believes due process within the immigration system is important and that facts should be clear before making any further public comment,\" the statement said. \"More broadly, Rep. Harris has always believed that any immigration enforcement action taken should be based on accurate information and lawful immigration adjudication processes.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Cooking for The King\n\n August 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1061\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Today's column is being written from the heart. The month of August is always a busy month, but not too busy for me to reflect on the past.Those of you who know me also know this is the month I usually travel to Memphis and meet with worldwide friends to gather at Graceland and pay respects to Elvis.\nAug. 16, 1977 was the day we teenagers of the late 1950s and '60s lost one of our favorite idols. Hard to believe it's been 48 years since I heard the news that morning. As goes with all our idols, Elvis is just as popular today with fans of all ages.\nMy answer to those who ask why I liked him so much is easy to explain: My older siblings loved the late 1940s through the mid-1950s music, and when I became a preteen, my generation needed a change of dance styles and rock 'n' roll music. And we got it — to the horror of our elders. That is true for all generations.\nWhen I meet fans from Germany, some are my age, but some are 30 and 40 years old and remembering their grandparents and parents talking about Elvis serving in the Army in Germany.\nLet's explore some of the King's favorite foods. Elvis loved his mother's meatloaf, and I occasionally make this recipe.\nMEATLOAF\n2 lbs ground beef, one chopped onion, one chopped green pepper, two minced cloves garlic, 4 oz crushed saltines, 8-oz can crushed tomatoes, 8-oz can tomato sauce, 1/2 cup ketchup.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Mix together ground beef with onion, green pepper, garlic, crushed saltines and crushed tomatoes. Mix well and form into a loaf and place in a baking pan. Bake covered, for 45 minutes. In the meantime, mix tomato sauce and ketchup and set aside. After 45 minutes of baking, remove the meatloaf and pour the ketchup on top and return to the oven. Bake for another 15 minutes and serve with mashed potatoes.\nROAST BEEF\n2 tbsps black pepper, 1 1/2 tbsps salt, 2 tbsps garlic, 6 lb beef, 1 1/2 cups water.\nMix pepper, salt and garlic to form a paste and rub on this mixture on the beef. Place this roast in a baking pan, add water and place in a 350-degree oven. Bake for about 4 hours or until tender. You can steam some fresh vegetables to serve with the roast.\nSPANISH OMELETTE\n4 eggs, 1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1/2 cup shredded cheese, salt and pepper.\nBeat eggs well and mix in bell pepper and onion. Fold in 1/2 cup shredded cheese of your choice with salt and pepper to taste. Cook in a greased skillet for about 4 minutes.\nHAMBURGER STEAK ELVIS\n2 1/2 pounds ground beef, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1/2 cup chopped green pepper, 1 tbsp garlic, 1 tbsp salt, 1 tbsp black pepper, 2 cups mushroom soup, 2 eggs (beaten).\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl mix together ground beef, chopped onions, chopped green pepper, garlic, salt, black pepper, mushroom soup and eggs. Mix well Shape into mini steaks and fry in a skillet with 2 tablespoons Crisco. Cook for about 12 to 15 minutes, making sure steaks are cooked inside well. Drain on paper towels and proceed to make gravy with grease left in the pan.\nELVIS BANANA BREAD\n2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 4 medium ripe bananas (mashed), 2 large eggs (room temperature), 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter, 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/4 cup canola oil, 2 tsps vanilla extract, 2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk the first six ingredients. In another bowl, whisk bananas, eggs, peanut butter, applesauce, oil and vanilla until blended. Add to flour mixture; stir just until moistened. Fold in chocolate chips. Transfer to three loaf pans coated with cooking spray. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in pans 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool. If you make multiple loaves like Mary Jenkins Langston would make for his plane rides to Las Vegas, you can freeze them and reheat. Securely wrap the cooled loaves and freeze. To use, thaw at room temperature or, if desired, microwave each loaf on high for 60-75 seconds or until heated through.\nFRIED PEANUT BUTTER AND BANANA SANDWICHES\nSmear peanut butter on one slice of bread, and on the other slice smear the bread with mashed banana. Put the slices together, smear each outside slice with bacon grease and fry in a hot skillet.\nFRIED DILL PICKLES\n1 jar (32 oz) whole dill pickles, 1 cup buttermilk, 2 tbsps Louisiana-style hot sauce, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup cornmeal, 2 tbsps garlic salt, 2 tbsps paprika, 1 tbsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp pepper, oil for deep-fat frying, ranch salad dressing.\nDrain pickles, discarding liquid. Cut pickles into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Drain on paper towels; blot with additional paper towels until dry. In a shallow bowl, mix buttermilk and hot sauce. In another shallow bowl, mix flour, cornmeal, garlic salt, paprika, cayenne pepper and pepper. Dip pickles in buttermilk mixture, then in flour mixture. In a Dutch oven, heat one inch of oil to 375 degrees. Working in batches, fry pickles for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with ranch dressing, if desired.\nBefore I close the column today, I need to honor my late brother, Staff Sgt. (E6) Ollie L. Hitchens Jr., who would be celebrating his 78th birthday on Aug. 15. Ollie served 20 years in the U.S. Army and pulled three tours of duty in Vietnam.\nOllie and I had a lot in common — our likes, dislikes, love for Chevy cars, love of family, patriotic responsibilities, personalities and love for Elvis.\nOllie loved our mom's old-fashioned cooking and often wrote home about how he missed it. While on his many trips home Mom would make sure to have those foods ready — fried chicken, pot roast, pork chops, mashed potatoes, fried liver with gravy, chicken and dumplings, fresh lima beans with tomatoes, corn and potatoes and of course homemade biscuits. I have shared many of these recipes with you in previous columns.\nRest in peace, brother — as I always say, \"All gave some, and some gave all.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.\"\nIn a world filled with uncertainty, Jesus offers a life-changing perspective: focus on God's kingdom first, and stop worrying about tomorrow.\nTo \"seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness\" means placing God's priorities ahead of our own. It is a daily choice to pursue His will, His ways, and His purposes. When we do this, Jesus promises that \"all these things\" — our basic needs of life — will be provided.\nJesus also addresses one of life's greatest challenges: worry about the future. He reminds us that tomorrow has its own problems and should not rob us of today's peace. Worry adds stress but accomplishes nothing. Faith, however, produces calm and confidence because it trusts God with what lies ahead.\nThree Practical Steps:\nStart with God each day — Begin mornings with prayer and Scripture, keeping your focus on His kingdom.Release tomorrow's concerns — Choose trust over anxiety; handle today's responsibilities, and let tomorrow rest with God.Rest in His care — Believe that as you prioritize Him, He will supply what you truly need.\nThe heart of Jesus' teaching is simple but powerful: when God is first, worry loses its grip. Today, choose to trust Him fully, live faithfully, and embrace His peace for today while leaving tomorrow in His hands. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We fret over not enough money or worry about what we will do if we have too much money. Most of us don't have the latter problem.\nWe fret over not enough space or how we care for too much space. We accumulate and store up in our barns and build bigger barns to store up more stuff. We then don't know what we will do with all the stuff.\nHow much does it take to bring you peace and make you happy? Can you be happy in a one-room dwelling place? Does it take a 25-room house to make you feel good? How many cars do you need to make you feel satisfied? Or is satisfaction only a remotely impossible concept? Many years ago, one popular song lamented, \"I can't get no satisfaction.\"\nSatisfaction and happiness may be claimed for a season. Possibly you are satisfied with your vocation, athletic accomplishments, family life, parenting success, fulfillment of life goals and ambitions? Often, we are but then those seasons pass. Careers end, athletic contests become history, retirement comes with memories that fade farther and farther into the past.\nToo often most of us can look back and wonder, \"what if?\" we may say. The problem with \"what if?\" is that it doesn't change anything. If it is in the past, you can't relive it or change it regardless of how great you were or how bad you were.\nAll we have for certain, is today. Even today is iffy. Since today is all we really have then it's best to not mess it up by constantly looking over our shoulders. You can't go forward always looking back.\nIn the Bible there was a man named Lot. He and his wife were told not to look back at Sodom and Gomera. She did and turned into a pillar of salt. Looking back has a way of doing that to all us as we become immobilized in time.\nWhat does it take to make you happy? Someone to love and someone who loves you? A few family members to care for who also care for you? Enough money to pay the light bill and keep food on the table? Something to do during the day that you enjoy? The only person who can answer these questions is you because only you know what it really takes to make you happy.\nHappiness is very much happenstance. Things change every day. Health, sickness, the stock market, families, jobs and hobbies. Friends and loved ones move away or die. Lie is always changing.\nGod never changes. Happiness may vary throughout the day or week, but your joy and peace that comes with faith in God and focusing on Him is something the world cannot give or take away.\nKeep this verse in mind this day regardless of whether you feel happy or if you are down and blue.\n\"You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in you.\" Isaiah 26:3. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'1984' was not fiction ... it was a warning\n\n August 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JARED O. BELL | Section: Columns \n \n 896\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n If I'm completely honest, I can't recall all the twists and turns of \"1984.\"I probably read it in high school or maybe as an undergrad, somewhere alongside \"Animal Farm.\" They're the kind of books teachers press into young hands to spark critical thinking, to push us to look beyond the surface, question the official story, and spot the sleight of hand in politics and power. What has stayed with me isn't the fine detail of the plot, but the feeling it left behind: that the words on the page were not just fiction, but a warning, one I wasn't sure I needed at the time, but which feels uncomfortably relevant now.\nIn \"1984,\" George Orwell particularly warned us about the dangers of language twisted into a tool of control. His fictional Newspeak and doublethink have since morphed into what we now call doublespeak, the art of making lies sound truthful, brutality seem humane and repression appear just and fair. In the U.S. and around the world, the language of democracy and human rights is often wielded not as a shield for the vulnerable, but as a weapon to serve political agendas and target those deemed expendable.\nWhile this is hardly new, as history is littered with leaders who cloaked repression in the language of freedom, today the phenomenon is compounded by the reach and velocity of social media, 24-hour news cycles and algorithm-driven outrage. These tools don't just spread doublespeak; they normalize it, rewarding those who weaponize democratic ideals with likes, shares and airtime until the distortion becomes the dominant narrative.\nWords like democracy, freedom, justice, fairness, human rights, along with lofty invocations of \"protecting the rule of law,\" have been co-opted by those who embody anything but. What's more unsettling is how banal this has become, so regularized that for those of us who still hold to the true principles of democracy, the world now feels upside down.\nOne example that has stayed with me comes from the Trump administration's deportations without due process. On social media, I repeatedly saw the refrain: \"This is what I voted for, a president promising to remove those who entered the U.S. 'illegally,'\" all under the guise of protecting the rule of law.\nYet the reality was far murkier. Take the case of Kilmar Abrego García, who in 2019 was granted protection from removal by an immigration judge due to credible threats in El Salvador. That order was ignored, and he was deported anyway — even as another federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to halt such actions. In other words, the rhetoric of law and justice was invoked while the actual rule of law was being actively undermined.\nAnother example from the U.S. is the notion that somehow suppressing the rights of trans women promotes the rights and liberties of women, a claim wrapped in the language of \"protection\" and \"fairness.\" Meanwhile many of the same states advancing these measures have simultaneously moved to strip away women's reproductive freedoms, curtailing their ability to make decisions about their own bodies and health care.\nOr, on a more global scale, consider the mass killing of civilians in Gaza, permitted, even rationalized, by much of the international community, especially in the West, under the guise of delivering \"justice\" and \"accountability\" for the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, which targeted and kidnapped innocent civilians. Yet Israel has been allowed, and actively supported, in carrying out indiscriminate bombings that have killed thousands, actions that are anything but justice or accountability.\nThe United States and several European countries have blocked or watered down UN Security Council resolutions calling for an immediate ceasefire, while continuing to supply Israel with military aid despite mounting civilian casualties. Meanwhile, the United States has sanctioned ICC judges and United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967.\nUsing the language of democracy and human rights is no different from leaders invoking \"protection\" during emergencies, not to safeguard the public, but to consolidate power and erode democratic norms. After 9/11, the United States expanded surveillance and curtailed civil liberties. During COVID-19, Hungary used emergency powers to rule by decree. In Egypt, anti-terror laws have been turned against journalists and political opponents.\nIn each case, the rhetoric of safety masked a tightening grip on power. Yet when democracy and human rights are twisted into this same kind of doublespeak, we undermine values that are already fragile, and, to be blunt, growing more fleeting by the day. The Economist Intelligence Unit reported a plunge in the global average democracy rating to 5.17 in 2024, the lowest since tracking began in 2006, with roughly 39% of the world's population now living under authoritarian regimes.\nThese figures are not simply a barometer of democratic vitality; they are a warning. The doublespeak that corrodes democracy on paper is the same force shaping real-world crises. To challenge these forces and those who hijack the language of democracy and human rights for their own ends, the true essence of these values must be continually echoed.\nEvery NGO, movement, article, discussion, meme, TikTok video or other act that counters these narratives helps protect the genuine form and spirit of democracy and human rights. Without such efforts, the values we hold dear will keep being twisted into tools of their own destruction, as we sink further into a present-day dystopia where the language of freedom is mistranslated into the language of repression. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was on his way to his construction job, his family said. He was taken to ICE's field office in Salisbury and then transferred to Baltimore, where he spent three nights in Baltimore before being transferred to a detention center in Louisiana.\nEspinal was granted bond on Tuesday, family told The Baltimore Banner.\nHis arrest received regional and national attention. In Easton, it stopped services at his congregation and sparked weekly protests against ICE.\nEarlier this month, Easton Town Council members called for Espinal to be returned to his family.\nEspinal has been in the country since 2001 and has no criminal record, his family has said. Following his arrest, ICE stated that Espinal was arrested for overstaying his six-month visa.\n\"Daniel Omar Fuentes Espinal is an illegal alien from Honduras who was arrested by ICE on July 21, in Easton, Maryland,\" the statement said. \"Fuentes entered the United States on a 6-month visa and never left in 24 years. It is a federal crime to overstay the authorized period of time granted under a visitors visa.\"\nOn Saturday, U.S. Sens. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) each issued statements on social media after Espinal's release.\nVan Hollen called Espinal's return home \"an important victory\" and said \"there are many more like him.\"\n\"Thanks to all who rallied to bring Pastor Daniel Fuentes Espinal home after his unjust abduction from Maryland's Eastern Shore,\" Van Hollen wrote on X.\nThis story has been updated to include statements from U.S. Sens.

Nowhere is that more true than in the Psalms.When I began the habit of daily praying through the Psalms, I quickly discovered that these ancient prayers put language to the full range of human experience.\nSome mornings I read words of joy and praise, \"Rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous\" (Psalm 97), and I find my heart lifted in thanksgiving. Other mornings I encounter the raw honesty of lament, \"Awake! Why are you sleeping, O Lord?\" (Psalm 44), and I realize I am allowed to bring my questions and frustrations to God. Still other times I pray with the psalmist who feels abandoned, yet clings to hope by remembering God's mighty deeds (Psalm 77).\nWhat I appreciate most is that the Psalms refuse to settle for shallow faith. They teach us that real prayer is not polished or polite but honest and wholehearted. Whether we are rejoicing or grieving, praising or questioning, the Psalms remind us that God invites us to come as we are.\nAnd for Christians, praying the Psalms takes us one step further. These prayers ultimately point us to Jesus, the one who prayed them before us and for us. On the cross He took up the words of Psalm 22, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" so that we might learn to trust that God hears us in every season.\nDaily, the Psalms give us the words we need, and the God we need. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

SEARS Maryland Matters | Section: State News \n \n 461\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A provision in Maryland's digital ad tax is an unconstitutional restriction on free speech, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.The 2021 law — the first of its kind in the nation — imposes taxes on large tech companies for the digital ads they sell within the state. But it prohibits those companies from passing the tax on to consumers as a surcharge, fee or line item on their bills — what a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals saw as a ban on telling customers about the new added tax.\nIn a ruling that invoked American protests against the Colonial-era Stamp Act, Circuit Judge Julius Richardson wrote that, as then, \"complaining about taxes remains a grand American political tradition.\" And the court said Maryland lawmakers went too far by adding language to the tax bill that was intended to shield them from public criticism.\n\"Perhaps fearing such complaints, Maryland paired its tax with another rule,\" Richardson wrote for the court. \"Companies that make money advertising on the internet must not only pay the tax, but avoid telling their customers how it affects pricing: No line items, no surcharges, no fees.\n\"If companies pass on the cost of the tax, they must do so in silence — keeping customers in the dark about why prices have gone up and thereby insulating Maryland from political responsibility,\" he wrote.\nThe ruling reverses a 2024 decision by U.S. District Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby, who agreed with the plaintiffs — a group of tech firms and business associations — that the law created some First Amendment issues. But she let the law stand because the offending provision had \"many constitutional applications.\"\nFriday's circuit court ruling sent the case back to Griggsby with instructions to determine an appropriate remedy for the plaintiffs.\nThe ruling is a blow to officials who looked to the unique tax to help pay for expensive K-12 education reforms contained in the Blueprint for Maryland's Future. Expenses associated with that law continue to rise and are potentially budget busting — even if the digital ad tax survives the onslaught of legal challenges.\nThe 2021 law — sponsored by Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) — targets big tech firms including Apple, Meta and Google.\nUnder the law, companies reporting $100 million of gross global annual revenue are subject to a 2.5% levy. The tax increases in increments of 2.5% to a maximum rate of 10% levied against companies reporting more than $15 billion in gross global revenue.\nThe state could collect as much as $250 million annually from the digital ad tax, according to a legislative analysis. The funds are earmarked for the education reform program.\nNeither Ferguson nor Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D), the defendant in the lawsuit, immediately responded to requests for comment on the ruling Friday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

GEDMAN St. Luke’s GMC, Denton | Section: Columns \n \n 342\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n What does God want from me? Without question, our belief in Jesus as the Christ is the prerequisite to everything else. Nevertheless, what does Christ want after our salvation?Certainly, He does not need anything from the physical world. After all, God is the provider of all things. But there is one thing we can offer: time.\nTime is definable and measurable. It controls our lives, it marches on no matter what we do, and our days are limited. We sell it, give it away and waste it.\nThe best we can do is to utilize our time efficiently and effectively. In our culture, time is a precious commodity.\nGod wants our time. Interestingly, time is the one thing many people claim not to have. \"They are too busy,\" they'll say. Well, as someone noted, the acronym b.u.s.y. means \"buried under Satan's yoke.\" Yep, too many times our being \"busy\" causes us to not spend time with God.\nJesus taught that we should \"seek first his kingdom.\" This requires time.\nJust as we prioritize bills and purchases, our time is prioritized and God is not always at the top of the list. While this seems to be a part of our human condition, there is one solution I can offer, whereby you can begin to commit more of your time to God: weekly worship.\nPaul admonished us to \"not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing.\" Consider for a moment that we have 168 hours per week. An average worship service is one hour. By dividing 1 into 168, we see that Sunday worship consumes six tenths of one percent (.6%) of our time. Even netting our time by a forty-hour work week, 56 hours for sleep and one hour preparation and travel time to church, only amounts to 1.4% of our time. Is God worth 1.4% of our time?\nCommit yourself to attending corporate worship once a week. God will bless your commitment and you'll find that you want to spend more time with God in prayer and reading His Word, the Bible. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

During the era of Franco, from the end of the civil war in 1939 until his death in 1975, police force was ever present in the capital, Madrid, and throughout the country in small towns and larger cities, urban and rural.For older individuals in this population, the bloody civil war of 1936-1939 was still raw with memories of atrocities. When Franco ceded power to Juan Carlos in 1974 and officially transferred power upon his death in 1975, Spain experienced an opening of freedoms — freedom of the press, religious freedom, freedom to gather, freedom to speak and criticize and express oneself openly without fear of government reprisal.\nDuring the transition into a democratic state, my elderly neighbor and landlady, who had lived through the turmoil of the civil war and was at that time witness to the transition into a democratic state, bemoaned the loss of strict law and order that had been imposed during Franco's regime. To her, the freedoms gained through a transition to a free democratic society had a cost. I think her question, \"Is this democracy worth it?\" is a repeated one that is worth considering today.\nSUSAN MacKINNON\nOxford \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We want all people to have a say in who our candidates will be, not just a select few.\nWith so many media sources available for candidates to communicate their messages, I do not accept the usual arguments for maintaining our current primary election system.\nSUSAN BASHAM\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'1984' was not fiction ... it was a warning\n\n September 6, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JARED O. BELL | Section: Columns \n \n 896\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n If I'm completely honest, I can't recall all the twists and turns of \"1984.\"I probably read it in high school or maybe as an undergrad, somewhere alongside \"Animal Farm.\" They're the kind of books teachers press into young hands to spark critical thinking, to push us to look beyond the surface, question the official story, and spot the sleight of hand in politics and power. What has stayed with me isn't the fine detail of the plot, but the feeling it left behind: that the words on the page were not just fiction, but a warning, one I wasn't sure I needed at the time, but which feels uncomfortably relevant now.\nIn \"1984,\" George Orwell particularly warned us about the dangers of language twisted into a tool of control. His fictional Newspeak and doublethink have since morphed into what we now call doublespeak, the art of making lies sound truthful, brutality seem humane and repression appear just and fair. In the U.S. and around the world, the language of democracy and human rights is often wielded not as a shield for the vulnerable, but as a weapon to serve political agendas and target those deemed expendable.\nWhile this is hardly new, as history is littered with leaders who cloaked repression in the language of freedom, today the phenomenon is compounded by the reach and velocity of social media, 24-hour news cycles and algorithm-driven outrage. These tools don't just spread doublespeak; they normalize it, rewarding those who weaponize democratic ideals with likes, shares and airtime until the distortion becomes the dominant narrative.\nWords like democracy, freedom, justice, fairness, human rights, along with lofty invocations of \"protecting the rule of law,\" have been co-opted by those who embody anything but. What's more unsettling is how banal this has become, so regularized that for those of us who still hold to the true principles of democracy, the world now feels upside down.\nOne example that has stayed with me comes from the Trump administration's deportations without due process. On social media, I repeatedly saw the refrain: \"This is what I voted for, a president promising to remove those who entered the U.S. 'illegally,'\" all under the guise of protecting the rule of law.\nYet the reality was far murkier. Take the case of Kilmar Abrego García, who in 2019 was granted protection from removal by an immigration judge due to credible threats in El Salvador. That order was ignored, and he was deported anyway — even as another federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to halt such actions. In other words, the rhetoric of law and justice was invoked while the actual rule of law was being actively undermined.\nAnother example from the U.S. is the notion that somehow suppressing the rights of trans women promotes the rights and liberties of women, a claim wrapped in the language of \"protection\" and \"fairness.\" Meanwhile many of the same states advancing these measures have simultaneously moved to strip away women's reproductive freedoms, curtailing their ability to make decisions about their own bodies and health care.\nOr, on a more global scale, consider the mass killing of civilians in Gaza, permitted, even rationalized, by much of the international community, especially in the West, under the guise of delivering \"justice\" and \"accountability\" for the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, which targeted and kidnapped innocent civilians. Yet Israel has been allowed, and actively supported, in carrying out indiscriminate bombings that have killed thousands, actions that are anything but justice or accountability.\nThe United States and several European countries have blocked or watered down UN Security Council resolutions calling for an immediate ceasefire, while continuing to supply Israel with military aid despite mounting civilian casualties. Meanwhile, the United States has sanctioned ICC judges and United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967.\nUsing the language of democracy and human rights is no different from leaders invoking \"protection\" during emergencies, not to safeguard the public, but to consolidate power and erode democratic norms. After 9/11, the United States expanded surveillance and curtailed civil liberties. During COVID-19, Hungary used emergency powers to rule by decree. In Egypt, anti-terror laws have been turned against journalists and political opponents.\nIn each case, the rhetoric of safety masked a tightening grip on power. Yet when democracy and human rights are twisted into this same kind of doublespeak, we undermine values that are already fragile, and, to be blunt, growing more fleeting by the day. The Economist Intelligence Unit reported a plunge in the global average democracy rating to 5.17 in 2024, the lowest since tracking began in 2006, with roughly 39% of the world's population now living under authoritarian regimes.\nThese figures are not simply a barometer of democratic vitality; they are a warning. The doublespeak that corrodes democracy on paper is the same force shaping real-world crises. To challenge these forces and those who hijack the language of democracy and human rights for their own ends, the true essence of these values must be continually echoed.\nEvery NGO, movement, article, discussion, meme, TikTok video or other act that counters these narratives helps protect the genuine form and spirit of democracy and human rights. Without such efforts, the values we hold dear will keep being twisted into tools of their own destruction, as we sink further into a present-day dystopia where the language of freedom is mistranslated into the language of repression. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Country Cooking: Enjoying the fall vegetables\n\n September 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARIE SAVAGE Country Cooking | Section: Food \n \n 1814\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It's that time of the year when summer is slowly slipping away and fall is approaching. All the signs are appearing — from the school bus to the pumpkins at the roadside stands.Growing up in the country, this time of year was usually when the potato baskets came out of storage. This meant that \"digging day\" was coming up. Mom would remind my sister and I that it would soon be storing food time. We had to scrub down the kitchen and the canning equipment after the summer harvest was processed and stored in the canning closet or the freezer.\nIt had been a long and busy summer both on the farm, in town, just about everywhere there is a kitchen and a family to feed. Even farmers, who made money selling crops, had to keep enough on hand to feed their families.\nNowadays, with the economy struggling, prices are going up on everything related to feeding the family. Families from all walks of life are preparing the food supply for winter months ahead. Makes you think of those families that survived times like the Great Depression.\nThis time of year in my family, most money went to school clothes or yards of fabric for clothes to be made at home. As always, we found joy in cooking or at mealtime. We never knew we were poor because so much thought and love was put into every piece of hand-stitched clothing or every plate of food on the table.\nLet's clean out those freezers and make room for the fall veggies. Besides stocking up on, and maybe freezing, the last of your summer produce, get ready for fall by picking up some fresh apples, basil, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, grapes, kale and potatoes.\nFall has always been my favorite season.\nBROCCOLI CHEDDAR CASSEROLE\n2 pounds broccoli (stems removed and crowns cut into florets), 2 strips thick-cut bacon cut crosswise into 1/4-inch strips, 5 large eggs (beaten), 1/3 cup all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 cup whole milk, 2 to 3 tsps freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 2 tsps Dijon mustard, 8 oz cheddar cheese (grated).\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil (1 tbsp salt for 2 quarts of water). Add the broccoli florets and boil for 3 to 5 minutes or until just tender enough so that a fork can easily pierce the floret. Strain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking. While the water in step one is coming to a boil, cook the bacon pieces on medium heat in a frying pan until lightly browned, but not crisp. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the excess fat. Set aside. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Butter a 2.5-quart casserole dish or a foil pan. In a bowl, whisk the eggs into the flour, then whisk in the cream and milk. Add the black pepper (more or less to taste), salt, and mustard. Mix in about a third of the cheese. Place the blanched broccoli florets in the casserole dish, sprinkling about a third of the cheese over the broccoli florets as you lay them down. Sprinkle the bacon pieces over the broccoli. Pour the egg, cream, milk, cheese mixture over the broccoli, moving the broccoli pieces a bit so that the mixture gets into all the nooks and crannies. Sprinkle the casserole with the remaining cheese. Bake until the casserole is set, 25 to 40 minutes depending on the depth of the casserole dish. Once the top has browned, you may want to tent with aluminum foil to keep from burning.\nSHREDDED BRUSSELS SPROUTS AND KALE SALAD WITH APPLE, GORGONZOLA AND CANDIED PECANS\nFor the dressing: 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice, 1 garlic clove (minced), 1 tsp sugar, 1/8 tsp salt, fresh ground pepper to taste. For the salad: 1 pound Brussels sprouts (thinly shredded),1 bunch of kale (stems removed, and leaves finely chopped), 2 medium apples (cored and thinly sliced), 1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1/3 cup candied pecans (chopped), 1/4 cup crumbled gorgonzola cheese, 4 slices cooked chopped turkey bacon (optional).\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, sugar and salt. In a separate large bowl, toss together shredded brussels sprouts and kale mixture with your hands. Slowly pour in dressing and use your hands to massage the kale and brussels sprouts for about 5 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour or up to overnight to allow for dressing to soak into the kale and Brussels. Once ready to serve, toss in apple slices, dried cranberries and chopped candied pecans. If you'd like you can add in chopped bacon at this point and toss salad again. Finally, garnish with crumbled gorgonzola. Serve immediately. Season with freshly ground black pepper.\nEND OF SUMMER GRILLED VEGETABLES\n1 bell pepper cut into half-inch thick strips, 1 red onion cut into half-inch rounds or quarters, 1 zucchini cut into half-inch rounds, 1 yellow squash cut into half-inch rounds, 1/2 pound fingerling potatoes, 1/2 pound Brussels sprouts cut in half, 1/2 pound baby bella mushrooms, 2 ears corn (shucked and cleaned), 2 tbsps olive oil, freshly ground salt and pepper, 2 tsps garlic powder.\nPreheat your grill to medium or medium-high heat, which is about 375 to 400 degrees on a gas grill. Scrape off any leftover bits from the last time you grilled. Marinate your veggies or season them with a little olive oil, salt and pepper. For large veggies like corn, bell pepper, thicker sliced zucchini, eggplant and onion, and portobello mushrooms, I recommend slicing, seasoning and putting them directly on the grill so that they get those lovely grill marks. Place your oiled and seasoned vegetables on the grill in a single layer, starting with the ones that take the longest to cook in the back where your grill is likely the hottest and finishing with the quick cooking vegetables in the front. Close the lid and let the veggies cook for about 5 minutes. Flip your veggies, starting with the closer ones. Then replace the lid and let them cook a few minutes more or until done to your liking. This goes great with any main dish.\nROASTED VEGGIES WITH PARMESAN AND OLIVE OIL\n1 large butternut squash (seeded and cut into cubes), 1 pound Brussels sprouts (halved), 3 large carrots (peeled and sliced), 2 large parsnips (peeled sliced), 1 large red onion (coarsely chopped), 12 garlic cloves (peeled), 2 tbsps olive oil, 1 tbsp dried oregano, 1 tbsp dried rosemary, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, 1/2 tsp salt, freshly ground black pepper.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees. Add veggies to a large bowl. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, oregano, rosemary and garlic. Pour over veggies and toss to evenly distribute. Add in parmesan topping, salt and pepper and toss again until well coated. Pour on a baking sheet and spread out evenly. Roast in the oven for 35-45 minutes, stirring every 15-20 minutes, until squash is fork tender and sprouts are slightly crispy and caramelized.\nCOUNTRY STYLE BAKED SWEET POTATO CASSEROLE\n4 pounds baked sweet potatoes, ½ cup butter, ¼ cup light brown sugar, 2 ½ tsps salt, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla extract, ¾ cup chopped pecans, 3 cups mini marshmallows.\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place the sweet potatoes on a baking sheet and bake for 1 hour, or until very fork tender. This can be done up to 3 days ahead. Refrigerate the baked sweet potatoes if making ahead. Change the oven temperature to 350 degrees. Set out a large mixing bowl. Peel the loose skins off the hot baked sweet potatoes. Place them in the bowl. Add the butter, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla extract. Use an electric mixer to beat the sweet potatoes into a smooth mash. Set out a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Scoop the sweet potato mash into the dish and spread it out in an even layer. Sprinkle the chopped pecans on top. Then sprinkle the mini marshmallows over the pecans in a single layer. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the marshmallows are golden and puffy. Serve warm.\nCABBAGE ROLLS\n1 head green cabbage, 1 cup uncooked rice, 1 pound ground pork, ½ pound ground beef, 2 small onions (diced), 3 cloves garlic (minced), ½ tsp dill, 3 tbsps fresh parsley (chopped), salt and pepper to taste, 1 can diced tomatoes (14 oz), 1 egg, 1 ½ cups plus ⅓ cup tomato sauce (divided), 1 can tomato soup (10.5 oz).\nBoil cabbage leaves for about 2 minutes or until soft. Set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cook rice according to package directions but reduce cooking time by 5 minutes. Set aside. Cook pork, beef, onions, garlic and seasonings in a pan until no pink remains. Drain any fat. Add in rice, diced tomatoes and ⅓ cup of tomato sauce. Stir in egg. Mix remaining tomato sauce and tomato soup in a bowl. Spread a very thin layer of the tomato sauce mixture in a 9-by-13-inch pan. Remove thick stem on cabbage leaves. Lay the cabbage leaf flat and add ¼ to 1/3 cup filling to the center of the leaf. Fold in the sides and roll the cabbage up. Place seam side down in the pan. Repeat with remaining cabbage. Pour sauce over the cabbage and cover tightly with foil. Bake for 75-90 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes before serving.\nSUMMER VEGETABLE SOUP\n1 tbsp olive oil, 1 medium yellow onion (finely diced), 3 sprigs fresh rosemary, 3-4 cloves garlic (minced), 1/2 pound zucchini (sliced into half-moons), 1/2 pound summer squash (sliced into half-moons), 2 ears sweet corn (kernels removed), 1/2 pound green beans, 1/2 pound fresh tomatoes (diced), 1 pound red potatoes (cut into 1-inch cubes), 12 oz frozen lima beans, 15-oz can white beans (drained and rinsed), 7 cups vegetable broth, ¼ cup fresh chopped parsley plus more for topping, 1/2 tsp salt, ¼ tsp black pepper, 2 tbsps lemon juice.\nIn a large soup pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the diced onion and fresh rosemary sprigs. Sauté for 6-8 minutes, or until onion is translucent, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and sauté a minute more. Carefully remove rosemary sprigs. Add all vegetables: zucchini, squash, sweet corn kernels, green beans, tomatoes, frozen lima beans, red potatoes and white beans. Cover in vegetable broth. Stir in salt, pepper and fresh parsley. If extra liquid is needed to fully cover the vegetables, add ½ cup water at a time until vegetables are fully submerged. Cover with a lid. Bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, uncover and reduce heat to low. Simmer uncovered until potato is softened, about 12-15 minutes. When the potatoes and vegetables are tender, stir in fresh lemon juice. Taste for salt and pepper. Serve topped with fresh parmesan and additional fresh chopped parsley. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

When will we all learn that each of us is a unique individual who deserves respect? We are all different from one another in some way. It makes no sense then to look at others as \"them\" instead of \"us.\" When will we learn to really listen to someone else's opinion which is different from ours, instead of trying to convince them that our opinion is right?\nIt is an important time in our history. I was shocked and saddened by the senseless murder of Charlie Kirk. I did not agree with most of what he stood for, but I did agree with his having conversations with people who disagreed with him. What a terrible loss it is for his parents, for his wife and kids and for his friends.\nEach one of us should be putting our phones, iPads, and TV shows down, and we should be having conversations with each other and our kids about violence, immigration, misuse of guns, transgender graffiti, relationships and many other subjects related to this moment in our country, Talbot County, and right here in Easton.\nIn this way, we will each be trying to \"meet the moment,\" and we will be attempting to turn the current violent, hateful messaging in our beloved country to one of loving kindness.

    "content": "We need more conversation, not assassination\n\n September 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: GLENN MOLLETTE | Section: Columns \n \n 565\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Charlie Kirk was a man who had opinions and vocalized them. He believed in free speech. He also believed in the right of free speech for those who disagreed with him. In his Turning Point rallies, he gave untold numbers of people the opportunity to express their opinions and to debate him. He respectfully gave each person the time to state their case on whatever the subject. Charlie was adamant, profound and articulated strong convictions.Sadly, a deranged 22-year-old man from Utah allegedly took Charlie's life. It has been reported that the suspected gunman had previously stated at a family dinner that he thought Kirk was filled with hate. When Kirk spoke at a university rally in Utah, the gunman plotted and positioned himself to shoot a single long-range rifle shot that took Kirk's life. The suspect ran back to his home where he reportedly later had no choice but to confess to his father that he was indeed the man who had been videotaped at the rally who took Charlie Kirk's life.\nThe lone assassin is an evil coward who silenced one of America's star voices. At least he thought he did. Charlie Kirk has become more known and his sound clips have been heard more in the last few days than in his entire ministry and career. Kirk has been propelled by the assassin to a status in American culture that will never be forgotten. Instead of silencing Kirk he magnified Kirk's voice and message a hundred or more times. Kirk is now being remembered around the world.\nCharlie Kirk used his voice. Every American is entitled to this freedom. His voice cost him his life.\nAbraham Lincoln gave his life reuniting our country and abolishing slavery. A cowardly assassin took Lincoln's life as he leisurely watched a play at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C.\nJohn F. Kennedy used his voice to excite the American people and to bring about a positive attitude in the country but was gunned down by an assassin from a hidden window in downtown Dallas, Texas.\nMartin Luther King, Jr. was a man with a great voice who stirred the hearts of millions of Americans and brought about liberating change for Black Americans. An assassin who disagreed with King cowardly hid and took King's life with a bullet.\nMalcom X and Bobby Kennedy were orators for positive change in America but someone who disagreed with their views killed them.\nThe greatest voice of hope, love, change and forgiveness, who ever lived, was Jesus Christ. A cowardly crowd yelled for him to be executed.\nThese mentioned voices were not silenced by hideous crowds or hidden gunmen. Each of their voices have rung loudly and clearly. Their legacies have only grown bolder and stronger.\nIt is sad that Charlie Kirk's assassin did not go down to the rally, stand up like a man and challenge Kirk in a debate. He could have told Kirk what he thought about him and given Kirk a chance to respond. But, no, he was a weak, spineless man filled with more hate than probably anyone in America at that given moment. It's one thing to have a hateful, negative thought, but it's another to allow hate to act itself out in such a way.\nViolence is never the answer. Let's keep America free. Free to speak, free to debate, free to practice and express our religion. Let's have peaceful and strong conversation not assassination. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "We need each other to sharpen conversation skills\n\n September 20, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MELINDA BURRELL | Section: Columns \n \n 516\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n September, and \"back to school,\" is a great time to sharpen skills. When life feels as complicated and fast-changing as it seems right now, it's particularly good to build our communication skills.Better communication gives us stronger relationships, and stronger relationships help us navigate challenging times.\nA few insights from neuroscience are especially helpful.\nHumans evolved to survive in groups. Because of that, we worry about how well we're fitting in with our group. We're constantly looking for clues about what others think about us.\nIf someone belittles us, shuts us out, or treats us unfairly, our Spidey sense goes off. We fear it means we're not part of the group, which is dangerous for our survival. We sense a social threat, and social threats are so urgent for us that they activate the same brain circuits as physical threats.\nManagement guru David Rock developed the SCARF model to describe these key social situations in which we can either feel socially threatened or rewarded.\nEssentially, we're hardwired to crave five things: status (being valued by others), certainty (having information to predict the future), autonomy (having some control over our lives), relatedness (feeling connected to others) and fairness (being treated reasonably).\nIf we get those five things, we relax. Our defenses come down, and we can talk openly and creatively with others. Sounds like a basis for a rich conversation, right?\nHowever, if we don't get those things, we feel threatened. We tend to shut down and lose our ability to think rationally. A Case Western Reserve University study showed that being rejected immediately lowers people's IQ by 25% and their reasoning ability by 30%, while also making them more aggressive. Sounds like a basis for a fight.\nSo how do we build our skills to create positive SCARF conditions in our interactions and avoid creating negative ones?\nFirst, think about how often you do the following, in both team and family settings. Give yourself a \"SCARF score.\" Then brainstorm ways you can increase your SCARF score.\nAffirm others' status: Go out of your way to acknowledge other people, especially when they contribute something to a team or family situation. Listen and ask questions that show you're interested. Don't publicly give negative feedback or compare people, especially family or team members.Provide certainty: Share information that helps others to plan, such as expectations or constraints for an event or a family vacation. Explain decisions. Don't unexpectedly change plans or forget to follow through on promises.Offer autonomy: Delegate decisions and tasks where you can, so that others share control over joint projects, whether job-related events or family routines. Offer options for people to choose between. Don't always be the problem-solver, but instead encourage others to resolve issues.Foster relatedness: Deliberately and regularly create time to be together, including meals (without devices!). Don't exclude members of your team or family from shared events.Uphold fairness: Apply rules consistently to everyone and offer everyone a voice in decisions. Don't be silent when you've made a mistake or been unfair.\nSeptember temperatures are cooling. Let's help tempers cool as well! Build your SCARF skills and enjoy richer, more fulfilling conversations and connections.\nWe need each other. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Amen.Brothers and sisters in Christ, let not your hearts be troubled. Seems like difficult words to follow as we consider the events across our nation over the past several weeks.\nI mean, whose heart wouldn't be troubled by the news of the loss of life as a result of two school shootings, a stabbing on a train, and the assassination of a man for speaking with a voice of truth. Throw in the mix a bitter divorce, a cancer diagnosis, loss of employment, depression, and the list goes on and on.\nYet, in all these things, our Lord tells us to let not our hearts be troubled. But how can he do that?\nGod can do it because He is the God of justice, peace, grace, mercy and forgiveness. He takes upon Himself all the things that trouble our hearts and He carries them to the cross and there He dies for them, for you, for me. In His death, our troubled hearts are healed as His grace, in blood and water, flows from the cross and covers us. Jesus came as Immanuel, that is God with us, and became one of us. He too experienced what it meant to have a troubled heart. In doing so, He leads us where our troubled hearts are to be no more. That is to the cross, to His salvation for all of us. And to heaven, where troubled hearts exist no more.\nFriends, God loves you. He is with you even in times of troubled hearts. The devil, sin, and death do not get the last word or the final say. Jesus triumphs over all and from the cross, His cry of \"It is finished\" is the healing voice and balm for our troubled hearts. Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. Now and forever. Amen. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Former FCC leaders weigh in on Kimmel suspension\n\n September 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Lily Tierney | Section: Local News \n \n 694\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The nearly week-long suspension of late-night show host Jimmy Kimmel, which was imposed by ABC after Kimmel drew backlash for comments he made in the wake of the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, quickly became the center of a national conversation on press freedoms.It was a conversation two former Federal Communications Commission chairs, both Talbot County residents, were watching closely.\nThe suspension was imposed by ABC last Wednesday after Kimmel said supporters of the Trump administration were \"working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk.\" Kimmel returned to the air Tuesday evening.\nBut the initial decision to remove Kimmel from his position raised concerns for former FCC Chair under Republican President George H.W. Bush Al Sikes, who said the current pressure on media, exemplified by incidents like Kimmel being pulled off air, is unprecedented and prevents individuals and organizations from pushing back.\nKimmel's suspension came amid recent pressure put on media outlets by the Trump administration to cover the president more favorably. The president has often complained of what he says is an asymmetry between critical press coverage and the views of the American people as exemplified by his victory in 2024.\nBrendan Carr, the current head of the FCC, issued a warning prior to Kimmel's suspension while speaking on the Benny Johnson podcast. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said. \"These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\"\nFormer FCC Chair under Democratic President Barack Obama Tom Wheeler critiqued Carr. Wheeler clained the FCC chair is pursuing a coercive approach to content and ownership, despite statutory prohibitions on content censorship, First Amendment protections, and 90 years of FCC policy promoting diversity of voices and ownership.\nCarr authored these concepts into a chapter of Project 2025, a political initiative to reshape the federal government in favor of right-wing policies written ahead of the 2024 election.\nIn the plan, Carr called for a balanced approach to regulation in the tech space, one that would protect free speech, promote competition and foster innovation without allowing government overreach.\nWheeler said recent FCC actions contrasts with Project 2025, citing Carr's recent messaging that \"We're not done yet. There will be a massive shift in dynamics in the media ecosystem, and we are operating under a permission structure provided by President Trump's election.\"\nCarr's messaging raises multiple concerns for Sikes, but the greatest is self-censorship, which he says is a harmful issue that ill-serves the nation.\n\"We are engaged in a level of self-censorship that is really quite harmful, by which I mean we choose to read people that we agree with or that agree with us, and we tend to get into these little narrow corridors,\" Sikes said.\nSikes said media entities are also complicit in censorship because litigation is too costly.\nIn December 2024, ABC settled a $15 million libel lawsuit with then President-elect Donald Trump and agreed to issue an apology.\n\"I think that ABC thought, 'okay, well, this is our blood money. We'll pay this. We'll get it all behind us.' But really what this taught is, for a bully, if you find you can bully them once, you can bully them twice,\" Wheeler said.\nWheeler linked the rapid move to take Kimmel off the air to Nexstar Media Group's dependence on FCC favor, saying Nexstar has more than two dozen ABC affiliate stations and pressured ABC after Kimmel's remarks.\nAccording to Wheeler, there has been limited judicial review of FCC actions because Carr has been acting informally, not in his official capacity as FCC chair. Judicial review can only occur when formal decisions are made.\n\"ABC could have stood up and said, 'No, we'll challenge you in court for violation of the First Amendment.' But they didn't because it was easier to buckle,\" he said.\nSikes anticipates that there will be further levels of censorship and more firings like Kimmel's. \"It's hard to know how all of this is going to unfold. I mean, we're literally in the very, very early stages,\" Sikes said.\nWheeler said electoral change and a non-beholden Congress are key remedies, emphasizing that citizens have the opportunity to \"send a message\" in 2026. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Eye of the storm: Communities still rebuilding and recovering after Hurricane Helene\n\n September 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks Adams MultiMedia | Section: News \n \n 1182\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A year ago, Hurricane Helene rampaged through Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and Tennessee with high winds, biblical rains and destructive storm surges and floods that left 252 people dead and caused an estimated $79 billion in damage.A few weeks later, Hurricane Milton slammed Florida and Georgia, killing 46 people and causing another $34 billion in damage.\nHelene brought torrential rains and deadly floods to areas of the Carolinas and Appalachia, with warmer ocean water fueling larger and more destructive hurricanes.\nSome areas saw historic amounts of rain and major power outages from Helene's monstrous storm clouds.\nParts of Transylvania and Yancey counties in North Carolina were hit with 30 inches of rain. Greenville, South Carolina, saw 21.66 inches.\nHeavy rains stretched from Florida to Ohio and Indiana, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\nFrom Western Carolina and Appalachia to Florida's Gulf coast and southern Georgia, communities are still healing and rebuilding from last year's devastating hurricane season.\nThose on the frontlines of the recovery efforts say progress has been made, but more work and challenges remain.\n'NEARLY EVERY STRUCTURE'On Florida's Gulf coast, Hurricane Helene brought historic storm surges and flooding to the southwestern parts of the state as well as the Big Bend and Tampa Bay areas.\nSome of those same areas were hit in October by Hurricane Milton.\n\"We had widespread flooding during Helene, with nearly every structure in the city taking water, some as much as 5 feet. Milton tore off roofs from condos and knocked down trees and power poles, many residents were without power and water for 7 to 10 days,\" said Trip Barrs, fire chief in the beach town of Treasure Island in the Tampa-St. Petersburg area.\nOther parts of Florida also got hit by both hurricanes.\n\"Helene impacted some of our coastal areas on Sept. 26 last year, and then Hurricane Milton impacted a much broader area of Lee County mere days later on Oct. 9,\" said Betsy Clayton, communications director for Lee County, which includes Fort Myers.\nThat area of southwest Florida experienced a storm surge of more than 5 feet and 6 inches of rain in a short period from Hurricane Helene.\nA few weeks later, Milton brought winds of 120 miles per hour, a 6.8-inch storm surge in Lee County and heavy rains. Parts of Florida saw numerous tornadoes.\nLee County collected more than 627,000 cubic yards of debris from the two storms, according to a post-storm analysis.\nIn Treasure Island, Barrs said roughly a year later that there are \"many vacant residential and commercial lots\" from the storms.\n\"We are starting to see some rebuilding and some homes being elevated. Many businesses were not able to reopen, and others are still in temporary facilities,\" he said.\nOther challenges persist.\n\"Many residents are still not able to rebuild or repair their homes. This is due to a variety of issues: insurance, permitting, old/non-flood compliant structures. Many of our smaller, 1-story hotels will not be able to reopen,\" Barrs said.\nHigh insurance costs and sometimes delayed, disputed or denied storm claims have been causes for frustrations in Florida, in particular, as well as other states.\nBarrs said some hotel rooms have started to come back online, and a beach renourishment project replacing sand lost to the storm surges is slated to start \"in the coming months.\"\nOther communities and tourist attractions in Helene's path have also reopened and have been marketing and advertising that to targeted audiences.\nThat includes Asheville, the popular arts and tourism hub in western North Carolina.\n\"We're shouting it from our beautiful Blue Ridge mountaintops—the Asheville area is open for business and eagerly welcoming visitors after Hurricane Helene impacted our region in fall of 2024,\" said Dodie Stephens, vice president of marketing for the Explore Asheville tourism group, earlier this summer.\nThe group has been advertising in regional drive markets as well as cities with flight connections to Asheville.\n\"Downtown Asheville was largely unimpacted by the storm last fall and many of the most iconic hikes, overlooks and attractions along the Blue Ridge Parkway are open,\" she said.\nThe Biltmore gardens reopened in November 2024 and is hosting an exhibition featuring Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamum through Jan. 4, 2026.\nSome areas of the Appalachian Trail damaged by Hurricane Helene have been repaired or reopened. But there continues to be repair work and debris collections in other trail areas in North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, according to the National Park Service.\nThere are detour areas along the 2,200-mile trail because of storm damage and remediation.\nSome Florida communities saw backlogs and delays with permitting approval after the storms.\nThat prompted Treasure Island and other localities to take fresh looks at its emergency planning and response, Barrs said.\nIn Lee County, local officials have been reexamining their communications and social media policies on how to keep the public best informed during major storms and other emergencies.\n'HISTORIC DAMAGE'Beyond its coastal impacts, Helene brought major flooding, downed trees and damaged homes, buildings and roadways in Georgia, the Carolinas and Tennessee.\n\"At one point during the storm, over 1.2 million gallons of water per second flowed over the Nolichucky Dam. In comparison, Niagara Falls' peak daily flow is 700,000 gallons of water per second,\" said Mark Nagi, regional communications officer for the Tennessee Department of Transportation.\nThe state also removed more than 720,000 cubic yards of debris from Helene.\n\"This storm has caused historic damage to bridges and roadways, especially in Upper East Tennessee. TDOT anticipates hundreds of millions of dollars in damage,\" Nagi said.\nHelene's biblical rains and floods damaged and shut down parts of Interstate 40 near the Tennessee, North Carolina border and 49 sections of state and local roadways in the eastern part of Tennessee last year, according to\n\"Work on full restoration of I-40 in Cocke County continues,\" Nagi said. \"We anticipate the roadway being fully back open in Summer 2026. We have had one lane open in each direction since late October 2024.\"\nForty-seven of the 49 impacted state and local roadway areas have reopened, with the two remaining areas under contract to be repaired this fall and next spring.\nTennessee surveyors inspected all 490 state-owned bridges that the storm could have damaged.\nNagi said two bridges in Greene and Washington counties were built in a faster \"Progressive Design-Build\" mode that allowed design and construction phases to overlap.\n\"Those bridges were each opened in less than 8 months. Without PDB being utilized, it would have probably taken approximately 2 to 3 years to reconnect those communities,\" he said.\nOn Sept. 15, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein called for an additional $13.5 billion in federal funding to help with Hurricane Helene reconstruction.\nThat includes $8 billion to help rebuild homes and small businesses, $2 billion for local governments financially strained by the storm and its cleanup, and $2 billion to help with reconstruction and full reopening of sections of I-40 hit by the storm.\nStein, a Democrat, also wants Congress to release another $10 billion in previously allocated funds related to hurricane recovery.\n\"Western North Carolinians are counting on the federal government for help to rebuild homes, support small businesses, and repair roads. I call on Congress to deliver for western North Carolina its fair share and appropriate an additional $13.5 billion in funding for Helene recovery,\" Stein said in a statement. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I've engaged in them all, and I value each for the lessons they teach. Losing, when it happens, can even make you stronger.In debate or sport, you must prepare. You must know your opponent's strengths and weaknesses, and you must have a strategy. And win or lose, you are judged not only by the outcome but by how you carry yourself. I learned long ago: You lose with honor, but you win with grace.\nSo I ask — where has grace gone? Where has decorum gone? Today it seems acceptable to shout down opponents, to sneer and label, to point fingers instead of making points. These are tactics we would scold in children, yet they are now common currency in our politics.\nI always valued the end of a contest, when you could shake hands, smile and respect the person across from you — even if you didn't like them. The best opponent was never the one I agreed with, but the one I could respect.\nThe true test of character, in debate or in life, is simple: Would I welcome this person as my next-door neighbor? Increasingly, I fear too many of today's loudest voices would fail that test.\nDAN McKEW\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Kirk did not invite conversation\n\n October 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 352\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Let me say at the start that like almost all Americans I deplore the murder of Charlie Kirk. But I want to challenge the opinion pieces by Glen Mollette and David Reel in the Sunday Star Weekend Edition of Sept. 20-21.The headlines accurately sum up their views: \"We need more conversation, not assassination\" and \"Charlie Kirk relished engagement with critics.\" I believe that Kirk's behavior exhibited neither conversation nor engagement.\nWikipedia tells us that \"conversation\" is an ambiguous word. The only common element in its various meanings is that it involves at least two people.\nAt the modest end of the spectrum of meanings one might imagine two people talking about the day's weather. At the other end is something like discussion, wherein two or more people seek a richer understanding of some topic that interests them.\nMany commentators, like your two opinion writers, seem to imply that Kirk's activity was of this sort. I believe it was not.\nKirk's behavior in his Q & A sessions were notable for his polite, respectful listening, which implied that he was open to changing his views — if only he could find someone to persuade him otherwise.\nThis apparent open mindedness seems to have disarmed some of his critics who, like Reel, were charmed by Kirk's manner even while finding his positions disreputable — even despicable. He was never bombastic; he did not promote demonstrations (or worse) on behalf of his views.\nWhat gets lost in appraisals of his mission are his actual beliefs and values, which then go unchallenged — and his offer to be proven wrong has effectively diverted away from them.\nFurthermore, there is no way to prove Kirk's views wrong (nor to prove right the views opposing his). These are not matters of proof but rather beliefs involving strongly held assumptions and values.\nIn sum, Kirk's mantra \"Prove me wrong,\" stated by him over and over– and posted prominently on overhangs of tents at his meetings – while seeming to ask for a counter argument, is a hollow request. It does not invite conversation at all — and certainly not conversation in pursuit of further understanding.\nFOREST HANSEN\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "With some rules, a civil discussion is possible\n\n October 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 587\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last week, my wife and I hosted a visit from a longtime friend who I met before starting elementary school and have known ever since.Before he arrived, we agreed that because we have different opinions on issues in the political arena, we should avoid any discussion on politics while he was here.\nWe knew there are increasing numbers of family members, friends and acquaintances who are not on speaking terms due to strongly held and diametrically opposing political positions.\nInstead of discussing politics, our time together was filled with talking about a wide range of other matters.\nWe talked about where he and I grew up, the schools we attended and all the changes that have occurred there.\nWe also discussed the challenges and opportunities we experienced with raising a family and long-distance relocations made necessary by job changes.\nWe talked about other childhood friends who died too soon and those who have recently died or are experiencing serious health problems.\nBefore his visit ended, we decided with some trepidation to discuss politics.\nWe did so with five rules:\nListen respectively to other points of view, even if we disagree strongly with them.Embrace the idea that listening is more than waiting for your turn to talk.End every discussion on strongly held differences of opinion with \"you may be right.\"Not all discussions are a debate with a winner and a loser.Disagree without being disagreeable.\nFollowing our rules was not always easy.\nIt was always worthwhile and meaningful.\nFor example, we discovered that we shared common ground with deep concerns over the steadily decreasing levels of civil discourse in our society.\nAs a result, shortly before my friend left to return home, we discussed Robert Putnam's book \"Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community.\"\nWritten 25 years ago, \"Bowling Alone\" is still relevant today.\nThe book's unusual title is based on Putnam's research showing the number of people who bowl alone had increased, but those who bowl in leagues had decreased.\nHe suggested that when people bowl alone, they do not have opportunities to participate in the social interaction and civic discussions that might occur in a bowling league environment.\nPutnam also wrote about the measurable declines in membership and participation in religious organizations, labor unions, parent–teacher associations, military veterans' organizations, fraternal organizations and community service organizations.\nPutnam did acknowledge that some organizations and issue advocacy groups had increased their membership rolls, but they rarely focus on fostering face-to-face interactions that build what Putnam called social capital. Instead, they focus instead on fund raising, collecting dues, marketing services, lobbying and sending periodic news updates to their members.\nPutnam also drew a distinction between two different but equally important types of social capital.\nOne type is \"bonding\" which occurs within a homogenous demographic group.\nThe other type is \"bridging\" which unites people from different groups.\nPutnam concluded a lack of social capital undermines the active civic engagement that a strong democracy requires from its citizens.\nI now know my friend's visit was more than a get-together to talk over old times, catch up on current times and ponder on the future.\nIn all our discussions, including those with civil discourse on politics, we built social capital.\nIt was unexpected opportunity to think about and evaluate what I can be and should be doing to help address the lack of civil discourse and to help increase social capital in our society.\nThe answer is clear.\nGoing forward, I must consistently strive to:\nRespectively consider all points of view.Listen with more than waiting for my turn to talk.Say regularly \"you may be right.\"Limit discussions as debates.Disagree without being disagreeable.Always look for opportunities to build social capital. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

such events could take down power grids as well as communications and other technology systems essential for contemporary market economies and modern everyday life.\n\"If you don't have electricity, everything just comes to a grinding and horrible halt,\" said Munson, whose company has patents and technology applications for energy storage, agriculture, defense and other sectors.\n\"Life turns to hell right fast,\" he said.\nA BIG WORRY\nElectromagnetic pulses as well as nuclear weapons detonated in space could potentially be used to cause dangerous surges and other disruptions.\nMunson said a detonation of nuclear weapons in space by an adversary such as North Korea could send electromagnetic pulses and waves that \"could knock out the U.S.\"\nMunson also points to North Korea's construction of extensive underground facilities and tunnels to help withstand a major war.\n\"They could bury all their troops underground,\" said Munson.\nMunson said a major solar storm like the 1859 Carrington Event (where the Northern Lights could be seen in Florida) would have monumental impacts today.\n\"A big solar storm is the worry,\" he said.\nMunson points to an industrial and urbanized world dependent on power supplies, data centers, smartphones and digital and technology platforms for banking, communications, defense, health care and other sectors.\nMunson said it could take a significant amount of time to replace utility transformers and transmission infrastructure, and he noted most of that power grid equipment is manufactured overseas, including China.\n\"There's no stockpile of transformers,\" said Munson. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Banned books once again increasing\n\n October 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 337\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n This week, Oct. 5-11, marks the 43rd year of celebrating the freedom to read with the American Library Association's Banned Book Week.It started in 1982, in response to a surge in book challenges and inspired by the landmark Supreme Court case, Island Trees School District v. Pico, which ruled that school officials cannot ban books solely based on their content (ala.org/advocacy). Now, decades later, we are experiencing a similar increase in censorship attempts across the country.\nIn their latest report, PEN America found that 6,870 books bans were enacted during the 2024-25 school year, across 23 states and 87 public school districts. And everywhere, more often than not, it is the books that have long fought for a place on the shelf that are being targeted: Books by authors of color, by LGBTQ+ authors and books by women. Books about racism, sexuality, gender and history also top the list.\nPublic library collections, too, are being attacked: the number of titles challenged in public libraries increased by 92% in 2023 alone. This increase is largely driven by organized groups and politicians, rather than isolated incidents, with groups demanding the censorship of multiple titles, sometimes dozens at a time (pen.org/book-bans).\nLibraries provide free access to information and resources that are vital to a functioning democracy. Banning books and censoring materials not only denies citizens their fundamental right to free speech but is a slippery slope to greater infringements and abuses of power, examples of which are in the news almost daily.\nIt's fitting that the theme for this year's Banned Books Week is \"Censorship is So 1984,\" as the world we are living in seems increasingly Orwellian. In the book we are warned, \"who controls the past, controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.\" Who will control our future? Who is controlling our present? Banned Books Week is the perfect time to reflect on these questions and take action against censorship in all its forms because, in a democratic society, free people read freely.\nMARY PELLICANO\nTalbot County Free Library Trustee\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That image in each of us is the basis of our worth.\nSadly, each of us are also broken by sin, that image having been marred in us all. We cannot point a finger in condemnation at those different from us because we are all guilty of selfishness, wanting our own way rather than selflessly living for others. The line between good and evil is not between categories in which we try to separate ourselves from others; it runs down each individual human heart.\nWe know this because, if we are honest, each of us are capable of acts of great kindness or great wickedness. None of us are guiltless.\nYet, the good news, the Gospel says that God in His love has given each of us a chance to experience that love and to have that image restored in us. When we accept what God in Jesus Christ has done for us, turn from living as we once did, and believe in Him, then His restoration process begins. He makes us into a brand new person, with the desire to do the good that our world needs.\nWe are given the chance to be human the way God intended by enjoying a personal relationship with Him and showing His love to everyone.\nThe good news that can bring healing and peace to everyone is that everyone is equally a sinner and, at the same time, everyone is equally loved. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The national No Kings movement began in 2024 to emphasize democracy over authoritarianism and has since inspired rallies nationwide calling for transparency, equality and civic engagement.\nUnder sunny skies, the crowd filled the courthouse lawn waving homemade signs reading \"We the People\" and \"Democracy Is Not a Spectator Sport.\" Throughout the afternoon, rally goers created signs, shared personal stories about what democracy means to them and wore paperclips as symbols of solidarity and unity.\nGathering people from all walks of life, many participants were no strangers to protest, recalling the Vietnam era, the women's rights movement and the Civil Rights movement. They said the freedoms they stood for in their youth are being challenged again by this generation.\nVickie Love, of Chester, has been peacefully protesting since Vietnam and said she was disappointed in what she considered the country going backward with too much misinformation spreading.\nInspired by a recent Portland protest in which a demonstrator \"held fast in the face of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\" while dressed in a frog costume, Kelley Barrow of Kent Island hopped in solidarity with protesters on the other side of the country as an eye-catching amphibian, joined by her son Jordan, who dressed as a bear.\n\"We are not terrorists, we are peacefully protesting,\" Kelley said.\n\"It's important to show you care about this country and speak out when you can,\" Jordan said.\nThe event was not limited to Queen Anne's County residents. Coming from Annapolis to participate, Janet Gambarani, Jill Garrity and Anne Schellie voiced concern for a world being \"destroyed\" that their grandchildren will have to inherit.\nVoicing a need to persevere and promote values outlined in the Constitution, Garrity said she was particularly offended by officials who framed No Kings Day rallies as \"hate America rallies.\"\nA teacher for 30 years, committee chair Elaine McNeil noted the importance of education and said No Kings Day rallies across the country highlight the need for change and demonstrate that people will not stand for violations of their rights or the rights of others.\n\"People should feel safe in the country they pay taxes and work in,\" she said.\nAs the crowd dispersed from the Historic Courthouse Square, MacKenzie said she felt hopeful seeing generations standing together.\n\"That's what democracy looks like,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He shared some of the experiences and obstacles that led him to Yale University for his undergraduate education, Harvard University, where he received his Ph. D in economics and, ultimately, to a career at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He told the members that life at the IMF found him traveling extensively around the world.Upon retirement, his life direction became focused on \"how to give back.\" He said that life had been good to him, and he wanted to share with others. He felt his legacy was an important part of his life and what most people would remember. One thing he stressed was the importance of listening. In his opinion, listening makes you a better leader and improves your empathy. His most recent book, \"Build Legacy Not Inheritance: Embracing the Journey of Building a Lasting Impact,\" reinforces his work post retirement.\nHis life continues having him travel, serving on a variety of professional boards in the U.S. and abroad. He has served as an adjunct faculty member at Strathmore Business School in Nairobi.\nAs a member of the Muyenga Rotary Club in Kampala, Uganda, Robin said the service work of Rotary serves as one way he gives back. During his talk, Kibuka presented Angie Hengst, president of the Rotary Club of Cambridge, with a banner from his Club in Uganda. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
