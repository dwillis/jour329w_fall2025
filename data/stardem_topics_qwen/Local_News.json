In front of a packed Buccaneer's stadium, several representatives from the class gave parting words of advice to their classmates.Darcy Lynn, the Class of 2024 valedictorian, welcomed family, friends, faculty, and her fellow graduates. She acknowledged the significance of the day and the importance of the decisions the graduates would make about their future. Lynn emphasized that while major life decisions, like choosing a college or career path, are daunting, it is the small, everyday choices that truly define a person's character.\nShe stressed that these minor actions, from how one interacts with others to behaviors when no one is watching, are the true indicators of who a person is. Lynn reminded her classmates, \"These actions make up who you are inside and reveal your true character.\"\nLynn paid tribute to Jacob Sloan, a classmate who died during their seventh grade year. She said that many graduates were wearing red heart pins in his honor. Sloan was known for his kindness and his habit of making others smile through small acts of generosity, like sitting with someone who was alone at lunch or making someone laugh when they were feeling down.\nIn an emotional tribute, Lynn continued, \"Jake always went out of his way to brighten someone else's day by performing small acts of kindness.\"\nSloan's lasting impact on their class, and his memory continues to inspire them to be kind and supportive of others. She encouraged her peers to carry on Sloan's legacy by making the world a better place through their everyday actions.\n\"While Jake may not be with us today, the mark he left on many of us remains,\" Lynn said. \"It is our job to carry on his kindness through our next steps in life.\"\nIn concluding her speech, Lynn urged her classmates to consider who they wanted to be as they moved forward in life. She reminded them that small choices, such as giving a compliment or helping someone, could significantly impact others.\nQuoting Taylor Swift, Lynn said, \"No matter what happens in life, be good to people. Being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind.\"\nShe ended by congratulating her classmates and encouraging them to embrace their future with the same spirit of kindness and community that Jake Sloan had exemplified.\nJake Sloan's message endures in Queen Anne's through the foundation set up to honor him.

Henry Price II, American Legion Post 246, took the act on the road — a quarter-of-a-mile down the road to be precise, at the Betterton Heritage museum.\nThe audience gathered on the lawn for some great music from 5 p.m. until dusk nodding to classics like \"Stop Dragging my Heart Around,\" originally performed by Stevie Nicks and the late Tom Petty and \"White Rabbit,\" by Jefferson Airplane.\nLead vocals Valerie Maitland easily hit those ranges.\nDevelopment corporation President Candi Sorge gave a speech to honor the volunteers, who work at the Betterton Heritage Museum on weekends. Each of the volunteers received key chains and a hearty show of gratitude from the over 50 in attendance.\nWerner said their last concert in June was popular, and so they decided to bring it back.\nWith refreshments available, and volunteers selling museum items like T-shirts and hats, Werner noted they received more donations than last time.\nHe added it was fortunate they didn't have to move the whole thing inside because of rain.\n\"We really lucked out,\" he said. \"It worked out well.\"\nYou don't need rain to urge you inside though.\nThe development group encourages the public to check out the museum for an expansive view of the town's storied past. Located in the Most Precious Blood Catholic Church, it is the result of a collaboration between the town and the Betterton Community Development Corporation.\nThe museum is \"intended to serve as a community center and a showcase for historic artifacts, the space was beautifully renovated to both honor the past and provide a functional meeting place for the present,\" as their website states. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
